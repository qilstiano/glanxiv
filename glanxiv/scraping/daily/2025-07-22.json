    "abstract": "We study two scalarizations of magnetically charged black holes in the\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the nonlinear electrodynamics (NED)\nterm. For this purpose, two scalar coupling functions $f_1(\\phi)$ and\n$f_2(\\phi)$ are introduced to couple to Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and NED terms. The\nbald black hole is described by mass ($M$) and action parameter ($\\alpha$) with\nmagnetic charge ($P$), which becomes the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole\nfor $P=M$ whose action is still unknown. We derive Smarr formula which\ndescribes a correct thermodynamics for the charged black hole. Two Davies\npoints of heat capacity are not identified with two critical onset mass and\naction parameter for GB$^-$ scalarization with $f_1(\\phi)$. Furthermore, the\nshadow radius analysis of charged black hole is performed to include naked\nsingularities and it is compared to the EHT observation. There is no\nconstraints on the action parameter, whereas new mass constraints are found.\nFinally, the NED$^+$ spontaneous scalarization with $f_2(\\phi)$ leads to\ninfinite branches of scalarized charged black holes.",

A potential solution must address the limited capacity for\nrealistic model synthesis, high uncertainty in perception, and the lack of\nefficient spatial abstractions, among others. We propose a novel framework for\nlearning model-free policies integrating two modalities: 3D point clouds and\nproprioceptive touch indicators, emphasising manipulation with full body\ncontact awareness, going beyond traditional end-effector modes. Our\nreinforcement learning framework leverages a distributional state\nrepresentation, aided by kernel mean embeddings, to achieve improved training\nefficiency and real-time inference. Furthermore, we propose a novel\ncontext-agnostic occlusion heuristic to clear deformables from a target region\nfor exposure tasks. We deploy the framework in a power line clearance scenario\nand observe that the agent generates creative strategies leveraging multiple\narm links for de-occlusion. Finally, we perform zero-shot sim-to-real policy\ntransfer, allowing the arm to clear real branches with unknown occlusion\npatterns, unseen topology, and uncertain dynamics.",

However, most existing approaches are\nsingle-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based\nmethods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on\nthe Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth\nestimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of\n3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction\nnetwork called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided\nview transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active\ndistillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth\ndistributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through\ndiffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active\ndistillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and\nselectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified\nregions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses\nfusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for\nfaster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with\nreal-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable\nperformance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating\nits effectiveness and robustness.

We quantify the time-averaged longitudinal dispersion\ncoefficient as a function of the flow speed, flow oscillation frequency, and\nparticle activity. In the weak-activity limit, asymptotic analysis shows that\nactivity can either enhance or hinder the dispersion compared to the passive\ncase. For arbitrary activity levels, we numerically solve the GTD equations and\nvalidate the results with Brownian dynamics simulations. We show that the\ndispersion coefficient could vary non-monotonically with both the flow speed\nand particle activity. Furthermore, the dispersion coefficient shows an\noscillatory behavior as a function of the flow oscillation frequency,\nexhibiting distinct minima and maxima at different frequencies. The observed\noscillatory dispersion results from the interplay between self-propulsion and\noscillatory flow advection -- a coupling absent in passive or steady systems.\nOur results show that time-dependent flows can be used to tune the dispersion\nof active particles in confinement.",

By propagating\ninformation across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching\nnetworks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging\nspatiotemporal structure.

In this work, we show that using LoRA for SFT on refusal datasets\neffectively aligns the model for safety without harming its reasoning\ncapabilities. This is because restricting the safety weight updates to a\nlow-rank space minimizes the interference with the reasoning weights. Our\nextensive experiments across four benchmarks covering math, science, and coding\nshow that this approach produces highly safe LLMs -- with safety levels\ncomparable to full-model fine-tuning -- without compromising their reasoning\nabilities. Additionally, we observe that LoRA induces weight updates with\nsmaller overlap with the initial weights compared to full-model fine-tuning. We\nalso explore methods that further reduce such overlap -- via regularization or\nduring weight merging -- and observe some improvement on certain tasks.

    "abstract": "We consider several sequences of random variables whose Fourier-Laplace\ntransforms present the same type of \\textit{splitting phenomenon} when suitably\nrescaled by the Fourier-Laplace transform of a Poisson-distributed random\nvariable (mod-Poisson convergence). Addressing a question raised by\nKowalski-Nikeghbali, we explain the appearance of a universal term, the\n\\textit{Gamma factor}, by a common feature of each model, the existence of an\nauxiliary randomisation that reveals an independence structure. This universal\nGamma factor is a consequence of the probabilistic (exponential) fluctuations\nof this subordinated random variable.\n  The class of examples that belong to this framework includes: random uniform\npermutations, random Gauss integers, random polynomials over a finite field,\nrandom matrices with values in a finite field, random partitions and the\nclassical Sathe-Selberg theorems in probabilistic number theory. For this last\nexample, the randomisation that triggers the Gamma factor defines a new\nprobability distribution, the ``delta-Zeta distribution'' which is the analogue\nof the geometric distribution in the permutation setting.",

Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset\nreported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical\nexperimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing\nclass-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift\ncompensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation\ntasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to\npredict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and\npredicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous\ntraining data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three\nmethods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark\nmethod Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method\nKD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed\nthat KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18%\nimprovement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior\neffectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for\nelectronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous\nstate-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift\ncompensation in real-world environments.",

Diffraction measurements probe average\ndistances between atoms and/or planes of atoms. A transmission electron\nmicroscope in scanning mode (STEM) can collect spatially resolved 2-dimensional\ndiffraction data, effectively creating a 4-dimensional (4D) hyperspectral\ndataset (4D-STEM). Interpretation strategies for such 4D data are\nwell-developed for crystalline materials, because their diffraction spectra\nshow intense peaks, allowing for effective phase and crystal orientation\nmapping at the nanoscale. Yet, because of the continuous nature of the\ndiffraction data for amorphous and mixed materials, it is challenging to\nseparate different amorphous contributions. Nonnegative matrix factorization\n(NMF) allows separation of 4D-STEM data into components with interpretable\ndiffraction signatures and intensity maps, independent of the structure.\nHowever, NMF is a non-convex optimization problem and scales ~ O(nmk) with n\nthe number of positions probed, m the number of diffraction features and k the\nnumber of components, making analysis of large 4D datasets inaccessible. Here,\nwe apply QB decomposition as a preprocessing step for NMF (Randomized NMF or\nRNMF) to achieve scaling independent of the largest data dimension (~O(nk)),\nopening the door for NMF analysis of 4D-STEM data. We demonstrate our approach\nby mapping a thin TiO$_2$ layer on top of SiO$_2$, and a\nLiNi$_{0.6}$Co$_{0.2}$Mn$_{0.2}$O$_{2}$ (NMC) - Li$_{10}$GeP$_2$S$_{12}$ (LGPS)\nmixed crystalline-amorphous battery interface, illustrating strengths and\nlimitations of using RNMF for structure-independent phase mapping in 4D-STEM\nexperiments.",

However, state-of-the-art generative models\n(GANs, VAEs, diffusion models) rely on large datasets with thousands of\nexamples. In low-data settings, often the primary motivation for synthetic\ndata, these models can overfit, leak sensitive records, and require frequent\nretraining. Recent work uses large pre-trained transformers to generate rows\nvia in-context learning (ICL), which needs only a few seed examples and no\nparameter updates, avoiding retraining. But ICL repeats seed rows verbatim,\nintroducing a new privacy risk that has only been studied in text. The severity\nof this risk in tabular synthesis-where a single row may identify a\nperson-remains unclear. We address this gap with the first benchmark of three\nfoundation models (GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 3.3 70B, TabPFN v2) against four\nbaselines on 35 real-world tables from health, finance, and policy. We evaluate\nstatistical fidelity, downstream utility, and membership inference leakage.\nResults show foundation models consistently have the highest privacy risk.\nLLaMA 3.3 70B reaches up to 54 percentage points higher true-positive rate at\n1% FPR than the safest baseline. GPT-4o-mini and TabPFN are also highly\nvulnerable. We plot the privacy-utility frontier and show that CTGAN and\nGPT-4o-mini offer better tradeoffs. A factorial study finds that three\nzero-cost prompt tweaks-small batch size, low temperature, and using summary\nstatistics-can reduce worst-case AUC by 14 points and rare-class leakage by up\nto 39 points while maintaining over 90% fidelity. Our benchmark offers a\npractical guide for safer low-data synthesis with foundation models.",

The\nRunge--Kutta--Legendre (RKL) and Runge--Kutta--Gegenbauer (RKG)\nsuper-time-stepping methods were originally developed for nonlinear complex\nphysics problems with diffusion. These are multi-stage single step\nsecond-order, forward-in-time methods with no implicit solves. The advantage is\nthat the timestep size for stability scales with stage number $s$ as\n$\\mathcal{O}(s^2)$. Many interesting nonlinear PDEs have finite-time\nsingularities, and the presence of diffusion often limits one to using implicit\nor semi-implicit timestep methods for stability constraints. Finite-time\nsingularities are particularly challenging due to the large range of scales\nthat one desires to resolve, often with adaptive spatial grids and adaptive\ntimesteps. Here we show two examples of nonlinear PDEs for which the\nself-similar singularity structure has time and space scales that are\nresolvable using the RKL and RKG methods, without forcing even smaller\ntimesteps. Compared to commonly-used implicit numerical methods, we achieve\nsignificantly smaller run time while maintaining comparable accuracy. We also\nprove numerical monotonicity for both the RKL and RKG methods under their\nlinear stability conditions for the constant coefficient heat equation, in the\ncase of infinite domain and periodic boundary condition, leading to a\ntheoretical guarantee of the superiority of the RKL and RKG methods over\ntraditional super-time-stepping methods, such as the Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev\n(RKC) and the orthogonal Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (ROCK) methods.",

    "abstract": "We present the first robust helium (He) abundance measurements in\nstar-forming galaxies at redshifts $1.6\\lesssim z\\lesssim 3.3$ using deep,\nmoderate-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy from the AURORA survey. We\nestablish a High$-z$ HeI Sample consisting of 20 galaxies with multiple\nhigh-S/N ($>5\\sigma$) HeI emission-line detections, including the critical\nnear-infrared $\\lambda$10833 line. This is the first study at high redshift\nleveraging $\\lambda$10833 to break degeneracies between temperature, electron\ndensity, optical depth, and He$^+$/H$^+$, enabling reliable He abundance\ndeterminations in the early universe. We use a custom MCMC framework\nincorporating direct-method electron temperature priors, extended optical depth\n($\\tau_{\\lambda3890}$) model grids up to densities of $10^6$~cm$^{-3}$, and\nsimultaneous fits of the physical conditions and HeI/HI line ratios to derive\nionic He$^+$/H$^+$ abundances. Most of the AURORA galaxies follow the\nextrapolated $z\\sim0$ He/H-O/H trend, indicating modest He enrichment by\n$z\\sim2-3$. However, we identify a subpopulation of four galaxies that exhibit\nelevated He mass fractions ($\\Delta Y>0.03$) without corresponding enhancements\nin N/O or $\\alpha$-elements ($\\sim20$% of the sample). This abundance pattern\nis inconsistent with enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars, but favors\nearly He enrichment from very massive stars (VMSs; $M\\gtrsim100\\ M_\\odot$),\nwhich can eject He-rich, N-poor material via stellar winds and binary stripping\nin young stellar populations. We speculate that these elevated-He systems may\nrepresent an early phase of globular cluster (GC) formation where N enrichment\nis still lagging behind He production. This work demonstrates the power of JWST\nmulti-line HeI spectroscopy for tracing early stellar feedback, enrichment\npathways, and GC progenitor signatures in the high-z universe.",

To address these challenges, we\npropose a simple yet practical alternative: deriving treatment policies from\nthe most frequently chosen actions in each patient state, as estimated by an\ninterpretable model of the behavior policy. By using a tree-based model, which\nis specifically designed to exploit patterns in the data, we obtain a natural\ngrouping of states with respect to treatment. The tree structure ensures\ninterpretability by design, while varying the number of actions considered\ncontrols the degree of overlap with the behavior policy, enabling reliable\noff-policy evaluation. This pragmatic approach to policy development\nstandardizes frequent treatment patterns, capturing the collective clinical\njudgment embedded in the data.

The first method is based on converting a\nSudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a\nuniversal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the\ntwo proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,\nthe universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty\nlevels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku\npractitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.",

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions. We also estimate the delays needed to satisfy\nconstraints and propose Delay-Based Flex Distribution. On top of that, we\npropose Mixed-Strategy Flex Distribution, combining both in a hierarchical\nframework. We prove that EECBS with our new flex distribution mechanisms is\ncomplete and bounded-suboptimal. Our experiments show that our approaches\noutperform the original (greedy) flex distribution.",

In stellar\npopulation synthesis, uncertainty in the mass-loss rates in these evolutionary\nstages limits our understanding of the formation of black holes and merging\ncompact binaries. In the last decade, the theoretical predictions, simulation,\nand direct observation of wind mass-loss rates in massive stars have improved\nsignificantly, typically leading to a reduction in the predicted mass-loss\nrates of massive stars. In this paper we explore the astrophysical implications\nof an updated treatment of winds in the COMPAS population synthesis code. There\nis a large amount of variation in predicted mass-loss rates for massive red\nsupergiants; some of the prescriptions we implement predict that massive red\nsupergiants are able to lose their hydrogen envelopes through winds alone\n(providing a possible solution to the so-called missing red supergiant\nproblem), while others predict much lower mass-loss rates that would not strip\nthe hydrogen envelope. We discuss the formation of the most massive\nstellar-mass black holes in the Galaxy, including the high-mass X-ray binary\nCygnus X-1 and the newly discovered Gaia BH3. We find that formation rates of\nmerging binary black holes are sensitive to the mass-loss rate prescriptions,\nwhile the formation rates of merging binary neutron stars and neutron-star\nblack hole binaries are more robust to this uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "We propose a compact and robust system architecture for soliton microcomb\ngeneration, based on two key techniques: direct fiber coupling using high\nnumerical-aperture polarization-maintaining single-mode fibers (high-NA PMFs)\nand active temperature control of the microresonator. These complementary\nstrategies address two major challenges in microcomb implementation:\nenvironmental sensitivity and resonance instability. Building on prior work\nusing single-mode fiber (SMF)-based direct coupling, which demonstrated device\nminiaturization and partial suppression of thermal drift in coupling\nefficiency, our PMF-based approach offers enhanced thermal stability and\nsignificantly greater robustness to environmental disturbances such as\ntemperature fluctuations and vibration. In our system, precision alignment\nusing microscopes or multi-axis stages is no longer required, enabling a\nsimplified optical setup and stable long-term operation. The direct coupling\nscheme achieved a coupling efficiency of 57.7% and maintained soliton operation\nfor over 24 hours under external perturbations. In parallel, active temperature\ncontrol of the microresonator was quantitatively evaluated, reducing the\nwavelength variation of the pump and auxiliary lasers by 79% and 97%,\nrespectively. This stability enables reproducible soliton generation even in\nthermally dynamic environments. Comparative experiments with SMF-based direct\ncoupling and lensed-SMF-based free-space coupling systems confirmed the\nsuperior performance of the PMF-based design in terms of coupling stability,\nsoliton lifetime, and immunity to environmental noise. The architecture\ndeveloped in this study lays a strong foundation for future integration into\ncompact modules, paving the way for portable and robust microcomb sources in\nreal-world photonic systems.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has significantly advanced in recent years, boasting\ndevices with hundreds of quantum bits (qubits), hinting at its potential\nquantum advantage over classical computing. Yet, noise in quantum devices poses\nsignificant barriers to realizing this supremacy. Understanding noise's impact\nis crucial for reproducibility and application reuse; moreover, the\nnext-generation quantum-centric supercomputing essentially requires efficient\nand accurate noise characterization to support system management (e.g., job\nscheduling), where ensuring correct functional performance (i.e., fidelity) of\njobs on available quantum devices can even be higher-priority than traditional\nobjectives. However, noise fluctuates over time, even on the same quantum\ndevice, which makes predicting the computational bounds for on-the-fly noise is\nvital. Noisy quantum simulation can offer insights but faces efficiency and\nscalability issues. In this work, we propose a data-driven workflow, namely\nQuBound, to predict computational performance bounds. It decomposes historical\nperformance traces to isolate noise sources and devises a novel encoder to\nembed circuit and noise information processed by a Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) network. For evaluation, we compare QuBound with a state-of-the-art\nlearning-based predictor, which only generates a single performance value\ninstead of a bound. Experimental results show that the result of the existing\napproach falls outside of performance bounds, while all predictions from our\nQuBound with the assistance of performance decomposition better fit the bounds.\nMoreover, QuBound can efficiently produce practical bounds for various circuits\nwith over 106 speedup over simulation; in addition, the range from QuBound is\nover 10x narrower than the state-of-the-art analytical approach.",

    "abstract": "Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPA) have emerged as\nhighly versatile devices, offering broadband amplification with quantum-limited\nnoise performance. They hold significant potential for addressing the readout\nbottleneck in prototype quantum computers, enabling scalability. Key challenges\nwith this technology include achieving sufficient gain with minimal gain ripple\nwhile maintaining low noise performance. Efficient phase matching between a\nweak signal and a strong pump over the entire length of the TWPA is critical to\novercoming these challenges. We present an experimental demonstration of the\ninverse Kerr phase matching technique in a TWPA, first proposed in Ref. Phys.\nRev. Appl. 4, 024014. This method addresses several limitations of conventional\ndispersion engineering approaches of phase matching in the four-wave mixing\nparametric process in TWPAs. Most notably the existence of an unusable region\nof gain near the pump frequency which typically corresponds to the region of\nmost optimal phase matching and maximum gain. The inverse Kerr phase matching\napproach, allows for greater frequency separation between the region of optimal\ngain and pump, \\textit{in situ} tunability of the pump, minimal gain ripple,\nand a compact footprint which reduces losses. A TWPA employing the inverse Kerr\nphase matching technique experimentally demonstrated 20 dB of gain over a 3 GHz\ninstantaneous bandwidth, with a tunable bandwidth of 8 GHz, minimal gain\nripple, and near quantum-limited noise performance, with 1.5 photons of added\nnoise.",

Among these\napplications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built\nenvironment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed\nimagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from\nsatellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of\nhigh-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture\nthe built environment.

    "abstract": "Black hole evaporation is one of the most striking phenomena at the interface\nbetween gravity and quantum physics. In Hawking's semi-classical treatment,\nwhere matter is quantum mechanical and the spacetime is definite and classical,\nevaporation leads to an apparent loss of unitarity of the overall evolution,\nand to the so-called black hole information paradox. Here, we go beyond this\nsemi-classical treatment and formulate a toy quantum model of black hole\nevaporation that allows the black hole to evolve into a superposition of being\nfully evaporated and not fully evaporated, consistent with the Hawking\nparticles being in a coherent superposition of different energy levels. We\nmodel Hawking particle production by the repeated action of quantum-controlled\nunitaries, generating emission from the quantum black hole and accounting for a\nquantum coherent back-reaction on the black hole matter state. We show that the\nprobability of full annihilation of the black hole matter increases with time\nuntil the black hole is, asymptotically, fully evaporated in every branch of\nthe quantum superposition. We prove that under natural assumptions, this\nevaporation model is unitary, such that the initial state can in principle be\nrecovered from the final asymptotic state of the radiation.",

Existing methods for evaluating the quality\nof an NPE estimate are largely derived from classifier-based tests or\ndivergence measures, but these suffer from several practical drawbacks. As an\nalternative, we introduce the \\emph{Conditional Localization Test} (CoLT), a\nprincipled method designed to detect discrepancies between \\( p(\\theta \\mid x)\n\\) and \\( q(\\theta \\mid x) \\) across the full range of conditioning inputs.\nRather than relying on exhaustive comparisons or density estimation at every \\(\nx \\), CoLT learns a localization function that adaptively selects points\n$\\theta_l(x)$ where the neural posterior $q$ deviates most strongly from the\ntrue posterior $p$ for that $x$. This approach is particularly advantageous in\ntypical simulation-based inference settings, where only a single draw \\( \\theta\n\\sim p(\\theta \\mid x) \\) from the true posterior is observed for each\nconditioning input, but where the neural posterior \\( q(\\theta \\mid x) \\) can\nbe sampled an arbitrary number of times. Our theoretical results establish\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for assessing distributional equality\nacross all \\( x \\), offering both rigorous guarantees and practical\nscalability. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoLT not only performs better\nthan existing methods at comparing $p$ and $q$, but also pinpoints regions of\nsignificant divergence, providing actionable insights for model refinement.\nThese properties position CoLT as a state-of-the-art solution for validating\nneural posterior estimates.",

    "abstract": "Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) has emerged as a powerful approach for\namortized Bayesian inference when the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ is\nintractable or difficult to sample. But evaluating the accuracy of neural\nposterior estimates remains challenging, with existing methods suffering from\nmajor limitations. One appealing and widely used method is the classifier\ntwo-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples\nfrom the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation\n$q(\\theta \\mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its\ntheoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a\nnear-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,\ndifficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still\nbe useful for neural posterior validation? We show that the answer is yes.\nBuilding on the work of Hu and Lei, we present several key results for a\nconformal variant of the C2ST, which converts any trained classifier's scores\n-- even those of weak or over-fitted models -- into exact finite-sample\np-values. We establish two key theoretical properties of the conformal C2ST:\n(i) finite-sample Type-I error control, and (ii) non-trivial power that\ndegrades gently in tandem with the error of the trained classifier. The upshot\nis that even weak, biased, or overfit classifiers can still yield powerful and\nreliable tests. Empirically, the Conformal C2ST outperforms classical\ndiscriminative tests across a wide range of benchmarks. These results reveal\nthe under appreciated strength of weak classifiers for validating neural\nposterior estimates, establishing the conformal C2ST as a practical,\ntheoretically grounded diagnostic for modern simulation-based inference.",

To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which\nleverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer\nlearning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while\nminimizing the need for extensive manual annotations.

We achieve efficient sampling through gradient-based Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) methods and low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Compared with\nexisting methods based on Bayesian neural networks, our approach bypasses the\nchallenge of sampling in the high-dimensional space of neural network weights\nand does not require specifying a prior distribution on the neural network\nsolution. Instead, uncertainty propagates naturally from the data through the\nPDE constraints. By enforcing strong PDE constraints, the proposed method\nimproves the accuracy of both parameter inference and uncertainty\nquantification. We analyze the dynamic error of the gradient in the MCMC\nsampler and the static error in the posterior distribution due to inexact\nminimization of the lower level problem and demonstrate a direct link between\nthe tolerance for solving the lower level problem and the accuracy of the\nresulting uncertainty quantification. Through numerical experiments across a\nvariety of PDE models, we demonstrate that our method delivers accurate\ninference and quantification of uncertainties while maintaining high\ncomputational efficiency.",

Given two alternative\nmodel responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the \"better\"\nresponse. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded\nmetrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping\nmodel evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise\ncomparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for\nresponses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh\nwriting quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore\naugmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve\nperformance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and\ncode tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality\nfeedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to\nground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal\nknowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our\nmethod across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation\ntasks, using RewardBench (incl.

Our analysis\ncovers a general class of non-separable Hamiltonians satisfying a displacement\nmonotonicity condition, along with mild regularity and growth conditions at\ninfinity. A major novelty of our work is the rigorous treatment of a nontrivial\nfixed-point problem on a space of measures, which arises naturally in the MFGC\nformulation. Unlike prior works that either restrict to separable Hamiltonians\n- rendering the fixed-point map trivial - or assume convergence or regularity\nproperties of the fixed point map, we develop a detailed structural analysis of\nthis equation and its N-player analogue. This leads to new regularity results\nfor the fixed-point maps and, in turn, to quantitative convergence of open-loop\nequilibria.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a closed-loop, test-time prompt refinement framework that requires no\nadditional training of the underlying T2I model, termed TIR. In our approach,\neach generation step is followed by a refinement step, where a pretrained\nmultimodal large language model (MLLM) analyzes the output image and the user's\nprompt. The MLLM detects misalignments (e.g., missing objects, incorrect\nattributes) and produces a refined and physically grounded prompt for the next\nround of image generation. By iteratively refining the prompt and verifying\nalignment between the prompt and the image, TIR corrects errors, mirroring the\niterative refinement process of human artists. We demonstrate that this\nclosed-loop strategy improves alignment and visual coherence across multiple\nbenchmark datasets, all while maintaining plug-and-play integration with\nblack-box T2I models.",

An observation is considered regular when the corresponding difference\nof these two depths is close to zero. When this difference is large the\nobservation score contribution is downweighted. We study the asymptotic\nproperties of the proposed estimator, including consistency and asymptotic\nnormality, for a broad class of weight functions.

While most SEP events involve\noutward streaming particles along open magnetic field lines, bidirectional\nevents characterized by simultaneous sunward and anti-sunward particle flows\noffer unique insights into magnetic field topology and the interplay of\nmultiple acceleration sources. We aim to investigate the origin and transport\nof energetic particles in two rare bidirectional anisotropic SEP events\nobserved by Solar Orbiter. Both events showed two clear velocity dispersion\nsignatures with opposite particle anisotropies during their onset phase. The\nsunward streaming protons, characterized by delayed release time, harder\nspectral index, and higher intensities, may be attributed to coronal mass\nejection-driven shock acceleration, while the promptly released anti-sunward\nstreaming protons are likely linked to flare acceleration. Notably, in both\ncases, small-scale flux ropes were identified in situ during the time intervals\ncorresponding to the bidirectional particle streaming. Path lengths derived for\nsunward and anti-sunward injections were substantially greater than nominal\nvalues of the Parker field lines, further supporting the role of the flux rope\nin shaping particle trajectories. These observations demonstrate that magnetic\nflux rope could significantly affect magnetic connectivity to the source region\nand SEP propagation in the inner heliosphere, while simultaneous velocity\ndispersion from two distinct particle sources allows for direct constraints on\nthe topology of the flux rope. Our results highlight the value of combining\nparticle anisotropy, release time, source spectra, and magnetic structure\ndiagnostics to unravel SEP transport in complex transient magnetic structures,\nand also present new challenges for the current SEP transport model.",

Our novel approach examines how this\nsubstitution affects both bias magnitude and accuracy across a spectrum of LLMs\nfrom industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Our experiments\nshow that small models are less accurate and exhibit more bias compared to\ntheir larger counterparts. For instance, on our name-based dataset and in the\nambiguous context (where the correct choice is not revealed), Claude Haiku\nexhibited the worst stereotypical bias scores of 9%, compared to only 3.5% for\nits larger counterpart, Claude Sonnet, where the latter also outperformed it by\n117.7% in accuracy.

Inspired by prominent models of\nbiological sensorimotor processing, our investigated HRL approach breaks down\nthe complex task of exoskeleton control adaptation into a higher-level\nframework for terrain strategy adaptation and a lower-level framework for\nproviding predictive information; this latter element is implemented via the\ncontinual learning of general value functions (GVFs). GVFs generated temporal\nabstractions of future signal values from multiple wearable lower-limb sensors,\nincluding electromyography, pressure insoles, and goniometers. We investigated\ntwo methods for incorporating actual and predicted sensor signals into a policy\nnetwork with the intent to improve the decision-making capacity of the control\nsystem of a lower-limb exoskeleton during ambulation across varied terrains. As\na key result, we found that the addition of predictions made from GVFs\nincreased overall network accuracy. Terrain-specific performance increases were\nseen while walking on even ground, uneven ground, up and down ramps, and turns,\nterrains that are often misclassified without predictive information.

This\nwork aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic\nsegmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground\ntruth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are\nfirst aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the\nresulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to\nproduce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations.

This is followed by a purely geometric\nsegmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes\nwithout relying on texture information.

    "abstract": "Silicon nitride Dissipative Kerr Soliton (DKS) microcombs have emerged as a\nfuture solution to bring metrological optical frequency comb capabilities into\na photonic integrated platform with mass-scale fabrication benefits. Precision\napplications demand low comb line phase noise as well as high repetition rate\nstability, but current approaches to achieve this involve complex\narchitectures, multiple lasers, and high-power components, which are\nchallenging to integrate to the chip scale. To achieve this goal, new\narchitectures are needed to simplify the comb generation, actuation, and pump\nlaser requirements, while enabling chip-integrated solutions. Here we\ndemonstrate a greatly simplified stabilized DKS comb architecture with a single\nlaser and a single point electronic control of both the microcomb generation\nand its stabilization to a coil-resonator reference. The silicon nitride\nmicrocomb is integrated with a low power, broadband PZT actuator that is driven\nby a simple electronic control sequence that generates a soliton and stabilizes\nit to the 16-meter silicon nitride coil resonator. PZT-enabled control brings\nflexibility and simplicity to the soliton generation and stabilization using a\nsingle CW pump laser, resulting in significantly reduced electronic and optical\ninfrastructure. We demonstrate coil-resonator locking which suppresses the 1\nkHz frequency noise by 40 dB over the 35 nm wide comb spectrum, with comb line\nlinewidths as low as 66 Hz and 108 GHz soliton repetition rate phase noise\nequivalent to -118 dBc/Hz when divided down to 10 GHz. The low power PZT\nactuator consumes nW bias power and the coil resonator allows flexible dual\nlocking using arbitrary comb lines. These results show a clear path towards\nfull chip integration of stabilized soliton microcombs with simplicity and\nversatility absent in other schemes.",

This work demonstrates that resource theories, widely employed\nin information theory, provide a unified organizing principle to frame Mpemba\nphysics. We show how the conventional thermal Mpemba effect arises naturally\nfrom the resource theory of athermality, while its symmetry-restoring\ncounterpart is fully captured by the resource theories of asymmetry. Leveraging\nthe framework of modes of asymmetry, we demonstrate that the Mpemba effect due\nto symmetry restoration is governed by the initial overlap with the slowest\nsymmetry-restoring mode -- mirroring the role of the slowest Liouvillian\neigenmode in thermal Mpemba dynamics.

Most tornadoes (72\\%) occurred broadly to the southeast of an ETC\ncenter within 2000km, with a median distance of approximately 500km. Of those\ntornadoes, 69\\% occurred in outbreaks of 6+ tornadoes. The spatial and\nETC-relative distributions are similar across all intensity levels. Through the\nseasonal cycle, tornadoes shift north and south along with ETCs and the jet\nstream, and they are much more strongly (weakly) associated with ETCs in the\nwinter (76\\%; summer 38\\%) when the jet stream and ETCs are strongest\n(weakest). Finally, median tornado and tornado-producing ETC locations covary\nstrongly with one another interannually. A long-term eastward trend in\ntornado-producing ETCs mirrors the eastward trend in tornadoes found in recent\nwork, suggesting that this shift may be driven by spatial shifts in ETC tracks.\nThis work identifies a strong link between tornado and ETC activity over the\nU.S. that warrants deeper analysis of their role in generating tornadic\nenvironments in a warming world.",

This paper explores the theoretical limits of distributed covariance\nestimation in a feature-split setting, where communication between agents is\nconstrained. Specifically, we study a scenario in which multiple agents each\nobserve different components of i.i.d. samples drawn from a sub-Gaussian random\nvector. A central server seeks to estimate the complete covariance matrix using\na limited number of bits communicated by each agent. We obtain a nearly tight\nminimax lower bound for covariance matrix estimation under operator norm and\nFrobenius norm. Our main technical tool is a novel generalization of the strong\ndata processing inequality (SDPI), termed the Conditional Strong Data\nProcessing Inequality (C-SDPI) coefficient, introduced in this work. The C-SDPI\ncoefficient shares key properties such as tensorization with the conventional\nSDPI. Crucially, it quantifies the average contraction in a state-dependent\nchannel and can be significantly lower than the worst-case SDPI coefficient\nover the state input.\n  Utilizing the doubling trick of Geng-Nair and an operator Jensen inequality,\nwe compute this coefficient for Gaussian mixture channels. We then employ it to\nestablish minimax lower bounds on estimation error, capturing the trade-offs\namong sample size, communication cost, and data dimensionality. Building on\nthis, we present a nearly optimal estimation protocol whose sample and\ncommunication requirements match the lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.\nUnlike much of the existing literature, our framework does not assume infinite\nsamples or Gaussian distributions, making it broadly applicable.

We\nbegin by identifying the characteristic scales involved in the spiral structure\nproblem and listing some quantitative requirements of a successful theory. We\nthen write down the general linear response theory for thin disks, making clear\nthe equivalence between different representations (e.g., Volterra, Landau, van\nKampen) of the theory. Next, using the asymptotic expansions developed in our\nprevious galactokinetics paper, we consider spiral structure on different\nspatial scales and thereby show how several classic results - including\nLindblad-Kalnajs density waves, swing amplification, Lin-Shu-Kalnajs modes, and\ngroove instabilities - emerge as limiting cases. In addition, many of our\nasymptotic results connect smoothly when extrapolated to intermediate regimes,\nrendering the analytic theory valid over a larger range of scales than naively\nexpected. Finally, we identify situations in which nonlinear physics is\nunavoidable. Though many nonlinear questions remain unanswered, we hope that\nthe theoretical synthesis developed here will allow us to both connect and\ndistinguish the plethora of ideas that have accumulated over the last six\ndecades of spiral structure studies, and will provide a foundation upon which a\ncomprehensive theory might ultimately be built.",

Valid statistical inference requires proper\nadjustment for these errors. Two-phase sampling with generalized raking (GR)\nestimation is an efficient solution to this problem that is robust to complex\nerror structures. In this approach, error-prone variables are observed in a\nlarge phase 1 cohort, and a subset is selected in phase 2 for validation with\nerror-free measurements. Previous research has studied optimal phase 2 sampling\ndesigns for inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators in non-adaptive,\nmulti-parameter settings, and for GR estimators in single-parameter settings.\nIn this work, we extend these results by deriving optimal adaptive, multiwave\nsampling designs for IPW and GR estimators when multiple parameters are of\ninterest. We propose several practical allocation strategies and evaluate their\nperformance through extensive simulations and a data example from the\nVanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic HIV Study. Our results show that\nindependently optimizing allocation for each parameter improves efficiency over\ntraditional case-control sampling. We also derive an integer-valued, A-optimal\nallocation method that typically outperforms independent optimization. Notably,\nwe find that optimal designs for GR can differ substantially from those for\nIPW, and that this distinction can meaningfully affect estimator efficiency in\nthe multiple-parameter setting.

Due to uncertainty on the precise mechanics of star formation, the\nproperties inferred for YSOs using these models often depend strongly on the\nassumed accretion history. We develop a framework for predicting observable\nproperties of YSOs that is agnostic to the underlying accretion history,\nenabling comparison between theories. This framework links a set of\nradiative-transfer SEDs with protostellar evolutionary tracks to create models\nof evolving YSOs. Unlike previous works, we directly relate evolution models to\nobservables through theoretical physical parameters rather than through\nintermediate, observationally derived analogues. We make flux predictions for\nYSOs corresponding to stars with birth masses from 0.2 to 50 $M_\\odot$ during\ntheir accretion phase following isothermal-sphere, turbulent-core, and\ncompetitive accretion histories, showing that these histories may be\nobservationally distinguished by examining the 100-$\\mu$m and 3-mm fluxes of a\nYSO. We discuss the impact of dust models and parameter ranges on the output of\nradiative transfer simulations through a comparison to another SED model grid.\nWe quantify the degree of confusion between YSO Stages and Classes across a\nwide range of physical scenarios; for each, we calculate confusion matrices\nthat enable inference of the number of objects of a given Stage from an\nobserved population.

Most existing SNNs assume a single time constant for neuronal membrane\nvoltage dynamics, modeled by first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nwith Markovian characteristics. Consequently, the voltage state at any time\ndepends solely on its immediate past value, potentially limiting network\nexpressiveness. Real neurons, however, exhibit complex dynamics influenced by\nlong-term correlations and fractal dendritic structures, suggesting\nnon-Markovian behavior. Motivated by this, we propose the Fractional SPIKE\nDifferential Equation neural network (fspikeDE), which captures long-term\ndependencies in membrane voltage and spike trains through fractional-order\ndynamics. These fractional dynamics enable more expressive temporal patterns\nbeyond the capability of integer-order models. For efficient training of\nfspikeDE, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm that optimizes parameters\nby solving an augmented fractional-order ODE (FDE) backward in time using\nadjoint sensitivity methods. Extensive experiments on diverse image and graph\ndatasets demonstrate that fspikeDE consistently outperforms traditional SNNs,\nachieving superior accuracy, comparable energy efficiency, reduced training\nmemory usage, and enhanced robustness against noise. Our approach provides a\nnovel open-sourced computational toolbox for fractional-order SNNs, widely\napplicable to various real-world tasks.",

However, the rigidity control of other origami structures\nis much less understood. In this work, we study the rigidity control of general\norigami structures via enforcing or relaxing the planarity condition of their\npolygonal facets. Specifically, by performing numerical simulations on a large\nvariety of origami structures with different facet selection rules, we\nsystematically analyze how the geometry and topology of different origami\nstructures affect their degrees of freedom (DOF). We also propose a\nhypergeometric model based on the selection process to derive theoretical\nbounds for the probabilistic properties of the rigidity change, which allows us\nto identify key origami structural variables that theoretically govern the DOF\nevolution and thereby the critical rigidity percolation transition in general\norigami structures. Moreover, we develop a simple unified model that describes\nthe relationship between the critical percolation density, the origami facet\ngeometry, and the facet selection rules, which enables efficient prediction of\nthe critical transition density for high-resolution origami structures.\nAltogether, our work highlights the intricate similarities and differences in\nthe rigidity control of general origami structures, shedding light on the\ndesign of flexible mechanical metamaterials for practical applications.",

These perturbations lead to an\nartificial fragmentation in the filamentary network of the Large Scale\nStructure, often referred to as \"beads-on-a-string.\" This issue is particularly\napparent in cosmologies with a suppression of the matter power spectrum at\nsmall spatial scales, such as warm dark matter models, where the perturbations\ninduced by the N-body discretisation dominate the cosmological power at the\nsuppressed scales. Initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian\nperturbation theory, which allow for a late-starting redshift, have been shown\nto minimise numerical errors contributing to such artefacts. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether the additional use of a spatially adaptive softening for\ndark matter particles, based on the gravitational tidal field, can reduce the\nseverity of artificial fragmentation. Tidal adaptive softening significantly\nimproves force accuracy in idealised filamentary collapse simulations over a\nfixed softening approach. However, it does not substantially reduce spurious\nhaloes in cosmological simulations when paired with such optimised initial\nconditions. Nevertheless, tidal adaptive softening induces a shift in halo\nformation times in warm dark matter simulations compared to a fixed softening\ncounterpart, an effect not seen in cold dark matter simulations. Furthermore,\ninitialising the initial conditions at an earlier redshift generally results in\nz=0 haloes forming from Lagrangian volumes with lower average sphericity. This\nsphericity difference could impact post-processing algorithms identifying\nspurious objects based on Lagrangian volume morphology. We propose potential\nstrategies for reducing spurious haloes without abandoning current N-body\nmethods.",

We first design a stable payoff allocation scheme that accounts for\ntruck heterogeneity in energy savings and platoon roles (leader or follower),\nestablishing core-stability conditions to ensure that no subset of trucks has\nan incentive to deviate for greater benefit. To enhance payoff fairness, we\nthen propose a closed-form, Shapley value-based allocation approach that is\ncomputationally efficient and independent of the platoon size. Sufficient\nconditions under which the allocation is both fair and core-stable are\nprovided. In scenarios where the Shapley value falls outside the core, we\ndevelop an alternative allocation based on the stable payoff that minimizes the\nmean relative deviation from the Shapley value while preserving core stability.\nThis deviation is further proved to be upper-bounded by $1$, showing a\nfavorable trade-off between stability and fairness.

    "abstract": "A broad range of NLP tasks involve selecting relevant text spans from given\nsource texts. Despite this shared objective, such \\textit{content selection}\ntasks have traditionally been studied in isolation, each with its own modeling\napproaches, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose\n\\textit{instruction-guided content selection (IGCS)} as a beneficial unified\nframework for such settings, where the task definition and any\ninstance-specific request are encapsulated as instructions to a language model.\nTo promote this framework, we introduce \\igcsbench{}, the first unified\nbenchmark covering diverse content selection tasks. Further, we create a large\ngeneric synthetic dataset that can be leveraged for diverse content selection\ntasks, and show that transfer learning with these datasets often boosts\nperformance, whether dedicated training for the targeted task is available or\nnot. Finally, we address generic inference time issues that arise in LLM-based\nmodeling of content selection, assess a generic evaluation metric, and overall\npropose the utility of our resources and methods for future content selection\nmodels.

Based on Local Universe observations, quiescent galaxies (QGs) host\nlower to no HI compared to star-forming galaxies (SFGs), but no constraints\nhave been derived so far at higher redshift (z>0.1). Understanding whether QGs\ncan retain significant HI reservoirs at higher z is crucial to refine quenching\nand gas accretion models and to constrain overall star formation efficiency at\ndifferent epochs. Aims. We aim to probe HI in candidate QGs at intermediate\nredshifts (z=0.36) and to understand whether there exists a class of QGs\nretaining consistent HI reservoirs and which parameters (dust content, stellar\nmass, Dn4000, morphology, environment) effectively capture HI-rich QGs.\nMethods. We perform 21-cm spectral line stacking on MIGHTEE-HI data at z=0.36,\ntargeting two different samples of QGs, defined by means of a color-selection\ncriterion and a spectroscopic criterion based on Dn4000, respectively. We also\nperform stacking on subsamples of the spectroscopically-selected quiescent\nsample to investigate the correlation between the HI content and other galaxy\nproperties. Results. We find that QGs with an IR counterpart (i.e., dusty\ngalaxies) are found to host a substantial HI content, on average just 40% lower\nthan SFGs. In contrast, color-selected QGs still hold HI, but lower than SFGs\nby a factor 3. Among dusty objects, we find morphology to have a mild impact on\nthe atomic gas content, with spirals hosting approximately 15-30% more HI than\nspheroids. Environmental effects are also present, with low-density regions\nhosting galaxies that are HI-richer than in high-density ones, by approximately\n30% for spirals and 60% for spheroids. We suggest that, in general, HI content\nis driven by several factors, including quenching mechanisms and ISM enrichment\nprocesses. Also, quiescent galaxies - and especially dusty systems - seem to\nyield HI more consistently than in the Local Universe.",

The standard\napproach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various\nnumerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the\nderivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a\nprocedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy\nscales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous\nformulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the\nrenormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129\n(2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target\nspace (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the\nthe rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we\nstate conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded\neffective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize\nthe exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase\napproximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting\nrelevant corrections in the process.

Observations of the long-wavelength dust continuum, a proxy for the cold\ngas, are widely used in the high-redshift community because of their ease and\nefficiency. These measurements rely on the assumption of a molecular\ngas-to-dust mass ratio, typically taken to be GDR ~ 100 in massive, metal-rich\nsystems. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)\nobservations of the 870um dust continuum in a sample of five massive quiescent\ngalaxies at z ~ 1 with existing detections of CO(2-1). We find surprisingly\nweak dust emission, falling a factor of >~0.4-0.8 dex below the typical\ncorrelation between CO and continuum luminosity. We interpret this dust\ndeficiency as evidence for unusually high GDR in these galaxies, which we\ncalculate to range from 300 to at least 1200. Our results and other\nobservations from the literature are generally compatible with predictions from\nthe SIMBA cosmological simulation that dust is preferentially destroyed in\nquiescent galaxies.

In this framework, we\npresent VLT/MUSE snapshot observations (45 min/source) of 59 $z\\sim3$ quasars\nextending the long-term QSO MUSEUM campaign to fainter SDSS sources. The whole\nsurvey now targets 120 quasars with a median redshift of $z$=3.13, and\nbolometric luminosities, black hole masses and Eddington ratios of\n$45.1<\\log(L_{\\rm bol}/[{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}]})<48.7$, $7.9<\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/[{\\rm\nM_{\\odot}]})<10.3 $ and $0.01<\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}<1.8$, respectively.

Assuming that all targeted quasars sit in halos of $M_{\\rm\nDM}\\sim10^{12.5}\\,M_\\odot$, as found in clustering studies, the trend in\nSB$_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$ can be explained by larger fractions of cool gas mass\nilluminated, implying that brighter quasars have larger ionization cone opening\nangles. Similarly, brighter AGNs seem to perturb the cool ($T\\sim10^4$ K) gas\nmore strongly.

We also observed a\ndiscrepancy in the log(g) estimates, which are dispersed between 3.5 and 5.5\ndex for mid-L objects. We interpreted this as a bias caused by a range of\nrotational velocities leading to cloud migration toward equatorial latitudes,\ncombined with a variety of viewing angles that result in different observed\natmospheric properties (cloud column densities, atmospheric pressures, etc.).\nFinally, while providing robust estimates of [M/H] and C/O for individual\nobjects remains challenging, the X-SHYNE library globally suggests solar\nvalues, which are consistent with a formation via stellar formation mechanisms.\nThis study highlights the strength of homogeneous datasets in performing\ncomparative analyses, reducing the impact of systematics, and ensuring robust\nconclusions while avoiding over-interpretation.",

The effects of light compact objects, such as\nthose in the unconstrained asteroid-mass range, have generally been neglected.\nIn principle, low-energy perturbers can harden binaries instead of softening\nthem, but the standard lore is that this effect vanishes when the perturber\nvelocities are large compared to the binary's orbital velocity, as is typical\nfor DM constituents. Here, we revisit the computation of the hardening rate\ninduced by light perturbers. We show that although the perturbations average to\nzero over many encounters, many scenarios of interest for DM constraints are in\nthe regime where the variance cannot be neglected. We show that a few\nfast-moving perturbers can leave stochastic perturbations in systems that are\nmeasured with great precision, and we use this framework to revisit the\nconstraint potential of systems such as binary pulsars and the Solar System.\nThis opens a new class of dynamical probes with potential applications to\nasteroid-mass DM candidates.",

We find\nthat enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in\nsubstructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF)\nresulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high\nmasses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is\nsensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the\nSHMF enhancement depend on the wave number of the $P(k)$ excess and the\npresence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the\nSHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution.\nAdditionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center and\ntheir concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement.

Off-policy RL\noffers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling\ntrajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to\nmismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for\nvision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy\nbehavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable\nLVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns\noutcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.\nThen LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning\ntrajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms.

Today, almost all successful\napplications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the\ncorrectness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize\nguessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect\nof degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate\nincorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper\ndescribes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach\nto training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated\nconfidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR\nsubstantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and\nclassifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL\nhurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized\nconfidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration\nvia confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly\noptimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning\nmodels.",

There, we demonstrate that the entanglement\nentropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a\nsemiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the\nsemiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum\ninformational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general\nstates and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement\nentropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading\nthat integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast\nto previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach\nemploys a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model\ncalled Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify\nprediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the\nstochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages\ndomain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that\nensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each\nprediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL\nframework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear\nunderstanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the\nuncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to\n5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing\nelectricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak\nhour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These\nimprovements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting\nthe synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient,\neconomically efficient energy communities.",

Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding\nto undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear\nprojections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended\ngeneralizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,\nincluding emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow\ntask generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.\nWithout any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses\nby 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution.

The main\nchallenge in building these quantum computers is to realize scalable modules\nfor remote qubits and entanglement. By assembling small, specialized parts into\na larger architecture, the modular approach mitigates complexity and\nuncertainty. Such a distributed architecture requires non-local quantum gate\noperations between remote qubits. An essential method for implementing such\noperations, known as quantum gate teleportation, requires only local\noperations, classical communication, and shared entanglement.

Second, for different input\npolarization states, we obtain an average quantum state fidelity of 87.0 +-\n2.2% with our teleported on-chip CNOT gate.

We expand on that research by\nconducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded\nrepresentational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of\nidentity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about\nsignificant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to\nencourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious\nand caste representation in the outputs against the actual population\ndistribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and\n\"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We\nfind that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups\nfar beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to\nencourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that\nrepresentational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased\nthan the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated\nprompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these\nbiases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be\nsufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental\nchanges in model development.

Recently,\nZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use\nunlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information\nrequired for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance.

First, we introduce a bounding box\nand category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set\nfrom the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and\ncategory distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate\ntask-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the\nperformance of quantized detection networks.

These\nchallenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of\nannotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning\nmodel performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we\nexamined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for\nnatural images.\n  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization,\nsemantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable\ncues, substantially improving the model performance.

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration lies at the intersection of developmental biology\nand non-equilibrium physics, where active processes give rise to emergent\npatterns that are biologically relevant. Here, we investigate dilatational\nmodes--cycles of expansion and contraction--in epithelial monolayers, and show\nthat the divergence of the velocity field exhibits robust, large-scale temporal\noscillations. These oscillatory patterns, reminiscent of excitable media and\ntheir biological analogs, emerge spontaneously from the coupled dynamics of\nactively pulsing cells. We find that the temporal persistence of these\noscillations varies non-monotonically with cell density: synchrony initially\nincreases with density, reaches a maximum at intermediate densities and is lost\nat higher values. This trend mirrors changes in the spatial correlation length\nof cell-cell interactions, and the density of topological defects in the\nsystem, suggesting a shared physical origin. We develop a continuum model in\nwhich a complex-valued Ginzburg-Landau-type field that governs the amplitude\nand phase of oscillations is coupled to local cell density. Simulations\nreproduce the observed behavior, revealing that local density adapts to phase\npatterns, reinforcing temporal coherence up to a critical density, and\nvariations in the density of topological defects as a function of cell density.\nExtending our analysis to breast cancer cell lines with increasing\ninvasiveness, we find that malignant cells exhibit longer phase persistence and\nfewer topological defects, suggesting a mechanistic link between temporal\ncoherence and metastatic potential. Together, these results highlight the role\nof density-dependent synchrony dynamics as a fundamental, quantifiable mode of\ncollective behavior in active epithelial matter, with implications for\nmorphogenesis, cancer progression, and tissue diagnostics.",

For these machines, far more computation will be possible\nthan that which can be saved to disk. As a result, users will be unable to rely\non post-hoc access to data for uncertainty quantification and other statistical\nanalyses and there will be an urgent need for sophisticated machine learning\nalgorithms which can be trained in situ. Algorithms deployed in this setting\nmust be highly scalable, memory efficient and capable of handling data which is\ndistributed across nodes as spatially contiguous partitions. One suitable\napproach involves fitting a sparse variational Gaussian process (SVGP) model\nindependently and in parallel to each spatial partition. The resulting model is\nscalable, efficient and generally accurate, but produces the undesirable effect\nof constructing discontinuous response surfaces due to the disagreement between\nneighboring models at their shared boundary. In this paper, we extend this idea\nby allowing for a small amount of communication between neighboring spatial\npartitions which encourages better alignment of the local models, leading to\nsmoother spatial predictions and a better fit in general. Due to our\ndecentralized communication scheme, the proposed extension remains highly\nscalable and adds very little overhead in terms of computation (and none, in\nterms of memory).

While nominally valid\nin the large-system limit, it is shown that the derived Gaussian approximation\nfor the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna\narrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when\nfast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation\nchallenging. The derived analysis indicates that, when the channel close to an\nRIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread which is reasonable\nfor wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication\nlink benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in\ngains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. More\nimportantly, the presented novel asymptotic properties of the correlation\nmatrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs can be deployed to\noptimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization. The\nnumerical investigation demonstrates that, when the desired reflection from any\nof the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the metasurfaces can\nbe optimized to provide robust communication links, without significant need\nfor their optimal placement.",

While metal-poor\ncarbon-rich AGB stars are known to produce copious amounts of amorphous carbon\ndust owing to the dredge up of newly synthesized carbon, this is the first time\nthat Si- and Fe-bearing dust has been detected at this extreme metallicity. Of\nthe six AGB stars observed, one is an intermediate-mass (~1.2-4 M_sun) carbon\nstar showing SiC dust, and another is an oxygen-rich M-type star with mass ~4-5\nM_sun that is likely undergoing hot bottom burning. The infrared excess of the\nM-type star is strong, but featureless. We tested multiple dust species, and\nfind that it is best fit with metallic iron dust. Assuming its dust-production\nrate stays constant over the final 2-3x10^4 yr of its evolution, this star will\nproduce ~0.9-3.7 times the iron dust mass predicted by models, with the range\ndepending on the adopted stellar mass. The implications for dust production in\nhigh-redshift galaxies are potentially significant, especially regarding the\nassumed dust species used in dust evolution models and the timescale of AGB\ndust formation. Stars on the upper end of the AGB mass range can begin\nproducing dust as early as 30-50 Myr after they form, and they may therefore\nrival dust production by supernovae at high redshift.",

    "abstract": "Non-reciprocal interactions are prevalent in various complex systems leading\nto phenomena that cannot be described by traditional equilibrium statistical\nphysics. Although non-reciprocally interacting systems composed of two\npopulations have been closely studied, the physics of non-reciprocal systems\nwith a general number of populations is not well explored despite the potential\nrelevance to biological systems, active matter, and driven-dissipative quantum\nmaterials. In this work, we investigate the generic features of the phases and\nphase transitions that emerge in $O(2)$ symmetric many-body systems with\nmultiple non-reciprocally coupled populations, applicable to microscopic models\nsuch as networks of oscillators, flocking models, and more generally systems\nwhere each agent has a phase variable. Using symmetry and topology of the\npossible orbits, we systematically show that a rich variety of time-dependent\nphases and phase transitions arise. Examples include multipopulation chiral\nphases that are distinct from their two-population counterparts that emerge via\na phase transition characterized by critical exceptional points, as well as\nlimit cycle saddle-node bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation. Interestingly, we\nfind a phase transition that dynamically restores the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry\noccurs via a homoclinic orbit bifurcation, where the two $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ broken\norbits merge at the phase transition point, providing a general route to\nhomoclinic chaos in the order parameter dynamics for $N\\geq4$ populations.

To explore these\nunconventional effects in the prototypical $s^\\pm$-wave superconductor FeSe, we\nuse atomic resolution scanned Josephson tunneling microscopy SJTM for\ncondensate resolved imaging and junction tuning -- capabilities unattainable in\nmacroscopic Josephson devices with fixed characteristics. We quantitatively\ndemonstrate frustrated Josephson tunneling by examining two tunneling\ninequalities. The relative transparency of two parallel tunneling pathways is\nfound tunable, revealing a tendency towards a 0-pi transition with decreasing\nSJTM junction resistance. Simultaneous visualization of both superconducting\ncondensates reveals anti correlated superfluid modulations, highlighting the\nrole of inter-band scattering.

    "abstract": "I suggest the double-degenerate (DD) scenario with a merger-to-explosion\ndelay (MED) time (the DD-MED scenario) of about 1-2 years to explain the rare\nproperties of the recently analyzed type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2020aeuh. The\nrare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich\ncircumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this\nDD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and\nM2=1, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar\nmass. The merger process ejects 0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At\nthe explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and\nhelium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the\ncore-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia\nremnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the\nDD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the\nCSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study\nstrengthens the claim that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD\nscenarios, account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia; all SN Ia scenarios,\nwhether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia.",

To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been\nproposed to reduce the unreliability (i.e., hallucinations) of LLMs. However,\ndesigning effective pipelines remains challenging due to numerous design\nchoices. In this paper, we construct a retrieval corpus of over 3 million Java\nand Python related Stack Overflow posts with accepted answers, and explore\nvarious RAG pipeline designs to answer developer questions, evaluating their\neffectiveness in generating accurate and reliable responses. More specifically,\nwe (1) design and evaluate 7 different RAG pipelines and 63 pipeline variants\nto answer questions that have historically similar matches, and (2) address new\nquestions without any close prior matches by automatically lowering the\nsimilarity threshold during retrieval, thereby increasing the chance of finding\npartially relevant context and improving coverage for unseen cases. We find\nthat implementing a RAG pipeline combining hypothetical-documentation-embedding\n(HyDE) with the full-answer context performs best in retrieving and answering\nsimilarcontent for Stack Overflow questions. Finally, we apply our optimal RAG\npipeline to 4 open-source LLMs and compare the results to their zero-shot\nperformance. Our findings show that RAG with our optimal RAG pipeline\nconsistently outperforms zero-shot baselines across models, achieving higher\nscores for helpfulness, correctness, and detail with LLM-as-a-judge. These\nfindings demonstrate that our optimal RAG pipelines robustly enhance answer\nquality for a wide range of developer queries including both previously seen\nand novel questions across different LLMs",

To implement the approach, the\ninitial data must be split into two subsets. The first subset serves as the\ntraining sample to which the model is fit, and the second subset serves as an\nout-of-sample test set from which the MEWMA control limit (CL) is determined.\nIn this paper, we develop a novel bootstrap procedure for computing the CL. Our\nbootstrap CL provides much more accurate control of false-alarm rate,\nespecially when the sample size and/or false-alarm rate is small. It also\nallows the entire initial sample to be used for training, resulting in a more\naccurate fitted supervised learning model. We show that a standard nested\nbootstrap (inner loop accounting for future data variability and outer loop\naccounting for training sample variability) substantially underestimates\nvariability and develop a 632-like correction that appropriately accounts for\nthis.

In particular, thanks to the\nformal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge\nmodes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the\nbulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs\nwith boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be\nassociated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in\norder to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the\nprediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall\nsystems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a\nphysical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum\nField Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have\nnon-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining\nsymmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the\nboundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which\nalso appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a\npossible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton\nquasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the\nalgebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never\nproved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter,\nelasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this\nThesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar\ngauge structure.

    "abstract": "Gaussian quantum probes have been widely used in quantum metrology and\nthermometry, where the goal is to estimate the temperature of an environment\nwith which the probe interacts. It was recently shown that introducing initial\nposition-momentum (PM) correlations in such probes can enhance the estimation\nprecision compared to standard, uncorrelated Gaussian states. Motivated by\nthese findings, we investigate whether PM correlations can also be advantageous\nin a simultaneous estimation setting, specifically, when estimating both the PM\ncorrelations themselves and the effective environment temperature that\ninteracts with the probe. Using the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, we\nderive new precision bounds for this joint estimation task. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that such correlations can serve as a resource to improve\ntemperature estimation within this multiparameter context. Finally, we analyze\nthe compatibility between the two parameters, establishing conditions under\nwhich the derived bounds can be saturated.",

However, engineering\ncoherent spin-motion couplings and effective spin-spin interactions in large\ncrystals poses technical challenges associated with decoherence and prolonged\ntimescales to generate appreciable entanglement. Here, we explore the\npossibility to speed up these interactions in 3D crystals via parametric\namplification. We derive a general Hamiltonian for the parametric amplification\nof spin-motion coupling that is applicable to crystals of any dimension in both\nrf Paul traps and Penning traps. Unlike in lower dimensional crystals, we find\nthat the ability to faithfully (uniformly) amplify the spin-spin interactions\nin 3D crystals depends on the physical implementation of the spin-motion\ncoupling. We consider the light-shift (LS) gate, and the so-called\nphase-insensitive and phase-sensitive M{\\o}lmer-S{\\o}rensen (MS) gates, and\nfind that only the latter gate can be faithfully amplified in general 3D\ncrystals. We discuss a situation where non-uniform amplification can be\nadvantageous.

    "abstract": "Generative models like Flow Matching have achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance but are often hindered by a computationally expensive iterative\nsampling process. To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or\none-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps\nnoise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by\nenforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous\nvelocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a\nlimiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first\nprinciples of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite\nintegrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term\nInterval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential\nrelationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals\nwithout resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we\nintroduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic\nconsistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the\ndifferential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit\nof our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This\nestablishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning\naverage velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is\nsignificantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,\nresulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware\ncompatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been\nsuccessfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as\nDoubao), achieving speedups of 20x.",

However, such investigations were limited by their use of\na perfect-merger and inflated-radii super-particle approach, which inhibits any\nanalysis of planetesimal shapes and spin states, precludes the formation of the\ntightest binary orbits, and produces significantly under-dense planetesimals.\nThe SSDEM enables super-particles to rest upon each other through mutual\nsurface penetration and by simulating contact physics. Super-particles do not\nneed to be inflated and collisions are not treated as perfect mergers; we can\nthus track the evolution of planetesimal shapes, spins, and tight binary\norbits. We demonstrate that the SSDEM is an excellent method to model the\ncollapse process, and is capable of producing many binary planetesimal systems\nfrom a single cloud. Our results confirm the findings of previously published\nperfect-merging models while also producing novel results about planetesimal\nspin and shape properties. Newly-formed planetesimals exhibit 10-hr rotation\nperiods on average and can be characterized by a wide variety of shapes\n(spherical, oblate, top-shaped, flattened, egg-shaped, or prolate), with the\nmost-massive planetesimals primarily forming as spheres and oblate-spheroids.",

To overcome this limitation, the proposed\napproach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate\nvisual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The\nDFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a\nhierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via\nSAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes\naudio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a\nfusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across\nvisual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic\ninteractions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path\nReconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from\ntri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.\nExtensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both\nsynthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance\nimprovements over state-of-the-art methods.",

This shortcoming limits the utility for video\nsegmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object\ncategories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object\ncategory that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating\nroom video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows\nand instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning\nsegmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural\nlanguage text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.\nHowever, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain\ncontextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is\ninadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,\ndisappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as\nsurgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural\nphases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments\nduring surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of\ntemporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation\nthat requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become\ncontextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal\nreasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets\nwould be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an\ninnovative automated benchmark construction method.

A key challenge lies in the scarcity of\nhigh-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several\nworks introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.\nHowever, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the\nquality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,\nwhile only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose\na two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for\ngenerating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate\ndistinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using\nRule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs\ngeneration methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate\nthese diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from\nmultiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,\nincluding about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two\nVLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an\nimage-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP\nand RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed\nthe previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only\n4.2\\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches\nacross benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or\neven exceed manual annotations.

    "abstract": "MRI is an indispensable clinical tool, offering a rich variety of tissue\ncontrasts to support broad diagnostic and research applications. Clinical exams\nroutinely acquire multiple structural sequences that provide complementary\ninformation for differential diagnosis, while research protocols often\nincorporate advanced functional, diffusion, spectroscopic, and relaxometry\nsequences to capture multidimensional insights into tissue structure and\ncomposition. However, these capabilities come at the cost of prolonged scan\ntimes, which reduce patient throughput, increase susceptibility to motion\nartifacts, and may require trade-offs in image quality or diagnostic scope.\nOver the last two decades, advances in image reconstruction\nalgorithms--alongside improvements in hardware and pulse sequence design--have\nmade it possible to accelerate acquisitions while preserving diagnostic\nquality. Central to this progress is the ability to incorporate prior\ninformation to regularize the solutions to the reconstruction problem. In this\ntutorial, we overview the basics of MRI reconstruction and highlight\nstate-of-the-art approaches, beginning with classical methods that rely on\nexplicit hand-crafted priors, and then turning to deep learning methods that\nleverage a combination of learned and crafted priors to further push the\nperformance envelope. We also explore the translational aspects and eventual\nclinical implications of these methods. We conclude by discussing future\ndirections to address remaining challenges in MRI reconstruction. The tutorial\nis accompanied by a Python toolbox\n(https://github.com/tutorial-MRI-recon/tutorial) to demonstrate select methods\ndiscussed in the article.",

    "abstract": "The rotation of the linear polarisation plane of photons during propagation,\nalso known as cosmic birefringence, is a powerful probe of parity-violating\nextensions of standard electromagnetism. Using Planck legacy data, we confirm\nprevious estimates of the isotropic birefringence angle, finding $\\beta \\simeq\n0.30 \\pm 0.05$ [deg] at 68% CL, not including the systematic error from the\ninstrumental polarisation angle. If this is a genuine signal, it could be\nexplained by theories of Chern--Simons-type coupled to electromagnetism, which\ncould lead to a harmonic scale-dependent birefringence signal, if the\nhypothesis of an ultra-light (pseudo) scalar field does not hold. To\ninvestigate these models, we pursue two complementary approaches: first, we fit\nthe birefringence angle estimated at different multipoles, $\\beta_{\\ell}$, with\na power-law model and second, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian\nreconstruction of it. Both methods yield results consistent with a\nnon-vanishing constant birefringence angle. The first method shows no\nsignificant dependence on the harmonic scale (up to $1.8\\sigma$ CL), while the\nsecond method demonstrates that a constant model is favored by Bayesian\nevidence. This conclusion is robust across all four published Planck CMB\nsolutions. Finally, we forecast that upcoming CMB observations by Simons\nObservatory, LiteBIRD and a wishful CMB-Stage 4 experiment could reduce current\nuncertainties by a factor of approximately 7.",

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically\ncreate real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single\nscreenshot.

We find that $R_{\\rm mol}$ is not converged even\nat a resolution of 1 $M_{\\odot}$, with $R_{\\rm mol}$ increasing by a factor of\n2 when resolution is improved from 10 to $1\\ M_{\\odot}$. Models excluding\neither photoionization or magnetic fields result in a factor 2 reduction in\n$R_{\\rm mol}$. The only model that agrees with the observed value of $R_{\\rm\nmol}$ includes our sub-grid clumping model, which enhances $R_{\\rm mol}$ by a\nfactor of $\\sim3$ compared with our fiducial model. This increases the\ntime-averaged $R_{\\rm mol}$ to $0.25$, in agreement with the Solar circle\nvalue, and closer to the observed median value of $0.42$ in regions comparable\nto the solar neighbourhood in nearby spirals.

Due to the significant heterogeneity of these signals, which we\nsummarize as the M5 problem, previous works only focus on small sub-problems\nand employ specialized models, failing to utilize the synergies between\nmodalities and the powerful scaling law. However, we argue that the M5 signals\ncan be modeled in a unified manner due to the intrinsic similarity. As a\nresult, we propose FISHER, a Foundation model for multi-modal Industrial Signal\ncompreHEnsive Representation.

Specifically, FISHER takes the STFT sub-band as the modeling unit\nand adopts a teacher student SSL framework for pre-training. We also develop\nthe RMIS benchmark, which evaluates the representations of M5 industrial\nsignals on multiple health management tasks. Compared with top SSL models,\nFISHER showcases versatile and outstanding capabilities with a general\nperformance gain up to 5.03%, along with much more efficient scaling curves.

However, for MI with\nfully conditional specification, an incorrectly-specified imputation model can\nimpair accuracy of point and interval estimates.\n  Objectives and Methods Our goal is to propose imputation models that are\ncompatible with the Weibull PH-MC analysis models. We derive an exact\nconditional distribution (ECD) imputation model which involves the analysis\nmodel likelihood. Using simulation studies, we compare effect estimate bias and\nconfidence interval (CI) coverage under alternative imputation models including\nthe ECD model, an approximation that includes a cure indicator (cECD), and a\ncomprehensive simple (CS) model. For robust parameter estimation in finite\nand/or sparse samples, we incorporate the Firth-type penalized likelihood\n(FT-PL) and combined likelihood profile (CLIP) methods into the MI.\n  Results Compared to complete case analysis, MI with penalization reduces\nestimation bias and improves coverage. Although ECD and cECD perform similarly\nat higher event rates, ECD generates smaller bias and higher coverage at lower\nrates.

HRS is highly\nsensitive to the line shape and position, thus, it can detect three-dimensional\n(3D) effects such as winds, rotation, and spatial variation of atmospheric\nconditions. At the same time, retrieval frameworks are increasingly deployed to\nconstrain chemical abundances, pressure-temperature (P-T) structures, orbital\nparameters, and rotational broadening. To explore the multidimensional\nparameter space, they need computationally fast models that are consequently\nmostly one-dimensional (1D). However, this approach risks introducing\ninterpretation bias since the planet's true nature is 3D. We investigate the\nrobustness of this methodology at high spectral resolution by running 1D\nretrievals on simulated observations in emission within an observational\nframework using 3D Global Circulation Models of the quintessential HJ WASP-76\nb. We find that the retrieval broadly recovers conditions present in the\natmosphere, but that the retrieved P-T and chemical profiles are not a\nhomogeneous average of all spatial and phase-dependent information. Instead,\nthey are most sensitive to spatial regions with large thermal gradients, which\ndo not necessarily coincide with the strongest emitting regions. Our results\nfurther suggest that the choice of parameterization for the P-T and chemical\nprofiles, as well as Doppler offsets among opacity sources, impact retrieval\nresults. These factors should be carefully considered in future retrieval\nanalyses.",

Motivated by the\nrecognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow\nphysics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a\nfundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular\nchannel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar\nconditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The\nproposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic\nexpressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,\nadhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key\ncontributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,\ninterpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation\napproaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models\nwith domain principles.

Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck\nchallenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a\nsingle prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we\npropose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO\noptimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit\nLLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by\nmaximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,\ntheoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,\nresulting in effective value instructions.

In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture\nthat leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by\nagreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by\nmatching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire\nnetwork. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise\nrobustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification\ntasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that\ncombines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling\nneuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that\nthe brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of\nneurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the\nsame object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We\ndrew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all\nlayers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto\ndynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with\nsimilar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits\nof this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one\ncomposed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image.\nOur results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to\nnoise and with better generalization abilities.

In\ntheir experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\\lambda$) and\nTD($\\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and\nits performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended\nabstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key\nideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\\lambda$) to develop an on-policy\nreinforcement learning algorithm called $\\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.\n  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the\n$\\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant\nconditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are\nrelevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled\nfrom a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn\nto differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and\nminimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters\nassociated with the relevant signals.\n  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to\nassign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the\nstructure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn\nrepresentations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel\nwithout performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.",

The current\nsolutions i.e. supervised fine-tuning and collaborative filtering are\ndense-user-item focused and would be expensive to maintain and update. This\npaper introduces a meta-learning framework, that can be used to perform\nparameter-efficient prompt-tuning, to effectively personalize LLM-based\nrecommender systems quickly at cold-start. The model learns soft prompt\nembeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by\ntreating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens,\nthese learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent\nuser behavioral priors. The prompts are meta-optimized through episodic\nsampling, inner-loop adaptation, and outer-loop generalization. On\nMovieLens-1M, Amazon Reviews, and Recbole, we can see that our adaptive model\noutperforms strong baselines in NDCG@10, HR@10, and MRR, and it runs in\nreal-time (i.e., below 300 ms) on consumer GPUs. Zero-history personalization\nis also supported by this scalable solution, and its 275 ms rate of adaptation\nallows successful real-time risk profiling of financial systems by shortening\ndetection latency and improving payment network stability.

    "abstract": "Agricultural products are often subject to seasonal fluctuations in\nproduction and demand. Predicting and managing inventory levels in response to\nthese variations can be challenging, leading to either excess inventory or\nstockouts. Additionally, the coordination among stakeholders at various level\nof food supply chain is not considered in the existing body of literature. To\nbridge these research gaps, this study focuses on inventory management of\nagri-food products under demand and lead time uncertainties. By implementing\neffective inventory replenishment policy results in maximize the overall profit\nthroughout the supply chain. However, the complexity of the problem increases\ndue to these uncertainties and shelf-life of the product, that makes\nchallenging to implement traditional approaches to generate optimal set of\nsolutions. Thus, the current study propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) algorithm that combines the benefits of both value- and policy-based DRL\napproaches for inventory optimization under uncertainties. The proposed\nalgorithm can incentivize collaboration among stakeholders by aligning their\ninterests and objectives through shared optimization goal of maximizing\nprofitability along the agri-food supply chain while considering perishability,\nand uncertainty simultaneously. By selecting optimal order quantities with\ncontinuous action space, the proposed algorithm effectively addresses the\ninventory optimization challenges. To rigorously evaluate this algorithm, the\nempirical data from fresh agricultural products supply chain inventory is\nconsidered. Experimental results corroborate the improved performance of the\nproposed inventory replenishment policy under stochastic demand patterns and\nlead time scenarios.

We define a Nonunified score that quantifies such\nself-contradiction. Our empirical results reveal that the self-contradiction\nmainly arises from weak generation that fails to align with prompts, rather\nthan misunderstanding. This capability asymmetry indicates the potential of\nleveraging self-contradiction for self-improvement, where the stronger model\nunderstanding guides the weaker generation to mitigate the\ngeneration-understanding gap. Applying standard post-training methods (e.g.,\nSFT, DPO) with such internal supervision successfully improves both generation\nand unification. We discover a co-improvement effect on both generation and\nunderstanding when only fine-tuning the generation branch, a phenomenon known\nin pre-training but underexplored in post-training. Our analysis shows\nimprovements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously\nincorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned\ntraining dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced\nprompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the\nunderstanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of\nco-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is\nempirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics\nlike Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement,\nwhich highlights the necessity of data quality check.

    "abstract": "Code reuse is common in modern software development, but it can also spread\nvulnerabilities when developers unknowingly copy risky code. The code fragments\nthat preserve the logic of known vulnerabilities are known as vulnerable code\nclones (VCCs). Detecting those VCCs is a critical but challenging task.\nExisting VCC detection tools often rely on syntactic similarity or produce\ncoarse vulnerability predictions without clear explanations, limiting their\npractical utility. In this paper, we propose VulCoCo, a lightweight and\nscalable approach that combines embedding-based retrieval with large language\nmodel (LLM) validation. Starting from a set of known vulnerable functions, we\nretrieve syntactically or semantically similar candidate functions from a large\ncorpus and use an LLM to assess whether the candidates retain the\nvulnerability. Given that there is a lack of reproducible vulnerable code clone\nbenchmarks, we first construct a synthetic benchmark that spans various clone\ntypes.\n  Our experiments on the benchmark show that VulCoCo outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of Precision@k and mean average precision\n(MAP). In addition, we also demonstrate VulCoCo's effectiveness in real-world\nprojects by submitting 400 pull requests (PRs) to 284 open-source projects.\nAmong them, 75 PRs were merged, and 15 resulted in newly published CVEs. We\nalso provide insights to inspire future work to further improve the precision\nof vulnerable code clone detection.",

However, these methods frequently overlook important sparsity\naspects of Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and result in high computational costs.\nWe introduce the SPL (Series-Parallel-Loop) decomposition, a novel framework\nthat offers optimal solutions to these challenges. A key contribution is the\nformulation of a general solution for Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n(PCSPs) within graph structures, applied to three optimization problems. First,\nSPL decomposition enhances register allocation by accurately modeling variable\ninterference graphs, leading to efficient register assignments and improved\nperformance across benchmarks. Second, it optimizes LOSPRE by effectively\nidentifying and eliminating redundancies in program execution. Finally, the\nthesis focuses on optimizing the placement of bank selection instructions to\nenhance data retrieval efficiency and reduce latency.

However, the amount of time-consuming annotated\ndata for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of\nincreasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training\nmodels at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city\nlayout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely\nreplicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data\nsuch as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and\nphysics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,\nincorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and\nenvironmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited\ntraining samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target\nenvironment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates\ngeo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building\nsegmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,\nwith median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap.

This approach\nreflects an implicit aim to capture the behavioral similarity between observed\nand estimated values. However, advances in similarity based approaches present\npromising alternatives to conventional variance based techniques, particularly\nin contexts characterized by large datasets or a high number of explanatory\nvariables. This study aims to investigate which methods either traditional or\nsimilarity based are capable of producing narrower confidence intervals under\ncomparable conditions, thereby offering more precise and informative intervals.\nThe dataset utilized in this study consists of U.S. mega cap companies,\ncomprising 42 firms.

The research findings indicate that variance based method and LCSS\nexhibit the highest coverage among the analyzed methods, although they produce\nbroader intervals.

On the hardware side, earlier approaches\neither use rigid-driven mechanisms, which provide precise control but are\ndifficult to design within constrained spaces, or tendon-driven mechanisms,\nwhich are more space-efficient but challenging to control. In contrast, we\npropose a hybrid actuation approach that combines the best of both worlds. The\neyes and mouth-key areas for emotional expression-are controlled using rigid\nmechanisms for precise movement, while the nose and cheek, which convey subtle\nfacial microexpressions, are driven by strings. This design allows us to build\na compact yet versatile hardware platform capable of expressing a wide range of\nemotions. On the algorithmic side, our method introduces a self-modeling\nnetwork that maps motor actions to facial landmarks, allowing us to\nautomatically establish the relationship between blendshape coefficients for\ndifferent facial expressions and the corresponding motor control signals\nthrough gradient backpropagation. We then train a neural network to map speech\ninput to corresponding blendshape controls. With our method, we can generate\ndistinct emotional expressions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and anger,\nfrom any given sentence, each with nuanced, emotion-specific control signals-a\nfeature that has not been demonstrated in earlier systems.

    "abstract": "Long school bus rides adversely affect student performance and well-being.\nRural school bus rides are particularly long, incentivizing parents to drive\ntheir children to school rather than to opt for the school bus. This in turn\nexacerbates the traffic congestion around schools, further compounding the\nproblem of long bus rides, creating a vicious cycle. It also results in\nunderutilized school buses and higher bus operating costs per rider. To address\nthese challenges, this paper focuses on the design of rural school bus routes\nand schedules, a particularly challenging problem due to its unique operational\ncomplexities, including mixed loading and irregular road networks. We formalize\na rural school bus routing and scheduling model that tackles these complexities\nwhile minimizing the total bus ride time of students. We develop an original\nroad network-aware cluster-then-route heuristic that leverages our problem\nformulation to produce high-quality solutions. For real-world case studies, our\napproach outperforms status quo solutions by reducing the bus ride times of\nstudents by 37-39 %. Our solutions also make the school bus more attractive,\nhelping address both the underutilization of school buses and the prevalence of\nprivate commutes. Our routing and scheduling approach can improve school bus\nuse by 17-19 % and reduce car trips that induce congestion near schools by\n12-17 %. Many rural school districts share the operational characteristics\nmodeled in this study, including long bus rides, high operational expenditures,\nmixed loading, and a high proportion of car-based school commutes, suggesting\nthe broad applicability of our approach. Ultimately, by reducing student travel\ntimes, increasing school bus utilization, and alleviating congestion near\nschools, our approach enables rural school district planners to address\ntransportation-related barriers to student performance and well-being.",

    "abstract": "A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient\nsynthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states\nfrom a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era\nand future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular\nQ-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state\nspace, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The\nframework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,\ndomain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with\ncustomizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures\nsuch as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse\nmatrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables\nscalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing\ncomputational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to\nseven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers\nminimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the\nframework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still\nproduces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and\nadaptability.

While monitoring tasks have\ntraditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made\nit possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated\nway. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space\n(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research\nof these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet\nbeen conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:\nPigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The\ndatasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn\nconditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad\nvisibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images\nimprove detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled\nimages alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art\nmodels offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time\nalternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods\nachieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.\nHowever, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they\ncould become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate\ncharacteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for\nfuture improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets\nperform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This\nhighlights the importance of high-quality training data.

    "abstract": "This paper presents Step-Audio 2, an end-to-end multi-modal large language\nmodel designed for industry-strength audio understanding and speech\nconversation. By integrating a latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric\nreinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate\ngenuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the\ngeneration of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly\nenhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking\nstyles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic\nknowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to\nmitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions\nof hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and\nexpressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results\ndemonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various\naudio understanding and conversational benchmarks compared to other open-source\nand commercial solutions.

To ensure number conservation in growth and mass\nconservation in aggregation and breakage, we design a DG scheme that applies\nstandard treatment for growth and nucleation, and introduces a novel\ndiscretization for aggregation and breakage. The birth and death terms are\ndiscretized in a symmetric double-integral form, evaluated using a common\nrefinement of the integration domain and carefully selected quadrature rules.\nBeyond conservation, we focus on preserving the positivity of the number\ndensity in aggregation-breakage. Since local mass corresponds to the first\nmoment, the classical Zhang-Shu limiter, which preserves the zeroth moment\n(cell average), is not directly applicable. We address this by proving the\npositivity of the first moment on each cell and constructing a\nmoment-conserving limiter that enforces nonnegativity across the domain. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to develop a positivity-preserving algorithm\nthat conserves a prescribed moment.

Mimicking the self-preservation strategies of some\nsessile organisms, CPDs adapt their morphology to the environment they grow in.\nEither studied as an electrochemical experiment or as neuromorphic devices, the\ndependence of CPDs' electrical properties on the chemical nature of their\nenvironment is still unreported, despite the inter-dependence between the\nelectrical properties of the electrogenerated material and the chemical\ncomposition of their growth medium. In this study, we report on the existing\nintrication between the nature and concentration of the electrolytes,\nelectroactive compounds and co-solvents and the electrical and the\nelectrochemical properties of CPDs in water. CPDs exhibit various chemical\nsensitivities in water: their morphology is highly dependent on the nature of\nthe chemical resources available in their environment.

Recent studies\nintegrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local\ndetails and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are\nlimited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any\ninteraction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer\nand Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing\nA2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a\nnew token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model\n(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an\nattention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of\ncross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the\nmulti-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a\ntwo-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of\nSSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and\nMamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks.

At a much\nlower $T_N$ ~ $A^2/T_Q$, virtual electronic fluctuations mediate an effective\nnuclear-spin Ising interaction, driving a second transition that collapses the\nremaining entropy. Under a transverse magnetic field, nuclear moments polarize\nsmoothly, replacing the sharp low-T transition by a crossover.

Existing approaches can\nbe broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its\nlimitations.

In $SO(10)$ GUTs, the\nscalar fields can arise from irreps contributing to the Yukawa sector at the\nrenormalisable level, such as $10_{\\mathrm{H}}$, $120_{\\mathrm{H}}$, and\n$\\overline{126}_{\\mathrm{H}}$, or from $16_{\\mathrm{H}}$ in non-renormalisable\ninteractions. The direct implications of these scalars include the violation of\nbaryon and lepton number, enabling processes such as nucleon decays,\nneutron-antineutron oscillation, and potentially accounting for the observed\nbaryon asymmetry of the universe. We systematically analyse their couplings to\nSM fermions, identifying diquark and leptoquark interactions vertices involving\nall scalars residing in $10_{\\mathrm{H}}$, $120_{\\mathrm{H}}$,\n$\\overline{126}_{\\mathrm{H}}$, and $16_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and comprehensively assess\ntheir contributions to nucleon decay, neutron-antineutron oscillation, quark\nflavour violation, and baryogenesis.

Conventional GUTs rely on multiple scalar irreps to avoid\nunrealistic fermion mass relations; for example, minimal $SU(5)$ with\n$5_{\\mathrm{H}}$ predicts degenerate down-quark and charged-lepton masses.

    "abstract": "A possibly time-dependent transition intensity matrix or generator $(Q(t))$\ncharacterizes the law of a Markov jump process (MP). For a time homogeneous MP,\nthe transition probability matrix (TPM) can be expressed as a matrix\nexponential of $Q$. However, when dealing with a time non-homogeneous MP, there\nis often no simple analytical form of the TPM in terms of $Q(t)$, unless they\nall commute. This poses a challenge because when a continuous MP is observed\nintermittently, a TPM is required to build a likelihood. In this paper, we show\nthat the estimation of the transition intensities of a two-state nonhomogeneous\nMarkov model can be carried out by augmenting the intermittent observations\nwith honest random times associated with two independent driving Poisson point\nprocesses, and that sampling the full path is not required. We propose a\npseudo-marginal McMC algorithm to estimate the transition rates using the\naugmented data. Finally, we illustrate our approach by simulating a continuous\nMP and by using observed (intermittent) time grids extracted from real clinical\nvisits data.",

It discusses network planning aimed\nat enabling positioning as a primary service, in contrast to the traditional\nfocus on communication services in terrestrial networks. Building on a network\ninfrastructure optimized for positioning, the paper proposes a system that\nleverages carrier phase (CP) ranging in combination with trilateration to\nlocalize the user within the network when at least three base stations (BSs)\nprovide line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Achieving accurate CP-based positioning\nrequires addressing three key challenges: integer ambiguity resolution,\nLOS/NLOS link identification, and localization under obstructed LOS conditions.\nTo this end, the system employs a multi-carrier CP approach, which eliminates\nthe need for explicit integer ambiguity estimation. Additionally, a deep\nlearning model is developed to identify NLOS links and exclude them from the\ntrilateration process. In cases where LOS is obstructed and CP ranging becomes\nunreliable, the system incorporates an error-state extended Kalman filter to\nfuse complementary data from other sensors, such as inertial measurement units\n(IMUs) and cameras. This hybrid approach enables robust tracking of moving\nusers across diverse channel conditions. The performance of the proposed\nterrestrial positioning system is evaluated using the real-world KITTI dataset,\nfeaturing a moving vehicle in an urban environment. Simulation results show\nthat the system can achieve a positioning error of less than 5 meters in the\nKITTI urban scenario--comparable to that of public commercial GNSS\nservices--highlighting its potential as a resilient and accurate solution for\nGNSS-denied environments.",

We find that the event rate\nalways exceeds the star formation rate (SFR) at lower redshift and matches with\neach other at higher redshift, which is independent of energy bands and\nconsistent with previous findings of other satellites. Furthermore, it is found\nthat sample completeness does not affect the deduced event rate too much as\nmentioned for the Swift lGRBs in Dong et al.. A triple power-law function has\nbeen used to fit the cumulative flux distribution and categorize the total\nsample into three subsamples of bright, medium and faint GRBs.

    "abstract": "Measurements of galaxy distributions at large cosmic distances capture\nclustering from the past. In this study, we use a cosmological model to\ntranslate these observations into the present-day galaxy distribution.\nSpecifically, we reconstruct the 3D matter power spectrum at redshift $ z = 0 $\nusing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 (DR1) galaxy\nclustering data and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, assuming\nthe $ \\Lambda \\text{CDM} $ model, and compare it to the result assuming the $\nw_0w_a \\text{CDM} $ model. Building on previous state-of-the-art methods, we\napply Effective Field Theory (EFT) modelling of the galaxy power spectrum to\naccount for small-scale effects in the 2-point statistics of galaxy data. The\nEFT approach offers a more robust methodology than traditional methods for\nmodelling the galaxy power spectrum from galaxy clustering data, which can be\nused to test the consistency of the assumed cosmological model. By\nincorporating both CMB and galaxy clustering data across a range of redshifts,\nwe can identify discrepancies between the datasets, which would indicate\npotential inaccuracies in the assumed expansion history.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models have been recently exploited as judges for complex\nnatural language processing tasks, such as Q&A. The basic idea is to delegate\nto an LLM the assessment of the \"quality\" of the output provided by an\nautomated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only\ntell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be\ntoo expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can\nalso unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a\nsolution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what\nis the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of\nLLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code\nsummarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First,\nquantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code\nsummarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as\nBLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second,\neven state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances\nof these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced\nsolutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check\nwhether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and\n1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. For\ncode summarization, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by\nnine humans for ~1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions. Our\nfindings show that GPT-4-turbo is the best LLM in terms of judging capabilities\nfor both tasks, with \"smaller\" LLMs featuring tens of billions parameters not\nbeing able to cope with judging tasks. However, even the best-performing LLM\nfrequently misjudges the correctness of the code and summary quality.",

    "abstract": "Sharing methods of attack and their effectiveness is a cornerstone of\nbuilding robust defensive systems. Threat analysis reports, produced by various\nindividuals and organizations, play a critical role in supporting security\noperations and combating emerging threats. To enhance the timeliness and\nautomation of threat intelligence sharing, several standards have been\nestablished, with the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) framework\nemerging as one of the most widely adopted. However, generating STIX-compatible\ndata from unstructured security text remains a largely manual, expert-driven\nprocess. To address this challenge, we introduce AZERG, a tool designed to\nassist security analysts in automatically generating structured STIX\nrepresentations. To achieve this, we adapt general-purpose large language\nmodels for the specific task of extracting STIX-formatted threat data. To\nmanage the complexity, the task is divided into four subtasks: entity detection\n(T1), entity type identification (T2), related pair detection (T3), and\nrelationship type identification (T4). We apply task-specific fine-tuning to\naccurately extract relevant entities and infer their relationships in\naccordance with the STIX specification. To address the lack of training data,\nwe compiled a comprehensive dataset with 4,011 entities and 2,075 relationships\nextracted from 141 full threat analysis reports, all annotated in alignment\nwith the STIX standard. Our models achieved F1-scores of 84.43% for T1, 88.49%\nfor T2, 95.47% for T3, and 84.60% for T4 in real-world scenarios. We validated\ntheir performance against a range of open- and closed-parameter models, as well\nas state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improvements of 2-25% across tasks.",

    "abstract": "A quasi-hereditary algebra is an algebra equipped with a certain partial\norder $\\unlhd$ on its simple modules. Such a partial order -- called a\nquasi-hereditary structure -- gives rise to a characteristic tilting module\n$T_{\\unlhd}$ by a classical result due to Ringel. A fundamental question is to\ndetermine which tilting modules can be realised as characteristic tilting\nmodules. We answer this question by using the notion of IS-tilting module,\nwhich is a pair $(T,\\unlhd)$ of a tilting module $T$ and a partial order\n$\\unlhd$ on its direct summands such that iterative idempotent truncation along\n$\\unlhd$ always reveals a simple direct summand. Specifically, we show that a\ntilting module $T$ is characteristic if, and only if, there is some $\\unlhd$ so\nthat $(T,\\unlhd)$ is IS-tilting; in which case, we have $T=T_{\\unlhd}$. This\nresult enables us to study quasi-hereditary structures using tilting theory.\n  As an application of the above result, we show that, for an algebra $A$, all\ntilting modules are characteristic if, and only if, $A$ is a quadratic linear\nNakayama algebra. Furthermore, for such an $A$, we provide a decomposition of\nthe set of its tilting modules that can be used to derive a recursive formula\nfor enumerating its quasi-hereditary structures. Finally, we describe the\nquasi-hereditary structures of $A$ via `nodal gluing' and binary tree\nsequences.",

Nevertheless,\nrealising the full potential of TMDs in electronic and optoelectronic devices,\nsuch as transistors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and photodetectors, is\ncon-strained by high contact resistance. This limitation arises from their low\nintrinsic carrier concen-trations and the current insufficiency of doping\nstrategies for atomically thin materials. Notably, chemical treatment with\n1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) has been demonstrated as an effective post-growth\nmethod to enhance the n-type electrical conductivity of TMDs. Despite the\nwell-documented electrical improvements post-DCE treatment, its effects on\noptical properties, specifically the retention of optical characteristics and\nexcitonic behaviour, are not yet clearly under-stood. Here, we systematically\ninvestigate the layer- and time-dependent optical effects of DCE on molybdenum\ndisulfide (MoS2) using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) simulations. Our PL results reveal a rapid reduction in\nthe indirect bandgap transition, with the direct transition remaining\nunaffected. DFT confirms that chlorine (Cl) atoms bind to sulphur vacancies,\ncreating mid-gap states that facilitate non-radiative recom-bination,\nexplaining the observed indirect PL suppression. This work demonstrates DCE's\nutility not only for n-type doping but also for optical band structure\nengineering in MoS2 by selec-tively suppressing indirect transitions,\npotentially opening new avenues for 2D optoelectronic device design.",

This paper examines how ethanol (C2H6O)\nand methanol (CH4O) additives influence formation pathways of NOx using ReaxFF\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations at temperatures of 2,000 K and 3,000 K. Ten\ncarefully designed fuel mixtures (C1-C10) were evaluated across 0%, 5%, and 10%\nalcohol concentrations. The findings show that adding alcohol can effectively\nsuppress NOx production, especially at elevated temperatures. At 3,000 K, 10%\nethanol addition and 10% methanol addition reduced the production of NOx by\napproximately 39.6% and 30.1%, respectively, compared with the base fuel. This\nsuppression is attributed to the charge redistribution and the redirection of\nnitrogen intermediates through stabilising pathways such as HNO, HNO2, and N2O.\nSimulation-derived descriptors served as the training data for machine learning\n(ML) models, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector\nRegression (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and Fully Connected\nNeural Networks (FCNN). RFR achieved superior performance compared with other\nmodels with an R2 of 0.993 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.661.

    "abstract": "Silicon offers great promise as a potential anode active material and the\noptimum alternative to lithium metal in all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries.\nHowever, its practical application is limited by severe volume expansion\n(~300%) during lithiation, leading to cracking upon delithiation. In this\nstudy, we investigated the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline\nsilicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment using cryogenic\nscanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) during electrochemical\ncycling. A controlled workflow prevents ambient exposure, and cryo-TEM ensures\nstructural integrity. After the first lithiation, the electrode shows a\nheterogeneous mix of crystalline Li15Si4, various amorphous LixSi phases, and\nresidual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure becomes\npredominantly amorphous with thread-like features and minimal remaining\ncrystallinity. By the 10th delithiation, the microstructure is more uniform,\nwith thread-like regions mainly at grain boundaries. Our results reveal that\nstarting from a crystalline phase, a stationary microstructure emerges in bulk\nsilicon only after several cycles. Thus, to have a more controlled behavior of\nthe electrode and minimize cracking, the starting material should be carefully\nchosen along with an optimized electrode architecture to help stabilize the\nmicrostructure throughout cycling.",

We\nfind that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature,\n$\\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer\nquantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature.\nMoreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\\kappa_{xy}/T$ is\nconsistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana\nfermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the\nadditional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\\Gamma$ and\n$\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we\nshow that positive $\\Gamma$ and negative $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ lead to a remarkable\nenhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with\nthe classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\\Gamma$ term go\nbeyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation\neffects, while those of the $\\Gamma^\\prime$ term are well captured at the\nclassical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced\nthermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from\ntopological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the\ncritical field.

Combining advanced computer\nalgorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the\nreliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale\nand RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly\nregarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in\nHSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict\nconstraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the\nshift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough\nsoftware/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks\nefficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to\ninference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant\ncomputational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the\nintensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked,\nmust be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task\ncommunication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC.

A spectrum completion technique is also\nimplemented to complete the spectrum and solve the corresponding inverse\nproblem when eigenvalue data is limited.

Infrared observations have recently shown that large PAHs\npresent in UV-illuminated regions are strongly enriched in deuterium. In order\nto shed light on the origin of PAHs in cold clouds, we have searched for\ndeuterated benzonitrile in the cold dark cloud TMC-1. To that purpose we have\nsynthesized the three isomers (ortho, meta, and para) of monodeuterated\nbenzonitrile, measured their rotational spectra across the 2-18 GHz and 75-110\nGHz frequency ranges in the laboratory, and searched for them in TMC-1 using\ndata from the QUIJOTE line survey. We did not detect any of the three species\nand have derived a 3sigma upper limit on the column density of each of them of\n3.0e10 cm-2, meaning a fractional abundance relative to H2 of <3e-12. We\nderived a D/H ratio (which we define as the total number of D atoms with\nrespect to the total number of H atoms present in benzonitrile) of <1.2 %. This\nvalue is in line with the range of D/H ratios observed for other molecules in\nTMC-1 (0.06-3.3 %), where deuterium enrichment is explained in terms of\nisotopic fractionation at low temperature. It is however below the range of D/H\nratios derived for large unspecific PAHs from JWST observations of the galactic\nPDRs Orion Bar and M17 and the galaxies M51 and NGC3256-S (between 1% and\n<17%). Although it is not straightforward to compare the deuteration of PAHs in\ndark and UV-irradiated clouds, our results suggest that the population of PAHs\ndetected in cold dark clouds does not result from the fragmentation of larger\nPAHs inherited from the previous diffuse stage in a top-down scenario.",

Typical RIS implementations include\nmetasurfaces with passive unit elements capable to reflect their incident waves\nin controllable ways. However, this solely reflective operation induces\nsignificant challenges in the RIS orchestration from the wireless network. For\nexample, channel estimation, which is essential for coherent RIS-empowered\nwireless communications, is quite challenging with the available solely\nreflecting RIS designs. This chapter reviews the emerging concept of Hybrid\nReflecting and Sensing RISs (HRISs), which enables metasurfaces to reflect the\nimpinging signal in a controllable manner, while simultaneously sensing a\nportion of it. The sensing capability of HRISs facilitates various network\nmanagement functionalities, including channel parameter estimation and\nlocalization, while, most importantly, giving rise to computationally\nautonomous and self-configuring RISs. The implementation details of HRISs are\nfirst presented, which are then followed by a convenient mathematical model for\ncharacterizing their dual functionality. Then, two indicative applications of\nHRISs are discussed, one for simultaneous communications and sensing and\nanother that showcases their usefulness for estimating the individual channels\nin the uplink of a multi-user HRIS-empowered communication system.

    "abstract": "While superiority of quantum over classical computation has been established,\nthe repertoire of primitives with proven or conjectured quantum advantage\nremains limited. Despite considerable progress in delineating the\nquantumclassical divide, the systematic construction of algorithms with quantum\nadvantage remains challenging, which can be attributed to a still incomplete\nunderstanding of the sources of quantum computational power. While intermediate\nnon-stabiliserness (i.e., traversal of states outside the Clifford orbit)\nindicates necessary non-classical behaviour for quantum advantage, naively\nequating non-stabiliserness and non-classicality is misguided: Even random Haar\nsampled states exhibit near-maximal non-stabiliserness. Advancing towards\nquantum advantage calls for a better understanding of the efficient use of\nnon-stabiliser states. We present an approach to track the behaviour of\nnon-stabiliserness across various algorithms by pairing resource theory of\nnon-stabiliser entropies with the geometry of quantum state evolution, and\nintroduce permutation agnostic distance measures that reveal non-stabiliser\neffects previously hidden by a subset of Clifford operations. We find different\nefficiency in the use of non-stabiliserness for structured and unstructured\nvariational approaches, and show that greater freedom for classical\noptimisation in quantum-classical methods increases unnecessary non-stabiliser\nconsumption.

We address\nthis through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.\nFirst, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,\nconsisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across\nthe U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene\nprovides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic\nsegmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain\ndiversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored\nframework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent\ndiffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)\nDual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D\nGaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the\ncostly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving\ncritical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models\ntrained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model\nlatent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely\nlarge-scale generation. The framework further supports versatile applications,\nfrom semantic-guided urban layout generation to unconditional terrain\nsynthesis, while maintaining geographic plausibility through our rich data\npriors from Aerial-Earth3D.

Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment\nenvironment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk\nManagement Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks\nin seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and\nmanipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\\&D, strategic deception and\nscheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the \"AI-$45^\\circ$ Law,\"\nwe evaluate these risks using \"red lines\" (intolerable thresholds) and \"yellow\nlines\" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk\nfor routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring\nstrengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating\nsuspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that\nall recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without\ncrossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for\ncyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\\&D risks. For self-replication, and\nstrategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except\nfor certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and\nmanipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective\ninfluence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule\nout the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although\ndetailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further\nclaims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and\nurges collective action to mitigate these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) has significantly\nreduced the cost of exploring architectural spaces with discrete design\nchoices, such as selecting operations within a model. However, the field faces\ntwo major challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily\nrely on the DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available\nbenchmarks. This overreliance has led to saturation, with reported improvements\noften falling within the margin of noise. Second, implementations of\ngradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented across disparate\nrepositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and further\ndevelopment. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt), an\nextensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of\ngradient-based one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes\nit easy for users to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the\ndecomposition of NAS optimizers into their core components. We use this\nframework to create a suite of new DARTS-based benchmarks, and combine them\nwith a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical flaw in how\ngradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed.

    "abstract": "Quantum state tomography is a technique in quantum information science used\nto reconstruct the density matrix of an unknown quantum state, providing\ncomplete information about the quantum state. It is of significant importance\nin fields such as quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum\nsimulation. However, as the size of the quantum system increases, the number of\nmeasurement settings and sampling requirements for quantum state tomography\ngrow exponentially with the number of qubits. This not only makes experimental\ndesign and implementation more complex, but also exacerbates the consumption of\nexperimental resources. These limitations severely hinder the application of\nstate tomography in large-scale quantum systems. To reduce measurement settings\nand improve sampling efficiency, this study proposes a state tomography method\nbased on auxiliary systems. This method can be implemented through either\nentanglement between the quantum system to be measured and a quantum auxiliary\nsystem or through correlation between the quantum system and a probabilistic\nclassical auxiliary system. Measurements on the entire joint system enable more\nefficient extraction of information about the quantum state to be measured.\nThis method relies on standard quantum gate operations and requires only two\nmeasurement settings, with a total sampling complexity of $O(d^2)$,\nsignificantly simplifying experimental operations and measurement processes.\nAdditionally, this study provides two schemes for measuring purity based on the\nproposed circuit, one of which achieves measurement precision at the Heisenberg\nlimit.

We show that the rate\nat which the posterior on model space concentrates on the true underlying DAG\ndepends critically on its nature: If it is maximal, in the sense that adding\nany one new edge would violate acyclicity, then its posterior probability\nconverges to 1 exponentially fast (almost surely) in the sample size $n$.\nOtherwise, it converges at a rate no faster than $1/\\sqrt{n}$.

Numerical studies\ntypically rely on two main approaches: Dynamics of linear-response functions in\nclosed systems and Markovian dynamics governed by master equations for\nboundary-driven open systems. While the equivalence of their dynamical behavior\nhas been explored in recent studies, a systematic comparison of the transport\ncoefficients obtained from these two classes of methods remains an open\nquestion. Here, we address this gap by comparing and contrasting the dc\ndiffusion constant $\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{dc}}$ computed from the aforementioned\ntwo approaches. We find a clear mismatch between the two, with\n$\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{dc}}$ exhibiting a strong dependence on the system-bath\ncoupling for the boundary-driven technique, highlighting fundamental\nlimitations of such a method in calculating the transport coefficients related\nto asymptotic dynamical behavior of the system. We trace the origin of this\nmismatch to the incorrect order of limits of time $t \\rightarrow \\infty$ and\nsystem size $L\\rightarrow \\infty$, which we argue to be intrinsic to\nboundary-driven setups. As a practical resolution, we advocate computing only\ntime-dependent transport coefficients within the boundary-driven framework,\nwhich show excellent agreement with those obtained from the Kubo formalism\nbased on closed-system dynamics, up to a timescale set by the system size. This\nleads us to interpret the sensitivity of the dc diffusion constant on the\nsystem-bath coupling strength in an open system as a potential diagnostic for\nfinite-size effects.",

If such scalars couple quadratically to particles of the Standard\nModel the scalar acquires an effective mass which depends on the local matter\nenergy density. The changing mass causes the field to deviate from its\ncosmological value in experimental environments. In this work we show that the\npresence of a local over-density enclosing the experiment, for example a\ncavity, vacuum chamber, or satellite can strongly suppress the value of the\nscalar and its gradient in the interior. This makes detection of such scalar\ndark matter challenging, and significantly relaxes constraints on strongly\ncoupled models.

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's\noperational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles,\ni.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum\nStirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the\nthermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat\nengine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other\ngraphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer\ngraphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal\nthat MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while\nachieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though\nthe performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and\nQSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we\nidentify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict\nadiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.",

However, most existing 3D\nmultimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or\nsegmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their\nspatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent\nin 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D\nMLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language\ntasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM\nintegrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that\nprogressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands,\ngenerating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts.\nFurthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and\n3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate\nthe model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range\nof 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our\nprogressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial\ninformation.

Agents exchange only output information with their\nneighbors over a directed communication graph, without requiring full state\nmeasurements or symmetric communication. Achieving fixed time consensus, where\nconvergence occurs within a pre-specified time bound that is independent of\ninitial conditions is faced with significant challenges due to the presence of\nunknown nonlinearities, inter-agent couplings, and external disturbances. This\nwork addresses these challenges by integrating actor critic reinforcement\nlearning with a novel fixed time adaptation mechanism. Each agent employs an\nactor critic architecture supported by two estimator networks designed to\nhandle system uncertainties and unknown perturbations. The adaptation laws are\ndeveloped to ensure that all agents track the leader within a fixed time\nregardless of their initial conditions. The consensus and tracking errors are\nguaranteed to converge to a small neighborhood of the origin, with the\nconvergence radius adjustable through control parameters. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight its\nadvantages over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence speed and\nrobustness.",

However, further enhancing existing MLLMs\nnecessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task\ncomplexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent\nself-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible\nsolution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods\naugment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data\ncomplexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual\ndescriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,\nleading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched\ndifficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,\nclosed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data\nand model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,\nC2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model\nevolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex\nmultimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with\niteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively\nselects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to\nconduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.\nConsequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and\nconsistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks.

However, conventional\nRISs are fundamentally limited by the double path loss effect, which severely\nattenuates the reflected signals. To overcome this, active RIS architectures,\ncapable of amplifying impinging signals, have been proposed. This chapter\ninvestigates the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of active\nRISs, focusing on two hardware designs: a dual-RIS structure with a single\nPower Amplifier (PA), and a reflection amplification structure at the unit cell\nlevel using tunnel diodes. For the PA-based design, a comprehensive\nmathematical model is developed, and closed-form expressions for the received\nsignal-to-noise ratio, bit error probability, and Energy Efficiency (EE) are\nderived. An optimization framework for configuring the phase shifts and\namplifier gain is proposed to maximize system capacity under power constraints.\nRegarding the second design, the integration of a tunnel diode into the unit\ncell is carefully studied by analyzing its I-V characteristic, enabling the\nderivation of the negative resistance range and the power consumption model.\nFurthermore, the intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling of the reflection\ncoefficient is characterized through compact linear algebra formulations,\nenabling practical optimization of active RISs. Extensive numerical simulations\nvalidate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that active RISs can\neffectively overcome the double path loss limitation and achieve favorable EE\ntrade-offs compared to passive RISs.

    "abstract": "Topology optimization has emerged as a powerful and increasingly relevant\nstrategy for enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of power system\noperations. However, solving these problems is computationally demanding due to\ntheir combinatorial nature and the use of big-M formulations.\nOptimization-based bound tightening (OBBT) is a well-known strategy to improve\nthe solution of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) by computing tighter\nbounds for continuous variables. Yet, existing OBBT approaches in topology\noptimization typically relax all switching decisions in the bounding\nsubproblems, leading to excessively loose feasible regions and limited bound\nimprovements. In this work, we propose a topology-aware bound tightening method\nthat uses network structure to determine which switching variables to relax.\nThrough extensive computational experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system, we find\nthat keeping a small subset of switching variables as binary, while relaxing\nthe rest, strikes a sweet spot between the computational effort required to\nsolve the bounding problems and the tightness of the resulting bounds.",

    "abstract": "Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief\nelectrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets\nsuch as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in\nconnected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as\ncontrollers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events\ndirectly as the control inputs, also called `impulse control', is challenging\nas it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical\ntractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering\nthe spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking\nneural networks (SNNs) have to output a continuous control signal,\nnecessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we\ncircumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method\nfor task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we\ntake inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define\na spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system\ncloser to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity\nfor an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show\nthat for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and\nthe control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream\nsystem to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to\nboth high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we\nmaintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the\nnetwork dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the\nunderstanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight\ninto how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in\nneuromorphic hardware design.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a natural language processing task\nwhich has the objective of categorising text documents into a set of classes\nfrom a predefined structured class hierarchy. Recent HTC approaches use various\ntechniques to incorporate the hierarchical class structure information with the\nnatural language understanding capabilities of pre-trained language models\n(PLMs) to improve classification performance. Furthermore, using topic models\nalong with PLMs to extract features from text documents has been shown to be an\neffective approach for multi-label text classification tasks. The rationale\nbehind the combination of these feature extractor models is that the PLM\ncaptures the finer-grained contextual and semantic information while the topic\nmodel obtains high-level representations which consider the corpus of documents\nas a whole. In this paper, we use a HTC approach which uses a PLM and a topic\nmodel to extract features from text documents which are used to train a\nclassification model. Our objective is to determine whether the combination of\nthe features extracted from the two models is beneficial to HTC performance in\ngeneral. In our approach, the extracted features are passed through separate\nconvolutional layers whose outputs are combined and passed to a label-wise\nattention mechanisms which obtains label-specific document representations by\nweighing the most important features for each class separately. We perform\ncomprehensive experiments on three HTC benchmark datasets and show that using\nthe features extracted from the topic model generally decreases classification\nperformance compared to only using the features obtained by the PLM. In\ncontrast to previous work, this shows that the incorporation of features\nextracted from topic models for text classification tasks should not be assumed\nbeneficial.",

Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable\nalternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of\nsample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and\npredictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the\nsafety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nintroduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages\nphysical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining B\\'ezier\ncurves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive\nsimulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our\napproach over existing alternatives.",

In an online study, 112\nparticipants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos\nfrom a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The\nexperimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise\non human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM\nreflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more\npronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human\ncondition.

While existing research has explored strategic bidding in a single\nmarket with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, arbitrage\nopportunities across local markets remain unexplored. This paper introduces a\nhierarchical MARL (HMARL) algorithm designed to enable aggregator arbitrage\nacross multiple local markets. The strategic behavior of these aggregators in\nlocal markets is modeled as a two-stage Markov game: the first stage involves\nthe LEM, while the second stage encompasses both the LFM and the balancing\nmarket. To solve this two-stage Markov game, the HMARL framework assigns two\nsub-agents to each aggregator, a primary sub-agent and a secondary sub-agent.\nWithout the arbitrage strategy, these sub-agents operate in silos, with the\nprimary sub-agent focusing on first-stage profits and the secondary sub-agent\non second-stage profits, each employing independent MARLs. On the contrary,\nwhen implementing the arbitrage strategy with the proposed HMARL, the\nsub-agents communicate and coordinate to perform arbitrage across multiple\nlocal markets, enhancing overall efficiency. The case study, conducted under a\nscenario where all aggregators employ the arbitrage strategy, shows that\ndespite higher initial costs in the LEM, this strategy generates substantial\nsavings in the LFM and the balancing market, resulting in a total profit\nincrease of $40.6\\%$ on average. This highlights the capability of the proposed\nHMARL to address the two-stage Markov game and facilitate arbitrage across\nlocal markets, thereby enhancing profitability for participants.",

Traditional automated\ntranslation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which\noften lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models\npresent promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based\nimplementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this\npaper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative\nframework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling\nin-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's\nautomated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,\nnarrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of\nclosed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation\nmodule, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code\nsamples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.\nACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a\ncomprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its\ncontroller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting\nhyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based\non real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to\ncontinue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the\nprocess.

To provide a rigorous foundation for using these\noptions as an abstract reasoning space, we extend the theory of continuous MDP\nhomomorphisms. This proves that learning a policy in the simplified, abstract\nlatent space, for which VMOC is suited, preserves the optimality of the\nsolution to the original, complex problem. Finally, we propose a cold-start\nprocedure that leverages supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to distill human\nreasoning demonstrations into this latent option space, providing a rich\ninitialization for the model's reasoning capabilities.

To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,\napproaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize\nrestoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)\ndeep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve\nambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration\nvia a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder.

Both the components are assumed to be distributed throughout\nthe star.

By combining these into a single effective EOS, we reduce\nthe two-fluid system to an equivalent one-fluid model and numerically solve the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to obtain the mass-radius (M-R)\nrelationship of the hybrid configuration. We systematically analyze how the\nstellar structure is modified by varying dark matter fractions, the mass of the\ndark matter particle and the self-repulsion coupling strength. Our results\nreveal distinct modifications to the M-R profiles and apparent phase behavior\nof the quark matter suggesting observable signatures that could offer insights\ninto the properties of dark matter in extreme astrophysical environments.

The system generates a\nset of contextually expressive, image-driven design alternatives that achieve\ncoherent alignments across visual, semantic, and data dimensions. Users can\nexplore these alternatives, select preferred mappings, and further refine the\ndesign through interactive adjustments and animated transitions to support\nexpressive data communication.

Friction between neutrals and charges is expected to contribute to\nplasma heating in a partially ionised plasma (PIP). Aims: We aim to study the\nefficiency of the frictional heating mechanism in partially ionised plasmas by\ncomparing a single-fluid model (1F) using ambipolar diffusion and a two-fluid\nmodel (2F) that incorporates elastic collision terms. Methods: We use the code\nMANCHA-2F to solve the equations for both models numerically. The simulations\ninvolve the vertical propagation of fast magneto-acoustic waves from the top of\nthe photosphere through the chromosphere. The model atmosphere is vertically\nstratified, including a horizontal, homogeneous magnetic field. We also apply\nthe linear theory to supplement the numerical results. Finally, we look at the\nassumptions of the 1F model to find out what causes the model discrepancies.\nResults: The results show that the temperature increase for the 1F model is\nslightly higher than for the 2F model, especially with long-period waves. The\nwave energy flux indicates that in the 2F model, the wave is transporting less\nenergy upwards. From the linear theory, we find that the wave in the 2F model\nloses more energy than in the 1F model in the deep layers, but the opposite\noccurs in the high layers. Conclusions: The efficient dissipation in the 2F\nmodel in deep layers reduces the energy flux at the high layers, reducing\nheating and explaining the temperature differences between models. We attribute\nthose discrepancies to the contribution of pressure forces to the drift\nvelocity and the omission of a term related to the centre of mass frame\nreference in the 1F energy equation.}",

Furthermore, the\nresulting schedules are not always robust.\n  In this paper, we integrate inductive and deductive techniques for solving\nthese issues. We first employ machine learning algorithms to predict the\nsurgery duration, from historical data, to compute provisional schedules. Then,\nwe consider the confidence of such predictions as an additional input to our\nproblem and update the encoding correspondingly in order to compute more robust\nschedules.

Small-scale magnetic field concentrations on the\nsurfaces of the host star affect the visibility of stellar limb regions, making\nthem brighter relative to the non-magnetic case.

Our results show that ingress-egress depth differences can reach up\nto 600 ppm for a 10000 ppm transit at 600 nm, depending on the magnetization of\nthe stellar limbs--significantly interfering with planetary signals.\nObservations of the Sun show that such concentrations are often not accompanied\nby spots and do not manifest in photometric variability, indicating that even\nphotometrically quiet stars can produce such asymmetries.

These systems often rely on Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more\nefficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting\nagents are trained independently-without shared context or joint\noptimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead\nto semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of\ntraditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in\nMultiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical\nand semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of\nReconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is\nimplemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at\nthe transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a\npost-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a\nconstrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two\nsolutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear\nDNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under\nsemantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power\nconstraints.

In situ measurements can\noccasionally shed some light on these mechanisms, but they are limited in space\nand time. Sophisticated numerical modelling offers the best approach to improve\nour understanding of the physical processes involved. This research examines\ntype IV radio bursts, exploring the effects of various electron distribution\nproperties and CMEs on their generation and characteristics. To transcend\nidealised assumptions, we employ realistic, anisotropic electron distributions\n- obtained from particle transport simulations within complex\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) environments - as input for radio emission models.

Electrons injected close to the MFR's central axis remain largely\nconfined, producing a GS emission spectrum resembling observed type IV\ncharacteristics. Varying observer positions, CME properties, and spectral\nindices of the electron energy distributions modify the intensities and\ndurations of the observed bursts.

Stokes polarimeters for measuring the polarization of\nlight are a powerful tool with a wide range of applications both in classical\nand quantum science. Generalizing Stokes polarimetry to other spinor degrees of\nfreedom is thus a challenge of prime importance.

These\nfield-theoretic Poisson brackets can be derived from canonical phase-space\nbrackets defined on Lagrangian variables $(x_i, p_j)$, mapped to Eulerian\nfields $(\\rho, v^i)$. We extend this framework to curved spacetime by\nconstructing a relativistic version of the Eulerian Poisson algebra and\nproposing a corresponding Hamiltonian.

    "abstract": "Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for\nseamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,\ncontinues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or\ntrains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent\npresence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable\nconnectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite\nbeams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address\nchallenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can\nanalyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific\nlocations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before\nconnectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of\ncommunication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over\nmultiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model\nachieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of\nmachine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling\nseamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite\nconstellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time\npredictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate\nsatellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication\nefficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object\nwith satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected\nvehicles and trains.",

To address this,\nwe propose a hybrid AL framework, termed \\textbf{PromptAL} (Sample-Aware\nDynamic Soft \\textbf{Prompts} for Few-Shot \\textbf{A}ctive \\textbf{L}earning).\nThis framework accounts for the contribution of each unlabeled data point in\naligning the current empirical distribution with the target distribution,\nthereby optimizing the decision boundary. Specifically, PromptAL first\nleverages unlabeled data to construct sample-aware dynamic soft prompts that\nadjust the model's predictive distribution and decision boundary. Subsequently,\nbased on the adjusted decision boundary, it integrates uncertainty estimation\nwith both global and local diversity to select high-quality samples that more\naccurately represent the target distribution. Experimental results on six\nin-domain and three out-of-domain datasets show that PromptAL achieves superior\nperformance over nine baselines. Our codebase is openly accessible.",

The\nmethodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing\nthe limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the\nnonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The\ndataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,\nwas curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of\nnon-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive\nsuite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based\nregressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient\nBoosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple\nmetrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared\nerror (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as\nthe final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive\nexPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and\ninteraction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To\nfacilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,\nPython-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as\nstructural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or\nthrough CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity\nwithout the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel\nstorage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can\nenhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform\ndecision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure\nmode",

Although numerous endeavors have been\ndedicated to this pursuit, most of them neglect the likelihood context in which\nthe prior is embedded, thereby considering all priors as \"beneficial\". In the\nlimited studies of addressing harmful priors, specifying a baseline prior\nremains an indispensable step. In this paper, by means of the elegant bridge\nbetween the p-value and the posterior probability of the null hypothesis, we\npropose a new ESS estimation method based on p-value in the framework of\nhypothesis testing, expanding the scope of existing ESS estimation methods in\nthree key aspects:\n  (i) We address the specific likelihood context of the prior, enabling the\npossibility of negative ESS values in case of prior-likelihood disconcordance;\n  (ii) By leveraging the well-established bridge between the frequentist and\nBayesian configurations under noninformative priors, there is no need to\nspecify a baseline prior which incurs another criticism of subjectivity;\n  (iii) By incorporating ESS into the hypothesis testing framework, our\n$p$-value ESS estimation method transcends the conventional one-ESS-one-prior\nparadigm and accommodates one-ESS-multiple-priors paradigm, where the sole ESS\nmay reflect the collaborative impact of multiple priors in diverse contexts.\n  Through comprehensive simulation analyses, we demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the p-value ESS estimation method in comparison with existing\napproaches.

To bridge the conceptual gap between well-studied DV\nentanglement percolation theories and their CV counterpart, we introduce a\nGaussian-to-Gaussian entanglement distribution scheme that deterministically\ntransports two-mode squeezed vacuum states across large CV networks. Analysis\nof the scheme's collective behavior using statistical-physics methods reveals a\nnew form of entanglement percolation--negativity percolation theory\n(NegPT)--characterized by a bounded entanglement measure called the ratio\nnegativity.

This distinctive behavior places CV-based\nQNs in a new universality class, fundamentally distinct from DV systems.\nAdditionally, the abruptness of this transition introduces a critical\nvulnerability of CV-based QNs: conventional feedback mechanism becomes\ninherently unstable near the threshold, highlighting practical implications for\nstabilizing large-scale CV-based QNs.

Our final dataset is comprised of two\nsubsets: Subset-I, which consists of group terms related to gender identity,\nand Subset-II, where group terms are replaced with proper names. We evaluate\nseveral LLMs used for German NLP on this newly created dataset and report the\naccuracy and bias scores. The results show that all models exhibit bias, both\nalong and against existing social stereotypes.",

However, prior studies have shown that LLMs\nare highly sensitive to prompt perturbations. Minor modifications in wording,\nsyntax, or formatting can significantly reduce the functional correctness of\ngenerated code. As perturbations frequently occur in real-world scenarios,\nimproving the robustness of LLMs to prompt perturbations is essential for\nensuring reliable performance in practical code generation. In this paper, we\nintroduce CREME (Code Robustness Enhancement via Model Editing), a novel\napproach that enhances LLM robustness through targeted parameter updates. CREME\nfirst identifies robustness-sensitive layers by comparing hidden states between\nan original prompt and its perturbed variant. Then, it performs lightweight\nparameter editing at the identified layer to reduce performance degradation. We\nevaluate CREME on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and\nMBPP) along with their perturbed counterparts. Experimental results show that\nCREME improves Pass@1 accuracy by 63% on perturbed prompts while maintaining\nstable performance on clean inputs, with accuracy deviations within 1%. Further\nanalysis reveals that robustness-sensitive layers are primarily concentrated in\nthe middle and deeper layers of the network, and their locations vary across\ndifferent model architectures. These insights provide a valuable foundation for\ndeveloping future robustness-oriented editing strategies.",

    "abstract": "High-quality speech generation for low-resource languages, such as many\nIndian languages, remains a significant challenge due to limited data and\ndiverse linguistic structures. Duration prediction is a critical component in\nmany speech generation pipelines, playing a key role in modeling prosody and\nspeech rhythm. While some recent generative approaches choose to omit explicit\nduration modeling, often at the cost of longer training times. We retain and\nexplore this module to better understand its impact in the linguistically rich\nand data-scarce landscape of India. We train a non-autoregressive Continuous\nNormalizing Flow (CNF) based speech model using publicly available Indian\nlanguage data and evaluate multiple duration prediction strategies for\nzero-shot, speaker-specific generation. Our comparative analysis on\nspeech-infilling tasks reveals nuanced trade-offs: infilling based predictors\nimprove intelligibility in some languages, while speaker-prompted predictors\nbetter preserve speaker characteristics in others. These findings inform the\ndesign and selection of duration strategies tailored to specific languages and\ntasks, underscoring the continued value of interpretable components like\nduration prediction in adapting advanced generative architectures to\nlow-resource, multilingual settings.",

    "abstract": "Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in\nthe last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations\n(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against\nthe system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised\nsubject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial\ntransactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation\nattacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)\napproaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection\nperformances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown\npresentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during\ntraining), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,\nthis paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the\neffectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and\nchallenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective\nframework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are\nable to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the\nmore advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training\nsets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing\nfoundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art\nobserved with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which\ncontains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks",

Privacy-preserving ML\n(PPML) based on cryptographic primitives has emerged as a promising solution in\nwhich an ML model is directly computed on the encrypted data to provide a\nformal privacy guarantee. However, PPML frameworks heavily rely on the\noblivious transfer (OT) primitive to compute nonlinear functions. OT mainly\ninvolves the computation of single-point correlated OT (SPCOT) and learning\nparity with noise (LPN) operations. As OT is still computed extensively on\ngeneral-purpose CPUs, it becomes the latency bottleneck of modern PPML\nframeworks.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel OT accelerator, dubbed Ironman, to\nsignificantly increase the efficiency of OT and the overall PPML framework. We\nobserve that SPCOT is computation-bounded, and thus propose a hardware-friendly\nSPCOT algorithm with a customized accelerator to improve SPCOT computation\nthroughput. In contrast, LPN is memory-bandwidth-bounded due to irregular\nmemory access patterns. Hence, we further leverage the near-memory processing\n(NMP) architecture equipped with memory-side cache and index sorting to improve\neffective memory bandwidth. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate Ironman\nachieves a 39.2-237.4 times improvement in OT throughput across different NMP\nconfigurations compared to the full-thread CPU implementation. For different\nPPML frameworks, Ironman demonstrates a 2.1-3.4 times reduction in end-to-end\nlatency for both CNN and Transformer models.",

As DAS\nbecomes a key technology for real-time, high-density, and long-range monitoring\nin fields such as geophysics, infrastructure surveillance, and environmental\nsensing, the volume of collected data is rapidly increasing. Large-scale DAS\ndeployments already generate hundreds of terabytes and are expected to increase\nin the coming years, making long-term storage a major challenge. Despite this\nurgent need, few compression methods have proven to be both practical and\nscalable in real-world scenarios. DASPack is a fully operational solution that\nconsistently outperforms existing techniques for DAS data. It enables both\ncontrolled lossy and lossless compression by allowing users to choose the\nmaximum absolute difference per datum between the original and compressed data.\nThe compression pipeline combines wavelet transforms, linear predictive coding,\nand entropy coding to optimise efficiency. Our method achieves up to 3x file\nsize reductions for strain and strain rate data in lossless mode across diverse\ndatasets. In lossy mode, compression improves to 6x with near-perfect signal\nfidelity, and up to 10x is reached with acceptable signal degradation. It\ndelivers fast throughput (100-200 MB/s using a single-thread and up to 750 MB/s\nusing 8-threads), enabling real-time deployment even under high data rates. We\nvalidated its performance on 15 datasets from a variety of acquisition\nenvironments, demonstrating its speed, robustness, and broad applicability.\nDASPack provides a practical foundation for long-term, sustainable DAS data\nmanagement in large-scale monitoring networks.",

In this paper, we\nstudy combinatorial Laplacians for complex pairs $(X, A)$, where $A$ is a\nsubcomplex of a simplicial complex $X$. We establish a relative version of the\nmatrix-tree theorem for complex pairs, which generalizes both the matrix-tree\ntheorem for simplicial complexes proved by Duval, Klivans, and Martin (2009)\nand the result for Dirichlet eigenvalues of graph pairs by Chung (1996).\nFurthermore, we derive several lower bounds for the spectral gaps of complex\npairs and characterize the equality case for one sharp lower bound. As\nby-products, we obtain sufficient conditions for the vanishing of relative\nhomology. Our results demonstrate that the combinatorial Laplacians for complex\npairs are closely related to relative homology.",

ISCC is particularly attractive for vehicle-to-everything (V2X)\napplications, where vehicles perform ISAC to sense the environment and\nsimultaneously offload the sensing data to roadside base stations (BSs) for\nremote processing. In this paper, we investigate a particular ISCC-enabled V2X\nsystem consisting of multiple multi-antenna BSs serving a set of single-antenna\nvehicles, in which the vehicles perform their respective ISAC operations (for\nsimultaneous sensing and offloading to the associated BS) over orthogonal\nsub-bands.

To solve the formulated complex\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose an alternating\noptimization algorithm.

Recent research\nproposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to\nensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner\nneuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which\nare traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization\nchallenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that\nsignificantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of\ninverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box\noptimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These\nattacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,\nthrough a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack\nunder more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability\nbetween the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a\ngeneration-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing\nan inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and\nlong prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs\nvalidates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token\nlong medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1\ntoken matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model.

The fabricated singlet metalens experimentally demonstrates a\nfield of view of 86{\\textdegree}, along with a tenfold reduction in focal\nlength variations with wavelength compared to a conventional quadratic\nmetalens, achieving a measured relative shift as low as 1.3% across the 1.5\n$\\mu$m - 1.6 $\\mu$m range (limited by our experimental setup). This improvement\nalso leads to a twofold increase in focusing efficiency relative to the\nreference metalens. These experimental results validate the effectiveness of\nour design strategy in simultaneously enhancing the operational bandwidth and\nfield of view of metalenses. The demonstrated performance can directly benefit\nbeam steering applications in the near-infrared wavelength range and provides a\npath toward achromatic, wide field-of-view metalenses in the visible range for\nimaging systems",

The discovery of\nFRB 20020428 supports the idea that at least a portion of FRBs is generated by\nmagnetars. However, FRB 20200428 and other radio bursts of SGR 1935+2154 are\nmuch less energetic than that of extragalactic FRBs. Thus, whether the\nprogenitors of extragalactic FRBs are magnetars is still in controversy.

However, existing studies focus solely on the\nrelationships between samples with known survival risks, without fully\nleveraging the value of censored samples. Furthermore, these studies may suffer\nperformance degradation in modality-missing scenarios and even struggle during\nthe inference process. In this study, we propose a bipartite patient-modality\ngraph learning with event-conditional modelling of censoring for cancer\nsurvival prediction (CenSurv). Specifically, we first use graph structure to\nmodel multimodal data and obtain representation. Then, to alleviate performance\ndegradation in modality-missing scenarios, we design a bipartite graph to\nsimulate the patient-modality relationship in various modality-missing\nscenarios and leverage a complete-incomplete alignment strategy to explore\nmodality-agnostic features. Finally, we design a plug-and-play\nevent-conditional modeling of censoring (ECMC) that selects reliable censored\ndata using dynamic momentum accumulation confidences, assigns more accurate\nsurvival times to these censored data, and incorporates them as uncensored data\ninto training. Comprehensive evaluations on 5 publicly cancer datasets showcase\nthe superiority of CenSurv over the best state-of-the-art by 3.1% in terms of\nthe mean C-index, while also exhibiting excellent robustness under various\nmodality-missing scenarios.

In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network\nnamed LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which\ncombines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized\nlicense plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the\nrecognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the\ncorrection process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction.

    "abstract": "Fault detection is essential in complex industrial systems to prevent\nfailures and optimize performance by distinguishing abnormal from normal\noperating conditions. With the growing availability of condition monitoring\ndata, data-driven approaches have seen increased adoption in detecting system\nfaults. However, these methods typically require large, diverse, and\nrepresentative training datasets that capture the full range of operating\nscenarios, an assumption rarely met in practice, particularly in the early\nstages of deployment.\n  Industrial systems often operate under highly variable and evolving\nconditions, making it difficult to collect comprehensive training data. This\nvariability results in a distribution shift between training and testing data,\nas future operating conditions may diverge from previously observed ones. Such\ndomain shifts hinder the generalization of traditional models, limiting their\nability to transfer knowledge across time and system instances, ultimately\nleading to performance degradation in practical deployments.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel method for continuous\ntest-time domain adaptation, designed to support robust early-stage fault\ndetection in the presence of domain shifts and limited representativeness of\ntraining data. Our proposed framework --Test-time domain Adaptation for Robust\nfault Detection (TARD) -- explicitly separates input features into system\nparameters and sensor measurements. It employs a dedicated domain adaptation\nmodule to adapt to each input type using different strategies, enabling more\ntargeted and effective adaptation to evolving operating conditions. We validate\nour approach on two real-world case studies from multi-phase flow facilities,\ndelivering substantial improvements over existing domain adaptation methods in\nboth fault detection accuracy and model robustness under real-world\nvariability.",

We\ninvestigate the concept of sample extensions as a means to improve efficiency\nwhen solving fully nonlinear inverse problems. A sample's extension is defined\nas the set of models or parameter values whose forward function values are\ndirectly accessible from a sample for which the forward function has already\nbeen evaluated, obviating the need for additional forward function evaluations.\nIn a specific case of first-arrival travel time calculations used in seismic\ntravel time tomography, we apply sample extensions to obtain a continuous\nregion with non-zero hypervolume within parameter space, across all of which\nthe forward function values are known given only a single forward simulation.\nWe devise a deterministic sampling technique that identifies the most\ninformative extensions by solving an optimisation problem.

    "abstract": "Blockchain systems have been a part of mainstream academic research, and a\nhot topic at that. It has spread to almost every subfield in the computer\nscience literature, as well as economics and finance. Especially in a world\nwhere digital trust is much sought for, blockchains offer a rich variety of\ndesired properties, such as immutability, public auditing, decentralised record\nkeeping, among others. Not only has it been a research topic of its own, the\nintegration of blockchains into other systems has been proposed as solutions in\nmany areas, ranging from grid computing, cloud and fog computing, to internet\nof things, self driving vehicles , and smart cities. In many cases the primary\nfunction attributed to blockchains in these contexts is resource management.\nAlthough much attention is paid to this topic, the focus is on single resource\nallocation scenarios. Even the cases where multiple resource types are to be\nallocated, are treated as single resource type scenarios, and problems are\nformulated as allocating standardised bundles consisting of a fixed amount of\neach of them, such as virtual machines. The present study addresses the problem\nof allocating multiple resource types among tasks with heterogeneous resource\ndemands with a smart contract adaptation of Precomputed Dominant Resource\nFairness; an algorithm that approximates Dominant Resource Fairness, without\nloop iterations, which makes it preferable in the blockchain context because of\nthe block gas limit. We present the resulting algorithm, Autonomous Dominant\nResource Fairness, along with the empirical data collected from the tests run\non the algorithm. The results show that Autonomous Dominant Resource Fairness\nis a gas-cost efficient algorithm, which can be used to manage hundreds of\nresource types for unlimited number of users.",

In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a\nquery-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries.\nDASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are\nmatched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support\nthis formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly\ndecouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event\ndecoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound\nevents at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies\nfor frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking\nstrategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel\nclasses, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments\non the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances\nlocalization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming\nCLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in\nthe closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS).

    "abstract": "Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed\nin glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the last decade, machine\nlearning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this\nstructure-dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous\nglassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction\nof the \\textit{cage state}, a structural quantity that captures the most likely\npositions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging\nregime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform\nmore complex ML methods trained on initial configurations alone. In this paper,\nwe explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to\nbetter understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the\ndynamics. Specifically, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere\nmixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our\nresults reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state\nbecomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This\ninfluence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in\nthe internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be\nassociated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.",

Additionally, reliance on\nlarge-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and\nerror-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation\nmodels like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong\ngeneralizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,\neffectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's\nprompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since\nmanually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework\nbased on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated\nimage, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional\nannotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation\n(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to\nadapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead\nof dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for\niterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.\nExtensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.\nNotably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by\n11.44%.",

In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models\ncould hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted\nalternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous\nformal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g.,\nDafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their\nreasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving\nlarge-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to\nemploy human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the\nreasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes\nunacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex\nprogramming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human\npriors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot\nstudy. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data\ncuration pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the\nformal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional\nformal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification\nreasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models\n(e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code,\nsurpassing proprietary models.

This raises serious\nconcerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which\naims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs\nfrom the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential\nexternal safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly\nrecognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before\nreal-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often\ntreat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which\nlimits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this\ngap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to\nautomatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.\nUnlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly\nmodels the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic\nprompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and\ndiversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve\nthis without direct access to representative training samples, we draw\ninspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple\nand tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient\noptimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long\nand potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is\nvalidated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9\nstate-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I\nmodels and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.",

    "abstract": "We propose a general procedure for estimating the variance-covariance matrix\nof two-step estimates of structural parameters in latent variable models. The\nmethod is partially simulation-based, in that it includes drawing simulated\nvalues of the measurement parameters of the model from their sampling\ndistribution obtained from the first step of two-step estimation, and using\nthem to quantify part of the variability in the parameter estimates from the\nsecond step. This is asymptotically equal with the standard closed-form\nestimate of the variance-covariance matrix, but it avoids the need to evaluate\na cross-derivative matrix which is the most inconvenient element of the\nstandard estimate. The method can be applied to any types of latent variable\nmodels. We present it in more detail in the context of two common models where\nthe measurement items are categorical: latent class models with categorical\nlatent variables and latent trait models with continuous latent variables. The\ngood performance of the proposed procedure is demonstrated with simulation\nstudies and illustrated with two applied examples.",

Methodology: We systematically reviewed 31\nquantitative LLM evaluation papers (Jan 2019 May 2025) identifying 19 English\nmedical QA benchmarks. Alama Health QA was developed using a retrieval\naugmented generation framework anchored on the Kenyan Clinical Practice\nGuidelines. Six widely used sets (AfriMedQA, MMLUMedical, PubMedQA, MedMCQA,\nMedQAUSMLE, and guideline grounded Alama Health QA) underwent harmonized\nsemantic profiling (NTD proportion, recency, readability, lexical diversity\nmetrics) and blinded expert rating across five dimensions: clinical relevance,\nguideline alignment, clarity, distractor plausibility, and language/cultural\nfit. Results: Alama Health QA captured >40% of all NTD mentions across corpora\nand the highest within set frequencies for malaria (7.7%), HIV (4.1%), and TB\n(5.2%); AfriMedQA ranked second but lacked formal guideline linkage. Global\nbenchmarks showed minimal representation (e.g., sickle cell disease absent in\nthree sets) despite large scale. Qualitatively, Alama scored highest for\nrelevance and guideline alignment; PubMedQA lowest for clinical utility.\nDiscussion: Quantitative medical LLM benchmarks widely used in the literature\nunderrepresent African disease burdens and regulatory contexts, risking\nmisleading performance claims. Guideline anchored, regionally curated resources\nsuch as Alama Health QA and expanded disease specific derivatives are essential\nfor safe, equitable model evaluation and deployment across African health\nsystems.",

With directional N-N bonding and\nsemiconducting character, CrN2 shows high sensitivity to defect incorporation,\nincluding local spin polarisation, gap states, and mechanical softening. In\ncontrast, CrN's metallic character enables effective screening of similar\ndefects, preserving its structural, magnetic, electronic and mechanical\nintegrity. However, hydrogen induces anisotropic distortions and mechanical\ndegradation in CrN, while oxygen enhances hardness. These findings reveal how\ndefect chemistry and bonding anisotropy govern mechanical performance, with\nimplications for nanoscale control in coatings design.",

    "abstract": "WhatsApp tiplines, first launched in 2019 to combat misinformation, enable\nusers to interact with fact-checkers to verify misleading content. This study\nanalyzes 580 unique claims (tips) from 451 users, covering both high-resource\nlanguages (English, Hindi) and a low-resource language (Telugu) during the 2021\nIndian assembly elections using a mixed-method approach. We categorize the\nclaims into three categories, election, COVID-19, and others, and observe\nvariations across languages. We compare content similarity through frequent\nword analysis and clustering of neural sentence embeddings. We also investigate\nuser overlap across languages and fact-checking organizations. We measure the\naverage time required to debunk claims and inform tipline users. Results reveal\nsimilarities in claims across languages, with some users submitting tips in\nmultiple languages to the same fact-checkers. Fact-checkers generally require a\ncouple of days to debunk a new claim and share the results with users. Notably,\nno user submits claims to multiple fact-checking organizations, indicating that\neach organization maintains a unique audience. We provide practical\nrecommendations for using tiplines during elections with ethical consideration\nof users' information.",

Multi-modal learning can mitigate this challenge by introducing richer\nand more discriminative information as input. To solve the problem of limited\naccess to multi-modal data at the time of use, we conduct multi-modal learning\nby introducing a teacher model to transfer discriminative knowledge to a\nstudent model during training. However, this knowledge transfer via\ndistillation is not trivial because the big domain gap between the widely\ndiffering modalities can easily lead to overfitting. In this work, we introduce\na cross-modal distillation framework. Specifically, we find hard constrained\nloss, e.g. l2 loss forcing the student being exact the same as the teacher, can\neasily lead to overfitting in cross-modality distillation. To address this, we\npropose two soft constrained knowledge distillation strategies at the feature\nlevel and classifier level respectively. In addition, we propose a\nquality-based adaptive weights module to weigh input samples via quantified\ndata quality, leading to robust model training. We conducted experiments on\nspeaker recognition and image classification tasks, and the results show that\nour approach is able to effectively achieve knowledge transfer between the\ncommonly used and widely differing modalities of image, text, and speech.",

Metal-organic frameworks\n(MOFs) are one of the most versatile classes of porous crystals. So far only\ntwo-photon upconverting processes have been realized in MOFs both by ligand\nbased triplet-triplet annihilation and directly in lanthanide ions. Here we\nreport on Yb3+/Er3+-trimesate-based MOFs that exhibit photon avalanche (PA)\ncharacteristics. The PA process conventionally occurs through cross-relaxation\nwithin the lanthanide emitter manifold. In contrast, here PA proceeds in the\norganic molecule part and relies on a cooperative process, involving multiple\nemission centers. The IR photons are first absorbed and upconverted into high\nenergy electronic population by the action of the lanthanide ions (Yb3+ and\nEr3+ are the sensitizer and the activator, respectively). Subsequently, the\nelectrons are funneled into electronically coupled triplet states of the\ntrimesate ligand, enabling accumulation in the organic matrix. This reservoir\nacts as source for a highly nonlinear spectrally broadband emission, arising\nmainly from ligand triplet states. The nonlinearity factor is comparable with\nthe well-established PA inorganic nanoparticles. We prove that the PA is\nstrongly related to the degree of crystallinity of the MOF: not well-formed\nframeworks support only the characteristic Er3+ emission with only linear\nincrease as a function of the excitation power. Our work paves a path towards\nvastly expanding the range of materials exhibiting PA, well beyond a limited\nset of lanthanide ions. Moreover, it provides a path for much broader control\nof the PA emission characteristics.",

However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and\npoint maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often\nfails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical\napplicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly\nmodels the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable\njoint regression.

We first present a simple yet crucial\nstructural observation relating unbordered factors and RLE-compressed strings.\nBuilding on this, we propose an algorithm that solves the problem in $O(m^{1.5}\n\\log^2 m)$ time and $O(m \\log^2 m)$ space, where $m$ is the size of the\nRLE-compressed input string. To achieve this, our approach simulates a key idea\nfrom the $O(n^{1.5})$-time algorithm by [Gawrychowski et al., SPIRE 2015],\nadapting it to the RLE setting through new combinatorial insights. When the RLE\nsize $m$ is sufficiently small compared to $n$, our algorithm may show\nlinear-time behavior in $n$, potentially leading to improved performance over\nexisting methods in such cases.",

Existing Compton edge identification\ntechniques - Gaussian fitting for the 50%-70% amplitude point, first derivative\nminimum detection, and Monte Carlo simulation - suffer significant degradation\nfrom low count rates, spectral overlap, and subjective interval selection. For\nthe first time, we propose an automated calibration procedure based on\nNormalized Cross-Correlation (NCC), Simulated Annealing (SA), and a\nconvolutional response model to address these issues.

    "abstract": "Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a\nmethod that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during\nparameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological\nplausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these\nchallenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing\nindependent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,\nbecause gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,\nperformance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from\nsupplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and\nfacilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary\nNetwork++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by\nemploying the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent\nblocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,\nupdated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.\nNotably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal\ndue to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we\nintroduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby\nfurther improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments\non tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image\nsegmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end\ntraining while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++\noffers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable\nalternative to conventional training methods.",

Unlike\nconventional text-to-table tasks, which rely on fixed schema and narrow task\ndomains, AOE includes 11 carefully crafted tasks across three diverse domains,\nrequiring models to generate context-specific schema tailored to varied input\nqueries. In the experiment, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source\nstate-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that even the most advanced models\nstruggled significantly. The benchmark is available at\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/tianyumyum/AOE.",

MRI inherently contains both spatial\nand frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain\nand reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most\nexisting AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting\ntheir capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the\ndisease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information,\nthey are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain\nanalysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose\nSpatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework\nthat simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to\nenhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense\nconvolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency\nmodule to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a\nnovel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial\nfeature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines\nand reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and\nAD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.",

Our main result --\nthe \\textit{one-basket theorem} -- identifies new sufficient conditions under\nwhich this reversal occurs for independent but not necessarily identically\ndistributed risks. We compare a weighted average to its corresponding mixture\nmodel, which concentrates all exposure on one of the risks, chosen at random.\nIn the iid case, the mixture has the same distribution as any individual risk,\nthereby recovering the canonical comparison between a diversified portfolio and\nfull exposure to a single component. The theorem enables weight-specific\nverification of the stochastic dominance relation and yields new applications,\nincluding infinite-mean discrete Pareto risks and the St. Petersburg lottery.\nWe further show that these reversals are boundary cases of a broader pattern:\ndiversification always increases the likelihood of exceeding small thresholds,\nand under specific conditions, this local effect extends globally, resulting in\nfirst-order stochastic dominance.",

    "abstract": "Although vision transformers (ViT) have shown remarkable success in various\nvision tasks, their computationally expensive self-attention hinder their\ndeployment on resource-constrained devices. Token reduction, which discards\nless important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance\nthe efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle\nunimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.\nConsidering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,\ntokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt\ntransformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a\nbalance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these\nchallenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing\n(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and\ntemporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a\nlater stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token\nidentification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By\njointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware\nend-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each\nblock, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of\nLV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a\nbetter trade-off between performance and complexity compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

A challenge exists, however, in\ndebugging quantum circuits, particularly as they scale in size and complexity.\nGiven the lack of effective debugging workflows, developers are forced to\nmanually inspect their circuits and analyze various quantum states, which is\nerror-prone and time-consuming.\n  In this research, we present a statistical assertion-based debugging workflow\nfor CUDA-Q. CUDA-Q has gained popularity due to its ability to leverage GPUs to\naccelerate quantum circuit simulations; this allows circuits to scale to larger\ndepths and widths, where they can be particularly hard to debug by hand.\nInspired by and building from prior Qiskit-based debuggers, our work allows\nCUDA-Q users to verify quantum program correctness with greater ease. Through\nthe insertion of statistical assertions within a quantum circuit, our tool\nprovides valuable insights into the state of qubits at any point within a\ncircuit, tracks their evolution, and helps detect deviations from expected\nbehavior. Furthermore, we improve the reliability and accuracy of the product\nstate assertion by using a combination of Fisher's exact test and the Monte\nCarlo Method instead of a chi-square test, and examine the impact of CUDA-Q's\ndistinct kernel-based programming model on the design of our debugging tool.\nThis work offers a practical solution to one of CUDA-Q's usability gaps, paving\nthe way for more reliable and efficient quantum software development.",

Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video\ngeneration, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,\nmulti-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it\nchallenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current\nmodels.

These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical\napplicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we\nprovide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both\ntheoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by\nintroducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation\nmodels.

Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize\nlong-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS.

While existing ethical frameworks emphasize Consent, Credit,\nand Compensation (C3), they do not adequately address the emergent risks\ninvolving vocal identities that are increasingly decoupled from context,\nauthorship, and control. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 20 professional\nvoice actors, this paper reveals how the synthetic replication of voice without\nenforceable constraints exposes individuals to a range of threats. Beyond\nreputational harm, such as re-purposing voice data in erotic content, offensive\npolitical messaging, and meme culture, we document concerns about\naccountability breakdowns when their voice is leveraged to clone voices that\nare deployed in high-stakes scenarios such as financial fraud, misinformation\ncampaigns, or impersonation scams. In such cases, actors face social and legal\nfallout without recourse, while very few of them have a legal representative or\nunion protection.

Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar\nparticles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering\nfunctions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse\ncomponents of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the\ntheory's validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian\nDynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid.

Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the\nmodel's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on\nthis, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the\npositive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and\nContinuous Utilization (SSCU) framework.

Unlike traditional learning strategies, our\napproach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive\nstyles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This\ntraining strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of\nnew styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough\nutilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's\ngeneralization performance.

    "abstract": "Natural disasters cause devastating damage to communities and infrastructure\nevery year. Effective disaster response is hampered by the difficulty of\naccessing affected areas during and after events. Remote sensing has allowed us\nto monitor natural disasters in a remote way. More recently there have been\nadvances in computer vision and deep learning that help automate satellite\nimagery analysis, However, they remain limited by their narrow focus on\nspecific disaster types, reliance on manual expert interpretation, and lack of\ndatasets with sufficient temporal granularity or natural language annotations\nfor tracking disaster progression. We present MONITRS, a novel multimodal\ndataset of more than 10,000 FEMA disaster events with temporal satellite\nimagery and natural language annotations from news articles, accompanied by\ngeotagged locations, and question-answer pairs. We demonstrate that fine-tuning\nexisting MLLMs on our dataset yields significant performance improvements for\ndisaster monitoring tasks, establishing a new benchmark for machine\nlearning-assisted disaster response systems.

Confidential\nComputing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

We constructed experiments on three\nenvironments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and\nevaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.\n  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other\nmodels in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for\nresource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit\nquantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain\nof up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer\nparameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms\nthe CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment.

To overcome these\nlimitations, this work introduces AMPTCR (Aligned Manifold Property and\nTopology Cloud Representation), a molecular surface representation that\ncombines local quantum-derived scalar fields and custom topological descriptors\nwithin an aligned point cloud format. Each surface point includes a chemically\nmeaningful scalar, geodesically derived topology vectors, and coordinates\ntransformed into a canonical reference frame, enabling efficient learning with\nconventional SE(3)-sensitive architectures. AMPTCR is evaluated using a DGCNN\nframework on two tasks: molecular weight and bacterial growth inhibition. For\nmolecular weight, results confirm that AMPTCR encodes physically meaningful\ndata, with a validation R^2 of 0.87. In the bacterial inhibition task, AMPTCR\nenables both classification and direct regression of E. coli inhibition values\nusing Dual Fukui functions as the electronic descriptor and Morgan Fingerprints\nas auxiliary data, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.912 on the classification task,\nand an R^2 of 0.54 on the regression task.

Most of the\nBayesian deep learning methods produced probabilistic forecasts that\noutperformed the deterministic ResNet, with one, the initial-weights ensemble +\nMonte Carlo (MC) dropout, an ensemble of deterministic ResNets with different\ninitial weights to start training and dropout activated during inference,\nproducing the most skillful and well-calibrated forecasts. The initial-weights\nensemble + MC dropout benefited from generating multiple solutions that more\nthoroughly sampled the hypothesis space. The Bayesian ResNet ensemble was the\nonly one that performed worse than the deterministic ResNet at longer lead\ntimes, likely due to the challenge of optimizing a larger number of parameters.\nTo address this issue, the Bayesian-MOPED (MOdel Priors with Empirical Bayes\nusing Deep neural network) ResNet ensemble was adopted, and it enhanced\nforecast skill by constraining the hypothesis search near the deterministic\nResNet hypothesis. All Bayesian methods demonstrated well-calibrated\nuncertainty and effectively separated cases with large and small errors.

The protocol's efficiency is driven by\nLavo-NN, a novel neural network potential (NNP) architected and trained\nspecifically for pharmaceutical crystal structure generation and ranking. This\nNNP-driven crystal generation phase is integrated into a scalable cloud-based\nworkflow.

The\naverage CSP in this benchmark is performed with approximately 8.4k CPU hours,\nwhich is a significant reduction compared to other protocols. The practical\nutility of the protocol is further demonstrated through case studies that\nresolve ambiguities in experimental data and a semi-blinded challenge that\nsuccessfully identifies and ranks polymorphs of three modern drugs from powder\nX-ray diffraction patterns alone. By significantly reducing the required time\nand cost, the protocol enables CSP to be routinely deployed earlier in the drug\ndiscovery pipeline, such as during lead optimization.

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust relative pose estimation is crucial for enabling\nchallenging Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions targeting tumbling derelict\nsatellites such as ESA's ENVISAT. This work presents a complete pipeline\nintegrating advanced computer vision techniques with adaptive nonlinear\nfiltering to address this challenge. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),\nenhanced with image preprocessing, detects structural markers (corners) from\nchaser imagery, whose 2D coordinates are converted to 3D measurements using\ncamera modeling. These measurements are fused within an Unscented Kalman Filter\n(UKF) framework, selected for its ability to handle nonlinear relative\ndynamics, to estimate the full relative pose. Key contributions include the\nintegrated system architecture and a dual adaptive strategy within the UKF:\ndynamic tuning of the measurement noise covariance compensates for varying CNN\nmeasurement uncertainty, while adaptive tuning of the process noise covariance,\nutilizing measurement residual analysis, accounts for unmodeled dynamics or\nmaneuvers online. This dual adaptation enhances robustness against both\nmeasurement imperfections and dynamic model uncertainties. The performance of\nthe proposed adaptive integrated system is evaluated through high-fidelity\nsimulations using a realistic ENVISAT model, comparing estimates against ground\ntruth under various conditions, including measurement outages. This\ncomprehensive approach offers an enhanced solution for robust onboard relative\nnavigation, significantly advancing the capabilities required for safe\nproximity operations during ADR missions.",

Traditional approaches focus\neither on randomized allocations that are fair in expectation or deterministic\nallocations that are approximately fair. Recent work reconciles both these\napproaches via best-of-both-worlds guarantees, wherein one seeks randomized\nallocations that are fair in expectation (ex-ante fair) while being supported\non approximately fair allocations (ex-post fair). Prior work has shown that\nunder additive valuations, there always exists a randomized allocation that is\nex-ante stochastic-dominance envy-free (sd-EF) and ex-post envy-free up to one\ngood (EF1).\n  Our work is motivated by the goal of achieving stronger ex-post fairness\nguarantees such as envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) along with meaningful\nex-ante guarantees. We make the following contributions:\n  1) We first consider lexicographic preferences, a subdomain of additive\nvaluations where ex-post EFX allocations always exist and can be computed\nefficiently. On the negative side, we show that ex-ante sd-EF is fundamentally\nincompatible with ex-post EFX, prompting a relaxation of the ex-ante benchmark.\nWe then present a poly. time algorithm that achieves ex-post EFX and PO\ntogether with ex-ante 9/10-EF. Our algorithm uses dependent rounding and\nleverages structural properties of EFX and PO allocations.\n  2)For monotone valuations, we study EFX-with-charity: a relaxation of EFX\nwhere some goods remain unallocated, with no agent envying the unallocated\npool. We show that ex-post EFX-with-charity can be achieved alongside ex-ante\n0.5-EF.\n  3)Finally, for subadditive valuations, we strengthen our previous ex-post\nguarantee to EFX-with-bounded-charity, where at most n-1 goods (n= no. of\nagents) remain unallocated, at the price of weakening the ex-ante guarantee to\n0.5-proportionality.",

    "abstract": "Verification using SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) is one of the most popular\nmethods for detecting circuit design vulnerabilities. However, with the\nglobalization of integrated circuit design and the continuous upgrading of\nsecurity requirements, the SVA development model has exposed major limitations.\nIt is not only inefficient in development, but also unable to effectively deal\nwith the increasing number of security vulnerabilities in modern complex\nintegrated circuits. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes an\ninnovative SVA automatic generation framework SVAgent. SVAgent introduces a\nrequirement decomposition mechanism to transform the original complex\nrequirements into a structured, gradually solvable fine-grained problem-solving\nchain. Experiments have shown that SVAgent can effectively suppress the\ninfluence of hallucinations and random answers, and the key evaluation\nindicators such as the accuracy and consistency of the SVA are significantly\nbetter than existing frameworks. More importantly, we successfully integrated\nSVAgent into the most mainstream integrated circuit vulnerability assessment\nframework and verified its practicality and reliability in a real engineering\ndesign environment.",

Fuzhou has a humid\nsubtropical climate and is one of the three hottest cities in China in 2024.\nThe reference roof measurement point showed the highest heat exposure (36.3%\n>35$^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$) followed by pedestrian-level areas (20.4%\n>35$^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$), while the underground remained consistently cooler (0%\n>35$^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$). Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirmed significant\ndifferences (p < 0.001) in environmental conditions (e.g., AT, GT, MRT, V, RH).\nUnderground spaces showed the most stable and lowest PET (mean PET =\n35.4$^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$) due to high thermal mass and shading, although moderate\nto intense thermal stresses still existed. Pedestrian-level spaces displayed\ngreater PET variation (mean = 37.4$^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$) influenced by direct and\ndiffuse solar radiation, while roofs suffered from extreme heat stress (mean\nPET = 40.6$^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$) peaking at 100% frequency from 9:00 to 14:00.\nFour distinct periods including early morning transition, evening transition,\ncooling, and heat stressing were identified for optimal underground space\nutilization as heat shelter. The global sensitivity analysis showed that\nvariations in MET explained 60% of the variance in PET within the underground\nenvironment, followed by AT (20%), V (10%), MRT (5%), and RH (5%). The partial\ndependence analysis indicated that PET in underground space rose by\napproximately 7$^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ when MET increased from 1 to 5 met, while a 1\nm/s rise in V led to a 2$^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ reduction in PET, suggesting shaded\nareas with good ventilation can significantly improve thermal comfort even if\nAT remains moderately high.",

    "abstract": "Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint\nrecognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this\ndistortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,\nfingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial\nregistration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching\npoints. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of\ndetected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial\nregistration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration\nprocess to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step\nfingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly\npredicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two\nfingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration\nfailure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end\npixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove\nthat our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only\nsingle-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense\nregistration algorithms for further performance improvements.",

By learning action distributions through a\ndenoising generation process, DiffCarl enhances DRL policy expressiveness and\nenables carbon- and risk-aware scheduling in dynamic and uncertain microgrid\nenvironments. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate that it outperforms\nclassic algorithms and state-of-the-art DRL solutions, with 2.3-30.1% lower\noperational cost. It also achieves 28.7% lower carbon emissions than those of\nits carbon-unaware variant and reduces performance variability.

We present MindGames: a novel `planning\ntheory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's\nbeliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous\nevaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans\nsignificantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher;\n$p=0.006$).

In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline\ncondition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state\ninferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already\ngiven someone's preferences).

    "abstract": "Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal\nconsistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream\ntracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical\ninformation without explicitly supervising the association process, making it\ndifficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate\nthis problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises\ncontext reasoning via three core mechanisms. \\textit{1) Context Reasoning\nMechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting\nunconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that\npredicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby\nenhancing temporal consistency. \\textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:\nUtilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,\nguiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and\nsuppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \\textit{3) Efficient State\nModeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core\nfeatures of the target, removing redundant information across frames and\npreventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms\ncollaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association\ndivergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that\nRSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets\nwhile maintaining real-time running speeds.

We present a two-stage deep\nlearning model to emulate high-resolution (HR-HydroSim) baryonic fields from\nlow-resolution (LR-HydroSim) simulations at redshift $z = 3$. The method takes\nas inputs an LR-HydroSim and the high-resolution initial conditions\n(HR-HydroICs). First, the model stochastically generates high-resolution\nbaryonic fields from the LR-HydroSim. Second, a deterministic emulator refines\nthese fields using HR-HydroICs to reconstruct small-scale structures including\ndisplacement, velocity, internal energy, and gas/star classification. Trained\non paired low- and high-resolution simulations produced with\n\\texttt{MP-Gadget}, the model captures small-scale structures of the\nintergalactic medium and %Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest observables down to the 100 kpc\npressure smoothing scale relevant to the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest.

Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a\nset of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training\nprocess and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to\nidentify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert\nlevel, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to\nmitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a\ncertain period as a \"bag\" and carefully design a reward function that leads to\na smoother acquisition of rewards.

In the\ncase of protein--nucleic acid mixtures, charge plays a key role but can have\ncontrasting effects on phase behavior. Attractive electrostatic interactions\nbetween oppositely charged macromolecules are screened by added salt, reducing\nthe driving force for coacervation. By contrast, base-pairing interactions\nbetween nucleic acids are diminished by charge repulsion and thus enhanced by\nadded salt, promoting associative phase separation. To explore this interplay,\nwe combine experiment and theory to map the complex phase behavior of a model\nsolution of poly-L-lysine (PLL) and self-complementary DNA nanostars (NS) as a\nfunction of temperature, ionic strength, and macromolecular composition.\nDespite having opposite salt dependences, we find that electrostatics and base\npairing cooperate to stabilize NS--PLL coacervation at high ionic strengths and\ntemperatures, leading to two-phase or three-phase coexistence under various\nconditions. We further observe a variety of kinetic pathways to phase\nseparation at different salt concentrations, resulting in the formation of\nnonequilibrium aggregates or droplets whose compositions evolve on long\ntimescales. Finally, we show that the cooperativity between electrostatics and\nbase pairing can be used to create multiphase coacervates that partition\nvarious NS species at intermediate salt concentrations.

Aims: This study\nevaluates the performance and user satisfaction of the five most widely used\ngenerative AI tools when recommending non-digital activities tailored to\nindividuals at risk of repetitive strain injury. Method: Following the\nGoal/Question/Metric (GQM) paradigm, this proposed experiment involves\ngenerative AI tools that suggest offline activities based on predefined user\nprofiles and intervention scenarios. The evaluation is focused on quantitative\nperformance (precision, recall, F1-score and MCC-score) and qualitative aspects\n(user satisfaction and perceived recommendation relevance). Two research\nquestions were defined: RQ1 assessed which tool delivers the most accurate\nrecommendations, and RQ2 evaluated how tool choice influences user\nsatisfaction.",

Current data selection methodologies predominantly rely on static,\ntraining-agnostic criteria, failing to account for the dynamic model training\nand data interactions. In this paper, we propose a new Data Weighting Model\n(DWM) to adjust the weight of selected data within each batch to achieve a\ndynamic data utilization during LLM training. Specially, to better capture the\ndynamic data preference of the trained model, a bi-level optimization framework\nis implemented to update the weighting model. Our experiments demonstrate that\nDWM enhances the performance of models trained with randomly-selected data, and\nthe learned weighting model can be transferred to enhance other data selection\nmethods and models of different sizes. Moreover, we further analyze how a\nmodel's data preferences evolve throughout training, providing new insights\ninto the data preference of the model during training.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has\ndemonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear\ncomplexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its\nadaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance\nthe global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,\nthey tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense\nprediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local\nfeatures as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question\nthat merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,\nAtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local\ndetails with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,\nour method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a\ngradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design\nshortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to\neffectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By\nleveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design\ndedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)\nand semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,\nrespectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the\nproposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and\nMamba-based methods.

Such scaling-laws\nwere indeed observed in condensed matter experiments.\n  Here we test the validity of Zurek's scaling-law in a different framework. We\nnumerically study the behavior of the Ising model (with classical spins) in 1,\n2 and 3 dimensions under rapid cooling. This model does not have topological\ndefects, so we consider the dynamics of domains instead, i.e. we measure their\nevolution during a cooling process down to zero temperature. For several Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithms, we consistently observe scaling-laws along the\nlines of Zurek's conjecture, in all dimensions under consideration, which shows\nthat this feature holds more generally than expected.

In particular, explicit realizations of the theory in\nsymmetry-reduced systems have shown robust resolutions of the singularities\nthat plague the classical theories in regions of extreme spacetime curvature,\nincluding nonsingular (SU(2)xU(1)-charged) black holes with a cosmologial\nconstant and collapsing solutions, as well as Gowdy and FLRW cosmologies.\nFurther applications include modifications in the spectrum of quasinormal modes\nand in the evaporation process of black holes, as well as relativistic\nformulations of long-range gravitational effects capable of modeling MOND as an\nalternative solution to the dark matter problem. New results here include an\nextension of the spherically symmetric system that couples SU(2) gauge fields\nand the generalization of previous dynamical, homogeneous solutions.",

However,\nintegrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased\ncomputational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded\nsegmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues\nundermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly\nin complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is\nessential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal\nNetwork (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and\nefficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM\ninput pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder\n(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific\ncharacteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich\ncontextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse\nstructural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric\nPrior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion\nprocess, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.\nAdditionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal\ncompatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence\nminimization.

However, its inherent high\nleakage currents, which lead to low piezoelectric response and poor temperature\nstability, have severely limited its practical applications. In this study,\nlead free piezoelectric ceramics of the 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 (BF-BT) system were\nprepared, and their microstructures along with high-temperature electrical\nperformance were modulated by introducing Nd3+. The results indicate that\nmoderate Nd doping improves lattice symmetry and reduces oxygen vacancy-related\ndefect dipoles, thereby effectively suppressing leakage currents at\ntemperatures above 75{\\deg}C. The Nddoped samples exhibit significantly lower\nleakage current densities, reduced by over 99% compared to the undoped\nceramics, reaching values as low as 10-5Acm-2. They also show higher\nresistivity under elevated temperatures and electric fields, offering notable\nimprovements in thermal stability over the undoped counterparts. In addition,\nthe Nd-doped samples achieved piezoelectric coefficients as high as 172 pC N -1\nat room temperature while still maintaining high dielectric and piezoelectric\nresponses at elevated temperatures. This work not only provides an effective\nway to solve the leakage current problem of BF-BT ceramics in high temperature\napplications but also indicates a new design strategy for optimizing the high\ntemperature stability of lead free piezoelectric materials, which shows a broad\napplication prospect in the field of high-temperature sensors and actuators.",

These\nissues have prompted the investigation of various alternative dark matter\ncandidates, leaving the question \"What is dark matter?\" still open. In this\nwork, we propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a\nbarotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets\ndark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a\ncosmological constant. We then place constraints on our new model using the\nPlanck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI), the Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae (Ia\nSNe), and the Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data from Gold2018.

The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical\nevolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from\nan existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and\nmost metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation\n(AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex\nin metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major\nmerger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in\nthe Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have\nexperienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our\nprevious works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of\nwing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned\nmerger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the\nclouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge\nformations.\n  In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample\nthat includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the\nexpectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show\na trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models\nthat best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with\nthe major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we\nsuggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters,\nwhich can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic\nchemical enrichment over time.",

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely\ncollected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the\nearly detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over\ntime. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to\noutputting classification results without providing a rationale for their\ndiagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot\nunderstand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and\nadoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals\nfrom the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large\nlanguage model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological\nfeatures from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT\nnumerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately\nempowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic\nreport. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC\nof 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data,\nit maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a\ntext-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design.

The core idea is a streaming update\nmechanism that incrementally integrates current-view observations while\nselectively compressing redundant historical Gaussians. Crucial to this\nmechanism is our Gaussian-Image Representation (GIR), a representation that\nencodes 3D Gaussian parameters into a structured, image-like 2D format. GIR\nsimultaneously enables efficient fusion of current-view and historical\nGaussians and identity-aware redundancy compression. These functions enable\nonline reconstruction and adapt the model to long sequences without\noverwhelming memory or computational costs. Furthermore, we leverage an\nexisting image compression method to guide the generation of more compact and\nhigher-quality 3D Gaussians. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that LongSplat\nachieves state-of-the-art efficiency-quality trade-offs in real-time novel view\nsynthesis, delivering real-time reconstruction while reducing Gaussian counts\nby 44\\% compared to existing per-pixel Gaussian prediction methods.",

    "abstract": "Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL) has emerged as a secure\ndistributed Machine Learning (ML) paradigm that aggregates locally trained\ngradients without exposing raw data. To defend against model poisoning threats,\nseveral robustness-enhanced PPFL schemes have been proposed by integrating\nanomaly detection. Nevertheless, they still face two major challenges: (1) the\nreliance on heavyweight encryption techniques results in substantial\ncommunication and computation overhead; and (2) single-strategy defense\nmechanisms often fail to provide sufficient robustness against adaptive\nadversaries. To overcome these challenges, we propose DP2Guard, a lightweight\nPPFL framework that enhances both privacy and robustness. DP2Guard leverages a\nlightweight gradient masking mechanism to replace costly cryptographic\noperations while ensuring the privacy of local gradients. A hybrid defense\nstrategy is proposed, which extracts gradient features using singular value\ndecomposition and cosine similarity, and applies a clustering algorithm to\neffectively identify malicious gradients. Additionally, DP2Guard adopts a trust\nscore-based adaptive aggregation scheme that adjusts client weights according\nto historical behavior, while blockchain records aggregated results and trust\nscores to ensure tamper-proof and auditable training. Extensive experiments\nconducted on two public datasets demonstrate that DP2Guard effectively defends\nagainst four advanced poisoning attacks while ensuring privacy with reduced\ncommunication and computation costs.",

In\nthis setup, all quantum events (branching, engagement, disengagement, and\nrelocation) occur entirely within the local system, and the Born rule,\nnaturally emerging through branch weights, can be observed in detector\nstatistics. To explore branching dynamics more thoroughly, we suggest an\nenhanced dual-layer experimental setup with an inner transparent detector.\nBecause the electron transit time between layers is shorter than the average\nresponse times of the inner sensors, this allows for a crucial test of\nmeasurement timing and potential anomalies, such as delayed or uncommitted\nchoices.

    "abstract": "Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has become a key technology for achieving\nlow-cost and precise positioning. However, traditional CNN-based inertial\npositioning methods struggle to capture the nonlinear motion characteristics\nand long-term dependencies in IMU data. To address this limitation, we propose\na novel inertial positioning network with a generic backbone called\nResChebyKAN, which leverages the nonlinear approximation capabilities of\nChebyshev polynomials to model complex motion patterns. Additionally, we\nintroduce an Efficient Kernel-based Self-Attention (EKSA) module to effectively\ncapture contextual information and enhance long-term dependency modeling.\nExperimental results on public datasets (e.g., RIDI, RoNIN, RNIN-VIO, OxIOD,\nIMUNet, and TLIO) demonstrate that our method reduces the absolute trajectory\nerror by 3.79% to 42.32% compared to existing benchmark methods. Furthermore,\nwe release a preprocessed dataset and empirically show that removing the\ngravity component from acceleration data significantly improves inertial\npositioning performance.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning has achieved significant advancements in\ninertial odometry. However, most existing inertial odometry methods primarily\nrely on CNNs in the time domain. These methods often struggle to capture\nlong-term dependency in inertial measurement unit data, thereby constraining\nthe potential for further improvements in localization accuracy. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel network architecture that integrates both\nfrequency-domain and time-domain information. Specifically, we leverage the\nglobal view and energy compaction properties of frequency-domain learning to\neffectively model long-term dependency and reduce redundancy in IMU data.\nAdditionally, we introduce a Scalar LSTM to capture sequential dependencies in\nthe time domain, enabling cross-domain information fusion and providing a\nstable and reliable reference for localization. Experimental evaluations on\nmultiple public datasets (e.g., RIDI, RoNIN, OxIOD, RNIN, TLIO, and IMUNet)\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-time domain fusion\nstrategy. Notably, on the RoNIN dataset, our method achieves a 43.0% reduction\nin absolute trajectory error and a 13.1% reduction in relative trajectory error\ncompared to RoNIN ResNet.",

    "abstract": "Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are dark, sunward-moving structures above the\narcade of flare loops. Naturally they are considered to be associated with\noutflows resulting from magnetic reconnection at the vertical current sheet\nbeneath the eruptive structure. Despite the extensive investigations on the SAD\nproperties, the timing information, particularly the waiting time between\nconsecutive SADs, has not been systematically examined. Here, using the\n131~{\\AA} passband of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on-board the Solar\nDynamics Observatory, we studied the waiting time distribution (WTD) of SADs in\n7 eruptive flares. In six of the 7 flares, the SADs are identified and tracked\nin previous studies, by two different methods; and in the 7th flare, by our\noptimized manual method. Based on statistical evaluations, we found that most\nof the WTDs are best fitted by a power-law function with the slope ranging from\n1.7 to 2.4, in accordance with the prediction of non-stationary Poisson\nprocesses or self-organized criticality; but often they can also be fitted\nalmost equally well by a log-normal function. These results rule out linear\nrandom or quasi-periodic processes to be responsible for the generation of\nSADs, but suggest that several nonlinear mechanisms be coupled together in the\nreconnection outflow region to shape the heavy-tailed WTD of SADs.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical data harmonization is essential for enabling exploratory analyses\nand meta-studies, but the process of schema matching - identifying semantic\ncorrespondences between elements of disparate datasets (schemas) - remains a\nlabor-intensive and error-prone task. Even state-of-the-art automated methods\noften yield low accuracy when applied to biomedical schemas due to the large\nnumber of attributes and nuanced semantic differences between them. We present\nBDIViz, a novel visual analytics system designed to streamline the schema\nmatching process for biomedical data. Through formative studies with domain\nexperts, we identified key requirements for an effective solution and developed\ninteractive visualization techniques that address both scalability challenges\nand semantic ambiguity. BDIViz employs an ensemble approach that combines\nmultiple matching methods with LLM-based validation, summarizes matches through\ninteractive heatmaps, and provides coordinated views that enable users to\nquickly compare attributes and their values. Our method-agnostic design allows\nthe system to integrate various schema matching algorithms and adapt to\napplication-specific needs. Through two biomedical case studies and a\nwithin-subject user study with domain experts, we demonstrate that BDIViz\nsignificantly improves matching accuracy while reducing cognitive load and\ncuration time compared to baseline approaches.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by\nfundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid\nsynchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep\nvariables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have\nsought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational\ninefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,\nwe present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep\nadaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video\ndiffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means\nit fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA\nWan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --\nsurpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\\leq$ 1/200 of the training\ncost (\\$500 vs. $\\geq$ \\$100,000) and $\\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.\n$\\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)\ngeneration, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\\% (vs. 86.86\\% of\nWan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as\nstart-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.\nMeanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic\nanalyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative\npriors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial\nexplosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,\nefficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,\ndemocratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.\nCode is open-sourced at https://github.com/Yaofang-Liu/Pusa-VidGen",

    "abstract": "The discrepancy between the early-time estimation and late-time observation\non the cosmic baryon content - the 'missing baryon problem' - is a longstanding\nproblem in cosmology. Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs)\nhave largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of\nthese baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback.\nCosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the\npartitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is\nsensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution\nwith feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates\nhow feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic\nstructures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web\nmethod to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments,\nsheets, and voids. We then analyze how the different feedback variants of Simba\naffect the distribution of matter within each structure. Our results show that\nin Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only\na few percent under different feedback models. However, jet feedback produces\nnoticeable changes in the gas distribution within structures, enhancing the\ndiffuse IGM on the outskirts of filaments and knots. This research provides a\nnew perspective on the impact of feedback on the IGM and motivates a refined\ndata model for the FRB foreground mapping.",
