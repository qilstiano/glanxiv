    "abstract": "We investigate the linear tearing instability in weakly collisional plasmas\nusing a non-ideal gyrotropic-MHD framework, uncovering a previously unknown\nscaling relation for the instability growth rate in high-$\\beta$ environments.\nEven starting from an isotropic equilibrium, our analysis reveals a\n$\\beta$-dependence, with the maximum growth rate scaling as\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{max} \\tau_a \\propto \\beta^{-1/4}$, challenging the long-held\nassumption of $\\beta$-independence inherent in classical MHD formulations. This\nnovel scaling emerges due to self-consistent fluctuations in pressure\nanisotropy, dynamically induced by perturbations in velocity and magnetic\nfields. Increasing plasma-$\\beta$ always suppresses the instability, whereas a\nbackground pressure anisotropy can either enhance or further suppress it,\ndepending on its sign: for $p_{\\parallel,0} < p_{\\perp,0}$ the instability is\nstrengthened, while for $p_{\\parallel,0} > p_{\\perp,0}$ it is weakened.\nImportantly, this effect is not limited to low-collisionality plasmas at high\n$\\beta$; it can also manifest in more collisional environments once the strict\nassumption of pressure isotropy is relaxed. This finding has profound\nimplications for various astrophysical contexts characterized by high $\\beta$\nand varying degrees of collisionality, including the solar corona and\nheliospheric current sheets, planetary magnetospheres, as probed by space\nmissions, and the intracluster medium, where magnetic reconnection critically\nimpacts magnetic field evolution and cosmic ray transport. Our results\ntherefore question the universality of the widely-accepted plasmoid-mediated\nfast reconnection paradigm and underscore the necessity of incorporating\npressure anisotropy effects into reconnection models for accurate\nrepresentation of astrophysical plasmas.",

    "abstract": "We present AnyCalib, a method for calibrating the intrinsic parameters of a\ncamera from a single in-the-wild image, that is agnostic to the camera model.\nCurrent methods are predominantly tailored to specific camera models and/or\nrequire extrinsic cues, such as the direction of gravity, to be visible in the\nimage. In contrast, we argue that the perspective and distortion cues inherent\nin images are sufficient for model-agnostic camera calibration. To demonstrate\nthis, we frame the calibration process as the regression of the rays\ncorresponding to each pixel. We show, for the first time, that this\nintermediate representation allows for a closed-form recovery of the intrinsics\nfor a wide range of camera models, including but not limited to: pinhole,\nBrown-Conrady and Kannala-Brandt. Our approach also applies to edited --\ncropped and stretched -- images.

In this paper we build on previous works arXiv:2408.05266 and\narXiv:2502.20440 on gapped phases in (2+1)d and provide a systematic framework\nto study phase transitions with categorical symmetries. The Symmetry\nTopological Field Theory (SymTFT) is, as often in these matters, the central\ntool. Applied to gapless theories, we need to consider the extension of the\nSymTFT to interfaces between topological orders, so-called ``club sandwiches\",\nwhich realize generalizations of so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations.\nThis requires an input phase transition for a smaller symmetry, such as the\nIsing transition for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the SymTFT constructs a transformation\nto a gapless phase with a larger categorical symmetry. We carry this out for\ncategorical symmetries whose SymTFT is a (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theory\nfor a finite group $G$ with twist -- so-called all bosonic fusion 2-categories.\nWe classify such interfaces using a physically motivated picture of generalized\ngauging, as well as with a complementary analysis using (bi-)module\n2-categories.This is exemplified in numerous abelian and non-abelian DW\ntheories, giving rise to interesting gapless phases such as intrinsically\ngapless symmetry protected phases (igSPTs) and spontaneous symmetry breaking\nphases (igSSBs) from abelian, $S_3$, and $D_8$ DW theories.",

Traditional finite element simulations for\ncrashworthiness analysis involve complex modelling, leading to an increased\ncomputational demand. Although a few machine learning-based surrogate models\nhave been developed for rapid predictions for crashworthiness analysis, they\nexhibit limitations in detailed representation of complex 3D components. Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for processing data\nwith complex structures. However, existing GNN models often lack sufficient\naccuracy and computational efficiency to meet industrial demands. This paper\nproposes Recurrent Graph U-Net (ReGUNet), a new graph-based surrogate model for\ncrashworthiness analysis of vehicle panel components. ReGUNet adoptes a U-Net\narchitecture with multiple graph downsampling and upsampling layers, which\nimproves the model's computational efficiency and accuracy; the introduction of\nrecurrence enhances the accuracy and stability of temporal predictions over\nmultiple time steps. ReGUNet is evaluated through a case study of side crash\ntesting of a B-pillar component with variation in geometric design. The trained\nmodel demonstrates great accuracy in predicting the dynamic behaviour of\npreviously unseen component designs within a relative error of 0.74% for the\nmaximum B-pillar intrusion. Compared to the baseline models, ReGUNet can reduce\nthe averaged mean prediction error of the component's deformation by more than\n51% with significant improvement in computational efficiency. Provided enhanced\naccuracy and efficiency, ReGUNet shows greater potential in accurate\npredictions of large and complex graphs compared to existing models.",

Our analysis spans three structural phases of BaTiO3:\ncubic, tetragonal, and rhombohedral.

    "abstract": "Video identity customization seeks to produce high-fidelity videos that\nmaintain consistent identity and exhibit significant dynamics based on users'\nreference images. However, existing approaches face two key challenges:\nidentity degradation over extended video length and reduced dynamics during\ntraining, primarily due to their reliance on traditional self-reconstruction\ntraining with static images. To address these issues, we introduce\n$\\textbf{MagicID}$, a novel framework designed to directly promote the\ngeneration of identity-consistent and dynamically rich videos tailored to user\npreferences. Specifically, we propose constructing pairwise preference video\ndata with explicit identity and dynamic rewards for preference learning,\ninstead of sticking to the traditional self-reconstruction. To address the\nconstraints of customized preference data, we introduce a hybrid sampling\nstrategy. This approach first prioritizes identity preservation by leveraging\nstatic videos derived from reference images, then enhances dynamic motion\nquality in the generated videos using a Frontier-based sampling method. By\nutilizing these hybrid preference pairs, we optimize the model to align with\nthe reward differences between pairs of customized preferences. Extensive\nexperiments show that MagicID successfully achieves consistent identity and\nnatural dynamics, surpassing existing methods across various metrics.",

Sparse-angle tomography plays a significant role in\nthis by reducing the required number of projections, thereby accelerating\nprocessing and conserving resources. Most existing methods aim to balance\nreconstruction quality and scanning time, typically relying on fixed scan\ndurations. Adaptive adjustment of the number of angles is essential; for\ninstance, more angles may be required for objects with complex geometries or\nnoisier projections. The concept of optimal stopping, which dynamically adjusts\nthis balance according to varying industrial needs, remains overlooked.\nBuilding on our previous work, we integrate optimal stopping into sequential\nOptimal Experimental Design (sOED) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). We propose\na novel method for computing the policy gradient within the Actor-Critic\nframework, enabling the development of adaptive policies for informative angle\nselection and scan termination.

Our focus is on one class of multi-agent\nsystem models over multilayer networks, namely multilayer synchronous dynamical\nsystems (MSyDSs). We study several fundamental problems for this model. We\nestablish properties of the phase spaces of MSyDSs and bring out interesting\ndifferences between single-layer and multilayer dynamical systems. We show\nthat, in general, the problem of determining whether two given MSyDSs are\ninequivalent is NP-complete. This hardness result holds even when the only\ndifference between the two systems is the local function at just one node in\none layer. We also present efficient algorithms for the equivalence problem for\nrestricted versions of MSyDSs (e.g., systems where each local function is a\nbounded-threshold function, systems where the number of layers is fixed and\neach local function is symmetric). In addition, we investigate the expressive\npower of MSyDSs based on the number of layers.

For increasing shear rotation angles, we find that the jamming point is\ncontinuously shifted to higher packing fractions for frictional particles,\nwhile it remains constant for frictionless particles. As a consequence, the\nalternating shear rotation is unable to reduce the dissipation per strain for\nsuspensions composed of frictionless particles. We detail the individual\ncontributions, hydrodynamic or contact, to the shear stress, being uncharted\nfor this protocol. As the angle of rotation increases, the average contact\nstress decreases. However, we find that the hydrodynamics shows the opposite\ntrend, instead increasing with increasing angle. Hence, hydrodynamic stress\nwill dominate up to much higher packing fractions as the angle of rotation\nincreases. In addition, we report how the microstructure varies and establish a\none-to-one mapping between the contact number and its contribution to the total\nstress for both frictionless and frictional particles.",

    "abstract": "The localized artificial diffusivity (LAD) method is widely regarded as the\npreferred multi-material regularization scheme for the compact finite\ndifference method, because it is conservative, easy to implement, and generally\nrobust for a wide range of problems. However, traditional LAD methods face\nsignificant challenges when applied to flows with large density ratios and when\nmaintaining thermodynamic equilibrium across material interfaces. These\nlimitations arise from the formulation of the artificial diffusivity flux and\nthe reliance on enthalpy diffusion for interface regularization. Additionally,\ntraditional LAD methods struggle to ensure stability for large density ratios,\nfail to maintain a finite interface thickness, and are therefore unsuitable for\nmodeling immiscible interfaces. In this work, we discuss the origins of these\nissues in traditional LAD methods and propose modifications which enable the\nsimulation of large density ratio and immiscible flows. The proposed method\ntargets the artificial diffusion fluxes at gradients and ringing in the volume\nfraction, rather than the mass fraction in traditional methods, to consistently\nregularize large density ratio interfaces. Furthermore, the proposed method\nintroduces an artificial bulk density diffusion term to enforce equilibrium\nconditions. To address the challenge of modeling immiscible flows, a\nconservative diffuse interface term is incorporated to ensure a finite\ninterface thickness. Specific consideration is taken in the method to ensure\nthat these crucial properties are maintained for N-material flows. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of\ncanonical test cases, and its accuracy is validated by comparison with\nexperimental data on microbubble collapse in water.

For an open chain with given\nboundary conditions described by a 2D conformal field theory~(CFT), the\nentanglement spectrum of the left/right half of the system coincides with a\nboundary CFT spectrum, where one of the boundary conditions arise due to the\n`entanglement cut'. The latter has been argued to be conformal and has been\nnumerically found to be the `free' boundary condition for Ising, Potts and free\nboson theories. For these models, the `free' boundary condition for the lattice\ndegree of freedom has a counterpart in the continuum theory. However, this is\nnot true in general. Here, this question is analyzed for the unitary minimal\nmodels of 2D CFTs using the density matrix renormalization group technique. The\nentanglement spectra are computed for blocks of spins in open chains of A-type\nrestricted solid-on-solid models with identical boundary conditions at the\nends. The imposed boundary conditions are realized exactly for these lattice\nmodels due to their integrable nature. The obtained entanglement spectra are in\ngood agreement with certain boundary CFT spectra. The boundary condition for\nthe entanglement cut is found to be conformal and to coincide with the one with\nthe highest boundary entropy. This identification enables determination of the\nexponents governing the unusual corrections to the entanglement entropy from\nthe CFT partition functions. These are compared with numerical results.",

We introduce a new parameter $\\zeta$ that\naccounts for the effects of the limited size of the junction and provide\nseveral interpretations of the parameter that shed new light on the complex\nphysics in the light-driven junction. Most strikingly, we find that for $\\zeta\n> 1$ photon-assisted tunneling is dominating the ultrafast electron transport\nacross the junction, regardless of the value of the Keldysh parameter. Here one\nor more photons are absorbed and the electron undergoes static tunneling\nthrough the barrier. $\\zeta < 1$ is required for a regime in which the laser\nfield and the Keldysh parameter dominate the transport. We also discuss the\nthree-step model of electron transport across the nanojunction in the adiabatic\nregime, the energy cutoff of the transported electrons and the carrier-envelope\nphase control of the net current.

Recently, multi-task learning has gained much attention for solving VRP\nvariants. However, this adaptability often compromises the performance of the\nmodels. To address this challenge, we first pre-train a reinforcement learning\nmodel on the multi-depot VRP, followed by a short fine-tuning phase to adapt it\nto different variants. By leveraging the complexity of the multi-depot VRP, the\npre-trained model learns richer node representations and gains more\ntransferable knowledge compared to models trained on simpler routing problems,\nsuch as the traveling salesman problem. TuneNSearch employs, in the first\nstage, a Transformer-based architecture, augmented with a residual edge-graph\nattention network to capture the impact of edge distances and residual\nconnections between layers. This architecture allows for a more precise capture\nof graph-structured data, improving the encoding of VRP's features. After\ninference, our model is also coupled with a second stage composed of a local\nsearch algorithm, which yields substantial performance gains with minimal\ncomputational overhead added. Results show that TuneNSearch outperforms many\nexisting state-of-the-art models trained for each VRP variant, requiring only\none-fifth of the training epochs.

Later,\nadvanced systems further improved the estimation at the cost of a higher\nruntime and complexity. This paper explores the limits of what can be achieved\nwith a LiDAR-only SLAM approach while following the \"Keep It Small and Simple\"\n(KISS) principle. By leveraging this minimalistic design principle, our system,\nKISS-SLAM, archives state-of-the-art performances in pose accuracy while\nrequiring little to no parameter tuning for deployment across diverse\nenvironments, sensors, and motion profiles. We follow best practices in\ngraph-based SLAM and build upon LiDAR odometry to compute the relative motion\nbetween scans and construct local maps of the environment. To correct drift, we\nmatch local maps and optimize the trajectory in a pose graph optimization step.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that this design achieves competitive\nperformance while reducing complexity and reliance on additional sensor\nmodalities.

    "abstract": "We develop several aspects of the theory of gaseous astrophysical discs in\nwhich the gravity of the disc makes a significant contribution to its structure\nand dynamics. We show how the internal gravitational potential can be expanded\nin powers of the aspect ratio of the disc (or of a structure within it) and\nseparated into near and far contributions. We analyse the hydrostatic vertical\nstructure of a wide family of disc models, both analytically and numerically,\nand show that the near contribution to the internal gravitational potential\nenergy can be written in an almost universal form in terms of the surface\ndensity and scaleheight. We thereby develop an affine model of the dynamics of\n(generally non-hydrostatic) self-gravitating discs in which this contribution\nto the energy acts as a gravitational pressure in the plane of the disc. This\ncombines with and significantly reinforces the gas pressure, allowing us to\ndefine an enhanced effective sound speed and Toomre stability parameter Q for\nself-gravitating discs. We confirm that this theory fairly accurately\nreproduces the onset of axisymmetric gravitational instability in discs with\nresolved vertical structure. Among other things, this analysis shows that the\ncritical wavelength is on the order of twenty times the scaleheight, helping to\njustify the validity of the affine model. The weakly nonlinear theory also\ntypically exhibits subcritical behaviour, with equilibrium solutions of finite\namplitude being found in the linearly stable regime Q > 1 for adiabatic\nexponents less than 1.50.",

    "abstract": "Second-order cone programs (SOCPs) with quadratic objective functions are\ncommon in optimal control and other fields. Most SOCP solvers which use\ninterior-point methods are designed for linear objectives and convert quadratic\nobjectives into linear ones via slack variables and extra constraints, despite\nthe computational advantages of handling quadratic objectives directly. In\napplications like model-predictive control and online trajectory optimization,\nthese SOCPs have known sparsity structures and require rapid solutions. When\nsolving these problems, most solvers use sparse linear algebra routines, which\nintroduce computational overhead and hinder performance. In contrast, custom\nlinear algebra routines can exploit the known sparsity structure of problem\ndata and be significantly faster. This work makes two key contributions: (1)\nthe development of QOCO, an open-source C-based solver for quadratic objective\nSOCPs, and (2) the introduction of QOCOGEN, an open-source custom solver\ngenerator for quadratic objective SOCPs, which generates a solver written in C\nthat leverages custom linear algebra. Both implement a primal-dual\ninterior-point method with Mehrotra's predictor-corrector. Our benchmarks show\nthat QOCO is faster and more robust than many commonly used solvers, and\nsolvers generated by QOCOGEN are significantly faster than QOCO and are free of\ndynamic memory allocation making them an attractive option for real-time\noptimization on resource-constrained embedded systems.",

The resulting system of two coupled equations\nwith cubic nonlinearity is Hamiltonian, with the origin being an elliptic\nequilibrium characterized by two distinct linear frequencies associated with\nthe acoustic and optical wave modes. Understanding this complex wave\npropagation problem requires the explicit derivation of analytical formulas for\nthe nonlinear frequencies as functions of the relevant physical parameters. In\nthe small wave amplitude regime and away from internal resonances, by using\nHamiltonian Perturbation Theory, we obtain the first-order nonlinear correction\nto the linear frequencies.

Addressing these failures through human\nintervention is challenging due to the agents' opaque reasoning processes,\nmisalignment with human expectations, the complexity of agent dependencies, and\nthe high cost of manual inspection. This paper thus introduces a human-centered\nevaluation framework for Verifying LLM Agent failures (VeriLA), which\nsystematically assesses agent failures to reduce human effort and make these\nagent failures interpretable to humans. The framework first defines clear\nexpectations of each agent by curating human-designed agent criteria.

This approach enables\ngranular evaluation of each agent's performance by revealing failures from a\nhuman standard, offering clear guidelines for revision, and reducing human\ncognitive load.

    "abstract": "Optimization with matrix gradient orthogonalization has recently demonstrated\nimpressive results in the training of deep neural networks (Jordan et al.,\n2024; Liu et al., 2025). In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of\nthis approach. In particular, we show that the orthogonalized gradient method\ncan be seen as a first-order trust-region optimization method, where the\ntrust-region is defined in terms of the matrix spectral norm. Motivated by this\nobservation, we develop the stochastic non-Euclidean trust-region gradient\nmethod with momentum, which recovers the Muon optimizer (Jordan et al., 2024)\nas a special case, along with normalized SGD and signSGD with momentum\n(Cutkosky and Mehta, 2020; Sun et al., 2023). In addition, we prove\nstate-of-the-art convergence results for the proposed algorithm in a range of\nscenarios, which involve arbitrary non-Euclidean norms, constrained and\ncomposite problems, and non-convex, star-convex, first- and second-order smooth\nfunctions. Finally, our theoretical findings provide an explanation for several\npractical observations, including the practical superiority of Muon compared to\nthe Orthogonal-SGDM algorithm of Tuddenham et al.

    "abstract": "Solar sails enable propellant-free space missions by utilizing solar\nradiation pressure as thrust. However, disturbance torques act on the solar\nsail and effective attitude control leads to the continuous accumulation of\nreaction wheel angular momentum, necessitating an efficient momentum management\nstrategy to prevent saturation. This paper presents a novel momentum management\ncontroller using model predictive control (MPC) that is tailored for solar\nsails, accommodating the unique actuation mechanisms of an active mass\ntranslator (AMT) and reflectivity control devices (RCDs). A first-order hold\ndiscretization and tailored motion costs are applied to the AMT translation,\nwhile the RCD actuation is handled using pulse-width modulation (PWM)-inspired\nquantization to address their on-off inputs. To enhance prediction accuracy, an\niterative backwards-in-time MPC approach is introduced, incorporating the\neffects of PWM-quantized inputs into the optimization process. The dynamic\nmodel accounts for the time-dependent center of mass and moment of inertia\nchanges caused by AMT translation, extending its applicability to other\nspacecraft with mass-shifting actuators. Simulation results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework in reaction wheel desaturation,\nattitude control, and momentum management actuation efficiency, highlighting\nthe potential of integrating MPC to manage coupled nonlinear dynamics and\ndiscrete actuator constraints for solar sails.",

This paper presents a cognition-decision\nframework that integrates individual variability and commonalities in driver\nbehavior to quantify risk cognition and model dynamic decision-making. First, a\nrisk sensitivity model based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution is\ndeveloped to characterize individual differences in risk cognition. Then, a\ncognitive decision-making model based on the drift diffusion model (DDM) is\nintroduced to capture common decision-making mechanisms in high-risk\nenvironments. The DDM dynamically adjusts decision thresholds by integrating\ninitial bias, drift rate, and boundary parameters, adapting to variations in\nspeed, relative distance, and risk sensitivity to reflect diverse driving\nstyles and risk preferences. By simulating high-risk scenarios with lateral,\nlongitudinal, and multidimensional risk sources in a driving simulator, the\nproposed model accurately predicts cognitive responses and decision behaviors\nduring emergency maneuvers. Specifically, by incorporating driver-specific risk\nsensitivity, the model enables dynamic adjustments of key DDM parameters,\nallowing for personalized decision-making representations in diverse scenarios.\nComparative analysis with IDM, Gipps, and MOBIL demonstrates that DDM more\nprecisely captures human cognitive processes and adaptive decision-making in\nhigh-risk scenarios.

    "abstract": "Roughly speaking, a system is said to be robust if it can resist disturbances\nand still function correctly. For instance, if the requirement is that the\ntemperature remains in an allowed range $[l,h]$, then a system that remains in\na range $[l',h']\\subset[l,h]$ is more robust than one that reaches $l$ and $h$\nfrom time to time. In this example the initial specification is quantitative in\nnature, this is not the case in $\\omega$-regular properties. Still, it seems\nthere is a natural robustness preference relation induced by an\n$\\omega$-regular property. E.g. for a property requiring that every request is\neventually granted, one would say that a system where requests are granted two\nticks after they are issued is more robust than one in which requests are\nanswered ninety ticks after they are issued. In this work we manage to distill\na robustness preference relation that is induced by a given $\\omega$-regular\nlanguage. The robustness preference relation is a semantic notion (agnostic to\nthe given representation of the language) that relies on Wagner's hierarchy and\non Ehlers and Schewe's definition of natural rank of infinite words. It aligns\nwith our intuitions on common examples, satisfies some natural mathematical\ncriteria, and refines Tabuada and Neider's five-valued semantics into an\ninfinite domain.",

First, we construct an $\\Omega$-spectrum\n$\\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy\ngroup of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we\ndevelop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\\Omega$-spectrum\n$\\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed\non an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the\nconcept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with\ndecaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse\nindex theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a\ncrystallographic group $\\Gamma $ and define the $\\Omega$-spectrum\n$\\mathit{IP}_*^\\Gamma$ of $\\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases.

Also, existing text-to-image PnP\napproaches are highly computationally expensive. We herein address these\nchallenges by proposing a novel PnP inference paradigm specifically designed\nfor embedding generative models within stochastic inverse solvers, with special\nattention to Latent Consistency Models (LCMs), which distill LDMs into fast\ngenerators. We leverage our framework to propose LAtent consisTency INverse\nsOlver (LATINO), the first zero-shot PnP framework to solve inverse problems\nwith priors encoded by LCMs. Our conditioning mechanism avoids automatic\ndifferentiation and reaches SOTA quality in as little as 8 neural function\nevaluations. As a result, LATINO delivers remarkably accurate solutions and is\nsignificantly more memory and computationally efficient than previous\napproaches. We then embed LATINO within an empirical Bayesian framework that\nautomatically calibrates the text prompt from the observed measurements by\nmarginal maximum likelihood estimation. Extensive experiments show that prompt\nself-calibration greatly improves estimation, allowing LATINO with PRompt\nOptimization to define new SOTAs in image reconstruction quality and\ncomputational efficiency.

To tackle this challenge, quantum error correction (QEC)\nhas been considered, however, indistinguishable noise from the signal and the\nbias induced by unknown noise prevents it from recovering the enhanced\nprecision in practice. Meanwhile, virtual purification (VP), an error\nmitigation technique, has been recently shown to mitigate the bias induced by\nnoise in quantum metrology. In this work, we comparatively analyze the\nperformance of QEC and VP in a realistic quantum metrology scenario.

We then demonstrate that VP with a\nstabilizer state probe in $5$-qubit GHZ state and $7$-qubit Steane code state\ncan efficiently suppress the bias under local depolarizing noise.

Conventional methods of urban\nassessment -- from standardized surveys to AI-driven evaluations -- frequently\nrely on a single consensus metric (e.g., an average measure of inclusivity or\nsafety). Although such aggregations simplify design decisions, they risk\nobscuring the distinct perspectives of marginalized populations. In this paper,\nwe present findings from a community-centered study in Montreal involving 35\nresidents with diverse demographic and social identities, particularly\nwheelchair users, seniors, and LGBTQIA2+ individuals. Using rating and ranking\ntasks on 20 urban sites, we observe that disagreements are systematic rather\nthan random, reflecting structural inequalities, differing cultural values, and\npersonal experiences of safety and accessibility.\n  Based on these empirical insights, we propose negotiative alignment, an AI\nframework that treats disagreement as an essential input to be preserved,\nanalyzed, and addressed. Negotiative alignment builds on pluralistic models by\ndynamically updating stakeholder preferences through multi-agent negotiation\nmechanisms, ensuring no single perspective is marginalized. We outline how this\nframework can be integrated into urban analytics -- and other decision-making\ncontexts -- to retain minority viewpoints, adapt to changing stakeholder\nconcerns, and enhance fairness and accountability.

    "abstract": "The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their\ngrowing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating\nresearch ideas within academic settings. Existing solutions primarily rely on\nprompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea\nevaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to\ncomprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding\ntheir ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above\nchallenges, we propose GraphEval, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for\nidea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into\ncomprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint\nnodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation\nextraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be\nused to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the\nrobustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight\ngraph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free\nlabel propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known\nview-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN)\nthat is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with\nminimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in\nobjectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty\ndetection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea\nnovelty. Experiments on two datasets show GraphEval improves F1 scores by at\nleast 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, GraphEval can\neffectively detect plagiarized ideas.",

    "abstract": "The computational cost of traditional first-principles method quickly becomes\nprohibitively expensive as the number of atoms increases. This challenge is\nfurther amplified by the need to evaluate finite-temperature properties with\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations, which is inherently challenging to parallelize\ndue to sequential Markov chain updates. Here, we introduce Scalable Monte Carlo\n(SMC), an efficient MC simulation method that overcomes the parallelization\nbottlenecks in conventional MC simulation, reducing the computational\ncomplexity of a MC sweep from quadratic to linear. We present a GPU\nimplementation of the SMC method, SMC-GPU, which simultaneously harnesses the\nthousands of processing cores on a GPU to accelerate the computation. By\nadopting a data-driven workflow that surrogates the computationally expensive\ndensity functional theory (DFT) with ML models, we demonstrate that SMC-GPU is\ncapable of simulating systems of more than one-billion atoms, while maintaining\nthe accuracy of first-principles methods. Using this unprecedented capability,\nwe performed billion-atom MC simulations to investigate the nanostructure\nevolution of two important high-entropy alloys (HEAs), FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW,\nin which the nanostructures are believed to be responsible for their superb\nmechanical properties. Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanostructures,\nincluding nanoparticles (NP), 3D-connected NP, and disorder protected\nnanophases. We quantitatively analyze the size, composition, and morphology of\nthe nanostructures, as well as directly simulate the atom-probe-tomography\n(APT) needle. The results align well with available experimental observations.\nThis work underscores the promising potential of leveraging large-scale MC\nsimulation to explore the largely uncharted territory of nanostructure\nevolution in HEAs.",

In addition, these methods usually mask the limb textures\nof the input for the clothing-agnostic person representation, which results in\ninaccurate predictions for human limb regions (i.e., the exposed arm skin),\nespecially when transforming between long-sleeved and short-sleeved garments.\nTo address these problems, we present a progressive virtual try-on framework,\nnamed PL-VTON, which performs pixel-level clothing warping based on multiple\nattributes of clothing and embeds explicit limb-aware features to generate\nphoto-realistic try-on results. Specifically, we design a Multi-attribute\nClothing Warping (MCW) module that adopts a two-stage alignment strategy based\non multiple attributes to progressively estimate pixel-level clothing\ndisplacements. A Human Parsing Estimator (HPE) is then introduced to\nsemantically divide the person into various regions, which provides structural\nconstraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture bleeding between\nclothing and limb regions.

OEL robots are highly relevant for applications as they can\nautonomously leverage acquired knowledge to perform tasks beneficial to human\nusers in unstructured environments, addressing challenges unforeseen at design\ntime. However, OEL robots face a significant limitation: their openness may\nlead them to waste time learning information that is irrelevant to tasks\ndesired by specific users. Here, we propose a solution called `Purpose-Directed\nOpen-Ended Learning' (POEL), based on the novel concept of `purpose' introduced\nin previous work. A purpose specifies what users want the robot to achieve. The\nkey insight of this work is that purpose can focus OEL on learning\nself-generated classes of tasks that, while unknown during autonomous learning\n(as typical in OEL), involve objects relevant to the purpose. This concept is\noperationalised in a novel robot architecture capable of receiving a human\npurpose through speech-to-text, analysing the scene to identify objects, and\nusing a Large Language Model to reason about which objects are\npurpose-relevant. These objects are then used to bias OEL exploration towards\ntheir spatial proximity and to self-generate rewards that favour interactions\nwith them.

    "abstract": "The presence of non-Brownian spherical particles dispersed in a liquid\nmodifies the impact and spreading dynamics of a drop on a hydrophilic\nsubstrate. This difference in spreading dynamics is attributed to the increase\nin the suspension's viscosity caused by the particles. Similarly, anisotropic\nnon-Brownian particles, such as fibers, also increase the bulk viscosity. In\naddition to the fiber diameter, D, the length, L, which determines the aspect\nratio A = L/D, is crucial in controlling the fiber suspension viscosity.\nTherefore, we hypothesize that the drop impact of fiber suspensions with\ndifferent volume fractions will result in a similar modification of the\nspreading dynamics. To investigate the impact and spreading dynamics, we\nprepared suspensions of fibers with an aspect ratio A = 12 at different volume\nfractions, spanning the dilute, semi-dilute, and dense concentration regimes.\nAdditionally, we conducted a subset of experiments with aspect ratios A = 4 and\nA = 20. Furthermore, we characterized the thickness of the resulting droplet\nfilm (the coating) and the orientation of fibers after the spreading dynamics\nreached a steady state. The presence of fibers results in a decrease in the\nfinal droplet size, as an increase in volume fraction leads to an increase in\nthe suspension viscosity. To rationalize these results, we used a modified\nequation, originally developed for spherical particles, which incorporates the\nsuspension viscosity. Furthermore, we observed that volume fraction plays only\na weak role in controlling splashing. However, it is crucial in determining the\nfinal thickness and resulting fiber coating. We also used a novel approach to\nquantify the final fiber orientation and showed that the resulting distribution\nis anisotropic within the quantified range.",

The reactive molecule is modeled using a triple-well potential,\nallowing two competing reaction pathways that yield distinct products.\nDynamical and equilibrium simulations are performed using the numerically exact\nhierarchical equations of motion approach in real- and imaginary-time\nformulations, respectively, both implemented with tree tensor network\ndecomposition schemes. We consider two illustrative cases: one dominated by\nslow kinetics and another by ultrafast processes. Our results demonstrate that\nthe rates of ground-state reaction pathways can be selectively enhanced when\nthe cavity frequency is tuned into resonance with a vibrational transition\ndirectly leading to the formation of the corresponding product, even when that\ntransition is spectroscopically dark. However, tuning cavity frequency to match\nan absorption-dominant transition shared across both reaction pathways does not\nnecessarily result in pronounced rate enhancements and selectivity. Together\nwith an additional analysis using an asymmetric double-well model, we highlight\nthe greater complexity of underlying factors governing chemical reactivity,\nwhich extend beyond considerations of transition dipole strengths and thermal\npopulation distributions that shape linear spectroscopy. Furthermore, we found\nthat in all scenarios, the equilibrium populations remain unchanged when the\nmolecule is moved into the cavity, regardless of the cavity frequency.

    "abstract": "Graph diffusion models have recently been proposed to synthesize entire\ngraphs, such as molecule graphs. Although existing methods have shown great\nperformance in generating entire graphs for graph-level learning tasks, no\ngraph diffusion models have been developed to generate synthetic graph\nstructures, that is, synthetic nodes and associated edges within a given graph,\nfor node-level learning tasks. Inspired by the research in the computer vision\nliterature using synthetic data for enhanced performance, we propose Diffusion\non Graph (DoG), which generates synthetic graph structures to boost the\nperformance of GNNs. The synthetic graph structures generated by DoG are\ncombined with the original graph to form an augmented graph for the training of\nnode-level learning tasks, such as node classification and graph contrastive\nlearning (GCL). To improve the efficiency of the generation process, a Bi-Level\nNeighbor Map Decoder (BLND) is introduced in DoG. To mitigate the adverse\neffect of the noise introduced by the synthetic graph structures, a low-rank\nregularization method is proposed for the training of graph neural networks\n(GNNs) on the augmented graphs. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets\nfor semi-supervised node classification and graph contrastive learning have\nbeen conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of DoG with low-rank\nregularization.

    "abstract": "The aim of multiple object tracking (MOT) is to detect all objects in a video\nand bind them into multiple trajectories. Generally, this process is carried\nout in two steps: detecting objects and associating them across frames based on\nvarious cues and metrics. Many studies and applications adopt object\nappearance, also known as re-identification (ReID) features, for target\nmatching through straightforward similarity calculation. However, we argue that\nthis practice is overly naive and thus overlooks the unique characteristics of\nMOT tasks. Unlike regular re-identification tasks that strive to distinguish\nall potential targets in a general representation, multi-object tracking\ntypically immerses itself in differentiating similar targets within the same\nvideo sequence. Therefore, we believe that seeking a more suitable feature\nrepresentation space based on the different sample distributions of each\nsequence will enhance tracking performance. In this paper, we propose using\nhistory-aware transformations on ReID features to achieve more discriminative\nappearance representations. Specifically, we treat historical trajectory\nfeatures as conditions and employ a tailored Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD)\nto find a spatial projection matrix that maximizes the differentiation between\ndifferent trajectories. Our extensive experiments reveal that this\ntraining-free projection can significantly boost feature-only trackers to\nachieve competitive, even superior tracking performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods while also demonstrating impressive zero-shot transfer\ncapabilities. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal and further\nencourages future investigation into the importance and customization of ReID\nmodels in multiple object tracking.

    "abstract": "With the continuous emergence of various social media platforms frequently\nused in daily life, the multimodal meme understanding (MMU) task has been\ngarnering increasing attention. MMU aims to explore and comprehend the meanings\nof memes from various perspectives by performing tasks such as metaphor\nrecognition, sentiment analysis, intention detection, and offensiveness\ndetection. Despite making progress, limitations persist due to the loss of\nfine-grained metaphorical visual clue and the neglect of multimodal text-image\nweak correlation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-granular\nmultimodal clue fusion model (MGMCF) to advance MMU. Firstly, we design an\nobject-level semantic mining module to extract object-level image feature\nclues, achieving fine-grained feature clue extraction and enhancing the model's\nability to capture metaphorical details and semantics. Secondly, we propose a\nbrand-new global-local cross-modal interaction model to address the weak\ncorrelation between text and images. This model facilitates effective\ninteraction between global multimodal contextual clues and local unimodal\nfeature clues, strengthening their representations through a bidirectional\ncross-modal attention mechanism. Finally, we devise a dual-semantic guided\ntraining strategy to enhance the model's understanding and alignment of\nmultimodal representations in the semantic space. Experiments conducted on the\nwidely-used MET-MEME bilingual dataset demonstrate significant improvements\nover state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, there is an 8.14% increase in\nprecision for offensiveness detection task, and respective accuracy\nenhancements of 3.53%, 3.89%, and 3.52% for metaphor recognition, sentiment\nanalysis, and intention detection tasks.

To\naddress this, we propose a novel reward model approach called the Hierarchical\nReward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning\nsteps at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. HRM excels at assessing\nmulti-step reasoning coherence, especially when flawed steps are later\ncorrected through self-reflection. To further reduce the cost of generating\ntraining data, we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation\nstrategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which merges two\nconsecutive reasoning steps into one within the tree structure. By applying HNC\nto MCTS-generated reasoning trajectories, we enhance the diversity and\nrobustness of HRM training data while introducing controlled noise with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset show that HRM,\ntogether with HNC, provides more stable and reliable evaluations than PRM.\nFurthermore, cross-domain evaluations on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets\ndemonstrate HRM's strong generalization and robustness across a variety of\nreasoning tasks.",

Here, using photonic quantum states as an\nexample, we harness the synthetic dimensions of orbital angular momentum (OAM)\nto discover a rich tapestry of topological maps in high dimensional spaces.\nMoving beyond spin textured fields, we demonstrate topologies using only one\ndegree of freedom, the OAM of light.

Subsequently they have been developed for other linear theories,\nsuch as the Dirac, Proca and Maxwell fields, but the particular features of\neach require slightly different treatments.\n  The first aim of this paper is to give a generalised definition of Hadamard\nstates for linear bosonic and fermionic theories encompassing a range of\ntheories that are described by Green-hyperbolic operators with 'decomposable'\nPauli-Jordan propagators, including theories whose bicharacteristic curves are\nnot necessarily determined by the spacetime metric. The new definition reduces\nto previous definitions for normally hyperbolic and Dirac-type operators. We\ndevelop the theory of Hadamard states in detail, showing that our definition\npropagates under the equation of motion, and is also stable under pullbacks and\nsuitable pushforwards. There is an equivalent formulation in terms of Hilbert\nspace valued distributions, and the generalised Hadamard condition on 2-point\nfunctions constrains the singular behaviour of all $n$-point functions. For\nlocally covariant theories, the Hadamard states form a covariant state space.\nIt is also shown how Hadamard states may be combined through tensor products or\nreduced by partial tracing while preserving the Hadamard property. As a\nparticular application it is shown that state updates resulting from\nnonselective measurements preserve the Hadamard condition.\n  The treatment we give was partly inspired by a recent work of Moretti, Murro\nand Volpe (MMV) on the neutral Proca field. Among our other applications, we\nrevisit the neutral Proca field and prove a complete equivalence between the\nMMV definition of Hadamard states and an older work of Fewster and Pfenning.",

However, they\nexhibit poor performance when confronted with sparse inputs, primarily due to\nthe sparse distribution of Gaussian points and insufficient view supervision.\nTo relieve these challenges, we propose SPC-GS, leveraging Scene-layout-based\nGaussian Initialization (SGI) and Semantic-Prompt Consistency (SPC)\nRegularization for open-world free view synthesis with sparse inputs.\nSpecifically, SGI provides a dense, scene-layout-based Gaussian distribution by\nutilizing view-changed images generated from the video generation model and\nview-constraint Gaussian points densification. Additionally, SPC mitigates\nlimited view supervision by employing semantic-prompt-based consistency\nconstraints developed by SAM2. This approach leverages available semantics from\ntraining views, serving as instructive prompts, to optimize visually\noverlapping regions in novel views with 2D and 3D consistency constraints.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SPC-GS across\nReplica and ScanNet benchmarks.

    "abstract": "With the advancement of Industry 4.0, intelligent manufacturing extensively\nemploys sensors for real-time multidimensional data collection, playing a\ncrucial role in equipment monitoring, process optimisation, and efficiency\nenhancement. Industrial data exhibit characteristics such as multi-source\nheterogeneity, nonlinearity, strong coupling, and temporal interactions, while\nalso being affected by noise interference. These complexities make it\nchallenging for traditional anomaly detection methods to extract key features,\nimpacting detection accuracy and stability. Traditional machine learning\napproaches often struggle with such complex data due to limitations in\nprocessing capacity and generalisation ability, making them inadequate for\npractical applications. While deep learning feature extraction modules have\ndemonstrated remarkable performance in image and text processing, they remain\nineffective when applied to multi-source heterogeneous industrial data lacking\nexplicit correlations. Moreover, existing multi-source heterogeneous data\nprocessing techniques still rely on dimensionality reduction and feature\nselection, which can lead to information loss and difficulty in capturing\nhigh-order interactions. To address these challenges, this study applies the\nEAPCR and Time-EAPCR models proposed in previous research and introduces a new\nmodel, Time-EAPCR-T, where Transformer replaces the LSTM module in the\ntime-series processing component of Time-EAPCR. This modification effectively\naddresses multi-source data heterogeneity, facilitates efficient multi-source\nfeature fusion, and enhances the temporal feature extraction capabilities of\nmulti-source industrial data.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches across four industrial datasets,\nhighlighting its broad application potential.",

Study 1 (N=85) revealed a dominant\nlatent factor - termed the \"A-factor\" - that accounts for 44.16% of variance\nacross diverse AI interaction tasks. Study 2 (N=286) refined the measurement\ntool by examining four key dimensions of AI literacy: communication\neffectiveness, creative idea generation, content evaluation, and step-by-step\ncollaboration, resulting in an 18-item assessment battery. Study 3 (N=146)\nvalidated this instrument in a controlled laboratory setting, demonstrating its\npredictive validity for real-world task performance. Results indicate that AI\nliteracy significantly predicts performance on complex, language-based creative\ntasks but shows domain specificity in its predictive power. Additionally,\nregression analyses identified several significant predictors of AI literacy,\nincluding cognitive abilities (IQ), educational background, prior AI\nexperience, and training history.

    "abstract": "Inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) events, characterized by higher-energy\nparticles arriving later than lower-energy particles, challenge the classical\nunderstanding of SEP events and are increasingly observed by spacecraft, such\nas Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO). However, the mechanisms\nunderlying IVD events remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate\nthe physical processes responsible for long-duration IVD events by analyzing\nthe SEP event observed by SolO on 2022 June 7. We explore the role of evolving\nshock connectivity, particle acceleration at interplanetary (IP) shocks, and\ncross-field transport in shaping the observed particle profiles.We utilize data\nfrom Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) suite onboard SolO to analyze the\ncharacteristics of the IVD, and model the event using the Heliospheric\nEnergetic Particle Acceleration and Transport (HEPAT) model. The IVD event\nexhibited a distinct and long-duration IVD signature, across proton energies\nfrom 1 to 20 MeV and lasting for approximately 10 hours. Simulations suggest\nthat evolving shock connectivity and the evolution of shock play a primary role\nin the IVD signature, with SolO transitioning from shock flank to nose over\ntime, resulting in a gradual increase in maximum particle energy along the\nfield line. Furthermore, model results show that limited cross-field diffusion\ncan influence both the nose energy and the duration of the IVD event. This\nstudy demonstrates that long-duration IVD events are primarily driven by\nevolving magnetic connectivity along a non-uniform shock that evolves over\ntime, where the connection moves to more efficient acceleration sites as the\nshock propagates farther from the Sun. Other mechanisms, such as acceleration\ntime at the shock, may also contribute to the observed IVD features.",

The above mentioned works, and the improvement of Kumar,\nMeel and Pote (AISTATS 2025), provided polylogarithmic algorithms for this\ntask.\n  In this work we shatter the polylogarithmic barrier, and provide an estimator\nfor the mass of individual elements that uses only $O(\\log \\log N) +\nO(\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon))$ conditional samples. We complement this result\nwith an $\\Omega(\\log\\log N)$ lower bound.\n  We then show that our mass estimator provides an improvement (and in some\ncases a unifying framework) for a number of related tasks, such as testing by\nlearning of any label-invariant property, and distance estimation between two\n(unknown) distribution. By considering some known lower bounds, this also shows\nthat the full power of the conditional model is indeed required for the\ndoubly-logarithmic upper bound.\n  Finally, we exponentially improve the previous lower bound on testing by\nlearning of label-invariant properties from double-logarithmic to $\\Omega(\\log\nN)$ conditional samples, whereas our testing by learning algorithm provides an\nupper bound of $O(\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)\\cdot\\log N \\log \\log N)$.",

    "abstract": "While fully digital precoding achieves superior performance in massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, it comes with significant\ndrawbacks in terms of computational complexity and power consumption,\nparticularly when operating at millimeter-wave frequencies and beyond. Hybrid\nanalog-digital architectures address this by reducing radio frequency (RF)\nchains while maintaining performance in sparse multipath environments. However,\nmost hybrid precoder designs assume ideal, infinite-resolution analog phase\nshifters, which cannot be implemented in actual systems. Another practical\nconstraint is the limited fronthaul capacity between the baseband processor and\narray, implying that each entry of the digital precoder must be picked from a\nfinite set of quantization labels. This paper proposes novel designs for the\nlimited-resolution analog and digital precoders by exploiting two well-known\nMIMO symbol detection algorithms, namely sphere decoding (SD) and expectation\npropagation (EP). The goal is to minimize the Euclidean distance between the\noptimal fully digital precoder and the hybrid precoder to minimize the\ndegradation caused by the finite resolution of the analog and digital\nprecoders. Taking an alternative optimization approach, we first apply the SD\nmethod to find the precoders in each iteration optimally. Then, we apply the\nlower-complexity EP method which finds a near-optimal solution at a reduced\ncomputational cost. The effectiveness of the proposed designs is validated via\nnumerical simulations, where we show that the proposed symbol detection-based\nprecoder designs significantly outperform the nearest point mapping scheme\nwhich is commonly used for finding a sub-optimal solution to discrete\noptimization problems.",

    "abstract": "Translating software written in legacy languages to modern languages, such as\nC to Rust, has significant benefits in improving memory safety while\nmaintaining high performance. However, manual translation is cumbersome,\nerror-prone, and produces unidiomatic code. Large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated promise in producing idiomatic translations, but offer no\ncorrectness guarantees as they lack the ability to capture all the semantics\ndifferences between the source and target languages. To resolve this issue, we\npropose SACTOR, an LLM-driven C-to-Rust zero-shot translation tool using a\ntwo-step translation methodology: an \"unidiomatic\" step to translate C into\nRust while preserving semantics, and an \"idiomatic\" step to refine the code to\nfollow Rust's semantic standards. SACTOR utilizes information provided by\nstatic analysis of the source C program to address challenges such as pointer\nsemantics and dependency resolution. To validate the correctness of the\ntranslated result from each step, we use end-to-end testing via the foreign\nfunction interface to embed our translated code segment into the original code.\nWe evaluate the translation of 200 programs from two datasets and two case\nstudies, comparing the performance of GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0\nFlash, Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek-R1 in SACTOR. Our results demonstrate that\nSACTOR achieves high correctness and improved idiomaticity, with the\nbest-performing model (DeepSeek-R1) reaching 93% and (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5,\nDeepSeek-R1) reaching 84% correctness (on each dataset, respectively), while\nproducing more natural and Rust-compliant translations compared to existing\nmethods.",

To address this gap, we propose a\nhierarchical oscillator-based model to better understand the perception of\ncomplex musical rhythms in biological systems.

    "abstract": "Representation learning has emerged as a crucial focus in machine and deep\nlearning, involving the extraction of meaningful and useful features and\npatterns from the input data, thereby enhancing the performance of various\ndownstream tasks such as classification, clustering, and prediction. Current\nmainstream representation learning methods primarily rely on non-linear data\nmining techniques such as kernel methods and deep neural networks to extract\nabstract knowledge from complex datasets. However, most of these methods are\nblack-box, lacking transparency and interpretability in the learning process,\nwhich constrains their practical utility. To this end, this paper introduces a\nnovel representation learning method grounded in an interpretable fuzzy\nrule-based model. Specifically, it is built upon the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy\nsystem (TSK-FS) to initially map input data to a high-dimensional fuzzy feature\nspace through the antecedent part of the TSK-FS. Subsequently, a novel\ndifferentiable optimization method is proposed for the consequence part\nlearning which can preserve the model's interpretability and transparency while\nfurther exploring the nonlinear relationships within the data. This\noptimization method retains the essence of traditional optimization, with\ncertain parts of the process parameterized corresponding differentiable modules\nconstructed, and a deep optimization process implemented. Consequently, this\nmethod not only enhances the model's performance but also ensures its\ninterpretability. Moreover, a second-order geometry preservation method is\nintroduced to further improve the robustness of the proposed method. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on various benchmark datasets validate the superiority of\nthe proposed method, highlighting its potential for advancing representation\nlearning methodologies.",

We examined the capabilities of methods based on the weak-field\napproximation and line bisectors to extract fast and reliable information about\nthe height stratification of the magnetic field and line-of-sight velocities,\nrespectively, from high spatial resolution observations of the Mg I b$_2$ line\nat 5173 \\r{A}. Methods. The Mg I b$_2$ line was analyzed alongside the Fe I\n6173 \\r{A} line to help constrain the physical conditions of the photosphere.\nAdditionally, we present the first high-resolution inversions of the Mg I b$_2$\nline under nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) conditions conducted over\na large field of view using a full-Stokes multiline approach. To determine the\noptimal inversion strategy, we performed several tests on the Mg I b$_2$ line\nusing the Fourier Transform Spectrometer atlas profile before applying it to\nour observations. Results. The good correlations between the traditional\nmethods and the NLTE inversions indicate that the weak-field approximation is\ngenerally a reliable diagnostic tool at moderate field strengths for the rapid\ninference of the longitudinal magnetic field from the Mg I b$_2$ line. In\ncontrast, line bisectors exhibit poorer correlations with the NLTE inferred\nplasma velocities, suggesting that they might not be suitable for deriving\nvelocity gradients from the Mg I b$_2$ line. Furthermore, to accurately derive\nthe thermodynamic properties of the solar atmosphere from this line, the more\ncomplex, and time-consuming, NLTE Stokes inversions are necessary. This work\nalso provides observational evidence of the existence of low-lying canopies\nexpanding above bright magnetic structures and pores near the low chromosphere.",

However, efficiently processing long videos remains a\nchallenge due to the ``Sampling Dilemma'': low-density sampling risks missing\ncritical information, while high-density sampling introduces redundancy. To\naddress this issue, we introduce LSDBench, the first benchmark designed to\nevaluate LVLMs on long-video tasks by constructing high Necessary Sampling\nDensity (NSD) questions, where NSD represents the minimum sampling density\nrequired to accurately answer a given question. LSDBench focuses on dense,\nshort-duration actions to rigorously assess the sampling strategies employed by\nLVLMs. To tackle the challenges posed by high-NSD questions, we propose a novel\nReasoning-Driven Hierarchical Sampling (RHS) framework, which combines global\nlocalization of question-relevant cues with local dense sampling for precise\ninference.

Inspired by the principle\nof modularization in software development, in this work, we propose a novel\nprompting technique, called MoT, to enhance the code generation performance of\nLLMs. At first, MoT exploits modularization principles to decompose complex\nprogramming problems into smaller, independent reasoning steps, enabling a more\nstructured and interpretable problem-solving process. This hierarchical\nstructure improves the LLM's ability to comprehend complex programming\nproblems. Then, it structures the reasoning process using an MLR Graph\n(Multi-Level Reasoning Graph), which hierarchically organizes reasoning steps.\nThis approach enhances modular understanding and ensures better alignment\nbetween reasoning steps and the generated code, significantly improving code\ngeneration performance. Our experiments on two advanced LLMs (GPT-4o-mini and\nDeepSeek-R1), comparing MoT to six baseline prompting techniques across six\nwidely used datasets, HumanEval, HumanEval-ET, HumanEval+, MBPP, MBPP-ET, and\nMBPP+, demonstrate that MoT significantly outperforms existing baselines (e.g.,\nCoT and SCoT), achieving Pass@1 scores ranging from 58.1% to 95.1%.

Here, we propose an\nadvanced Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion that drives cracking based on the\nvisco-elastic stress state in ice. This criterion is implemented in a phase\nfield fracture framework, and finite element simulations are conducted to\ndetermine the critical conditions that can trigger ice cliff collapse. Results\ndemonstrate that fast-moving glaciers with negligible basal friction are prone\nto tensile failure causing crevasse propagation far away from the ice front;\nwhilst slow-moving glaciers with significant basal friction are likely to\nexhibit shear failure near the ice front. Results also indicate that seawater\npressure plays a major role in modulating cliff failure. For land terminating\nglaciers, full thickness cliff failure is observed if the glacier exceeds a\ncritical height, dependent on cohesive strength $\\tau_\\mathrm{c}$ ($H \\approx\n120\\;\\text{m}$ for $\\tau_\\mathrm{c}=0.5\\;\\text{MPa}$). For marine-terminating\nglaciers, ice cliff failure occurs if a critical glacier free-board\n($H-h_\\mathrm{w}$) is exceeded, with ice slumping only observed above the\nocean-water height; for $\\tau_\\mathrm{c} = 0.5\\;\\text{MPa}$, the\nmodel-predicted critical free-board is $H-h_\\mathrm{w} \\approx 215\\;\\text{m}$,\nwhich is in good agreement with field observations. While the critical\nfree-board height is larger than that predicted by some previous models, we\ncannot conclude that marine ice cliff instability is less likely because we do\nnot include other failure processes such as hydrofracture of basal crevasses\nand plastic necking.",

Copper surfaces are often\nexposed to hydrogen in the form of charged ions. The hydrogen ions can\naccelerate towards the surface, resulting in an accumulation of hydrogen below\nthe surface. Harmless in low concentrations, prolonged hydrogen exposure can\nlead to dramatic changes on copper surfaces. This effect is visible to the\nnaked eye in the form of blisters densely covering the exposed surface.\nBlisters are structural modifications that can affect the physical properties\nof the surface including, for example, vacuum dielectric strength. Using\nscanning electron microscopy we found that the blistering of the irradiated\npolycrystalline copper surface does not grow uniformly with ion fluence.\nInitially, only some grains exhibit blisters, while others remain intact. Our\nexperiments indicate that grains with the 100 orientation are the most prone to\nblistering, while the grains oriented in the 110 are the most resistant to it.\nMoreover, we noticed that blisters assume different shapes correlating with\nspecific grain orientation. Good agreement of experiments with the atomistic\nsimulations explains the difference in the shapes of the blisters by specific\nbehavior of dislocations within the FCC crystal structure. Moreover, our\nsimulations reveal the correlation of the delay in blister formation on\nsurfaces with certain orientations compared to the others with the dependence\nof the hydrogen penetration depth and the depth and amount of vacancies in\ncopper on the orientation of the irradiated surface.",

First, we introduce a novel compact, non-oscillatory\nstabilization mechanism that effectively suppresses spurious oscillations while\npreserving the high-order accuracy of CDG methods. Unlike existing\nlimiter-based approaches that rely on large stencils or problem-specific\nparameters for oscillation control, our dual damping mechanism is inspired by\nCDG-based numerical dissipation and leverages overlapping solutions within the\nCDG framework, significantly enhancing stability while maintaining compactness.\nOur approach is free of problem-dependent parameters and complex characteristic\ndecomposition, making it efficient and robust. Second, we provide a rigorous\nstability and optimal error analysis for fully discrete Runge-Kutta (RK) CDG\nschemes, addressing a gap in the theoretical understanding of these methods.\nSpecifically, we establish the approximate skew-symmetry and weak boundedness\nof the CDG discretization. These results enable us to rigorously analyze the\nfully discrete error estimates for our oscillation-eliminating CDG (OECDG)\nmethod, a challenging task due to its nonlinear nature, even for linear\nadvection equations. Building on this framework, we reformulate nonlinear\noscillation-eliminating CDG schemes as linear RK CDG schemes with a nonlinear\nsource term, extending error estimates beyond the linear case to schemes with\nnonlinear oscillation control. While existing error analyses for DG or CDG\nschemes have largely been restricted to linear cases without nonlinear\noscillation-control techniques, our analysis represents an important\ntheoretical advancement.

However,\na specific data synthesis technique tailored for VI-ReID models has yet to be\nexplored. In this paper, we present a novel data generation framework, dubbed\nDiffusion-based VI-ReID data Expansion (DiVE), that automatically obtain\nmassive RGB-IR paired images with identity preserving by decoupling identity\nand modality to improve the performance of VI-ReID models. Specifically,\nidentity representation is acquired from a set of samples sharing the same ID,\nwhereas the modality of images is learned by fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion\n(SD) on modality-specific data. DiVE extend the text-driven image synthesis to\nidentity-preserving RGB-IR multimodal image synthesis. This approach\nsignificantly reduces data collection and annotation costs by directly\nincorporating synthetic data into ReID model training.

    "abstract": "In the theoretical study of two-dimensional systems, difficulties emerge as\nthat quantum phase transitions at zero temperature cause low- and\nhigh-temperature scenarios to belong to different branches, while the\nMermin-Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking at finite\ntemperatures, excluding a Landau phase transition marked by a critical\ntemperature $T_c$. In many-body theory, fundamental symmetries like\nWard-Takahashi identity (WTI), Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem (FDT), and\nPauli-repulsive principle must be satisfied, yet widely-used approximate\ntheories struggle to meet them simultaneously. We introduce a symmetrization\ntheory that, by using spurious broken phases from approximate theories, can\nnaturally generate different low- and high-temperature branches. Employing the\nGW method beyond mean-field and the covariance scheme, which strictly satisfy\nWTI and FDT, we numerically show that the violation of Pauli-repulsive\nprinciple is significantly less than that in mean-field, and further restore\nPauli-repulsive principle without breaking WTI and FDT. By calculating\nsymmetrized one-body Green's function and two-body correlation function and\ncomparing them with accurate results from Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo\n(DQMC), we demonstrate its numerical accuracy at low temperatures and strong\ncoupling. This symmetrization theory can be easily applied to other\ntwo-dimensional systems at low temperatures.",

It has been\ndemonstrated in our previous work that SubChCFD is highly adaptable to HTGR\nfuel designs and performs exceptionally well in modelling steady-state\nprocesses. In this study, the approach is extended to simulate a Loss of Flow\nAccident (LOFA) transient, where coolant circulation is disrupted, causing the\ntransition from forced convection to buoyancy-driven natural circulation within\nthe reactor core. To enable SubChCFD to capture the complex physics involved,\ncorrections were introduced to the empirical correlations to account for the\neffects of flow unsteadiness, property variation and buoyancy.\n  A 1/12th sector of the reactor core, representing the smallest symmetric\nunit, was modelled using a coarse mesh of approximately 60 million cells. This\nmesh size is about 6% of that required for a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes\n(RANS) model, where mesh sizes can typically reach the order of 1 billion cells\nfor such configurations.

    "abstract": "This paper establishes the minimum entropy principle (MEP) for the\nrelativistic Euler equations with a broad class of equations of state (EOSs)\nand addresses the challenge of preserving the local version of the discovered\nMEP in high-order numerical schemes. At the continuous level, we find out a\nfamily of entropy pairs for the relativistic Euler equations and provide\nrigorous analysis to prove the strict convexity of entropy under a necessary\nand sufficient condition. At the numerical level, we develop a rigorous\nframework for designing provably entropy-preserving high-order schemes that\nensure both physical admissibility and the discovered MEP. The relativistic\neffects, coupled with the abstract and general EOS formulation, introduce\nsignificant challenges not encountered in the nonrelativistic case or with the\nideal EOS. In particular, entropy is a highly nonlinear and implicit function\nof the conservative variables, making it particularly difficult to enforce\nentropy preservation. To address these challenges, we establish a series of\nauxiliary theories via highly technical inequalities. Another key innovation is\nthe use of geometric quasi-linearization (GQL), which reformulates the\nnonlinear constraints into equivalent linear ones by introducing additional\nfree parameters. These advancements form the foundation of our\nentropy-preserving analysis. We propose novel, robust, locally\nentropy-preserving high-order frameworks. A central challenge is accurately\nestimating the local minimum of entropy, particularly in the presence of shock\nwaves at unknown locations. To address this, we introduce two new approaches\nfor estimating local lower bounds of specific entropy, which prove effective\nfor both smooth and discontinuous problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat our entropy-preserving methods maintain high-order accuracy while\neffectively suppressing spurious oscillations.",

To address this problem,\nthis paper studies the caching mechanism for MAR by leveraging two types of\nredundancy: Token Redundancy indicates that a large portion of tokens have very\nsimilar representations in the adjacent decoding steps, which allows us to\nfirst cache them in previous steps and then reuse them in the later steps.\nCondition Redundancy indicates that the difference between conditional and\nunconditional output in classifier-free guidance exhibits very similar values\nin adjacent steps.

Additionally, the image expert processes\nimage tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and\nreducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities.

The Cantonese language used in\nHong Kong presents unique challenges for natural language processing due to its\nrich cultural nuances and lack of dedicated evaluation datasets. The\nHKCanto-Eval benchmark addresses this gap by evaluating the performance of\nlarge language models (LLMs) on Cantonese language understanding tasks,\nextending to English and Written Chinese for cross-lingual evaluation.\nHKCanto-Eval integrates cultural and linguistic nuances intrinsic to Hong Kong,\nproviding a robust framework for assessing language models in realistic\nscenarios.

However, their application the infrared (IR) is\nlimited by silicon's intrinsic bandgap, which restricts its detection to\nphotons with wavelengths shorter than 1100 nm. Although several methods have\nbeen developed to extend silicon photodetectors further in the IR range, these\napproaches often introduce additional challenges, such as increased fabrication\ncomplexity and compatibility issues with standard CMOS processes. Here, we\npresent an approach to overcome these limitations by integrating disordered\nmetasurfaces with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), enabling IR detection by\nsilicon photodetectors. The disordered design consists of hybrid Mie-plasmonic\ncavities, which can enhance both the near-field localization and wide-band\nlight absorption from visible to IR, improving photocurrent conversion.\nCompared to ordered structures, the infrared absorption and near field of the\nhighly disordered configuration are increased by 2.6-folds and 3.9-folds,\nrespectively. UCNPs not only convert near-infrared photons into visible light\nbut also enhance absorption in the mid-infrared range, thereby improving hot\nelectron generation. The measured responsivity of the disordered element for\n1550 nm laser is up to 0.22 A/W at room temperature, corresponding to an\nexternal quantum efficiency of 17.6%.

However, there remains a considerable gap in the\nconstruction and utilization of knowledge base, which plays important roles in\nestablishing consensus among communication participants through knowledge\ntransferring and sharing. Current knowledge base designs typically involve\ncomplex structures, which lead to significant computational overheads and heavy\nreliance on manually annotated datasets, making it difficult to adapt to\nexisting encoder-decoder models. Hence, without knowledge transferring and\nsharing within the network results in poor generalization of encoder-decoder.\nThis necessitates model training for specific tasks and datasets, significantly\nlimiting the scalability of semantic communication systems to larger networks.\nTo address these challenges, we propose an innovative Contrastive\nRepresentations Learning based Semantic Communication Framework (CRLSC). In\nCRLSC, the server-side pre-trained large model utilizes large-scale public\ndatasets to construct shared knowledge base. Local-side encoders in terminal\ndevices conduct training guided by shared knowledge base. These trained\nencoders can then build private knowledge bases from private datasets and\nfine-tune decoders for specific tasks.

    "abstract": "Deep multi-view clustering incorporating graph learning has presented\ntremendous potential. Most methods encounter costly square time consumption\nw.r.t. data size. Theoretically, anchor-based graph learning can alleviate this\nlimitation, but related deep models mainly rely on manual discretization\napproaches to select anchors, which indicates that 1) the anchors are fixed\nduring model training and 2) they may deviate from the true cluster\ndistribution. Consequently, the unreliable anchors may corrupt clustering\nresults. In this paper, we propose the Deep Multi-view Anchor Clustering (DMAC)\nmodel that performs clustering in linear time. Concretely, the initial anchors\nare intervened by the positive-incentive noise sampled from Gaussian\ndistribution, such that they can be optimized with a newly designed anchor\nlearning loss, which promotes a clear relationship between samples and anchors.\nAfterwards, anchor graph convolution is devised to model the cluster structure\nformed by the anchors, and the mutual information maximization loss is built to\nprovide cross-view clustering guidance. In this way, the learned anchors can\nbetter represent clusters. With the optimal anchors, the full sample graph is\ncalculated to derive a discriminative embedding for clustering. Extensive\nexperiments on several datasets demonstrate the superior performance and\nefficiency of DMAC compared to state-of-the-art competitors.",

This study introduces a new\nframework which enables the time-varying and time-frequency analysis of\nhigh-order interactions in network of random processes through the spectral\nrepresentation of vector autoregressive models. The time- and\nfrequency-resolved analysis of synergistic and redundant interactions among\ngroups of processes is ensured by a robust identification procedure based on a\nrecursive least squares estimator with a forgetting factor. Validation on\nsimulated networks illustrates how the time-frequency analysis is able to\nhighlight transient synergistic behaviors emerging in specific frequency bands\nwhich cannot be detected by time-domain stationary analyses. The application on\nbrain evoked potentials in rats elicits the presence of redundant information\ntimed with whisker stimulation and mostly occurring in the contralateral\nhemisphere. The proposed framework enables a comprehensive time-varying and\ntime-frequency analysis of the hierarchical organization of dynamic networks.\nAs our approach goes beyond pairwise interactions, it is well suited for the\nstudy of transient high-order behaviors arising during state transitions in\nmany network systems commonly studied in physiology, neuroscience and other\nfields.",

Changes\nin the singular patterns arise solely from the system's intrinsic dynamics\nrather than variations in its parameters, emphasizing the system's\nself-organizing nature over time.

    "abstract": "In digital pathology, acquiring all-in-focus images is essential to\nhigh-quality imaging and high-efficient clinical workflow. Traditional scanners\nachieve this by scanning at multiple focal planes of varying depths and then\nmerging them, which is relatively slow and often struggles with complex tissue\ndefocus. Recent prevailing image restoration technique provides a means to\nrestore high-quality pathology images from scans of single focal planes.\nHowever, existing image restoration methods are inadequate, due to intricate\ndefocus patterns in pathology images and their domain-specific semantic\ncomplexities. In this work, we devise a two-stage restoration solution\ncascading a transformer and a diffusion model, to benefit from their powers in\npreserving image fidelity and perceptual quality, respectively. We particularly\npropose a novel mixture of prompts for the two-stage solution. Given initial\nprompt that models defocus in microscopic imaging, we design two prompts that\ndescribe the high-level image semantics from pathology foundation model and the\nfine-grained tissue structures via edge extraction. We demonstrate that, by\nfeeding the prompt mixture to our method, we can restore high-quality pathology\nimages from single-focal-plane scans, implying high potentials of the mixture\nof prompts to clinical usage.

EEG signals underwent preprocessing to remove\ntremor artifacts before classification with CNNs using wavelet-based electrode\ntriplet images. Our analysis across different brain regions and frequency bands\nshowed distinct spatial-spectral patterns of PD-related neural oscillations. We\nidentified high classification accuracy (76%) using central electrodes (C3, Cz,\nC4) with full-spectrum 0.4-62.4 Hz analysis and 74% accuracy in right parietal\nregions (P8, CP6, P4) with 10-second windows. Bilateral centro-parietal regions\nshowed strong performance (67%) in the theta band (4.0-7.79 Hz), while multiple\nareas demonstrated some sensitivity (65%) in the alpha band (7.8-15.59 Hz). We\nalso observed a distinctive topographical pattern of gamma band (40-62.4 Hz)\nalterations specifically localized to central-parietal regions, which remained\nconsistent across different temporal windows. In particular, we observed\npronounced right-hemisphere involvement across several frequency bands. Unlike\nprevious studies that achieved higher accuracies by potentially including\ntremor artifacts, our approach isolates genuine neurophysiological alterations\nin cortical activity. These findings suggest that specific EEG-based\noscillatory patterns, especially in central and parietal regions and across\nmultiple frequency bands, may provide diagnostic information for PD,\npotentially before the onset of motor symptoms.",

To address these\nchallenges, in our paper, we introduce Car-1000, a large-scale dataset designed\nspecifically for fine-grained visual categorization of diverse car models.\nCar-1000 encompasses vehicles from 165 different automakers, spanning a wide\nrange of 1000 distinct car models. Additionally, we have reproduced several\nstate-of-the-art FGVC methods on the Car-1000 dataset, establishing a new\nbenchmark for research in this field. We hope that our work will offer a fresh\nperspective for future FGVC researchers. Our dataset is available at\nhttps://github.com/toggle1995/Car-1000.",

However, the on-demand\nmanipulation of the superbunching effect in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) under\npulsed excitation, which is beneficial to integrated photonics and\nlab-on-a-chip quantum devices, is still challenging. Here, we disclosed the\nevolution of $g^{(2)}(0)$ with the parameters of colloidal QDs by Mento Carlo\nsimulations and performed second-order correlation measurements on CdSe/ZnS\ncore/shell QDs under both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed lasers. The photon\nstatistics of a single colloidal QD have been substantially tailored from\nsub-Poissonian distribution $g^{(2)}(0) <1$) to superbunching emission, with\nthe maximum $g^{(2)}(0)$ reaching 69 and 20 under CW and pulsed excitation,\nrespectively. We have achieved correlated biphoton imaging (CPI), employing the\ncoincidence of the biexciton and bright exciton in one laser pulse, with the\nstray light and background noise up to 53 times stronger than PL emission of\nsingle colloidal QDs. By modulating the PL intensity, the Fourier-domain CPI\nwith reasonably good contrast has been determined, with the stray light noise\nup to 107 times stronger than PL emission and 75600 times stronger than the\ncounts of biphotons. Our noise-resistance CPI may enable laboratory-based\nquantum imaging to be applied to real-world applications with the highly\ndesired suppression of strong background noise and stray light.",

    "abstract": "Deepfake is a widely used technology employed in recent years to create\npernicious content such as fake news, movies, and rumors by altering and\nsubstituting facial information from various sources. Given the ongoing\nevolution of deepfakes investigation of continuous identification and\nprevention is crucial. Due to recent technological advancements in AI\n(Artificial Intelligence) distinguishing deepfakes and artificially altered\nimages has become challenging. This approach introduces the robust detection of\nsubtle ear movements and shape changes to generate ear descriptors. Further, we\nalso propose a novel optimized hybrid deepfake detection model that considers\nthe ear biometric descriptors via enhanced RCNN (Region-Based Convolutional\nNeural Network). Initially, the input video is converted into frames and\npreprocessed through resizing, normalization, grayscale conversion, and\nfiltering processes followed by face detection using the Viola-Jones technique.\nNext, a hybrid model comprising DBN (Deep Belief Network) and Bi-GRU\n(Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) is utilized for deepfake detection based\non ear descriptors. The output from the detection phase is determined through\nimproved score-level fusion. To enhance the performance, the weights of both\ndetection models are optimally tuned using the SU-JFO (Self-Upgraded Jellyfish\nOptimization method). Experimentation is conducted based on four scenarios:\ncompression, noise, rotation, pose, and illumination on three different\ndatasets.

While ICNNs offer\ntheoretical guarantees based on restrictive assumptions of non-negative neural\nnetwork parameters, can one improve the approximation power with an extra step\non negative duplication of inputs?

While this design can not improve performance, we propose a\nunified approach to embed the non-negativity constraint as a regularized\noptimization of the neural network, contrary to the existing methods, which\nadded a loosely integrated second step for post-processing on parameter\nnegation. Our integration directly ties back-propagation to simultaneously\nminimizing the approximation error while enforcing the convexity constraints.\nNumerical experiments validate the issues of the mirroring method and show that\nour integrated objective can avoid problems such as unstable training and\nnon-convergence existing in other methods for optimal control.",

    "abstract": "Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) constitutes a pivotal element in autonomous\ndriving perception systems, tasked with inferring the 3D semantic occupancy of\na scene from sensory data. To improve accuracy, prior research has implemented\nvarious computationally demanding and memory-intensive 3D operations, imposing\nsignificant computational requirements on the platform during training and\ntesting. This paper proposes L2COcc, a lightweight camera-centric SSC framework\nthat also accommodates LiDAR inputs. With our proposed efficient voxel\ntransformer (EVT) and cross-modal knowledge modules, including feature\nsimilarity distillation (FSD), TPV distillation (TPVD) and prediction alignment\ndistillation (PAD), our method substantially reduce computational burden while\nmaintaining high accuracy. The experimental evaluations demonstrate that our\nproposed method surpasses the current state-of-the-art vision-based SSC methods\nregarding accuracy on both the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks,\nrespectively. Additionally, our method is more lightweight, exhibiting a\nreduction in both memory consumption and inference time by over 23% compared to\nthe current state-of-the-arts method.

    "abstract": "It is known rigorously that the phase transition of the $q$-state\nferromagnetic Potts model on the square lattice is second order for $q=4$.\nDespite this fact, some observables of the $q=4$ model show features of a\nfirst-order phase transition. For example, negative peak appears for the\nquantity of Binder ratio $Q_2$ of this model. Such a non-monotonic behavior of\n$Q_2$ is typically a consequence of phase coexistence, hence is served as a\nsignal of a first-order phase transition. In particular, the negative peak\nshould diverge with linear system size $L$ squared. Since the mentioned\ndivergence phenomenon is not observed for the 4-state Potts model, the scenario\nof a first-order phase transition for this model is ruled out. Interestingly, a\nrecent large scale Monte Carlo investigation of the 4-state Potts model\nobserves that the two-peak structure of the energy density distribution becomes\nmore noticeable when $L$ increases. This finding indicates the signal of\ncoexistence of phases is getting stronger with $L$. Due to these unusual\ncritical behaviors, here we study the energy density $E$ and the specific heat\n$C_v$ of the 4-state Potts model on the square lattice using the technique of\nbond weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG). For a comparison purpose,\n$q=2$ and $q=5$ ferromagnetic Potts models on the square lattice are\ninvestigated using the same method as well. Remarkably, our results do imply\nthere may be a small energy gap for $q=4$ model. While the appearance of the\nmentioned small energy gap can be explained plausibly and it will disappear\nwith a more sophisticated investigation, our finding suggests that whether a\nmessage of a first-order phase transition is genuine or is an artificial effect\nrequires further and detailed investigations.",

To maintain\nthe generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is\nnecessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it\nlocally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts\noften compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the\nlocalized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the\noverall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first\nintroduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the\ndeletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image\nwhile preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept\nerasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation\nfor Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the\ndiffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate,\ndetermined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By\ndirectly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate\nonly for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the\ntarget concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an\nimage. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image\nfidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also\noutperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin\nand can be extended to mass concept erasure.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently modeling massive images is a long-standing challenge in machine\nlearning. To this end, we introduce Multi-Scale Attention (MSA). MSA relies on\ntwo key ideas, (i) multi-scale representations (ii) bi-directional cross-scale\ncommunication. MSA creates O(log N) scales to represent the image across\nprogressively coarser features and leverages cross-attention to propagate\ninformation across scales. We then introduce Atlas, a novel neural network\narchitecture based on MSA. We demonstrate that Atlas significantly improves the\ncompute-performance tradeoff of long-context image modeling in a\nhigh-resolution variant of ImageNet 100. At 1024px resolution, Atlas-B achieves\n91.04% accuracy, comparable to ConvNext-B (91.92%) while being 4.3x faster.\nAtlas is 2.95x faster and 7.38% better than FasterViT, 2.25x faster and 4.96%\nbetter than LongViT. In comparisons against MambaVision-S, we find Atlas-S\nachieves 5%, 16% and 32% higher accuracy at 1024px, 2048px and 4096px\nrespectively, while obtaining similar runtimes.

    "abstract": "Traditional neural network regression models provide only point estimates,\nfailing to capture predictive uncertainty. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs)\naddress this limitation by producing output distributions, enabling the\nconstruction of prediction intervals. However, the common assumption of\nGaussian output distributions often results in overly wide intervals,\nparticularly in the presence of outliers or deviations from normality. To\nenhance the adaptability of PNNs, we propose t-Distributed Neural Networks\n(TDistNNs), which generate t-distributed outputs, parameterized by location,\nscale, and degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom parameter allows TDistNNs\nto model heavy-tailed predictive distributions, improving robustness to\nnon-Gaussian data and enabling more adaptive uncertainty quantification. We\ndevelop a novel loss function tailored for the t-distribution and derive\nefficient gradient computations for seamless integration into deep learning\nframeworks. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate\nthat TDistNNs improve the balance between coverage and interval width. Notably,\nfor identical architectures, TDistNNs consistently produce narrower prediction\nintervals than Gaussian-based PNNs while maintaining proper coverage. This work\ncontributes a flexible framework for uncertainty estimation in neural networks\ntasked with regression, particularly suited to settings involving complex\noutput distributions.",

In FedPL, clients\ncollaboratively construct a set of global feature centers (prototypes), and let\nlocal features align with these prototypes to mitigate the effects of data\nheterogeneity. The performance of FedPL highly depends on the quality of\nprototypes. Existing methods assume that larger inter-class distances among\nprototypes yield better performance, and thus design different methods to\nincrease these distances. However, we observe that while these methods increase\nprototype distances to enhance class discrimination, they inevitably disrupt\nessential semantic relationships among classes, which are crucial for model\ngeneralization. This raises an important question: how to construct prototypes\nthat inherently preserve semantic relationships among classes? Directly\nlearning these relationships from limited and heterogeneous client data can be\nproblematic in FL. Recently, the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs)\ndemonstrates their ability to capture semantic relationships from vast textual\ncorpora. Motivated by this, we propose FedTSP, a novel method that leverages\nPLMs to construct semantically enriched prototypes from the textual modality,\nenabling more effective collaboration in heterogeneous data settings. We first\nuse a large language model (LLM) to generate fine-grained textual descriptions\nfor each class, which are then processed by a PLM on the server to form textual\nprototypes. To address the modality gap between client image models and the\nPLM, we introduce trainable prompts, allowing prototypes to adapt better to\nclient tasks.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nnovel framework HAR-DoReMi, which introduces a masked reconstruction task based\non Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. By raplacing the discrete language sequence\nprediction task, which relies on the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) loss, in the\noriginal DoReMi framework, the proposed framework is inherently more\nappropriate for handling the continuous and multi-channel characteristics of\nIMU data. In addition, HAR-DoReMi integrates the Mahony fusion algorithm into\nthe self-supervised HAR pre-training, aiming to mitigate the heterogeneity of\nvarying sensor orientation. This is achieved by estimating the sensor\norientation within each dataset and facilitating alignment with a unified\ncoordinate system, thereby improving the cross-dataset generalization ability\nof the HAR model.

By learning the\ndeformation characteristics of simple geometric primitives (a cube and a cube\nwith a hole), the DDPM-Polycube model progressively reconstructs polycube\nstructures from input geometry by removing non-standard Gaussian noise. Once\nvalid polycube structures are generated, they are used for surface segmentation\nand parametric mapping to generate high-quality hex meshes.

This\ndesign eliminates the need for task-specific training while capturing multiple\nplausible motions.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a\npromising LLM compression technique.

In this work, we introduce SVD-LLM V2, a\nSVD-based LLM compression method that optimizes singular value truncation in\nSVD compression with two techniques. First, SVD-LLM V2 proposes to use\ntheoretical truncation loss of weight matrices to assign a unique compression\nratio to each weight matrix at different layers to accommodate weight\nredundancy heterogeneity. Second, SVD-LLM V2 proposes loss-optimized weight\ntruncation to ensure that the truncated singular values result in a lower and\nmore stable truncation loss in practice.

In this series, we statistically investigate the uniqueness and\ncausal connection between precursors and SEEs using paired activity-quiet\nepochs. This first paper specifically introduces transient brightenings (TBs)\nand presents analysis regimes to study their role as precursors, including\nimaging of the solar atmosphere, magnetic field, and topology analysis.\nApplying these methods qualitatively to three cases, we find that prior to\nsolar flares, TBs 1) tend to occur in one large cluster close to the future\nflare ribbon location and below the separatrix surface of a coronal magnetic\nnull point, 2) are co-spatial with reconnection signatures in the lower solar\natmosphere, such as bald patches and null point fan traces and 3) cluster in\nthe vicinity of strong-gradient polarity inversion lines and regions of\nincreased excess magnetic energy density. TBs are also observed during quiet\nepochs of the same active regions, but they appear in smaller clusters not\nfollowing a clear spatial pattern, although sometimes associated with short,\nspatially-intermittent bald patches and fan traces, but predominantly away from\nstrong gradient polarity inversion lines in areas with little excess energy\ndensity.",

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) has gained significant attention in the field of surface reconstruction\ndue to its impressive geometric quality and computational efficiency. While\nrecent relevant advancements in novel view synthesis under inconsistent\nillumination using 3DGS have shown promise, the challenge of robust surface\nreconstruction under such conditions is still being explored. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a method called GS-3I. Specifically, to mitigate 3D\nGaussian optimization bias caused by underexposed regions in single-view\nimages, based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a tone mapping correction\nframework is introduced. Furthermore, inconsistent lighting across multi-view\nimages, resulting from variations in camera settings and complex scene\nillumination, often leads to geometric constraint mismatches and deviations in\nthe reconstructed surface. To overcome this, we propose a normal compensation\nmechanism that integrates reference normals extracted from single-view image\nwith normals computed from multi-view observations to effectively constrain\ngeometric inconsistencies. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nGS-3I can achieve robust and accurate surface reconstruction across complex\nillumination scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility in this\ncritical challenge. https://github.com/TFwang-9527/GS-3I",

    "abstract": "Metabolism plays a crucial role in sleep regulation, yet its effects are\nchallenging to track in real time. This study introduces a machine\nlearning-based framework to analyze sleep patterns and identify how metabolic\nchanges influence sleep at specific time points. We first established that\nsleep periods in Drosophila melanogaster function independently, with no causal\nrelationship between different sleep episodes. Using gradient boosting models\nand explainable artificial intelligence techniques, we quantified the influence\nof time-dependent sleep features. Causal inference and autocorrelation analyses\nfurther confirmed that sleep states at different times are statistically\nindependent, providing a robust foundation for exploring metabolic effects on\nsleep. Applying this framework to flies with altered monocarboxylate\ntransporter 2 expression, we found that changes in ketone transport modified\nsleep stability and disrupted transitions between day and night sleep. In an\nAlzheimers disease model, metabolic interventions such as beta hydroxybutyrate\nsupplementation and intermittent fasting selectively influenced the timing of\nday to night transitions rather than uniformly altering sleep duration.\nAutoencoder based similarity scoring and wavelet analysis reinforced that\nmetabolic effects on sleep were highly time dependent. This study presents a\nnovel approach to studying sleep-metabolism interactions, revealing that\nmetabolic states exert their strongest influence at distinct time points,\nshaping sleep stability and circadian transitions.",

With the rise of LLMs, modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) generate\ndetailed and comprehensive image descriptions. However, benchmarking the\nquality of such captions remains unresolved. This paper addresses two key\nquestions: (1) How well do current VLMs actually perform on image captioning,\nparticularly compared to humans? We built CapArena, a platform with over 6000\npairwise caption battles and high-quality human preference votes. Our\narena-style evaluation marks a milestone, showing that leading models like\nGPT-4o achieve or even surpass human performance, while most open-source models\nlag behind. (2) Can automated metrics reliably assess detailed caption quality?\nUsing human annotations from CapArena, we evaluate traditional and recent\ncaptioning metrics, as well as VLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that while\nsome metrics (e.g., METEOR) show decent caption-level agreement with humans,\ntheir systematic biases lead to inconsistencies in model ranking. In contrast,\nVLM-as-a-Judge demonstrates robust discernment at both the caption and model\nlevels. Building on these insights, we release CapArena-Auto, an accurate and\nefficient automated benchmark for detailed captioning, achieving 94.3%\ncorrelation with human rankings at just $4 per test.

Non-reciprocal interactions among these active constituents then enable\nnovel collective behavior that often can be strikingly counterintuitive.\nHowever, non-reciprocity in these cases typically requires that the interacting\nbodies have different physical properties or it needs to be programmed\nexplicitly into all pairwise interactions. Here we show that collective\nactivity in a driven system can emerge spontaneously through multibody\nnonreciprocal forces, even if all bodies are individually non-active and have\nidentical properties. We demonstrate this with as few as three identical\nspheres, acoustically levitated in air, which exhibit collective activity as\nthey interact through non-pairwise forces: similar to the classic gravitational\nthree-body problem, the interaction between two spheres depends sensitively on\nthe relative position of the third sphere. Non-reciprocity arises naturally\nfrom both near-field sound scattering and microstreaming forces among the\nspheres. The underdamped dynamics in air furthermore make it possible to go\nbeyond collective center-of-mass propulsion or rotation and observe internal,\nengine-like reconfigurations that follow limit cycles. These findings open up\nnew possibilities for self-assembly, where now multibody interactions not only\ndetermine the resulting structure but also drive the spontaneously emerging\ndynamics.",

Here, we\nshow that low-energy reconstructions of Si(111)-7x7 surface with (DAS-d8-T12,\nDAS-d8-T9H3-A, DAS-d8-T9H3-B and DAS-d8-T6H6) and without (AB-d10-T12,\nAB-d10-T9H3, AA-d10-T12 and AA-d10-T9H3) stacking-fault can be quickly\ndiscovered by graph theory as implemented in RG2 code for crystal structure\nprediction.

    "abstract": "Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging\nproblem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches\ntypically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious\nannotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,\nuncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real\ncausal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by\ndata bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an\nAttentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident\nvideo clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal\nclips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on\naccident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content\nof frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using\ndatasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.\nAdditionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant\ntriple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated\npair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,\nand competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been\nobtained.",

First, we analyze the computational bottlenecks of the\nclassic low-complexity randomized unitary-based MUSIC (RU-MUSIC), formulating\nthis computational issue as an inner product problem. Then, a mixed-precision\nmethod is introduced to address this problem. Specifically, this method\npartitions summations in inner products into blocks, where intra-block\ncomputations use low-precision arithmetic and inter-block sums use\nhigh-precision arithmetic. To further improve computational accuracy, we\ndevelop an adaptive-precision method that supports adaptive block sizes and\nmultiple precision levels. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed\nfinite-precision MUSIC design achieves direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation\nperformance similar to that using full-precision arithmetic while reducing more\nthan 50\\% computational cost.",

Our observations also show that the\napproaching gas flows from the overshoot process are captured by the bar\ngravitational and then flows towards the Galactic central molecular zone (CMZ)\nthrough the bar channel. The recycling gas from the overshoot effect, in\nconjunction with freshly accreted gas from the inner 3-kpc disk, accumulates\nsignificantly near R_GC~1/2R_bar and R_GC~2/3R_bar regions by adopting a bar\nlength of ~3.2--3.4kpc. Importantly, within these regions, there are frequent\ncollisions and substantial angular momentum exchanges between gas flows with\ndifferent trajectories. In this scenario, the DISSIPATION processes arising\nfrom interactions between colliding flows, together with the varying torques\ninduced by the nonaxisymmetric bar, effectively transfer the angular momentum\nof viscous gas outward, thereby driving the molecular gas to settle into the\nCMZ within ~3 orbital periods. A long-term gas inflow with an average rate of\n>1.1Msun/yr, coupled with intense transient accretion events that exceed the\naverage rate by several times due to the overshoot effect, significantly\nregulates the gas distribution, physical properties, and dynamical evolution of\nthe CMZ.

In this paper we propose Swift4D, a divide-and-conquer 3D\nGaussian Splatting method that can handle static and dynamic primitives\nseparately, achieving a good trade-off between rendering quality and\nefficiency, motivated by the fact that most of the scene is the static\nprimitive and does not require additional dynamic properties.

We first employ a learnable decomposition\nstrategy to separate the primitives, which relies on an additional parameter to\nclassify primitives as static or dynamic. For the dynamic primitives, we employ\na compact multi-resolution 4D Hash mapper to transform these primitives from\ncanonical space into deformation space at each timestamp, and then mix the\nstatic and dynamic primitives to produce the final output. This\ndivide-and-conquer method facilitates efficient training and reduces storage\nredundancy.

    "abstract": "Precise characterization of noisy quantum operations plays an important role\nfor realizing further accurate operations. Quantum tomography is a popular\nclass of characterization methods, and several advanced methods in the class\nuse error amplification circuit (EAC), a repetition of a sequence of quantum\ngates, for increasing their estimation precision. Here, we develop new\ntheoretical tools for analyzing effects of an EAC on Lindbladian error of\ncyclic gates in the EAC for arbitrary finite-dimensional system, which takes\nnon-commutativity between different gates or between ideal and error parts of a\ngate, periodic properties of ideal gates, and repetition of gate sequence into\nconsideration within a linear approximation. We also propose a tomographic\nprotocol for the Lindbladian errors of cyclic gates based on the linear\napproximation, named Robust Lindbladian Tomography (RLT). The numerical\noptimization at data-processing of the proposed method reduces from nonlinear\nto linear (positive semi-definite) programming. Therefore, compared to the\noriginal optimization problem, the reduced one is solvable more efficiently and\nstably, although its numerical cost grows exponentially with respect to the\nnumber of qubits, which is the same as other tomographic methods.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs) has shifted\nfocus from pre-training to inference-time computation and post-training\noptimization, largely due to concerns over the availability of high-quality\nhuman data. However, these strategies alone are insufficient to drive\nsubstantial model improvements. We argue that effective model advancement\nrequires strong synergy among pre-training, inference-time computation, and\npost-training optimization. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving\ncognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework for constructing next-generation\nfoundation MLLMs by imparting multimodal knowledge and enhancing systematic\ncognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated\ndata. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description for step-by-step visual\nunderstanding and integrate structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to\nsupport in-depth multimodal reasoning. SIcog first equips a base model with\nsystematic perception and reasoning using minimal external supervision. The\nenhanced models then generate candidate image captions and CoT reasoning\nresponses for unlabeled images and image-question pairs across diverse tasks,\nwhich are filtered through a semantic-similarity-guided self-consistency\nmechanism. These high-quality, self-generated samples enable large-scale\nmultimodal pre-training, creating a self-improvement loop. Experiments\ndemonstrate SIcog's effectiveness in developing MLLMs with enhanced multimodal\ncognition. Using only 213K self-generated pre-training samples, SIcog achieves\nsignificant improvements, including +3.6% on MMStar and +3.5% on AI2D,\noutperforming previous pre-training approaches. When combined with\npost-training techniques for CoT reasoning, SIcog yields +9% gains on MMVet and\n+8.5% on ScienceQA.",

However,\nthese methods often assume unbiased human feedback, which is rarely the case in\nreal-world scenarios. This paper introduces Content-Aware Noise-Resilient\nPreference Optimization (CNRPO), a novel framework that addresses multiple\nsources of content-dependent noise in preference learning. CNRPO employs a\nmulti-objective optimization approach to separate true preferences from\ncontent-aware noises, effectively mitigating their impact. We leverage backdoor\nattack mechanisms to efficiently learn and control various noise sources within\na single model. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on different\nsynthetic noisy datasets demonstrate that CNRPO significantly improves\nalignment with primary human preferences while controlling for secondary noises\nand biases, such as response length and harmfulness.",

    "authors": [
      "Jinghan Wang",

    ],
    "abstract": "Engineered systems naturally experience large disturbances that can disrupt\ndesired operation because the system may fail to recover to a stable\nequilibrium point. It is valuable to determine the mechanism of instability\nwhen the system is subject to a particular finite-time disturbance, because\nthis information can be used to improve vulnerability detection, and to design\ncontrollers to reduce vulnerability. Often there exists a particular unstable\nequilibrium point on the region of attraction boundary of the stable\nequilibrium point such that the unstable eigenvector of the Jacobian at this\nunstable equilibrium point represents the mode of instability for the\ndisturbance. Unfortunately, it is challenging to find this mode of instability,\nespecially in high dimensional systems, because it is computationally\nintractable to obtain this particular unstable equilibrium point. This paper\ndevelops a novel algorithm for numerically computing the mode of instability\nfor parameterized nonlinear systems without identifying the particular unstable\nequilibrium point, resulting in a computationally efficient method. The key\nidea is to first consider the setting where the system recovers, and to average\nthe Jacobian along the system trajectory from the post-disturbance state up\nuntil the Jacobian becomes stable. As the system approaches inability to\nrecover, the averaged Jacobians converge to the Jacobian at the particular\nunstable equilibrium point, and can be used to extract the unstable eigenvector\nrepresenting the mode of instability. Convergence guarantees are provided for\ncomputing the mode of instability, both for the theoretical setting in\ncontinuous time, and for the proposed algorithm which relies on numerical\nintegration. Numerical examples illustrate the successful application of the\nmethod to identify the mechanism of instability in power systems subject to\ntemporary short circuits.",
