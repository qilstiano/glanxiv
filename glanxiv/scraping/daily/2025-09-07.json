    "abstract": "Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms\nof performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:\nimproving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using\nsmaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a\nniche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step\nfor automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we\nstrive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in\nterms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other\navailable solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and\ntrain it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with\ndata augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID\nand passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.\nOther methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation\nstate-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each\nmethod to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.\nThe OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the\nLevenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information\nretrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe\nthat with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect\nto attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is\nsmaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while\nretaining a competitive OCR quality metric.

However, thin epitaxial YIG has mostly been\ninvestigated under ambient temperatures, limited by the paramagnetic losses\noccurring at low temperatures due to the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG)\nsubstrates required for epitaxial growth. Driven by a growing interest in\nmagnonic devices that can operate in cryogenic conditions and address quantum\ninformation applications, there is a strong need for iron garnet epitaxial\nfilms grown on diamagnetic substrates that can maintain low losses at low\ntemperatures. In this work, we use liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) to grow ultrathin\nfilms of strained YIG on a commercial diamagnetic substrate, yttrium scandium\ngallium garnet (YSGG). We investigate their magnetization dynamics in the 3-300\nK temperature range, and compare them to equivalent films grown on paramagnetic\nGGG.

A small basis for the\nexcitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a\nsingle site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian\nmatrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only\nrequires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory\ndiagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the\nground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational\nuniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the\n$S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) --\nefficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also\nexamine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge\ncondition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach,\nwhereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers\nconvergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous\nto the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation,\ntranslated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for\nall momenta.",

To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed\nPREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that\niteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically\nsteering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly\nfine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis\nframework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the\ngeneration of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural\nlanguage specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's\nverifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring\nDafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs\ninto synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)\nemploying Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a\nchallenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization\nconsistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by\nup to 21%.

This theoretical structure features a spectrum\nwith both the SM-like Higgs boson (with a 125 GeV mass) and a lighter CP-even\n(or scalar) Higgs state with mass around 95 GeV, $h_{95}$, which is present in\nthis scenario for the purpose of simultaneously explaining anomalies seen in\nthe $b\\bar b$, $\\gamma\\gamma$ and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ final states in searches for\nadditional light Higgs states at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider and\nLHC itself.

The second is the modeling of\ntwo-dimensional rarefied hypersonic flow over a cylinder, where an ensemble of\nDeepONets trained on a sparse dataset obtained from the direct simulation Monte\nCarlo, DSMC, approach, generalizes successfully to both interpolation and\nextrapolation cases up to M equal to 10. A custom weighted loss function\nimproves the prediction of pressure, while ensemble-based uncertainty\nquantification correctly identifies regions of high gradients such as shock\nwaves. The results demonstrate that embedding physical constraints into neural\noperator architectures enables accurate, physically consistent, and\ncomputationally efficient surrogates, paving the way for their application to\nmulti-dimensional high-speed rarefied flow problems.",

In this work, we aimed\nto evaluate different text-to-image AI models and compare the degree of gender\nbias they present. The evaluated models were Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), Stable\nDiffusion Cascade (SC), DALL-E and Emu. We hypothesized that DALL-E and Stable\nDiffusion, which are comparatively older models, would exhibit a noticeable\ndegree of gender bias towards men, while Emu, which was recently released by\nMeta AI, would have more balanced results. As hypothesized, we found that both\nStable Diffusion models exhibit a noticeable degree of gender bias while Emu\ndemonstrated more balanced results (i.e. less gender bias). However,\ninterestingly, Open AI's DALL-E exhibited almost opposite results, such that\nthe ratio of women to men was significantly higher in most cases tested. Here,\nalthough we still observed a bias, the bias favored females over males. This\nbias may be explained by the fact that OpenAI changed the prompts at its\nbackend, as observed during our experiment. We also observed that Emu from Meta\nAI utilized user information while generating images via WhatsApp. We also\nproposed some potential solutions to avoid such biases, including ensuring\ndiversity across AI research teams and having diverse datasets.",

While\nextensive prior work has addressed tensor completion with data missingness,\nmost assume that each entry of the tensor is available independently with\nprobability $p$. However, real-world tensor data often exhibit\nmissing-not-at-random (MNAR) patterns, where the probability of missingness\ndepends on the underlying tensor values. This paper introduces a generalized\ntensor completion framework for noisy data with MNAR, where the observation\nprobability is modeled as a function of underlying tensor values. Our flexible\nframework accommodates various tensor data types, such as continuous, binary\nand count data. For model estimation, we develop an alternating maximization\nalgorithm and derive non-asymptotic error bounds for the estimator at each\niteration, under considerably relaxed conditions on the observation\nprobabilities. Additionally, we propose a statistical inference procedure to\ntest whether observation probabilities depend on underlying tensor values,\noffering a formal assessment of the missingness assumption within our modeling\nframework.

    "abstract": "Determining the physical properties of ices across the solar system is\nessential for understanding the surface dynamics, volatile transport, and\nclimate evolution on ice-covered planetary bodies. Here, we use\nwell-constrained measurements of snow that has metamorphosed into\ncoarse-grained firn and bubbly glacier ice in East Antarctica to test three\ncommonly-used radiative transfer models: delta-Eddington, Hapke, and Shkuratov.\nUsing the measured optical properties, we find that the delta-Eddington model\ngenerally shows the least deviation from the measured albedo, followed by the\nShkuratov and Hapke models, respectively. But when the models are used to infer\nthe grain radius using the measured albedo, the Shkuratov model provides closer\nbest-fit grain radii (off by average factor 0.9) than delta-Eddington (0.6),\nand Hapke (1.8). Despite this, the spectral albedos estimated by the Shkuratov\nand Hapke models using their respective best-fit grain radii deviate more from\nthe measurements than delta-Eddington. This result is caused by the Hapke and\nShkuratov models not accounting for: (1) the increased absorption within dense\nice, and (2) specular reflection at the surface of firn and ice. Additionally,\nall three models do not account for the nonsphericity of bubbles within ice.\nThe combination of these factors leads to model errors generally increasing\nwith increasing grain radius. Based on our quantitative comparison, we\nrecommend using the delta-Eddington model for predicting the albedo and\ninferring the grain radius of ices across the solar system because it generally\nproduces the least error while using realistic physical parameters.",

Here, we address this issue\nquantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares\nclassical shadows with \"quantum footage,\" which refers to direct quantum\nmeasurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of\ndownload efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For\nobservables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical\nshadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is\nlarge and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large\nHermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when\nthe number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits\nfall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior\ninclude the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight\n$w$, accuracy requirement $\\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\\delta$. We also\ncompare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of\nquantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow\nmethod becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware. This paper\nopens a new avenue for quantitatively designing optimal strategies for hybrid\nquantum-classical tomography and provides practical insights for selecting the\nmost suitable quantum measurement approach in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0) represents a new era where intelligent\nagents are tasked not with simple code generation, but with achieving complex,\ngoal-oriented SE objectives. To harness these new capabilities while ensuring\ntrustworthiness, we must recognize a fundamental duality within the SE field in\nthe Agentic SE era, comprising two symbiotic modalities: SE for Humans and SE\nfor Agents. This duality demands a radical reimagining of the foundational\npillars of SE (actors, processes, tools, and artifacts) which manifest\ndifferently across each modality. We propose two purpose-built workbenches to\nsupport this vision. The Agent Command Environment (ACE) serves as a command\ncenter where humans orchestrate and mentor agent teams, handling outputs such\nas Merge-Readiness Packs (MRPs) and Consultation Request Packs (CRPs). The\nAgent Execution Environment (AEE) is a digital workspace where agents perform\ntasks while invoking human expertise when facing ambiguity or complex\ntrade-offs. This bi-directional partnership, which supports agent-initiated\nhuman callbacks and handovers, gives rise to new, structured engineering\nactivities (i.e., processes) that redefine human-AI collaboration, elevating\nthe practice from agentic coding to true agentic software engineering. This\npaper presents the Structured Agentic Software Engineering (SASE) vision,\noutlining several of the foundational pillars for the future of SE. The paper\nculminates in a research roadmap that identifies a few key challenges and\nopportunities while briefly discussing the resulting impact of this future on\nSE education. Our goal is not to offer a definitive solution, but to provide a\nconceptual scaffold with structured vocabulary to catalyze a community-wide\ndialogue, pushing the SE community to think beyond its classic, human-centric\ntenets toward a disciplined, scalable, and trustworthy agentic future.",

It is found that\nAnd V has an orbit consistent within errors with alignment with M31's disk and\ncounter orbiting it, although this alignment is not well constrained. And VI's\norbit is better determined and is very much consistent with co-orbiting with\nM31's disk. While currently at a distance of ~280 kpc from M31, And VI will\nremain beyond a distance of ~ 90 kpc from M31, thus experiencing low tidal\ninfluence compared to the other M31 satellites with known orbits.

Here we developed a multi-dimensional framework to examine gender\ndifferences in scientific knowledge creation through three complementary\ntemporal dimensions: stability (consistency of performance over time),\nvolatility (degree of year-to-year fluctuation), and persistence (ability to\nmaintain high performance for extended periods). Using comprehensive\nbibliometric data from SciSciNet covering 62.5 million authors whose careers\nbegan between 1960-2010, we constructed knowledge creation capability measures\nthat captured how scientists absorb knowledge from diverse sources and\ncontribute to field advancement. We found that female scientists demonstrated\nsignificantly higher knowledge production stability (0.170 vs. 0.119 for males)\nwhile simultaneously exhibiting greater year-to-year volatility (6.606 vs.\n6.228), revealing a striking paradox in career dynamics. Female scientists\nshowed persistence advantages under moderate performance requirements but faced\ndisadvantages under extreme criteria demanding sustained peak performance.\nHowever, these patterns varied substantially across disciplines, with female\nadvantages strongest in humanities and social sciences while STEM fields show\nmixed results.",

While mixed titanate ceramics\nlike MgTiO3-CaTiO3 (MCT) and (Zr,Sn)TiO4 (ZST) are primary candidates, their\ncomparative performance as radiative antennas in the deep-cryogenic regime has\nremained uncharacterized. Here we present a side-by-side comparison of MCT and\nZST operated as dielectric resonator antennas from 296 K down to 7-10 K under\nidentical fixtures and protocols. While the MCT resonator exhibits large,\nnonlinear frequency drift (230 MHz by 10 K), pronounced thermal hysteresis, and\na collapse of the loaded quality factor at low temperature-behavior consistent\nwith incipient/relaxor-like losses, the ZST resonator demonstrates exceptional\nstability. Its resonant frequency shifts by only 30 MHz, its loaded Q-factor is\nenhanced by 20-25%, and it shows negligible thermal hysteresis. Leveraging\nthese properties, we operate the ZST disk as a radiative antenna at 10 K with\nonly 1 mW input, establishing a through-window wireless link that detects\nroom-temperature dielectric targets over multiple wavelengths via near-field\nfrequency shifts and far-field magnitude modulations.

    "abstract": "This is a pedagogical review of some recent progress in rigorously proving\nchiral symmetry breaking in a class of QCD-like theories that closely resemble\nthe real-world QCD, namely the $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled to $N_f$\nflavors of massless quarks in the fundamental representation. Based on 't Hooft\nanomaly matching and persistent mass conditions, a general no-go theorem is\nformulated: assuming that the theory flows in the infrared to a fully\ncolor-screened, infrared-free phase described by color-singlet hadrons,\nsymmetry and anomaly constraints necessarily imply spontaneous chiral symmetry\nbreaking; conversely, any phase with unbroken chiral symmetry must retain\nunscreened color charges, thereby ruling out a fully color-singlet hadron\ndescription in the infrared. While these results have been widely assumed, the\nrecent developments reviewed here establish them with a new level of rigor. The\npersistent mass condition, carefully formulated here, plays a central role,\njust as it does in the Vafa-Witten theorem on unbroken vectorlike symmetries.",

Polar vortices and skyrmions are representative polar topologies\nthat have been predicted to significantly enhance the functionality and\ninformation density of nanoelectronic devices due to their ultrasmall\ndimensions. Despite these advantages, the practical realization of polar\ntopologies in devices is impeded by the intrinsic challenges associated with\ntheir controlled motion and manipulation. Therefore, harnessing vortex\nmanipulation-such as motion, on demand creation, annihilation, and shape\ntransformation-is essential for practical device integration. However, vortex\nmotion is often challenged by intrinsic physical limitations in collective\nlattice distortions and strong pinning effects from the surrounding\nenvironment, which remains elusive. In this study, we present real time\nobservation of vortex motion in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, achieved\nthrough the application of localized pulsed electric fields and trailing bias\nfields from a conductive tip. Notably, the vortices exhibit reversible motion\nin response to the field direction. Furthermore, by precisely manoeuvring the\nconductive Atomic-Force-Microscopy tip along specific trajectories, we achieved\ncontrolled vortex reshaping, with reconfigured vortices showing remarkable\nstability over extended periods. This underline physical mechanism is further\npinpointed by phase-field simulations, which revealed that the motion of the\nvortex boundary is controlled through the switching of the zigzag patterns of\nthe vortex core.

They determined appropriate\nhabitat sizes $l$ for the survival of a population, whose individuals are\ninitially placed homogeneously within the full habitat domain with a total\ninitial population $n_0$. We show that the survival condition can be naturally\nformulated in terms of the parameter\n$Q:=\\frac{a}{D}l^{-\\mu+\\nu+2}n_0^{\\mu-\\nu}$. Indeed, there exists a critical\nvalue $Q_c$ determined by $\\mu$, $\\nu$ and the initial distribution parameter\nsuch that the survival condition can always be written as $Q\\geq Q_c$. Notably,\nfrom this point of view, one can derive a condition for $Q$ that holds\nuniversally for our model under conditional persistence ($\\mu\\geq\\nu$). It\napplies, in particular, to the case $\\mu=\\nu+2$, which was not addressed in the\npreviously mentioned work. Nevertheless, in this case $Q=\\frac{a}{D}n_0^2$,\ntherefore survival depends solely on the total population, not on the habitat\nsize. We apply a finite-difference scheme to estimate $Q_c$. Conversely, given\na population whose evolution is determined by $\\mu$, $\\nu$, $l$, $n_0$, and the\ngrowth and diffusion coefficients $a$ and $D$ (and consequently the value of\n$Q$) we use the numerical algorithm to estimate the initial distribution to\nensure population survival.",

Most\nassociated functionalities can be tuned via domain switching, including but not\nlimited to piezoelectricity, thermal conductivity, domain wall conductivity and\ntopological structures. However, achieving the full potential of reversible\nferroelectric domain switching is restricted by the incomplete access to the\nentire ferroelectric texture space, as well as the memory effects and energy\ndissipation associated with the hysteretic nature of ferroelectrics. The\nmanipulation of domain switching behaviour is moderately attainable in\nepitaxial heterostructures by exploiting the valence or lattice mismatch at\nheterointerfaces, which is generally constrained by the necessity for two\ndimensional architectures. In this study, domain-engineered bulk ferroelectric\nheterostructures (DE-BFH), constructed via elemental partitioning, are employed\nto unleash full potential of bulk ferroelectrics, providing comprehensive\ncontrol of domain switching characteristics and adjustable reversibility within\nthe entire range of ferroelectric texture space.

The unstable magnetic field is either imposed through\nthe boundary conditions or generated by an imposed $\\alpha$-effect. In the case\nof an imposed field, we solve for the deviations from the background state with\nperiodic boundary conditions. We also include cosmic rays as a weightless fluid\nwhich exerts a dynamically significant pressure and amplifies magnetic\nbuoyancy, known as the Parker instability. Without rotation, systems with an\nimposed magnetic field evolve to a state with a very weak magnetic field, very\ndifferent from the marginally stable eigenfunction, where the gas layer\neventually becomes very thin as it is supported by thermal and turbulent\npressures alone. However, this does not happen when the $\\alpha$-effect\nmaintains the magnetic field. Rotation fundamentally changes the development of\nthe instability. A rotating system develops nonlinear oscillations, and the\nmagnetic field direction changes even with an imposed magnetic field. We\ndemonstrate that the cause is a secondary $\\alpha$-effect at large altitudes as\nthe gas flow produced by the instability becomes helical. The secondary\n$\\alpha$-effect has an anomalous sign with the $\\alpha$-coefficient being\nnegative in the northern hemisphere, whereas the Coriolis force produces a\npositive $\\alpha$. The mean-field dynamo action outside the original gas layer\ncan also lead to a switch in the magnetic field parity from quadrupolar to\ndipolar. Altogether, the magnetic buoyancy instability and the mean-field\ndynamo action become separated as distinct physical effects in a nonlinear\nrotating system. We show that none of the assumptions used in analytic studies\nof the Parker instability is corroborated by numerical results.",

Drawing on qualitative interviews and\nethnographic observations, it shows how factors such as financial privilege,\ninformal gatekeeping, visibility bias, and onboarding structures create\nbarriers to meaningful inclusion. While DAOs are frequently framed as\npermissionless and egalitarian, the lived experiences of contributors reveal a\nmore complex reality, one in which soft power and implicit norms determine\npeople's position within DAOs. Instead of offering solutionist prescriptions,\nthis report argues for a deeper cultural reflection within the DAO ecosystem.\nIt highlights that decentralisation is not solely a protocol-level feature, but\nan ongoing social process that requires intentional cultivation of trust,\nbelonging, and epistemic plurality. With this report, we want to sharpen the\ncollective awareness of structural blind spots and call for building more\ninclusive and culturally conscious decentralised systems.",

In particular, XPAT was able to\nproduce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum\nof products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters\ncan act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on\nparametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.\nWe demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area\nsolutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original\nXPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.",

The\nformula for the alternating version has an advantage, in that for Newton\nnondegenerate functions, it can be calculated in terms of volumes of faces of\nthe Newton diagram, whereas a similar formula for the original nonalternating\nversion includes mixed volumes.\n  The Milnor fiber can be given a handlebody decomposition, with handles\ncorresponding to intersection points with the polar curve in generic plane\nsections of the singularity.

The model combines the matter-bounce mechanism, that generates\nscale-invariant perturbations, with ekpyrotic contraction, that suppresses\nanisotropies leading to the bounce. The bounce that replaces the classical\ninitial singularity is achieved thanks to the loop quantisation. The\nmatter-bounce is enacted by a \\textit{quasi-dust} scalar field, with a\nslightly-negative equation of state that accounts for a small positive\ncosmological constant, that generates a red-tilt in the perturbations' power\nspectra. A second field, endowed with an ekpyrotic potential, is introduced to\ntame the growth of anisotropies throughout the bouncing phase. The equations of\nmotion of the scalar perturbations are non-trivially coupled, leading to rich\nphenomenology that cannot be inferred simply from their single-field\ncounterpart. We study the evolution of scalar and tensor perturbations and\ncompare the results to current observations, showing the viability of this\nmodel as a base for further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Ranking and selection (R&S) aims to identify the alternative with the best\nmean performance among $k$ simulated alternatives. The practical value of R&S\ndepends on accurate simulation input modeling, which often suffers from the\ncurse of input uncertainty due to limited data. Distributionally robust ranking\nand selection (DRR&S) addresses this challenge by modeling input uncertainty\nvia an ambiguity set of $m > 1$ plausible input distributions, resulting in\n$km$ scenarios in total. Recent DRR&S studies suggest a key structural insight:\nadditivity in budget allocation is essential for efficiency. However, existing\njustifications are heuristic, and fundamental properties such as consistency\nand the precise allocation pattern induced by additivity remain poorly\nunderstood. In this paper, we propose a simple additive allocation (AA)\nprocedure that aims to exclusively sample the $k + m - 1$ previously\nhypothesized critical scenarios. Leveraging boundary-crossing arguments, we\nestablish a lower bound on the probability of correct selection and\ncharacterize the procedure's budget allocation behavior. We then prove that AA\nis consistent and, surprisingly, achieves additivity in the strongest sense: as\nthe total budget increases, only $k + m - 1$ scenarios are sampled infinitely\noften. Notably, the worst-case scenarios of non-best alternatives may not be\namong them, challenging prior beliefs about their criticality. These results\noffer new and counterintuitive insights into the additive structure of DRR&S.\nTo improve practical performance while preserving this structure, we introduce\na general additive allocation (GAA) framework that flexibly incorporates\nsampling rules from traditional R&S procedures in a modular fashion. Numerical\nexperiments support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the competitive\nperformance of the proposed GAA procedures.",

    "abstract": "The equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter is a central open problem in\nnuclear astrophysics. Its inference is hindered by the lack of \\textit{ab\ninitio} control above about twice nuclear saturation density, requiring\nextrapolation. Parametric schemes such as piecewise polytropes (PP) are\nefficient but restrictive, while nonparametric approaches like Gaussian\nprocesses (GP) allow more flexibility at the cost of larger prior volumes. We\nextend our hybrid EOS framework by replacing the high-density polytropic\nextension with a GP representation of the squared sound speed, anchored at low\ndensities by the SLy crust EOS and a nuclear meta-model constrained by\n$\\chi$EFT and laboratory data. Using hierarchical Bayesian analysis, we jointly\nconstrain the EOS and neutron star mass distribution with multi-messenger\nobservations, including NICER radii, GW170817 and GW190425 tidal\ndeformabilities, pulsar masses, and neutron skin experiments. We examine four\nscenarios defined by high-density extrapolation (PP vs.\\ GP) and hotspot\ngeometry in the NICER modeling of PSR~J0030$+$0451 (ST+PDT vs.\\ PDT-U). GP\nextrapolations generally yield softer EOS posteriors with broader\nuncertainties. Hotspot assumptions also play an important role, shifting\ninferred mass--radius relations. Bayesian evidence strongly favors the ST+PDT\ngeometry over PDT-U under both extrapolations, while GP is mildly preferred\nover PP. These results underscore the impact of observational modeling and EOS\nextrapolation on neutron star inferences, and show that a GP-based extension\noffers a robust way to quantify systematic uncertainties in high-density\nmatter.",

The presence of two positive\nexponents indicates that $\\textit{C.elegans}$ locomotion is hyperchaotic, while\nthe total sum being negative indicates that the system is dissipative and\nnon-Hamiltonian. Those are key observations for the underlying system and will\nbe significant for the potential creation of future mathematical or\ncomputational models.",

    "abstract": "As AI is increasingly integrated into products and critical systems,\nresearchers are paying greater attention to identifying related\nvulnerabilities. Effective remediation depends on whether vendors are willing\nto accept and respond to AI vulnerability reports. In this paper, we examine\nthe disclosure policies of 264 AI vendors. Using a mixed-methods approach, our\nquantitative analysis finds that 36% of vendors provide no disclosure channel,\nand only 18% explicitly mention AI-related risks. Vulnerabilities involving\ndata access, authorization, and model extraction are generally considered\nin-scope, while jailbreaking and hallucination are frequently excluded. Through\nqualitative analysis, we further identify three vendor postures toward AI\nvulnerabilities - proactive clarification (n = 46, include active supporters,\nAI integrationists, and back channels), silence (n = 115, include self-hosted\nand hosted vendors), and restrictive (n = 103). Finally, by comparing vendor\npolicies against 1,130 AI incidents and 359 academic publications, we show that\nbug bounty policy evolution has lagged behind both academic research and\nreal-world events.",

    "abstract": "Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,\nenvironmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial\nand spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral\nimagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while\nhyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior\nhyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix\nfactorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and\nspectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based\nmodel that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while\npreserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes\nfive multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at\nthe same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors\ngrow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To\naddress this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively\nexpands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.\nMoreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and\norders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise\nrelations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our\nmodel achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,\noutperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by\nmore than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical\nvalue of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification\nand burnt area segmentation.",

Here we experimentally demonstrate a photonic\nanalogue of this principle and reveal the infinite nonreciprocity of the\ntime-reversal-symmetric Maxwell equations. By designing a non-Hermitian\nzero-index magneto-optical metawaveguide, we introduce multivalued feature to\nthis metawaveguide's complex eigenspace via an exceptional point with non-zero\nresidue, bringing nonlocal, path-dependent historical memory to the system.\nHence, a weak magneto-optical response can direct forward and backward waves to\ntwo photonic branches with largely distinct momenta and losses, leading to the\noptical nonreciprocity far beyond the limitation imposed by the magneto-optical\nmaterial. We fabricated an a-Si/Ce:YIG metawaveguide, achieving nonreciprocal\nphase shift of 47.78 rad/mm and nonreciprocal loss of 53.9 dB/mm near 1575 nm,\nexceeding state-of-the-art nonreciprocal devices by an order of magnitude. Our\nprinciple universally applies from microwave to visible frequencies, leading to\ncompact isolators, circulators, and sensors.

In these\nscenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained\ncommunication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines,\notherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In\nthis work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted\nin robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic\nloads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time\narrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an\nIEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's\ndeterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot\ntraffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical\ncommand delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic\nintegration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for\nestablishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic\nTDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV\nprotection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from\ninterference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot\nOperating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces\nmissed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed\nrobot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS)\ntrajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while\nmaintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.",

We focus on a conformal scalar field in a de Sitter\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmology with flat but compact\nspatial sections in 3+1 dimensions, and a comoving Unruh-DeWitt detector: the\nnovel coupling posits the detector to couple to the scaled scalar field that\nappears in the conformally related static spacetime. We survey the differences\nbetween the conventional and novel coupling, for detectors that couple to the\nfull field and detectors that couple only to specific field modes, and for\ndetectors with proper time internal dynamics and detectors with conformal time\ninternal dynamics. We also briefly discuss noncompact spatial sections and\nsingle-mode detectors with discontinuous time dependence. We find that the\nnovel coupling tends to enhance the de-excitation peaks in the detector's\nresponse, particularly for single-mode detectors.",

We investigate the transfer of mechanical\nnoise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave\ncavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing\nin one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of\nits resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously,\noptomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical\nmodes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode\n(target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical\nmodes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from\nthe squeezing in the control mode.

In\nparticular, we recognize that ECC chips (used for parity storage) do not\nnecessarily require the same performance level as regular data chips. This\noffers two-fold benefits: First, the bandwidth originally provisioned for a\nregular-performance ECC chip can instead be used to accommodate multiple\nlow-performance chips. Second, the cost of ECC chips can be effectively\nreduced, as lower performance often correlates with lower expense. In addition,\nwe observe that server-class memory chips are often provisioned with ample, yet\nunderutilized I/O resources. This further offers the opportunity to repurpose\nthese resources to enable flexible on-DIMM interconnections.

The cascading effect of\ntraffic congestion propagation can cause large-scale disruptions to networks.\nExisting studies have laid a solid foundation for characterizing the cascading\neffects. However, they typically rely on predefined graph structures and lack\nadaptability to diverse data granularities. To address these limitations, we\npropose a spatiotemporal adaptive local search (STALS) method, which feeds the\ndynamically adaptive adjacency matrices into the local search algorithm to\nlearn propagation rules. Specifically, the STALS is composed of two data-driven\nmodules. One is a dynamic adjacency matrix learning module, which learns the\nspatiotemporal relationship from congestion graphs by fusing four node\nfeatures. The other one is the local search module, which introduces local\ndominance to identify multi-scale congestion bottlenecks and search their\npropagation pathways. We test our method on the four benchmark networks with an\naverage of 15,000 nodes. The STALS remains a Normalized Mutual Information\n(NMI) score at 0.97 and an average execution time of 27.66s, outperforming six\nstate-of-the-art methods in robustness and efficiency. We also apply the STALS\nto three large-scale traffic networks in New York City, the United States,\nShanghai, China, and Urumqi, China. The ablation study reveals an average\nmodularity of 0.78 across three cities, demonstrating the spatiotemporal-scale\ninvariance of frequencytransformed features and the spatial heterogeneity of\ngeometric topological features.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning\nframework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while\nrefining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core\ncomponents: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies\ndownstream samples most representative of the original pre-training\ndistribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and\nGeneralization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge\ndistillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention\nof pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets\ncovering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial\nperformance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,\nevaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT\nenhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation.

We assume that as long as\nthe target is within the sensing radius from the sensor, the sensor-attacker\nteam is able to measure the target's instantaneous position and velocity. We\npose and solve this problem as a \\emph{game of kind} in which the target uses\nan open-loop strategy (passive target). Aside from the novel formulation, our\ncontributions are four-fold. First, we present optimal strategies for both the\nsensor and the attacker, according to their respective objectives.\nSpecifically, we design a sensor strategy that maximizes the duration for which\nthe target remains within its sensing range, while the attacker uses\nproportional navigation to capture the target.

    "abstract": "$H$-Packing is the problem of finding a maximum number of vertex-disjoint\ncopies of $H$ in a given graph $G$. $H$-Partition is the special case of\nfinding a set of vertex-disjoint copies that cover each vertex of $G$ exactly\nonce. Our goal is to study these problems and some generalizations on\nbounded-treewidth graphs. The case of $H$ being a triangle is well understood:\ngiven a tree decomposition of $G$ having treewidth $tw$, the $K_3$-Packing\nproblem can be solved in time $2^{tw} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$, while Lokshtanov et\nal.~[{\\it ACM Transactions on Algorithms} 2018] showed, under the Strong\nExponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH), that there is no $(2-\\epsilon)^{tw}\\cdot\nn^{O(1)}$ algorithm for any $\\epsilon>0$ even for $K_3$-Partition. Similar\nresults can be obtained for any other clique $K_d$ for $d\\ge 3$. We provide\ngeneralizations in two directions:\n  - We consider a generalization of the problem where every vertex can be used\nat most $c$ times for some $c\\ge 1$. When $H$ is any clique $K_d$ with $d\\ge\n3$, then we give upper and lower bounds showing that the optimal running time\nincreases to $(c+1)^{tw}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$. We consider two variants depending on\nwhether a copy of $H$ can be used multiple times in the packing.\n  - If $H$ is not a clique, then the dependence of the running time on\ntreewidth may not be even single exponential. Specifically, we show that if $H$\nis any fixed graph where not every 2-connected component is a clique, then\nthere is no $2^{o({tw}\\log {tw})}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for\n\\textsc{$H$-Partition}, assuming the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH).",

Under spatial confinement, cells are known to exhibit\neither vortex rotation or oscillatory motion depending on boundary geometry,\nbut the mechanisms governing transitions between these states remain unclear.\nHere, we investigated the collective motion of MDCK cells confined within a\ndoublet circular boundary, where the confinement aspect ratio, defined as the\ndistance between the centers of two circles relative to their radius, can be\ntuned by varying the degree of overlap. When the overlap is large, cells form a\nstable vortex. Increasing the confinement aspect ratio destabilizes this vortex\nand induces oscillatory motion characterized by periodic reversals of migration\ndirection, before ultimately transitioning into disordered dynamics. To\nelucidate the underlying mechanism, we developed simulations of self-propelled\nparticles incorporating local alignment (LA) and contact inhibition of\nlocomotion (CIL). The model successfully reproduced the experimentally observed\ntransitions from vortices to oscillatory motion and further revealed that an\nappropriate balance between LA and CIL is critical for stabilizing vortex pairs\nwith velocity reversals.

    "abstract": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computation with classical\nMachine Learning (ML) and holds the potential to achieve the quantum advantage\nfor specific tasks. In classical ML, Machine Unlearning (MU) is a crucial\nstrategy for removing the influence of specified training data from a model, to\nmeet regulatory requirements and mitigate privacy risks. However, both the risk\nof training-data membership leakage remains underexplored in QML. This\nmotivates us to propose Quantum Machine Unlearning (QMU) to explore two core\nquestions: do QML models require MU due to training-data membership leakage,\nand can MU mechanisms be efficiently implemented in the QML? To answer the two\nquestions, we conducted experiments on the MNIST classification task, utilizing\na class-wise unlearning paradigm in both noiseless simulations and quantum\nhardware. First, we quantify training-data privacy leakage using a Membership\nInference Attack (MIA), observing average success rates of 90.2\\% in noiseless\nsimulations and 75.3\\% on quantum hardware. These results indicate that QML\nmodels present training-data membership leakage with very high probability\nunder adversarial access, motivating the need for MU. Second, we implement MU\nalgorithms on the QML model, which reduces the average MIA success rate to 0\\%\nin simulations and 3.7\\% on quantum hardware while preserving accuracy on\nretained data. We conclude that implementing MU mechanisms in QML models\nrenders them resistant to MIA. Overall, this paper reveals significant privacy\nvulnerabilities in QML models and provides effective corresponding defense\nstrategies, providing a potential path toward privacy-preserving QML systems.",

This allows\nus to classify the chain, according to transience, recurrence in the sense of\nHarris, and positive recurrence in the sense of Harris. We further go on to\ndevelop tail asymptotics for the stationary distribution of the maximum dater\nsequence, when the service times have tails that are asymptotically exponential\nor Pareto, and we contrast the stability theory for the infinite server queue\nrelative to that for the single server queue.",

However, there is a need to develop\nefficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and\nthe model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been\nproposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving\naccording to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model.

Due to the high cost of\nlabeling and maintenance, recent research has turned to online HD map\nconstruction using onboard sensor data, offering wider coverage and more timely\nupdates for autonomous vehicles. However, the robustness of online map\nconstruction under adversarial conditions remains underexplored. In this paper,\nwe present a systematic vulnerability analysis of online map construction\nmodels, which reveals that these models exhibit an inherent bias toward\npredicting symmetric road structures. In asymmetric scenes like forks or\nmerges, this bias often causes the model to mistakenly predict a straight\nboundary that mirrors the opposite side. We demonstrate that this vulnerability\npersists in the real-world and can be reliably triggered by obstruction or\ntargeted interference. Leveraging this vulnerability, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage attack framework capable of manipulating online constructed maps.\nFirst, our method identifies vulnerable asymmetric scenes along the victim AV's\npotential route. Then, we optimize the location and pattern of camera-blinding\nattacks and adversarial patch attacks.

This article\nuses a series of one-shot experiments to quantify the behavioral, welfare and\ndistribution consequences of large language models (LLMs) on AI-AI,\nHuman-Human, Human-AI and Human-AI-Human expert markets. Using a credence goods\nframework where experts have private information about the optimal service for\nconsumers, we find that Human-Human markets generally achieve higher levels of\nefficiency than AI-AI and Human-AI markets through pro-social expert\npreferences and higher consumer trust. Notably, LLM experts still earn\nsubstantially higher surplus than human experts -- at the expense of consumer\nsurplus - suggesting adverse incentives that may spur the harmful deployment of\nLLMs. Concurrently, a majority of human experts chooses to rely on LLM agents\nwhen given the opportunity in Human-AI-Human markets, especially if they have\nagency over the LLM's (social) objective function. Here, a large share of\nexperts prioritizes efficiency-loving preferences over pure self-interest.\nDisclosing these preferences to consumers induces strong efficiency gains by\nmarginalizing self-interested LLM experts and human experts. Consequently,\nHuman-AI-Human markets outperform Human-Human markets under transparency rules.\nWith obfuscation, however, efficiency gains disappear, and adverse expert\nincentives remain. Our results shed light on the potential opportunities and\nrisks of disseminating LLMs in the context of expert services and raise several\nregulatory challenges. On the one hand, LLMs can negatively affect human trust\nin the presence of information asymmetries and partially crowd-out experts'\nother-regarding preferences through automation.

In particular, we show that limit\ncycles can arise when interactions include parasitic phases but are absent in\nstrictly mutualistic regimes. This framework provides a general approach for\ncharacterizing the population dynamics of interacting species and highlights\nthe effect of the transitions from mutualism to parasitism due to density\ndependence.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operate on battery power, making energy\nefficiency a critical consideration, particularly in outdoor environments where\nterrain variations affect energy consumption. While prior research has\nprimarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a\ndestination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot\nneeds to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact\nenergy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the\nObject-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses\nenergy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one\nof many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,\nwe first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a\nvariant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit\neach pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from\nhigh computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To\nmitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages\nmultiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to\nour solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of\nthe Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints. We\ndemonstrate that PCPD significantly reduces branching factors during search,\nimproving overall performance. Although the concurrent PCPD search may produce\nslightly suboptimal solutions, extensive experiments on real-world datasets\nshow it achieves near-optimal performance while being one to two orders of\nmagnitude faster than the baseline algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have\nbeen significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series\nproperties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an\nintrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing\nbenchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,\nrestricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there\nis no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost\nexpenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream\napplications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing\nrelation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for\nrecommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we\nconstruct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a\ncomprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct\nan extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the\nrelationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our\nexperimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we\npropose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing\ninterpretable suggestions for real-world time series.

The Local Pool\nstores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently\nhigh-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The\nPolicy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top\nthree policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the\ncurrent iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy\nusing feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited\ninto the Local Pool.

The packing of footwear products is a typical representative\npaired-item packing task involving irregular shapes and deformable objects.\nAlthough studies on shoe packing have been conducted, different initial states\ndue to the irregular shapes of shoes and standard packing placement poses have\nnot been considered. This study proposes a robotic manipulation framework,\nincluding a perception module, reorientation planners, and a packing planner,\nthat can complete the packing of pairs of shoes in any initial state. First, to\nadapt to the large intraclass variations due to the state, shape, and\ndeformation of the shoe, we propose a vision module based on semantic\nkeypoints, which can also infer more information such as size, state, pose, and\nmanipulation points by combining geometric features. Subsequently, we not only\nproposed primitive-based reorientation methods for different states of a single\ndeformable shoe but also proposed a fast reorientation method for the top state\nusing box edge contact and gravity, which further improved the efficiency of\nreorientation. Finally, based on the perception module and reorientation\nmethods, we propose a task planner for shoe pair packing in any initial state\nto provide an optimal packing strategy. Real-world experiments were conducted\nto verify the robustness of the reorientation methods and the effectiveness of\nthe packing strategy for various types of shoes. In this study, we highlight\nthe potential of semantic keypoint representation methods, introduce new\nperspectives on the reorientation of 3D deformable objects and multi-object\nmanipulation, and provide a reference for paired object packing.",

For a\ntemporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and\nabsorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a\ngiven band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands\nare added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange\nis a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model,\nwhich we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number.\nInterestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the\ndrives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the\npresence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier\nspectra.

An empirical relation exists between the fragility of the liquid\nand the broadness of its relaxation spectrum. However, the microscopic origins\nof this correlation remain unclear and its generality has been debated\\cite.\nHere, we demonstrate that this relationship is inverted in organic materials\nwith ionic interactions. We introduce a novel class of materials consisting of\nhighly charged hydrophobic polymers cross-linked via moderated ionic\ninteractions, and show that these combine a strong glass transition with an\nunusually broad mechanical relaxation spectrum. By surveying a large variety of\nionic liquids, polymerized ionic liquids, and ionomers, we show that all these\ncharged materials follow a trend between fragility and relaxation broadness\nthat is opposite to that of non-charged materials.

We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report\nimages. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini\n2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of\n100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically\nrelevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then\nprocessed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models\nresponded.

Existing MIAs targeting RAG's external databases often rely on model\nresponses but ignore the interference of non-member-retrieved documents on RAG\noutputs, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose DCMI, a\ndifferential calibration MIA that mitigates the negative impact of\nnon-member-retrieved documents. Specifically, DCMI leverages the sensitivity\ngap between member and non-member retrieved documents under query perturbation.\nIt generates perturbed queries for calibration to isolate the contribution of\nmember-retrieved documents while minimizing the interference from\nnon-member-retrieved documents. Experiments under progressively relaxed\nassumptions show that DCMI consistently outperforms baselines--for example,\nachieving 97.42% AUC and 94.35% Accuracy against the RAG system with Flan-T5,\nexceeding the MBA baseline by over 40%. Furthermore, on real-world RAG\nplatforms such as Dify and MaxKB, DCMI maintains a 10%-20% advantage over the\nbaseline. These results highlight significant privacy risks in RAG systems and\nemphasize the need for stronger protection mechanisms.

Yet the\nrule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming\nbenchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to\nwhether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.\nFurthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical\ndepth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We\npropose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward\nframework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning\nQuality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that\ndemonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising\nthe trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage\ndecays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a\nvalidation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous\nassessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive\nreasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a\ncomprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B\nmodel attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing\nsteps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The\nmodel further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning\ndatasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24.

Next, we analyze the structures of\nglobal multi-dimensional Riemann solutions for scalar conservation laws with\nnon-Lipschitz source terms, where the Riemann-type initial data consist of two\ndifferent constant states separated by a smooth hypersurface. More precisely,\nwe construct the global multidimensional Riemann solutions with non-selfsimilar\nstructures, including nonselfsimilar shock waves and nonselfsimilar rarefaction\nwaves, and prove that these two kinds of basic waves can be expressed via the\nimplicit functions of functional equation determined by the initial\ndiscontinuity, the flux functions, and the non-Lipschitz source term. Moreover,\nwe discover two new phenomena: (i) such kinds of basic waves can disappear in a\nfinite time and (ii) the new-type rarefaction wave can contain some weak\ndiscontinuities in its interior. These behaviors are in stark contrast to the\ncase of the Lipschitz source term, where these two kinds of basic waves persist\nglobally and the rarefaction waves remain smooth in the interior.

Most existing\nmethods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former\noften additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale\nand low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained\ndynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level\nfeatures of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank\nprocess encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.\nSpecifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for\nframe representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate\nrank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from\nrank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.\nFinally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic\nimage construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and\nthe latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.\nThe design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing\nfacial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity\nissue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image\nconstruction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%\nover the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,\nCAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively.

Some papers also see LRs as functional and others as non-functional\nrequirements. Legal requirements are often characterized as being vague and\ncomplex, requiring a lot of effort to elicit, implement, and validate. These\ncharacterizations supposedly correlate with knowledge gaps among requirements\nengineers. LRs are also seen to often change and overlap. They may be also\nprioritized.

This leads to multiple valid answers,\neach grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional\nVQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we\npresent BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency\nin the face of ambiguity.

Evaluated on the\nVQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves\nmore robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.\nThis work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human\nuncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users.

Following the detection of a\ncompanion candidate around the young ($\\sim 15$ Myr) binary star HD 143811, we\ncollected a new observation with SPHERE@VLT ($0.95-1.67 {\\mu}$m) to confirm the\npresence of the source and to assess its physical bond to the target.

Moreover, current content quality evaluations often rely on\nsubjective human judgment, which is labor-intensive and lacks objectivity,\npotentially compromising the consistency and reliability. In this study, to\nprovide a quantitative evaluation and enhance research proposal writing\ncapabilities of LLMs, we propose two key evaluation metrics--content quality\nand reference validity--and an iterative prompting method based on the scores\nderived from these two metrics.

The surface flux transport (SFT) model has been successful\nin describing the large-scale evolution of the surface field, but its ability\nto capture observed multi-scale features, quantified by magnetic power spectra,\nremains uncertain. Here, we evaluate the SFT model by comparing observed and\nsimulated power spectra across a broad range of spatial scales and by analyzing\nthe effects of key transport parameters. We find that the simulations reproduce\nthe observed spectra well at spherical harmonic degrees $l\\lesssim60$, but\ndiverge progressively at smaller spatial scales $l\\gtrsim60$.

    "abstract": "This work presents a comprehensive investigation of the HH alloy PdCrAs using\nfirst - principles methods, highlighting its potential applications in various\nfields, including spintronics, thermoelectrics, and optoelectronics. We\nemployed density functional theory (DFT) within the full potential linearized\naugmented plane wave (FLAPW) framework. Structural optimizations indicate that\nthe alloy stabilizes in the ferromagnetic phase. Both mechanical and dynamical\nstability have been confirmed through analyses of elastic constants and phonon\ndispersion. Our calculations of the electronic band structure and density of\nstates (DOS) reveal that PdCrAs exhibits half-metallic behavior, with a\nspin-polarized band gap of 0.670 eV in the minority spin channel. The magnetic\nmoment aligns with the Slater Pauling (SP) rule, indicating robust\nferromagnetism. Mechanical analysis shows that the material is ductile in\nnature. Thermodynamic analysis highlights the alloy's resilience, supported by\nconsistent trends in entropy, heat capacity, and Debye temperature.Its optical\nresponse demonstrates strong absorption in the visible and ultraviolet (UV)\nregions, along with pronounced dielectric and plasmonic features, suggesting\npotential applications in optoelectronics and refracective coatings.\nFurthermore, evaluations of the transport properties reveal high Seebeck\ncoefficients and a significantly tunable figure of merit (ZT), with values\napproaching 0.9 across the temperature range of 300 - 1500 K, indicating\nexcellent thermoelectric characteristics. Overall, these findings position\nPdCrAs as a promising multifunctional material suitable sustainable energy\nsolutions.",

    "abstract": "The EU AI Act provides a rulebook for all AI systems being put on the market\nor into service in the European Union. This article investigates the\nrequirement under the AI Act that Member States establish national AI\nregulatory sandboxes for testing and validation of innovative AI systems under\nregulatory supervision to assist with fostering innovation and complying with\nregulatory requirements. Against the backdrop of the EU objective that AI\nregulatory sandboxes would both foster innovation and assist with compliance,\nconsiderable challenges are identified for Member States around\ncapacity-building and design of regulatory sandboxes. While Member States are\nearly movers in laying the ground for national AI regulatory sandboxes, the\narticle contends that there is a risk that differing approaches being taken by\nindividual national sandboxes could jeopardise a uniform interpretation of the\nAI Act and its application in practice. This could motivate innovators to play\nsandbox arbitrage. The article therefore argues that the European Commission\nand the AI Board need to act decisively in developing rules and guidance to\nensure a cohesive, coordinated approach in national AI regulatory sandboxes.\nWith sandbox participation being voluntary, the possibility that AI regulatory\nsandboxes may prove unattractive to innovators on their compliance journey is\nalso explored. Confidentiality concerns, the inability to relax legal rules\nduring the sandbox, and the inability of sandboxes to deliver a presumption of\nconformity with the AI Act are identified as pertinent concerns for innovators\ncontemplating applying to AI regulatory sandboxes as compared with other direct\ncompliance routes provided to them through application of harmonised standards\nand conformity assessment procedures.",

For example, in climate sciences, low precipitation events may\nlead to droughts, while heavy rainfall may generate large floods, and both of\nthese extreme scenarios can have major impacts on the safety of people and\ninfrastructure, as well as agricultural or other economic sectors. In the\nunivariate case, the extended generalized Pareto distribution (eGPD) was\nspecifically developed to accurately model low, moderate, and high\nprecipitation intensities, while bypassing the threshold selection procedure\nusually conducted in extreme-value analyses. In this work, we extend this\napproach to the multivariate case. The proposed multivariate eGPD has the\nfollowing appealing properties: (1) its marginal distributions behave like\nunivariate eGPDs; (2) its lower and upper joint tails comply with multivariate\nextreme-value theory, with key parameters separately controlling dependence in\neach joint tail; and (3) the model allows for fast simulation and is thus\namenable to simulation-based inference.

Most studies tacitly assume\ndynamic stress waves as the main triggering factor, often disregarding the role\nof coseismic static stress changes associated with fault slip. This paper\nintroduces a novel analytical framework to diagnose both static and dynamic\ncoseismic stress perturbations and quantify their contributions to fault-slip\nrockburst around a circular tunnel. Building on linear elastic fracture\nmechanics, seismic source theory, and the Kirsch solution, the model assesses\nwhether coseismically elevated maximum tangential stress on the tunnel boundary\nunder static and dynamic triggering effects is sufficient to induce failure\naround the tunnel. We extensively test our framework using synthetic case\nstudies that represent typical fault-slip rockburst scenarios.

They overly rely on textual similarity\nfor retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and\ninheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively\nconcatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address\nthese shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph\nthat unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs,\nclass hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code\nsemantics.

Using the stellar and binary evolution code MESA, which includes a\nrecently proposed helium-star wind prescription alongside internal differential\nrotation and tidal interactions,we find that the recently proposed wind\nprescription for helium stars is substantially weaker than the standard Dutch\nwind scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Using this scheme, we\nperform detailed binary modeling of a helium star with a black hole companion.\nOur results show that the spin magnitude of the resulting black hole is\ninsensitive to the helium star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal\ninteractions or to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss plays the\ndominant role: more massive helium-star progenitors produce lower-spinning\nblack holes. The initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially\nunder strong tidal coupling, consistent with the common assumption of orbital\nsynchronization. Using the derived relation between the mass and spin of the\nsecond-born black hole, we find that the properties of most binary black holes\nin GWTC-4.0-specifically the mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin\nchi_eff-can be reproduced.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data\ndistribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to\naddress this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for\ngreater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training\ndomains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.\nTo enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to\nbe trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an\ninherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the\nunseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that\nleverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the\ndomain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped\nonto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen\ndomain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both\ntraining and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively\nreduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen\ndomains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently\noutperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a\nlimited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up\nto 19.82\\% compared to the next best approach.",

The post measurement states are\nanalyzed via their Schmidt rank to characterize residual bipartite\nentanglement. For the symmetric $\\wwbar$ state, measurement of any qubit\nconsistently results in a non-maximally entangled post-measurement state\n(Schmidt rank 2), analogous to the behavior of a \\textit{3-Hopf link}\nstructure, where cutting any ring leaves the remaining two nontrivially linked.\nOn the other hand, the $\\starstate$ state exhibits a context-dependent\nfragility. Its behavior predominantly mirrors that of a \\textit{3-link chain},\nwhere severing the central qubit decouples the system, while cutting an outer\nqubit often preserves a residual link. Crucially, for specific measurement\noutcomes, the $\\starstate$ state also exhibits the defining property of the\n\\textit{Borromean rings}, where the loss of one qubit completely disentangles\nthe remaining two. This analysis provides a concrete interpretation of\ntopological linking structures as a resource for characterizing distributed\nentanglement and its resilience under local measurement operations, revealing\nthat a single quantum state can contextually embody multiple distinct\ntopological analogues.",

This advantage is realized by leveraging powerful\nneural networks to learn an optimal end-to-end mapping from the source data\ndirectly to the transmit symbol sequence, eliminating the need for separate\nsource coding, channel coding, and modulation. Although numerous efforts have\nbeen made towards efficient DeepJSCC, they have largely stayed at numerical\nsimulations that can be far from practice, leaving the real-world viability of\nDeepJSCC largely unverified. To this end, we prototype DeepStream upon\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to offer efficient\nand robust DeepJSCC for multimedia transmission. In conforming to OFDM, we\ndevelop both a feature-to-symbol mapping method and a cross-subcarrier\nprecoding method to improve the subcarrier independence and reduce\npeak-to-average power ratio. To reduce system complexity and enable flexibility\nin accommodating varying quality of service requirements, we further propose a\nprogressive coding strategy that adjusts the compression ratio based on latency\nwith minimal performance loss. We implement DeepStream for real-time image\ntransmission and video streaming using software-defined radio. Extensive\nevaluations verify that DeepStream outperforms both the standard scheme and the\ndirect deployment scheme. Particularly, at an SNR of 10 dB, DeepStream achieves\na PSNR of 35 dB for image transmission and an MS-SSIM of 20 dB for video\nstreaming, whereas the standard scheme fails to recover meaningful information.",

Two key features that are particularly relevant when\nthis vitrimer concept is used to compatibilize immiscible polymer blends are\nhow they affect the (i) bulk polymer density and (ii) interfacial activity of\nthe crosslink groups. To probe these issues, we model both a bulk polymer melt\nand a thin film of a polymer melt both with explicit small molecular\ncrosslinkers, in the associative limit, i.e., when the number of crosslinks are\nfixed. We show that the bulk density and the distribution of stickers within a\npolymer matrix is strongly influenced by their size and interactions with the\nbase polymer. Specifically, when the crosslinkers are chemically compatible\nwith the base polymer, then the overall packing fraction increases, regardless\nof crosslinker size, while it decreases when crosslinkers are incompatible with\nthe polymers. Similarly, the crosslinkers segregate preferentially to the\npolymer-air interface when they are incompatible with the polymer chains,\nleading to a reduction interfacial tension. Thus, these incompatible\ncrosslinkers should help in affecting both the miscibility of polymer blends,\nand also their compatibility by creating copolymer structures at the interface.\nThese results demonstrate the key role of crosslinker-polymer interactions and\ncrosslinker size on the structural and interfacial properties of vitrimer\nmelts.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in\ndiagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors\nsuch as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis\nof diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these\nissues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis\nin the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature\nconcatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully\nleverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing\nthe side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a\ndual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual\ncomplementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs\ncross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding\nspatial information across different images, subsequently refining the\ncomplementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages\nlow- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural\nattributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features\nthat embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a\nmulti-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation\naccuracy at object boundaries.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for\nimproving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,\nspecifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A\ncritical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the\nintroduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly\nrealized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a\nsignificant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced\nnoise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to\nthe reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin\nof this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To\naddress this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,\nCoefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This\nleads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more\nstable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO\nand Dance-GRPO.

In recent\nyears, various CG methods have been extended to Riemannian manifold\noptimization, but existing Riemannian CG methods are confined to smooth\nobjective functions and cannot handle nonsmooth ones. This paper proposes a\nRiemannian conjugate subgradient method for a class of nonconvex, nonsmooth\noptimization problems on manifolds. Specifically, we first select a Riemannian\nsubgradient from the convex hull of two directionally active subgradients. The\nsearch direction is then defined as a convex combination of the negative of\nthis subgradient and the previous search direction transported to the current\ntangent space.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement toward sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks has\nsignificantly intensified the complexity and scale of optimization problems,\nincluding resource allocation and trajectory design, often formulated as\ncombinatorial problems in large discrete decision spaces. However, traditional\noptimization methods, such as heuristics and deep reinforcement learning (DRL),\nstruggle to meet the demanding requirements of real-time adaptability,\nscalability, and dynamic handling of user intents in increasingly heterogeneous\nand resource-constrained network environments. Large language models (LLMs)\npresent a transformative paradigm by enabling natural language-driven problem\nformulation, context-aware reasoning, and adaptive solution refinement through\nadvanced semantic understanding and structured reasoning capabilities. This\npaper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of LLM-enabled\noptimization frameworks tailored for wireless networks.

A scenario-based analysis is conducted to evaluate the\nimpacts of the extended components. Key findings show that incorporating demand\ncharges into the optimization reduces daily costs by 5% and decreases the share\nof peak power costs by 9%, underlining the importance of load management.\nIntegrating PV and ESS leads to a total net cost reduction of up to 56%, with\nESS primarily used for energy arbitrage rather than direct bus charging.

We evaluate a spectrum of\nalgorithms, from greedy (Min-RTT) and cooperative (Round-Robin) to hybrid\napproaches (Epsilon-Greedy), against axioms of Efficiency, Loss Avoidance,\nStability, and Fairness in a simulated path-aware environment.\n  Our simulations reveal that purely greedy strategies, while efficient under\nlow contention, induce catastrophic packet loss, increasing by over >18,000% as\nthe number of competing agents grow, due to herd effects that cause severe\nnetwork instability. Conversely, cooperative strategies ensure fairness and\nstability but at the cost of underutilizing high-capacity paths. Crucially, we\ndemonstrate that hybrid strategies resolve this conflict.

However, most\nexisting frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web\nautomation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,\nmulti-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with\ncustomized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial\nreasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools\nuniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different\ngeospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level\nplanner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to\nspecialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then\ndesign a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs\nadaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the\nquery, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)\noperate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces\ncognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise\ncoordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse\ngeospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and\nMapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented\nand agentic baselines.

    "abstract": "In mathematical optimization, we want to find the best possible solution for\na decision-making problem. Curiously, these problems are harder to solve if\nthey have discrete decisions. Imagine that you would like to buy chocolate: you\ncan buy no chocolate or one chocolate bar, but typically you cannot buy just\nhalf of a bar. Now imagine that you could also buy many other items, and that\nyou need to meet nutritional needs while minimizing the grocery bill. With more\noptions and more demands, finding the best solution becomes trickier. But since\nmany real-world settings benefit from mathematical optimization, such as\nscheduling trains and flights, planning truck deliveries, and making better\ninvestment decisions, these problems are widely studied in a branch of\nmathematics called Operations Research (OR). Sometimes we can simply write the\nmathematical model and find an optimal solution with OR software, but for\nlarger problems we may need to develop new mathematical models and even write\nour own algorithms. We explore both cases with a simple and well-known problem\n(the traveling salesperson problem), some computer programming (in Python), and\nsoftware that is free for academic use (Gurobi).",

Numerical simulations on diverse datasets, including high-resolution\nimages, show the BIQC's superior accuracy and scalability compared to existing\nmethods. This highlights the promise of brain-inspired, hybrid\nquantum-classical approach for developing next-generation visual systems.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) angular super-resolution (ASR) aims to reconstruct\nhigh-angular-resolution (HAR) signals from limited low-angular-resolution (LAR)\ndata without prolonging scan time. However, existing methods are limited in\nrecovering fine-grained angular details or preserving high fidelity due to\ninadequate modeling of q-space geometry and insufficient incorporation of\nphysical constraints. In this paper, we introduce a Physics-Guided Diffusion\nTransformer (PGDiT) designed to explore physical priors throughout both\ntraining and inference stages. During training, a Q-space Geometry-Aware Module\n(QGAM) with b-vector modulation and random angular masking facilitates\ndirection-aware representation learning, enabling the network to generate\ndirectionally consistent reconstructions with fine angular details from sparse\nand noisy data. In inference, a two-stage Spherical Harmonics-Guided Posterior\nSampling (SHPS) enforces alignment with the acquired data, followed by\nheat-diffusion-based SH regularization to ensure physically plausible\nreconstructions. This coarse-to-fine refinement strategy mitigates\noversmoothing and artifacts commonly observed in purely data-driven or\ngenerative models. Extensive experiments on general ASR tasks and two\ndownstream applications, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Neurite Orientation\nDispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), demonstrate that PGDiT outperforms\nexisting deep learning models in detail recovery and data fidelity. Our\napproach presents a novel generative ASR framework that offers high-fidelity\nHAR dMRI reconstructions, with potential applications in neuroscience and\nclinical research.",

    "abstract": "Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their\npractical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While\nadaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,\nthey introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save\ncomputation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically\nreduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this\nconflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike\nan optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first\naddresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by\nproposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep\nparameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields\ncompact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical\nsynchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents\na unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically\nassign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a\nnew Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively\noptimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a\nsingle model.",

We find that, regardless of the length of\nthe biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant\nto a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and\nintegrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire\nbiasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information\nvolume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic\ncorrelation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and\ncalculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate\nrepresentations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,\nphrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled\nto produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information\nacross various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual\nrecognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the\njoint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification\nmechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant\nbiasing phrases.

Due to the random\nvelocities, the exact locations of vehicles versus time, namely trajectories,\ncannot be determined in advance. Hence, instead of deterministic optimization,\nthe cell association, uplink time, and throughput allocation of multiple\nvehicles during a period of task offloading are formulated as a finite-horizon\nMarkov decision process. In order to derive a low-complexity solution\nalgorithm, a two-time-scale framework is proposed.

We explore two mechanisms\nfor ISO capture: gravitational braking (primarily with Jupiter) and the Hills\nmechanism with the Sun. Using N-body simulations, we investigate ISO capture\nrates, ejection probabilities, and the resulting orbital elements. Our\nsimulations suggest that approximately 10 ISOs may currently be bound to the\nsolar system, with the vast majority captured through gravitational braking by\nJupiter. These objects are bound by a Tisserand parameter with respect to\nJupiter less than three, tend to have high eccentricities, semi-major axes\nlarger than Jupiter's, and inclinations modestly biased toward the prograde\ndirection. This region is sparsely populated by observed solar system objects.\nBy comparing known solar system objects to the most probable orbital elements\nof our simulated ISOs, we identify 18 candidate objects in the current solar\nsystem population that may be bound ISOs captured by Jupiter. For the Hills\nmechanism, we find it to be a viable but less common capture pathway, typically\nproducing isotropic inclinations and perihelia less than one au. Based on these\ncharacteristics, we identify seven additional candidate objects for ISOs\ncaptured through the Hills mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Many data applications involve counting queries, where a client specifies a\nfeasible range of variables and a database returns the corresponding item\ncounts. A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks\nleaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance\ndata privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically\nachieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total\nprivacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of\nqueries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not\nmaintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many\napplications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,\nsigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion\nof sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that\nthe proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy\nwhile maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to\nthe same data.

To this end, we investigate both static and\ndynamic versions of an optimization algorithm. The static version assumes full\ntask availability, while the dynamic version manages tasks as they arrive.

We evaluate our proposed Online Dynamic Cost-Driven Algorithm\n(On-Dyn-CDA) against these baselines. Notably, the static Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO) baseline assumes all tasks are transferred to the RSU and\nprocessed by the MEC, and its offline version disregards execution time, making\nit infeasible for real-time applications despite its optimal performance in\ntheory. Our novel On-Dyn-CDA completes execution in just 0.05 seconds under the\nmost complex scenario, compared to 1330.05 seconds required by Dynamic PSO. It\nalso outperforms Dynamic PSO by 3.42% in task loss and achieves a 29.22%\nreduction in average latency in complex scenarios.

The flow is generated downstream of a\nregenerative pump in a duct, with Taylor-scale Reynolds number\n(Re_\\lambda~10^3), but turbulence decays rapidly along the duct. Shadowgraph\nimaging and particle shadow velocimetry are used for measurements. High-speed\nimaging and statistical analysis reveal that bubble coalescence dominates over\nbreakup across most of the domain, leading to monotonic growth in Sauter mean\ndiameter (d_{32}) and progressive broadening of the bubble size distribution.\nThe normalised extreme-to-mean diameter ratio increases axially and\nasymptotically saturates at~2.2, indicating the emergence of a\nquasi-self-similar bubble size distribution. The probability density function\nof bubble diameter exhibits a dual power law tail with exponents $-10/3$ and\n-3/2 near the duct inlet, where the flow is coalescence-dominated. However,\nafter a few hydraulic diameters, a single~-3/2 power law scaling emerges,\nindicating a regime of pure coalescence in which all bubbles are smaller than\nthe Hinze scale. The cumulative distribution with d/d_{32} exponent (~1.3)\nemerges only after the size distribution stabilises. Although classical Hinze\nscaling gives d_H ~ L^0.9, our theory for d_{32} and~d_{99.8}(99.8th percentile\nbubble diameter) in a pure-coalescence regime predicts the slower law~ L^0.5,\nwhich our experimental results confirm, indicating negligible breakup and\nsub-Hinze growth. In contrast to current models, transient void fraction\nprofiles evolve from nearly uniform to sharply core-peaked Gaussian\ndistributions in the developing regime, with increasing centerline values and\ndecreasing near-wall values, due to lift-force reversal.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical\ntext is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the\ncontinuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge\nwith two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a\nframework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define\nhigh-salience key facts and an \"LLM Jury\"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses\ntheir inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a\nmodel-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual\ndischarge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a\ngold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on\nclinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury\nachieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a\nperformance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert\n(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework\n(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),\noffering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of\ngenerative AI in clinical workflows.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in systems with competing\ninteractions, we developed a self-learning quantum Monte Carlo (SLQMC) method\nto simulate the phase transition in the classical Holstein-spin-fermion model.\nIn SLQMC, machine learning techniques are employed to approximate the free\nenergy, thereby bypassing the need for exact diagonalization and significantly\nreducing computational cost. We assess the performance of SLQMC using both\nlinear regression and neural network models. Our results show that both models\nare capable of capturing the phase transition from the antiferromagnetic state\nto the charge-density-wave state. However, the sampling efficiency decreases\nnear the AFM-CDW phase transition, which is attributed to the increased\nmean-squared-error of the machine learning model. Additionally, the sampling\nefficiency decreases with increasing lattice size. This suppression is due to\nthe increased root-mean-squared-error as the machine learning model is applied\nto a large lattice and the finite-size effect, wherein the energy gap between\nthe ground state and low-energy excited states decreases as the lattice grows.\nOur findings highlight the necessity of highly accurate machine learning models\nto simulate theoretical models with complex, competing microscopic interactions\non a large lattice.",
