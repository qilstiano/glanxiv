We compared this result with annual\nvalues of the ADF calculated for the Dalton Minimum and the most recent solar\ncycles.

A\nfundamental challenge in these methods is their dependency on hardware-specific\ntraining data and their limited ability to generalize. Large drops in\nperformance are reported in literature when DL models trained in one antenna\nenvironment are applied in another. This paper proposes the application of\nPrototypical Networks to address this challenge and utilizes the DeepBeam\nreal-world dataset to validate the developed solutions. Prototypical Networks\nexcel in extracting features to establish class-specific prototypes during the\ntraining, resulting in precise embeddings that encapsulate the defining\nfeatures of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PN to enable\ngeneralization of deep beam predictors across unseen antennas. Our approach,\nwhich integrates data normalization and prototype normalization with the PN,\nachieves an average beam classification accuracy of 74.11 percent when trained\nand tested on different antenna datasets. This is an improvement of 398 percent\ncompared to baseline performances reported in literature that do not account\nfor such domain shifts.

The nature\nand origin of radio emission in these types of sources is typically ambiguous\nbased on all-sky, low-resolution surveys. With e-MERLIN, we investigate radio\nemission on sub-kiloparsec scales ($\\sim$10s-100s pc). We find 37/42 quasars\nare detected, with a diversity of radio morphologies, including compact cores,\nknots and extended jet-like structures, with sizes of 30-540 pc. Based on\nmorphology and brightness temperature, we classify 76 per cent of the quasars\nas radio-AGN, compared to the $\\sim$57 per cent identified as radio-AGN at the\n$\\sim$1-60 kpc scales probed in prior studies. Combining results from e-MERLIN\nand the Very Large Array, 86 per cent reveal a radio-AGN. On average, $\\sim$60\nper cent of the total radio flux is resolved away in the e-MERLIN maps, and is\nlikely dominated by jet-driven lobes and outflow-driven shocks. We find no\nsignificant differences in measured radio properties between type 1 and type 2\nquasars, and estimate sub-relativistic jet speeds of $\\sim$0.2-0.3c and modest\njet powers of $P_\\mathrm{jet} \\approx \\times$10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the few\ntargets, where these measurements were possible.

By understanding the attack nature and\nunderlying weaknesses, the paper aims to enhance bridge security and propose\npotential countermeasures. The findings contribute to developing industry-wide\nstandards for bridge security and operational resilience. Addressing the\nvulnerabilities and weaknesses exploited in recent cross-chain bridge hacks\nfosters trust and confidence in cross-chain interoperability.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion wake accompanying a Mach cone is a unique feature of the medium\nresponse to projectiles traveling at a speed faster than the velocity of sound.\nThis is also the case for jet-medium interaction inside the quark-gluon plasma\nin high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in\nthe opposite direction of the propagating jet and has been recently observed in\n$Z$-jet events of Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. In di-jet events, however, the\ndiffusion wake of one jet usually overlaps with the medium-induced hadron\nenhancement of other jet without a clear signal except a reduction of the\nhadron enhancement, unless there is a large rapidity gap between the two jets.\nWe propose to use the rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlations in di-jets\nwith a finite rapidity gap relative to that without, as a robust and\nbackground-free signal of the diffusion wake. The asymmetry emerges because the\ndiffusion wake of one jet is shifted to a finite rapidity relative to the other\njet. Consequently, a depletion of soft hadrons appears in the shifted rapidity\nregion of the diffusion wake and an enhancement in the rapidity region of the\nother jet whose soft hadron enhancement is no longer or less reduced by the\ndiffusion wake as in di-jets without a rapidity gap. We predict the rapidity\nasymmetry using both theoretical and mixed-event background subtraction for\ndifferent values of the rapidity gap within the CoLBT-hydro model. Future\nmeasurements of this rapidity asymmetry with high statistics data on di-jets\nshould provide more precise insights into the jet-induced diffusion wake and\nproperties of the quark-gluon plasma.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across\nvarious machine learning tasks, quickly becoming one of the most prevalent AI\nworkloads. Yet the substantial memory requirement of LLMs significantly hinders\ntheir deployment for end users. Post-training quantization (PTQ) serves as one\nof the most hardware-efficient methods to mitigate the memory and computational\ndemands of LLMs. Although the traditional integer (INT) datatype has received\nwidespread adoption in PTQ methods, floating-point (FP) quantization has\nemerged as a viable alternative thanks to its effectiveness in fitting LLM\nnumerical distributions. However, the FP datatype in sign-magnitude binary\nrepresentation contains both positive and negative zero, which constrains its\nrepresentation capability, particularly under low precision (3 and 4 bits). In\nthis paper, we extend the basic FP datatype to perform Redundant Zero Remapping\n(RaZeR), which remaps the negative zero FP encoding to a set of pre-defined\nspecial values to maximally utilize FP quantization encodings and to better fit\nLLM numerical distributions. Through careful selection of special values, RaZeR\noutperforms conventional asymmetric INT quantization while achieving high\ncomputational efficiency. We demonstrate that RaZeR can be seamlessly\nintegrated with quantization algorithms for both weights and KV-cache,\nincluding advanced methods with clipping and transformations, and consistently\nachieve better model accuracy. Additionally, we implement a fast GEMV kernel\nwith fused dequantization that efficiently converts the 4-bit RaZeR value to\nFP16 through novel bit-level manipulation. On modern GPUs, our evaluation shows\nthat RaZeR improves the GEMV speed by up to 7.56$\\times$ compared to the FP16\nimplementation, while achieving up to 2.72$\\times$ speedup in the LLM decoding\nthroughput.",

While there have been advancements in developing lightweight sensors,\noften drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has\nbeen able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external\nsensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of\nsustained hovering -- the first level of ``sensor autonomy'' -- is the much\nlarger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that\nvehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further\nreduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser\nrangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a\nsmaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter\n(KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed\nto control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system\nachieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in\nflight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 deg, 0.186 m/s, and 0.136 m,\nrespectively, relative to motion capture.",

Our study thoroughly investigates the\ntime-varying response of sensors to gust-airfoil interactions, uncovering\nvaluable insights into optimal sensor placement. To address uncertainties in\ndeep learning predictions, we implement probabilistic regression strategies to\nmodel both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Epistemic uncertainty,\nreflecting the model's confidence in its predictions, is modeled using Monte\nCarlo dropout, as an approximation to the variational inference in the Bayesian\nframework, treating the neural network as a stochastic entity. On the other\nhand, aleatoric uncertainty, arising from noisy input measurements, is captured\nvia learned statistical parameters, which propagates measurement noise through\nthe network into the final predictions. Our results showcase the efficacy of\nthis dual uncertainty quantification strategy in accurately predicting\naerodynamic behavior under extreme conditions while maintaining computational\nefficiency, underscoring its potential to improve online sensor-based flow\nestimation in real-world applications.",

One major OOD situations is when\nrobots encounter faults, making fault adaptation essential for real-world\noperation for robots. Current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning\nalgorithms show promising results but suffer from sample inefficiency, leading\nto low adaptation speed due to their limited ability to generalize to OOD\nsituations. Our research is a step towards adding hardware fault tolerance and\nfast fault adaptability to machines. In this research, our primary focus is to\ninvestigate the efficacy of generative flow networks in robotic environments,\nparticularly in the domain of machine fault adaptation. We simulated a robotic\nenvironment called Reacher in our experiments. We modify this environment to\nintroduce four distinct fault environments that replicate real-world\nmachines/robot malfunctions. The empirical evaluation of this research\nindicates that continuous generative flow networks (CFlowNets) indeed have the\ncapability to add adaptive behaviors in machines under adversarial conditions.\nFurthermore, the comparative analysis of CFlowNets with reinforcement learning\nalgorithms also provides some key insights into the performance in terms of\nadaptation speed and sample efficiency. Additionally, a separate study\ninvestigates the implications of transferring knowledge from pre-fault task to\npost-fault environments.

We provide direct experimental evidence that\nthe negative viscosity results from cells aligning their stresses with the\norientation of the flow. Regions of negative viscosity consistently exhibited\ngreater cell speed and vorticity, and the cells had elevated metabolic\nactivity, indicating that negative viscosity is a mechanism for injection of\nsurplus energy.

    "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), heterogeneity among the local dataset\ndistributions of clients can result in unsatisfactory performance for some,\nleading to an unfair model. To address this challenge, we propose an\nover-the-air fair federated learning algorithm (OTA-FFL), which leverages\nover-the-air computation to train fair FL models. By formulating FL as a\nmulti-objective minimization problem, we introduce a modified Chebyshev\napproach to compute adaptive weighting coefficients for gradient aggregation in\neach communication round. To enable efficient aggregation over the multiple\naccess channel, we derive analytical solutions for the optimal transmit scalars\nat the clients and the de-noising scalar at the parameter server. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of OTA-FFL in achieving fairness and\nrobust performance compared to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "The Bitcoin white paper introduced blockchain technology, enabling trustful\ntransactions without intermediaries. Smart contracts emerged with Ethereum and\nblockchains expanded beyond cryptocurrency, applying to auctions, crowdfunding\nand electronic voting. However, blockchain's transparency raised privacy\nconcerns and initial anonymity measures proved ineffective. Smart contract\nprivacy solutions employed zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption and\ntrusted execution environments. These approaches have practical drawbacks, such\nas limited functionality, high computation times and trust on third parties\nrequirements, being not fully decentralized. This work proposes a solution\nutilizing zk-SNARKs to provide privacy in smart contracts and blockchains. The\nsolution supports both fungible and nonfungible tokens.

Recent advances in multivariate information theory provide\na principled framework for quantifying these higher-order interactions,\ncapturing key properties such as redundancy, synergy, shared randomness, and\ncollective constraints. However, two major challenges persist: accurately\nestimating joint entropies and addressing the combinatorial explosion of\ninteracting terms.

THOI leverages\nthe well-established Gaussian copula method for joint entropy estimation,\ncombined with state-of-the-art batch and parallel processing techniques to\noptimize performance across CPU, GPU, and TPU environments. Our results\ndemonstrate that THOI significantly outperforms existing tools in terms of\nspeed and scalability. For larger systems, where exhaustive analysis is\ncomputationally impractical, THOI integrates optimization strategies that make\nhigher-order interaction analysis feasible. We validate THOI accuracy using\nsynthetic datasets with parametrically controlled interactions and further\nillustrate its utility by analyzing fMRI data from human subjects in wakeful\nresting states and under deep anesthesia.

The key focus is on fine-tuning\ncrucial parameters, including transmit power, receiver orientations, OIRS\nelements allocation, and strategic placement. In particular, a multi-objective\noptimization problem (MOOP) aimed at simultaneously improving the network's\nspectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) while adhering to the\nnetwork's quality of service (QoS) constraints is formulated. The problem is\nsolved by employing the $\\epsilon$-constraint method to convert the MOOP into a\nsingle-objective optimization problem and solving it through successive convex\napproximation. Simulation results show the significant impact of OIRS on SE and\nEE, confirming its effectiveness in improving OWC network performance.",

To address this challenge, synthetic data generation has emerged as a\npromising approach. In this paper, we propose to synthesize realistic license\nplates (LPs) using diffusion models, inspired by recent advances in image and\nvideo generation. In our experiments a diffusion model was successfully trained\non a Ukrainian LP dataset, and 1000 synthetic images were generated for\ndetailed analysis. Through manual classification and annotation of the\ngenerated images, we performed a thorough study of the model output, such as\nsuccess rate, character distributions, and type of failures. Our contributions\ninclude experimental validation of the efficacy of diffusion models for LP\nsynthesis, along with insights into the characteristics of the generated data.\nFurthermore, we have prepared a synthetic dataset consisting of 10,000 LP\nimages, publicly available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13342102.\nConducted experiments empirically confirm the usefulness of synthetic data for\nthe LPR task. Despite the initial performance gap between the model trained\nwith real and synthetic data, the expansion of the training data set with\npseudolabeled synthetic data leads to an improvement in LPR accuracy by 3%\ncompared to baseline.",

The\nproblem was recently proven to be NP-hard, such that optimal solutions obtained\nwith brute-force methods require exponentially many computation steps and thus\nare infeasible for any graph of realistic size. Therefore, it is common in such\ncases to use a simple greedy algorithm to obtain an approximation of the\noptimal solution. It is known that if the considered problem is submodular, the\nquality of the greedy solution can be guaranteed. However, it is known that the\noptimisation problem we are facing, is not submodular. For such cases one can\nuse the notion of generalized submodularity, which is captured by the\nsubmodularity ratio $\\gamma$. A performance bound, which is a function of\n$\\gamma$, also exists in case of generalized submodularity. In this paper we\ngive an example of a family of graphs where the submodularity ratio approaches\nzero, implying that the solution quality of the greedy algorithm cannot be\nguaranteed. Furthermore, we show that the greedy algorithm does not always\nyield the optimal solution and demonstrate that even for a small graph with 10\nnodes, the ratio between the optimal and the greedy solution can be as small as\n0.878.",

    "abstract": "We discuss a new strategy to compute partial Auger decay widths with\nequation-of-motion ionisation-potential coupled-cluster (EOMIP-CCSD) wave\nfunctions in the framework of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, where the\ndecaying character of the metastable states is described via complex-scaled\nbasis functions. While the total decay width can generally be obtained from the\nenergy eigenvalues, the computation of partial decay widths, i. e. the\ncontributions of channels to the total decay rate, governing their probability\ndistribution, is less trivial. In the past, methods where channels are\nprojected out during the EOMIP-CCSD iteration have been developed (Auger\nChannel Projector), but such a procedure requires to establish convergence of\nthe excitation vector for each separately. Furthermore, they suffer from\ninteraction between the channels upon perturbation of the wave function.\n  In contrast, we suggest to compute the contribution of the two-electron\ntransition that Auger decay implies, where two valence electrons are involved,\none refilling the core hole and one emitted to the continuum, from the\nrespective entries in the two-electron density matrix that describe the extent\nof this transition in the wave function upon application of correlation and\nexcitation operator. In this way, we obtain all partial decay widths from wave\nfunctions determined in the full excitation manifold. The results from this\napproach compare very well to the Auger Channel Projector results: we compute\nspectra for K-edge ionised states of methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, and the\ncyanide anion, as well as Coster-Kronig spectra of L1-edge ionised hydrogen\nsulfide, which differ only negligibly between the two methods. A spectrum of\nthe cyanide anion has not been reported before -- we discuss the selectivity of\nthe decay process with respect to the initial state and the possibility of\ninteratomic Auger decay.",

The extracted pure quantum information is then fused with\ntraditional feature information to jointly make the final decision.

The six\n4513-bit registers in the circuits have a common single-phase ac clock and\nindividual input/output drivers enabling their parallel testing. We have\ninvestigated flux trapping in the circuits with various geometry, size, and\ndistance between moats in two active ground planes (GPs), and containing up to\nthree additional 'dummy' GPs, using multiple cooldowns through the critical\ntemperature with various cooling rates and residual magnetic fields up to ~1.2\n$\\mu$T. For the slit-type and square moats arrayed along the sides of the\nregister cells, we have found a negligible effect of flux sequestered in the\nmoats on the operating margins of the registers, and negligible probability of\ndetrimental flux trapping outside of the moats. Circuits with 0.3-$\\mu$m-wide\nslit moats occupying <2% of the circuit area were fully operational in 100% of\ncooldowns, supporting the viability of VLSI superconductor digital circuits. We\nhave found a strong enhancement of flux trapping outside of the moats in\ncircuits with closely spaced GPs and determined a critical distance, t$_c$=0.6\n$\\mu$m, between them. The presence of GPs spaced below t$_c$ rendered the\ncircuits nonoperational in 100% of cooldowns. We have measured 30 chips with\n>3M JJs and determined individual cell margins in 138 registers to characterize\nthe fabrication-related parameter spread and detect fabrication defects and\nflux-trapping events. By finding outlier cells in the statistical distribution\nof the individual cell margins, we detected about one defect per million JJs,\nin most cases causing magnetic flux trapping in the affected cell.",

These\nhigh-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics\nwithin a SMBHs sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results\nreveal the presence of highly chaotic, non-rotational ionized gas flows on\nsub-kpc scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger\nscales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy\nclusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple,\nleading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through\ncooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in\nturn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with\nweaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may\nlead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity\nand gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity\ndispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive $M_{\\rm\nBH}\\sim1.5\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas\nis also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around\ngalaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved.

Such compact disks are incompatible with\ntypical disks in active galactic nuclei, but form naturally following the tidal\ndisruption of a star. Our results rule out models (for eRO-QPE2) invoking i) a\nclassic AGN accretion disk and ii) no accretion disk at all. For orbiter\nmodels, the expected radius derived from the timing properties would naturally\nlead to disk-orbiter interactions for both quasi-spherical and eccentric\ntrajectories. We infer a black hole mass of log$_{10}(M_{\\rm BH}) = 5.9 \\pm\n0.3$ M$_{\\odot}$ and Eddington ratio of 0.13$^{+0.18}_{-0.07}$; in combination\nwith the compact outer radius this is inconsistent with existing disk\ninstability models. After accounting for the quiescent disk emission, we\nconstrain the ratio of X-ray to FUV luminosity of the eruption component to be\n$L_{\\rm X} / L_{\\rm FUV} > 16-85$ (depending on the intrinsic extinction).",

The latter accounts for $\\leq 5\\%$ of the UV\nemission in the inner 0.5\"$\\times$0.5\" region, while the luminosity of the\nformer cannot be attributed to stars.

The\nphase diagrams under the magnetic field were also explored for these quasi-one\ndimensional models. For an isotropic Kitaev chain, it was found that a magnetic\nfield polarizes the ground state except along the symmetric field angle, where\nthe chain is found to remain gapless up to a critical field strength where it\nenters an intriguing soliton phase before reaching the polarized state at\nhigher field strengths. Here we study an anisotropic Kitaev chain under a\nmagnetic field using the density matrix renormalization group technique, where\nthe ground state has a macroscopic degeneracy with a finite gap in the absence\nof the magnetic field. When the field is mainly aligned parallel to the strong\nbond, four-site and large unit-cell ordered phases arise. In a certain angle of\nthe field, another ordered phase characterized by a uniform chirality with\nsix-site periodicity emerges. We employ a perturbation theory to understand\nsuch field-induced ordered phases. The effective model uncovers the presence of\ntransverse Ising and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between unit cells, as\nwell as further-neighbor Ising interaction induced by the magnetic field, which\ncollectively explain the mechanisms behind these ordered states.

Twinkle has\ndemonstrated an acceleration of approximately 2 orders of magnitude (>~100\ntimes) on contemporary GPUs. The enhancement in computational speed of Twinkle\nwill translate to the delivery of accurate and highly efficient data analysis\nfor ongoing and upcoming microlensing projects.

    "abstract": "Star-Planet Magnetic Interactions (SPMI) have been proposed as a mechanism\nfor generating stellar hot-spots with energy outputs on the order of\n$10^{19-21}$ watts. This interaction is primarily believed to be mediated by\nAlfv\\'en waves propagating towards the star. The stellar atmosphere dictates\nwhere and how much of this incoming energy can actually be deposited as heat.\nThe stellar transition region separating the chromosphere from the corona of\ncool stars gives rise to a significant variation of the Alfv\\'en speed over a\nshort distance, and therefore a reflection of the Alfv\\'en waves at the\ntransition region is naturally expected. We aim to characterize the efficiency\nof energy transfer due to SPMI by quantifying a frequency dependent reflection\nof the wave energy at the stellar transition region and its transmission to the\nstellar chromosphere. Magnetohydrodynamic simulations are employed to model the\nfrequency-dependent propagation of Alfv\\'en waves through a realistic\nbackground stellar wind profile. The transmission efficiency as a function of\nthe wave frequency is quantified, and further analysis is conducted to\ncharacterize the overall energy transfer efficiency of SPMI in several\ncandidate systems where chromospheric hotspots have been tentatively detected.\nLow-frequency waves experience greater reflection compared to high-frequency\nwaves, resulting in reduced energy transfer efficiency for lower frequencies.\nConversely, the parametric decay instability of Alfv\\'en waves substantially\ndiminishes the energy transfer efficiency at higher frequencies. As a result,\nthere exists a frequency range where energy transfer is most efficient. A\nsignificant fraction of the Alfv\\'en wave energy is reflected at the stellar\ntransition region, and in most realistic scenarios, the transmission efficiency\nto the chromosphere is found to be approximately 10 percent.",

    "abstract": "Numerous decameter-sized asteroids have been observed impacting Earth as\nfireballs. These objects can have impact energies equivalent to hundreds of\nkilotons of TNT, posing a hazard if they impact populated areas. Previous\nestimates of meteoroid flux using fireball observations have shown an Earth\nimpact rate for decameter-size objects of about once every $2$-$3$ years. In\ncontrast, telescopic estimates of the near-Earth asteroid population predict\nthe impact rate of such objects to be of order $20$-$40$ years, an\norder-of-magnitude difference. While the cause of this discrepancy remains\nunclear, tidal disruption of a larger near-Earth body has been proposed as an\nexplanation for these excess decameter-sized impactors. The release in 2022 of\npreviously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data for\nfireball events has provided a wealth of new information on many of these\nimpacts. Using this newly available USG sensor data, we present the first\npopulation-level study characterizing the orbital and dynamical properties of\n14 decameter-sized Earth impactors detected by USG sensors since 1994, with a\nparticular focus on searching for evidence of tidal disruption as the cause of\nthe impact rate discrepancy. We find there is no evidence for recent ($\\lesssim\n10^4$ years) tidal disruption and weak evidence for longer-term tidal\ndisruption in the decameter impactor population, but that the latter conclusion\nis limited by small number statistics. We also investigate the origins of both\nthe impactor and near-Earth asteroid populations of decameter-sized objects\nfrom the main asteroid belt. We find that both populations generally originate\nfrom the same source regions: primarily from the $\\nu_6$ secular resonance\n($\\sim70$%) with small contributions from the Hungaria group ($\\sim20$%) and\nthe 3:1 Jupiter mean-motion resonance ($\\sim10$%).",

If runaway collapse is the\nprimary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be\nfairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs.

In this paper we discuss cases where $\\text{Aut}(\\mathcal{C})$ has\nelements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry\nfractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft\nsymmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects\ncorresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain\nclass of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus\npartition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on\nsoft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important\nimplications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of\nsymmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous\nphenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group\ngiven by the quaternion group $Q_8$.",

While\nreconstructive self-supervised learning frameworks such as MAE learns good\nsemantic abstractions, it is not trained for explicit spatial awareness. Our\napproach, named Gaussian Masked Autoencoder, or GMAE, aims to learn semantic\nabstractions and spatial understanding jointly. Like MAE, it reconstructs the\nimage end-to-end in the pixel space, but beyond MAE, it also introduces an\nintermediate, 3D Gaussian-based representation and renders images via\nsplatting. We show that GMAE can enable various zero-shot learning capabilities\nof spatial understanding (e.g., figure-ground segmentation, image layering,\nedge detection, etc.) while preserving the high-level semantics of\nself-supervised representation quality from MAE. To our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to employ Gaussian primitives in an image representation learning\nframework beyond optimization-based single-scene reconstructions. We believe\nGMAE will inspire further research in this direction and contribute to\ndeveloping next-generation techniques for modeling high-fidelity visual data.\nMore details at https://brjathu.github.io/gmae",

    "abstract": "Although, both double-spending and selfish-mining attacks have been\nextensively studied since the ``Bitcoin'' whitepaper of Nakamoto and the\n``majority is not enough'' paper of Eyal and Sirer, there has been no rigorous\nstochastic analysis of an attack that combines the two, except for the\ncomplicated MDP models. In this paper, we first combine stubborn and selfish\nmining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn\nuntil its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act\nselfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next,\nwe provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest\nmining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the\n$k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of\nstubbornness is higher than $k$, there is a risk of double-spending which comes\nat no-cost to the adversary. The result can be seen as a guide for picking $k$\nin the $k$-confirmation rule in a blockchain design. At each cycle, for a given\nstubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the risk of\ndouble-spending is. We provide the minimum double-spend value needed for an\nattack to be profitable in the regimes where the scheme is less profitable than\nhonest mining. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to\nconceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability. Finally, we\nevaluate the results and provide the optimal and the maximum stubbornness\nlevels for each parameter regime as well as the revenue. As a case study, with\nBitcoin's $k=6$ block confirmation rule, we evaluate the revenue and\ndouble-spending risk of the attacks for each pool parameter.",

This challenge is particularly\npronounced in few-shot learning scenarios, where the objective is to achieve\nrobust generalization from minimal annotated samples. To overcome these\nlimitations, it is crucial to identify and leverage the most salient and\ndiscriminative features of 3D objects, thereby enhancing learning efficiency\nand reducing dependency on large-scale labeled datasets. This work introduces\nRW-Net, a novel framework designed to address the challenges above by\nintegrating Rate-Distortion Explanation (RDE) and wavelet transform into a\nstate-of-the-art projection-based 3D object classification architecture. The\nproposed method capitalizes on RDE to extract critical features by identifying\nand preserving the most informative data components while reducing redundancy.\nThis process ensures the retention of essential information for effective\ndecision-making, optimizing the model's ability to learn from limited data.\nComplementing RDE, incorporating the wavelet transform further enhances the\nframework's capability to generalize in low-data regimes. By emphasizing\nlow-frequency components of the input data, the wavelet transform captures\nfundamental geometric and structural attributes of 3D objects. These attributes\nare instrumental in mitigating overfitting and improving the robustness of the\nlearned representations across diverse tasks and domains.

However, inherent conflicts exist among the desired\ncapabilities. The Decision and Reaction require a contrary Perception scale and\ngrain, and the autoregressive decoding blocks the real-time Perception and\nDecision during the Reaction. To unify the conflicted capabilities within a\nharmonious system, we present Dispider, a system that disentangles Perception,\nDecision, and Reaction. Dispider features a lightweight proactive streaming\nvideo processing module that tracks the video stream and identifies optimal\nmoments for interaction. Once the interaction is triggered, an asynchronous\ninteraction module provides detailed responses, while the processing module\ncontinues to monitor the video in the meantime. Our disentangled and\nasynchronous design ensures timely, contextually accurate, and computationally\nefficient responses, making Dispider ideal for active real-time interaction for\nlong-duration video streams. Experiments show that Dispider not only maintains\nstrong performance in conventional video QA tasks, but also significantly\nsurpasses previous online models in streaming scenario responses, thereby\nvalidating the effectiveness of our architecture.

Here we develop and test a simple theoretical model\nwhich shows that these observations are unsurprising, but instead are arguably\nas expected if one assumes a non-evolving halo-mass dependent galaxy-formation\nefficiency consistent with that observed today.

Using new constraints on Lyman continuum\nescape and the ionizing photon production efficiency, we also predict the\nprogress of cosmic hydrogen reionization consistent with current observations.\nThe requirement to fit both the UV LF and the GSMF breaks the degeneracy\nbetween mass-to-light ratio and star-formation efficiency, where the typical\nmass-to-light ratio of galaxies increases systematically with redshift beyond\n$z \\simeq 6$. However, at present this does not require changes to the IMF,\ncosmic dust, or any other new astrophysics. Rather, the current data can be\nreproduced simply by assuming ever-younger stellar populations consistent with\na formation epoch at $z \\simeq 15$. A key prediction of our model therefore is\nthat there should be a more rapid drop-off in the galaxy number density beyond\n$z \\simeq 15$, where one can no longer appeal to ever younger ages to offset\nthe precipitous descent of the halo mass function.",

The parameter $g'(r,n)$ is\ndefined identically with the exception that the host hypergraph is not required\nto be $r$-partite.\n  In this note, we improve the best known lower bounds on $g'(r,n)$ for all $r\n\\geq 4$ and the upper bounds on $g(r,n)$ for all $r \\geq 3$, provided $n$ is\nsufficiently large.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the hydrodynamic drag force on side-by-side flexible\nblades in a uniform steady current through experimental and theoretical\napproaches. Four different blade mimics were arranged in side-by-side bunches\nand tested in a circulating water tunnel. The experiments cover a static regime\nand a dynamic instability regime known as flutter. We examine four\nnon-dimensional parameters to assess their effects on the bulk drag coefficient\n$C_{D,\\mathrm{bulk}}$ and the onset of flutter: the drag-to-stiffness ratio\n$\\mathrm{Ca}$, the buoyancy-to-stiffness ratio $\\mathrm{B}$, the mass ratio of\nfluid inertia to total system inertia $\\beta$, and the slenderness parameter\n$\\lambda$, which represents the ratio of the resistive drag to the reactive\nforce. The results show that $C_{D,\\mathrm{bulk}}$ decreases in the static\nregime starting at $\\mathrm{Ca}/B > \\textit{O}(1)$ and settles to an almost\nconstant value in the flutter regime at high $\\mathrm{Ca}$. In the static\nregime, $\\mathrm{B}$ is the primary influencing factor. Increasing $\\beta$,\n$\\mathrm{B}$, or $\\lambda$ stabilizes the system and delays the onset of\nflutter. By introducing an equivalent thickness and bending stiffness for a\nbunch of blades, we utilize well-established analytical and numerical models\nfor individual blades to predict the drag reduction of side-by-side blade\nassemblies. The analytical model accurately predicts drag reduction in the\nstatic regime, while the numerical model effectively predicts both the onset of\nflutter and drag reduction across both regimes with appropriate cross-flow\nhydrodynamic coefficients. Meanwhile, we investigate the reactive force terms\nto unveil their impact on the system stability and drag reduction,\ndemonstrating its superiority over the traditional Morison's equation for\nhighly compliant blades in cross-flow scenarios.",

However, the observability of these\n`superhabitable' planets in the habitable zones around K dwarf stars has not\nbeen fully modeled. This study addresses this gap by modeling the atmospheres\nof superhabitable exoplanets. We employed the 1D model $\\texttt{Atmos}$ to\ndefine the superhabitable parameter space, $\\texttt{POSEIDON}$ to calculate\nsynthetic transmission spectra, and $\\texttt{PandExo}$ to simulate\n$\\text{JWST}$ observations. Our results indicate that planets orbiting mid-type\nK dwarfs, receiving $80\\%$ of Earth's solar flux, are optimal for life. These\nplanets sustain temperate surfaces with moderate $CO_2$ levels, unlike those\nreceiving $60\\%$ flux, where necessarily higher $CO_2$ levels could hinder\nbiosphere development. Moreover, they are easier to observe, requiring\nsignificantly fewer transits for biosignature detection compared to Earth-like\nplanets around Sun-like stars. For instance, detecting biosignature pairs like\noxygen and methane from $30$ parsecs would require $150$ transits ($43$ years)\nfor a superhabitable planet, versus over $1700$ transits ($\\sim 1700$ years)\nfor Earth-like planets.

We recast these\nconcepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero\npairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for\nthe study of positive geometries and their canonical forms.

We investigate two protocols for this\ntransfer: resonant interaction between the cavity, the atom/ion and the\nsuperconducting qubit, and dispersive interaction. We analyze the robustness of\nthe state transfer fidelity against various noise and damping mechanisms,\nincluding cavity decay, Rydberg state decay, and the relaxation and dephasing\nof the superconducting qubit.

AI technologies play a central role in this phenomenon, as social\nmedia platforms increasingly use algorithms and machine learning to curate\ncontent, drive engagement, and maximize advertising revenue. While these tools\nenhance scalability and personalization, they also prioritize virality and\nconsumption over authentic communication, contributing to the erosion of trust,\nthe loss of content diversity, and a dehumanized internet experience. This\nstudy redefines DIT in the context of social media, proposing that the\ncommodification of content consumption for revenue has taken precedence over\nmeaningful human connectivity.

Here, we evaluate the\nabsorption spectrum of the three-level system in the ladder/cascade\nconfiguration when the bottom two levels are driven by a periodic pulse\nsequence while the transition between the middle and the highest level is\nprobed by a weak field. The absorption spectrum displays similarities with the\nAutler-Townes doublet with frequency separation between the main peaks defined\nby the inter-pulse delay. In addition, this spectrum shows little dependence on\nthe pulse carrier frequency. These results demonstrate the capacity to modulate\nthe absorption spectrum of a three-level system with experimentally achievable\npulse protocols.",

The gravity\nof the RN naked singularity is modeled with a pseudo-Newtonian potential that\nreproduces exactly the radial dependence of the RN Keplerian orbital frequency;\nin particular, orbital angular velocity vanishes at the zero gravity radius and\nhas a maximum at 4/3 of that radius. Angular momentum is transported outwards\nby viscous stresses only outside the location of this maximum. Nonetheless,\neven at that radius, accretion proceeds at higher latitudes, the disk having\nthickened there owing to excess pressure. The accretion stops at a certain\ndistance away from the singularity, with the material accumulating in a\ntoroidal structure close to the zero-gravity sphere. The shape of the structure\nobtained in our simulations is reminiscent of fluid figures of equilibrium\nanalytically derived in full general relativity for the RN singularity. The\npresence of a rotating ring, such as the one found in our simulations, could be\nan observational signature of a naked singularity. For charge to mass ratios\nclose to but larger than unity, the inner edge of the quasi-toroidal inner\naccretion structure would be located well within the Schwarzschild marginally\nstable orbit (ISCO), and the maximum orbital frequency in thin accretion disks\nwould be much higher than the Schwarzschild ISCO frequency.",

We demonstrate that microwave\nshielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of\ndifferent molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units\nof length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic\nscattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule\nbound states.

In general, the collision properties are\nnear-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the\nmolecular rotational constant.

Then, screening of\ncation-substituted structural candidates with \\textit{ab initio} and\nmachine-learned potential calculations reveal a number of candidates that are\nthermodynamically stable, likely synthesizable, and have high predicted ionic\nconductivities.

In\nfine-tuning, the law among model performance, model parameters, and data\ncomplexity has been a focal issue in the field. Existing methods often leverage\nexternal metrics (such as cross-entropy or perplexity) to evaluate model\nperformance. In the fine-tuning process for large models, two types of\nknowledge are typically involved: the frozen, general knowledge acquired by the\nmodel during pre-training and the new knowledge learned through the LoRA module\nfrom the current data. Generally, the less LoRA's learned knowledge relies on\nthe large model, the more it captures the specific knowledge of new data,\nthereby enhancing its adaptability to new tasks. However, external metrics do\nnot readily capture the dependency relationship between these two types of\nknowledge. Therefore, we designed an internal metric based on the Mutual\nInformation Upper Bound (MIUB) theory to investigate the scaling law of\nlarge-model LoRA fine-tuning. In our experiments, we validated this approach on\nbenchmark datasets, using the Llama3-8B and Phi3-3B models.

    "abstract": "After a brief history of the development of quality factor, useful\nexpressions are derived for the robust input-impedance Qz(w) quality factor\nthat accurately determines the VSWR fractional bandwidth of antennas for\nisolated resonances and a small enough bandwidth power drop. For closely spaced\nmultiple resonances/antiresonances, a definitive formula is given for the\nincrease in fractional bandwidth enabled by Bode-Fano tuning. Methods are given\nfor determining the conventional and complex-energy quality factors of antennas\nfrom RLC circuit models. New field-based quality factors Q(w) are derived for\nantennas with known fields produced by an input current. These Q(w) are\nremarkably robust because they equal Qz(w) when the input impedance is\navailable. Like Qz(w), the field-based Q(w) is independent of the choice of\norigin of the antenna fields and is impervious to extra lengths of transmission\nlines and surplus reactances. These robust field-based quality factors are used\nto derive new lower bounds on the quality factors (upper bounds on the\nbandwidths) of spherical-mode antennas that improve upon the previous Chu/CR\n(Collin-Rothschild) lower bounds for spherical modes. A criterion for antenna\nsupergain is found by combining the Harrington maximum gain formula with the\nrecently derived formula for the reactive power boundaries of antennas. Maximum\ngain versus minimum quality factor for spherical antennas are determined using\nthe improved lower bounds on quality factor for different values of electrical\nsize ka. Lastly, reduced antenna quality factors allowed by dispersive tuning\novercome the traditional Chu/CR lower bounds for lower radiation efficiencies\nand small enough bandwidth power drops.",

Despite its advantages, a critical question remains\nas to whether the CS method can be extended to perform QST with guaranteed\nperformance. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a\nprojected classical shadow (PCS) method with guaranteed performance for QST\nbased on Haar-random projective measurements. PCS extends the standard CS\nmethod by incorporating a projection step onto the target subspace. For a\ngeneral quantum state consisting of $n$ qubits, our method requires a minimum\nof $O(4^n)$ total state copies to achieve a bounded recovery error in the\nFrobenius norm between the reconstructed and true density matrices, reducing to\n$O(2^n r)$ for states of rank $r<2^n$ -- meeting information-theoretic optimal\nbounds in both cases. For matrix product operator states, we demonstrate that\nthe PCS method can recover the ground-truth state with $O(n^2)$ total state\ncopies, improving upon the previously established Haar-random bound of\n$O(n^3)$.

More specifically, we aim to\nassess whether additional planets in the system could explain the discrepancy\nbetween the predicted cutoff of the disk inner cavity at $\\sim$28 au with only\ntwo planets, and the observed one at $\\sim$50 au. We performed an exhaustive\ndynamical modeling of the debris disk and the carving of its inner edge, by\nintroducing one or two additional planets beyond $\\beta$ Pic b, coplanar with\nthe disk. Guided by theoretical predictions for the parameter space - mass,\nsemi-major axis, eccentricity - allowed for additional planets, we further\ncarried out a set of N-body simulations, using the symplectic integrator RMVS3.\nOur simulations indicate that an additional planet with a low eccentricity of\n0.05, a mass between 0.15 and 1 $M_{Jup}$, and a semi-major axis between 30 and\n36 au, would be consistent with the observations of an inner debris disk edge\nat 50 au. We have also explored the hypotheses of a higher eccentricity and the\npresence of two additional lower mass planets instead of one, which could also\naccount for these observations. While we find that one or even two additional\nplanets could explain the observed location of the disk inner edge, these\nhypothetical planets remain in most cases below the current observational\nlimits of high contrast imaging. Future observational campaigns with improved\nsensitivity will help lowering these limits and perhaps detect that planet.",

We refer to such auctions as platform-assisted\nauctions.Traditionally, the auction theory literature mainly focuses on\ndesigning auctions that incentivize the buyers to bid truthfully,assuming that\nthe platform always faithfully implements the auction. In practice, however,\nthe platforms have been found to manipulate the auctions to earn more profit,\nresulting in high-profile anti-trust lawsuits. We propose a new model for\nstudying platform-assisted auctions in the permissionless setting. We explore\nwhether it is possible to design a dream auction in thisnew model, such that\nhonest behavior is the utility-maximizing strategy for each individual buyer,\nthe platform, the seller, as well as platform-seller or platform-buyer\ncoalitions.Through a collection of feasibility and infeasibility results,we\ncarefully characterize the mathematical landscape of platform-assisted\nauctions. We show how cryptography can lend to the design of an efficient\nplatform-assisted auction with dream properties. Although a line of works have\nalso used MPC or the blockchain to remove the reliance on a trusted auctioneer,\nour work is distinct in nature in several dimensions.First, we initiate a\nsystematic exploration of the game theoretic implications when the service\nproviders are strategic and can collude with sellers or buyers. Second, we\nobserve that the full simulation paradigm is too stringent and leads to high\nasymptotical costs. Specifically, because every player has a different private\noutcomein an auction protocol, running any generic MPC protocol among the\nplayers would incur at least $n^2$ total cost. We propose a new notion of\nsimulation calledutility-dominated emulation.Under this new notion, we showhow\nto design efficient auction protocols with quasilinear efficiency.",

The benchmark suite enables quantitative\ncomparisons of samples by applying different metrics, including basic\nstatistical metrics as well as more complex measures, in particular the sliced\nWasserstein distance and the maximum mean discrepancy. We apply these metrics\nto point clouds of both independent and identically distributed (IID) samples\nand correlated samples generated by MC techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo or Nested Sampling. Through repeated comparisons, we evaluate test\nstatistics of the metrics, allowing to evaluate the quality of the MC sampling\nalgorithms.\n  Our benchmark suite offers a variety of target functions with different\ncomplexities and dimensionalities, providing a versatile platform for testing\nthe capabilities of sampling algorithms. Implemented as a Julia package,\nMCBench enables users to easily select test cases and metrics from the provided\ncollections, which can be extended as needed. Users can run external sampling\nalgorithms of their choice on these test functions and input the resulting\nsamples to obtain detailed metrics that quantify the quality of their samples\ncompared to the IID samples generated by our package. This approach yields\nclear, quantitative measures of sampling quality and allows for informed\ndecisions about the effectiveness of different sampling methods.\n  By offering such a standardized method for evaluating MC sampling quality,\nour benchmark suite provides researchers and practitioners from many scientific\nfields, such as the natural sciences, engineering, or the social sciences with\na valuable tool for developing, validating and refining sampling algorithms.",

The conventionally trained\nnetwork may achieve unexpected inferior performance on the rare class compared\nto the frequent class. Most previous works attempt to rectify the network bias\nfrom the data-level or from the classifier-level. Differently, in this paper,\nwe identify that the bias towards the frequent class may be encoded into\nfeatures, i.e., the rare-specific features which play a key role in\ndiscriminating the rare class are much weaker than the frequent-specific\nfeatures. Based on such an observation, we introduce a simple yet effective\napproach, normalizing the parameters of Batch Normalization (BN) layer to\nexplicitly rectify the feature bias. To achieve this end, we represent the\nWeight/Bias parameters of a BN layer as a vector, normalize it into a unit one\nand multiply the unit vector by a scalar learnable parameter. Through\ndecoupling the direction and magnitude of parameters in BN layer to learn, the\nWeight/Bias exhibits a more balanced distribution and thus the strength of\nfeatures becomes more even. Extensive experiments on various long-tailed\nrecognition benchmarks (i.e., CIFAR-10/100-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist\n2018) show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-arts remarkably.\nThe code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/yuxiangbao/NBN.",

While most investigations focus on\ntwo-dimensional systems, high-dimensional systems are more general and widely\napplicable. Building on the non-extensibility theorem by Colbeck and Renner\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 050403 (2008)], which established that no higher theory\ncan enhance the predictive power of quantum mechanics for two-dimensional\nsystems, we extend this result to arbitrarily dimensional systems. We connect\nmaximum potential predictive power achievable by any alternative theory to\nexperimentally observable correlations, and establish optimal experimental\nbounds across varying dimensions by exploiting two-photon orbital angular\nmomentum entangled states with entanglement concentration. These bounds falsify\na broader class of alternative theories, including Bell's and Leggett's models,\nand those that remain theoretically ambiguous or experimentally unverified. Our\nfindings not only deepen the foundational understanding of quantum mechanics\nbut also hold significant potential for high-dimensional quantum cryptography.",

Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian\nperspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical\nexponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the\nquantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such\na cavity, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half\nmixed state-a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic\ndelocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode.\nOur findings establish photonic temporal crystals as versatile platforms for\nstudying nonequilibrium quantum photonics and suggest new avenues for\ncontrolling light matter interactions through time domain engineering.",

In this work, we present a hybrid approach\nand demonstrate a robust method for self-assembly of magnetic organometallic\ncomplexes consisting of individual iron (Fe) atoms and molecules on a silver\nsubstrate using STM. We employ two types of molecules, bis(dibenzoylmethane)\ncopper(II) [Cu(dbm)2] and iron phthalocyanine (FePc).

In both\nsituations, a molecule can be combined with up to two Fe atoms. In addition, we\nobserve a change in the magnetic properties of the attached Fe atoms in\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy, revealing a distinct Kondo signature at the Fe\nsites. We explain the latter using density functional theory calculations, and\nfind that the bond formation between the Fe 3d-orbitals and the benzene\n{\\pi}-molecular orbitals creates a favorable situation for Kondo screening of\nthe d_xz- and d_yz-like orbitals.

This paper reports on a method to improve the beam\ntransport efficiency without adding new components to the beam transport\nsystem. High beam currents often suffer from a beam loss in a transport line.\nWhen Au negative ion beams are injected into a tandem accelerator, numerical\nsimulations of low-energy ion beam transport have found that the beam loss\nincreases significantly when the Au or Cu negative ion beam current exceeds 100\n${\\mu}$A due to space-charge effects. We found that the transport efficiency is\nsignificantly improved by remaining constant beam energy accelerated at the\nmulti-stage accelerator tube and by providing an electrostatic lens effect. In\nthe heavy ion beam probe system (HIBP) system of the Large Helical Device (LHD)\nfor plasma potential measurement, the negative ion beam current injected into\nthe tandem accelerator could be increased by a factor of 3.6. As a result, the\noutput of Au$^+$ beam current at the tandem accelerator used to measure the LHD\nplasma potential was increased from about 3 ${\\mu}$A to 12$ {\\mu}$A and it was\ndemonstrated that the average electron density in the plasma could be measured\nup to $1.75\\times10^{19}m^{-3}$.

The arising\nmathematical problems resemble those recently studied in aggregation equations,\nbut with additional challenges emerging from restricting the dynamics to the\nsphere and the particular form of the interaction energy.\n  We provide a rigorous framework for studying the gradient flow, which also\nsuggests a possible metric geometry to study the general case (i.e. one that is\nnot described by a gradient flow). We further analyze the stationary points of\nthe induced self-attention dynamics. The latter are related to stationary\npoints of the interaction energy in the Wasserstein geometry, and we further\ndiscuss energy minimizers and maximizers in different parameter settings.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks suffer from storing millions and billions of weights in\nmemory post-training, making challenging memory-intensive models to deploy on\nembedded devices. The weight-sharing technique is one of the popular\ncompression approaches that use fewer weight values and share across specific\nconnections in the network. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithm (MOEA) based compression framework independent of neural\nnetwork architecture, dimension, task, and dataset. We use uniformly sized bins\nto quantize network weights into a single codebook (lookup table) for efficient\nweight representation. Using MOEA, we search for Pareto optimal $k$ bins by\noptimizing two objectives. Then, we apply the iterative merge technique to\nnon-dominated Pareto frontier solutions by combining neighboring bins without\ndegrading performance to decrease the number of bins and increase the\ncompression ratio. Our approach is model- and layer-independent, meaning the\nweights are mixed in the clusters from any layer, and the uniform quantization\nmethod used in this work has $O(N)$ complexity instead of non-uniform\nquantization methods such as k-means with $O(Nkt)$ complexity. In addition, we\nuse the center of clusters as the shared weight values instead of retraining\nshared weights, which is computationally expensive. The advantage of using\nevolutionary multi-objective optimization is that it can obtain non-dominated\nPareto frontier solutions with respect to performance and shared weights. The\nexperimental results show that we can reduce the neural network memory by\n$13.72 \\sim14.98 \\times$ on CIFAR-10, $11.61 \\sim 12.99\\times$ on CIFAR-100,\nand $7.44 \\sim 8.58\\times$ on ImageNet showcasing the effectiveness of the\nproposed deep neural network compression framework.",

It is well established that sunspots host magnetohydrodynamic\nwaves, with numerous observations showing a connection to the internal acoustic\n(or p-)modes of the Sun. The p-modes are fast waves below the equipartition\nlayer and are thought to undergo a double mode conversion as they propagate\nupwards into the atmosphere of sunspots, which can generate Alfv\\'{e}nic modes\nin the upper atmosphere. We employ 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical\nsimulations to investigate the adiabatic wave propagation and examine the\nresulting power spectra of coronal Alfv\\'{e}nic waves. A broadband wave source\nis used that has a 1D power spectrum which mimics aspects of the observed\np-mode power spectrum. We examine magnetoacoustic wave propagation and mode\nconversion from the photosphere to the corona. Frequency filtering of the\nupwardly propagating acoustic waves is a natural consequence of a\ngravitationally stratified atmosphere, and plays a key role in shaping the\npower spectra of mode converted waves. We demonstrate that the slow, fast\nmagnetoacoustic waves and Alfv\\'{e}n waves above the equipartition layer have\nsimilarly shaped power spectra, which are modified versions of the driver\nspectrum. Notably, the results reveal that the coronal wave power spectra have\na peak at a higher frequency than that of the underlying p-mode driver. This\nmatches observations of coronal Alfv\\'enic waves and further supports the role\nof mode conversion process as a mechanism for Alfv\\'enic wave generation in the\nSun's atmosphere.",

Primary beam theory often fails to accurately\npredict the stresses in the bridge girder, leading to potential overestimation\nof the ultimate capacity of these bridges. This study addresses this gap by\ndeveloping a detailed finite element (FE) model of a continuous rigid bridge\nusing ABAQUS, which accounts for the complex 3D geometry, construction\nprocedures, and nonlinear material interactions. A loading test on a 210-meter\ncontinuous rigid bridge is performed to validate the model, with the measured\nstrain and deflection data closely matching the FE simulation results. The\nstudy also examines stress distributions under constant and live loads, as well\nas the shear lag coefficients of the main girder. Through parametric analysis,\nwe explore the effects of varying the width-to-span and height-to-width ratios.\nThe results reveal that both a wider box girder and a larger span significantly\namplify the shear lag effect in the bridge girder.

Unfortunately, the massive shortage of professionals,\nhigh costs, and mental health stigma pose significant barriers to consulting\ntherapists. As a substitute, Virtual Mental Health Assistants (VMHAs) have\nemerged in the digital healthcare space. However, most existing VMHAs lack the\ncommonsense to understand the nuanced sentiments of clients to generate\neffective responses.

By\nleveraging foundation models and harnessing commonsense knowledge, EmpRes aims\nto generate responses that effectively shape the client's sentiment towards\npositivity. We evaluate the performance of EmpRes on HOPE, a benchmark\ncounseling dataset, and observe a remarkable performance improvement compared\nto the existing baselines across a suite of qualitative and quantitative\nmetrics. Moreover, our extensive empirical analysis and human evaluation show\nthat the generation ability of EmpRes is well-suited and, in some cases,\nsurpasses the gold standard. Further, we deploy EmpRes as a chat interface for\nusers seeking mental health support. We address the deployed system's\neffectiveness through an exhaustive user study with a significant positive\nresponse. Our findings show that 91% of users find the system effective, 80%\nexpress satisfaction, and over 85.45% convey a willingness to continue using\nthe interface and recommend it to others, demonstrating the practical\napplicability of EmpRes in addressing the pressing challenges of mental health\nsupport, emphasizing user feedback, and ethical considerations in a real-world\ncontext.",

This disease is prominent in\npatients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Although HLHS patients\ntypically survive into adulthood, they have reduced cardiac output due to their\nuniventricular physiology (i.e., a Fontan circuit). As a result, they have\ninsufficient blood delivery to the liver. In comparison, patients with double\noutlet right ventricle (DORV), also having a univentricular circuit, have lower\nincidence of FALD. In this study, we use a patient-specific, one-dimensional\ncomputational fluid dynamics (1D-CFD) model to predict hemodynamics in the\nliver of an HLHS patient and compare predictions with an age- and size-matched\nDORV control patient. Additionally, we simulate FALD conditions in the HLHS\npatient to predict hemodynamic changes across various stages of disease\nprogression. Our results show that the HLHS patient has a higher portal venous\npressure compared to the DORV patient. This difference is exacerbated as FALD\nconditions progress. The wall shear stress (WSS) is also higher than normal for\nthe HLHS patient, suggesting vascular remodeling. WSS decreases slightly under\nFALD conditions, consistent with the development of portal hypertension.\nPerfusion analysis gives insight into regions of liver tissue at risk for\nfibrosis development, showing increasing pressures and reduced flow throughout\nthe liver tissue fed by the portal vein under FALD conditions. Our results\nprovide insight into the specific hemodynamic changes in Fontan circulation\nthat can cause FALD.",

    "abstract": "A unifying moving mesh method is developed for general $m$-dimensional\ngeometric objects in $d$-dimensions ($d \\ge 1$ and $1\\le m \\le d$) including\ncurves, surfaces, and domains. The method is based on mesh equidistribution and\nalignment and does not require the availability of an analytical parametric\nrepresentation of the underlying geometric object. Mathematical\ncharacterizations of shape and size of $m$-simplexes and properties of\ncorresponding edge matrices and affine mappings are derived. The\nequidistribution and alignment conditions are presented in a unifying form for\n$m$-simplicial meshes. The equation for mesh movement is defined based on the\nmoving mesh PDE approach, and suitable projection of the nodal mesh velocities\nis employed to ensure the mesh points stay on the underlying geometric object.\nThe analytical expression for the mesh velocities is obtained in a compact\nmatrix form. The nonsingularity of moving meshes is proved.

To protect legitimate\ncommunication in a chaotic UAV environment, where both eavesdropping and\njamming become straightforward from multiple adversaries with line-of-sight\nsignal propagation, a new reliable and integrated physical layer security\nmechanism is proposed in this paper for a massive\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) UAV system. Particularly, a physical\nlayer fingerprint, also called a tag, is first embedded into each message for\nauthentication purpose. We then propose to reuse the tag additionally as a\nreference to encode each message to ensure secrecy for confidentiality\nenhancement at a low cost. Specifically, we create a new dual-reference\nsymmetric tag generation mechanism by inputting an encoding-insensitive feature\nof plaintext along with the key into a hash function. At a legitimate receiver,\nan expected tag, reliable for decoding, can be symmetrically regenerated based\non the received ciphertext, and authentication can be performed by comparing\nthe regenerated reference tag to the received tag. However, an illegitimate\nreceiver can only receive the fuzzy tag which can not be used to decode the\nreceived message. Additionally, we introduce artificial noise (AN) to degrade\neavesdropping to further decrease message leakage. To verify the efficiency of\nour proposed tag-based encoding (TBE) scheme, we formulate two optimization\nproblems including ergodic sum secrecy rate maximization and authentication\nfail probability minimization. The power allocation solutions are derived by\ndifference-of-convex (DC) programming and the Lagrange method, respectively.\nThe simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed TBE\napproach compared to the prior AN-aided tag embedding scheme.",

Unlike FL, FR has a unique\nsparse aggregation mechanism, where the embedding of each item is updated by\nonly partial clients, instead of full clients in a dense aggregation of general\nFL. Recently, as an essential principle of FL, model security has received\nincreasing attention, especially for Byzantine attacks, where malicious clients\ncan send arbitrary updates. The problem of exploring the Byzantine robustness\nof FR is particularly critical since in the domains applying FR, e.g.,\ne-commerce, malicious clients can be injected easily by registering new\naccounts. However, existing Byzantine works neglect the unique sparse\naggregation of FR, making them unsuitable for our problem. Thus, we make the\nfirst effort to investigate Byzantine attacks on FR from the perspective of\nsparse aggregation, which is non-trivial: it is not clear how to define\nByzantine robustness under sparse aggregations and design Byzantine attacks\nunder limited knowledge/capability. In this paper, we reformulate the Byzantine\nrobustness under sparse aggregation by defining the aggregation for a single\nitem as the smallest execution unit. Then we propose a family of effective\nattack strategies, named Spattack, which exploit the vulnerability in sparse\naggregation and are categorized along the adversary's knowledge and capability.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that Spattack can effectively\nprevent convergence and even break down defenses under a few malicious clients,\nraising alarms for securing FR systems.",

    "abstract": "It is known that the long-range quantum entanglement exhibited in free\nfermion systems is sufficient to \"thermalize\" a small subsystem in that the\nsubsystem reduced density matrix computed from a typical excited eigenstate of\nthe combined system is approximately thermal. Remarkably, fermions without any\ninteractions are thus thought to satisfy the Eigenstate Thermalization\nHypothesis (ETH). We explore this hypothesis when the fermion subsystem is only\nminimally coupled to a quantum reservoir (in the form of another fermion\nsystem) through a quantum point contact (QPC). The entanglement entropy of two\n2-d free fermion systems connected by one or more quantum point contacts (QPC)\nis examined at finite energy and in the ground state. When the combined system\nis in a typical excited state, it is shown that the entanglement entropy of a\nsubsystem connected by a small number of QPCs is sub-extensive, scaling as the\nlinear size of the subsystem ($L_A$). For sufficiently low energies ($E$) and\nsmall subsystems, it is demonstrated numerically that the entanglement entropy\n$S_A \\sim L_A E$, what one would expect for the thermodynamics of a\none-dimensional system. In this limit, we suggest that the entropy carried by\neach additional QPC is quantized using the one-dimensional finite\nsize/temperature conformal scaling: $\\Delta S_A = \\alpha\n\\log{(1/E)\\sinh{(L_AE)}}$. The sub-extensive entropy in the case of a small\nnumber of QPCs should be contrasted with the expectation for both classical,\nergodic systems and quantum chaotic systems wherein a restricted geometry might\naffect the equilibrium relaxation times, but not the equilibrium properties\nthemselves, such as extensive entropy and heat capacity.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to automated proof generation for the TLA+ Proof\nSystem (TLAPS) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method combines two key\ncomponents: a sub-proof obligation generation phase that breaks down complex\nproof obligations into simpler sub-obligations, and a proof generation phase\nthat leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation with verified proof examples. We\nevaluate our approach using proof obligations from varying complexity levels of\nproof obligations, spanning from fundamental arithmetic properties to the\nproperties of algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that while the method\nsuccessfully generates valid proofs for intermediate-complexity obligations, it\nfaces limitations with more complex theorems.

    "abstract": "In recent years, data-driven deep learning models have gained significant\ninterest in the analysis of turbulent dynamical systems. Within the context of\nreduced-order models (ROMs), convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) pose a\nuniversally applicable alternative to conventional approaches. They can learn\nnonlinear transformations directly from data, without prior knowledge of the\nsystem. However, the features generated by such models lack interpretability.\nThus, the resulting model is a black-box which effectively reduces the\ncomplexity of the system, but does not provide insights into the meaning of the\nlatent features. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel\ninterpretable CAE approach for high-dimensional fluid flow data that maintains\nthe reconstruction quality of conventional CAEs and allows for feature\ninterpretation. Our method can be easily integrated into any existing CAE\narchitecture with minor modifications of the training process. We compare our\napproach to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and two existing methods for\ninterpretable CAEs. We apply all methods to three different experimental\nturbulent Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection datasets with varying complexity. Our\nresults show that the proposed method is lightweight, easy to train, and\nachieves relative reconstruction performance improvements of up to 6.4% over\nPOD for 64 modes. The relative improvement increases to up to 229.8% as the\nnumber of modes decreases. Additionally, our method delivers interpretable\nfeatures similar to those of POD and is significantly less resource-intensive\nthan existing CAE approaches, using less than 2% of the parameters. These\napproaches either trade interpretability for reconstruction performance or only\nprovide interpretability to a limited extend.",

Observations\nfrom the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) instrument suite\nshow that SEPs arrived at the spacecraft with a significant delay from the\nonset of the parent solar eruption and that the first arriving SEPs exhibited\nan Inverse Velocity Dispersion (IVD) for energetic protons above $\\sim$1~MeV.\nUtilizing data from multiple spacecraft we investigate the eruption dynamics\nand shock wave propagation. Our analysis includes 3D shock modeling and SEP\ntransport simulations to examine the origins of this SEP event and explore the\ncauses of the delayed SEP onset and the observed IVD. The data-driven SEP\nsimulation reproduces the SEP event onset observed at PSP, its evolving energy\nspectrum and the IVD. This IVD is attributed to a relatively slow, ongoing\nparticle acceleration process occurring at the flank of the expanding shock\nwave intercepted by PSP. This has significant implications for the role of\nshocks in the release of SEPs at widespread events and for methods used to\ninfer the SEP release times. Furthermore, the match between the simulation and\nobservations worsens when cross-field diffusion is considered, indicating that\nSEP diffusion had a minor effect on this event. These findings underscore the\ncomplexity of SEP events and emphasize the need for advanced modelling\napproaches to better understand the role of shock waves and other physical\nprocesses in SEP acceleration and release.",

    "abstract": "Various mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of Primordial Black\nHoles (PBHs), and this thesis focuses on the standard mechanism based on the\ncritical collapse of cosmological fluctuations. The underlying idea is that\nduring inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early Universe, large\ncosmological fluctuations could have been generated. After inflation, when the\ncosmic horizon reached a size comparable to these fluctuations, if the latter\nwere high enough, they could collapse and form a PBH.\n  Beyond the fascinating possibility that these compact objects might make up\nall or part of the Dark Matter (DM) we observe today, their formation and\nexistence is also associated with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs).\nThese waves could contribute to the merger events observed by the\nLIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) or account for signals detected by pulsar\ntiming array experiments (PTA). In the first part of this thesis, we\ninvestigate the PBH scenario, examining the computation of the abundance beyond\nthe Gaussian paradigm. In the second part, we discuss how PBH formation can\nproduce a stochastic GW background and how observations, related to recent\nexperiments such as LVK and PTA collaborations, can help in distinguishing\nbetween different PBH production models.

As a consequence of electrostatic instability\nwe also calculate the expected electric field enhancement at the spheroidal\npoles, the increased surface area of a dust grain, the truncation of the\nparticle eccentricity distribution function and the resultant degree of\npolarization. Dust grains with an eccentricity below a critical value will be\nelectrostatically stable; whereas, grains with an eccentricity above a critical\nvalue will be unstable. The results presented here are applicable not only to\nspheroidal dust grains but any non-spherical dust grains where non-uniform\nsurface electric fields or inhomogeneous tensile strengths could be susceptible\nto electrostatic instability.

A contribution of this\nwork is the step-by-step derivation and clarification of the relationships\namong these models, particularly demonstrating that Poisson regression in the\nsurvival context is a specific case of the Cox model. These insights address\ngaps in understanding and reinforce the simplicity and interpretability of\nsurvival models.

In\nthe context of fall detection, it demonstrates how these models can\nsimultaneously predict fall risk, analyze contributing factors, and estimate\ntime-to-event outcomes within a single streamlined framework. In contrast,\nadvanced deep learning methods often require complex post-hoc interpretation\nand separate training for different tasks particularly when working with\nstructured numerical data.

    "abstract": "With the advent of ever more intense and focused X-ray sources, including in\nlaboratories, at synchrotrons, and at X-ray free electron lasers,\nradiation-induced sample change and damage are becoming increasingly\nchallenging. Therefore, the exploration of possible mitigation strategies is\ncrucial to continue to allow the collection of robust and repeatable data. One\nmitigation approach is the introduction of short, X-ray-free ``dark'' periods.\nHowever, it is unclear whether this strategy minimises damage or, in actuality,\npromotes it through a phenomenon called ``dark progression'', i.e. the increase\nor progression of radiation damage that occurs after the X-ray beam is turned\noff. This work discusses the influence of introducing dark periods and their\nduration on the radiation-induced changes in two model small-molecule\ncatalysts, [Ir(COD)Cl]$_2$ and [Rh(COD)Cl]$_2$, exposed to X-ray radiation in\npowder diffraction (PXRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments.\nThis provides, for the first time, insights into how damage progresses under\nvarying radiation regimes and allows the distinction between the processes that\naffect the unit cell itself, the individual molecular units, and the respective\natomic chemical environments. Furthermore, it provides the basis for informed\ndecision-making in the design of future experiments where the need to minimise\nradiation-induced damage is crucial.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a Feature-preserving Particle Generation (FPPG) method for\narbitrary complex geometry is proposed. Instead of basing on implicit\ngeometries, such as level-set, FPPG employs an explicit geometric\nrepresentation for the parallel and automatic generation of high-quality\nsurface and volume particles, which enables the full preservation of geometric\nfeatures, such as sharp edges, singularities and etc. Several new algorithms\nare proposed in this paper to achieve the aforementioned objectives. First, a\nparticle mapping and feature line extraction algorithm is proposed to ensure\nthe adequate representation of arbitrary complex geometry. An improved and\nefficient data structure is developed too to maximize the parallel efficiency\nand to optimize the memory footprint. Second, the physics-based particle\nrelaxation procedure is tailored for the explicit geometric representation to\nachieve a uniform particle distribution. Third, in order to handle large-scale\nindustrial models, the proposed FPPG method is entirely parallelized on shared\nmemory systems and Boolean operations are allowed to tackle structures with\nmultiple assemblies. Intensive numerical tests are carried out to demonstrate\nthe capabilities of FPPG. The scalability tests show that a speedup of ~10X is\nachieved through multi-threading parallelization with various models.\nComparative studies with other particle generation methods show that FPPG\nachieves better performance in both runtime and accuracy. Last, two industrial\ncases of vehicle wading and gearbox oiling are studied to illustrate that FPPG\nis applicable to complex geometries.",

    "abstract": "In congestion games, selfish users behave myopically to crowd to the shortest\npaths, and the social planner designs mechanisms to regulate such selfish\nrouting through information or payment incentives. However, such mechanism\ndesign requires the knowledge of time-varying traffic conditions and it is the\nusers themselves to learn and report past road experiences to the social\nplanner (e.g., Waze or Google Maps). When congestion games meet mobile\ncrowdsourcing, it is critical to incentivize selfish users to explore\nnon-shortest paths in the best exploitation-exploration trade-off. First, we\nconsider a simple but fundamental parallel routing network with one\ndeterministic path and multiple stochastic paths for users with an average\narrival probability $\\lambda$. We prove that the current myopic routing policy\n(widely used in Waze and Google Maps) misses both exploration (when strong\nhazard belief) and exploitation (when weak hazard belief) as compared to the\nsocial optimum. Due to the myopic policy's under-exploration, we prove that the\ncaused price of anarchy (PoA) is larger than\n\\(\\frac{1}{1-\\rho^{\\frac{1}{\\lambda}}}\\), which can be arbitrarily large as\ndiscount factor \\(\\rho\\rightarrow1\\). To mitigate such huge efficiency loss, we\npropose a novel selective information disclosure (SID) mechanism: we only\nreveal the latest traffic information to users when they intend to over-explore\nstochastic paths upon arrival, while hiding such information when they want to\nunder-explore. We prove that our mechanism successfully reduces PoA to be less\nthan~\\(2\\). Besides the parallel routing network, we further extend our\nmechanism and PoA results to any linear path graphs with multiple intermediate\nnodes.",

Although extensive research has delineated the\ncoding principles of receptive fields, most studies have been constrained by\ntheir foundational assumptions. Moreover, while machine learning has\nsuccessfully been used to reconstruct images from brain data, this approach\nfaces significant challenges, including inherent feature biases in the model\nand the complexities of brain structure and function. In this study, we\nintroduce an inverse receptive field attention (IRFA) model, designed to\nreconstruct naturalistic images from neurophysiological data in an end-to-end\nfashion. This approach aims to elucidate the tuning properties and\nrepresentational transformations within the visual cortex. The IRFA model\nincorporates an attention mechanism that determines the inverse receptive field\nfor each pixel, weighting neuronal responses across the visual field and\nfeature spaces. This method allows for an examination of the dynamics of\nneuronal representations across stimuli in both spatial and feature dimensions.\nOur results show highly accurate reconstructions of naturalistic data,\nindependent of pre-trained models. Notably, IRF models trained on macaque V1,\nV4, and IT regions yield remarkably consistent spatial receptive fields across\ndifferent stimuli, while the features to which neuronal representations are\nselective exhibit significant variation.

    "abstract": "Causal models in statistics are often described using acyclic directed mixed\ngraphs (ADMGs), which contain directed and bidirected edges and no directed\ncycles. This article surveys various interpretations of ADMGs, discusses their\nrelations in different sub-classes of ADMGs, and argues that one of them -- the\nnoise expansion (NE) model -- should be used as the default interpretation. Our\nendorsement of the NE model is based on two observations. First, in a subclass\nof ADMGs called unconfounded graphs (which retain most of the good properties\nof directed acyclic graphs and bidirected graphs), the NE model is equivalent\nto many other interpretations including the global Markov and nested Markov\nmodels. Second, the NE model for an arbitrary ADMG is exactly the union of that\nfor all unconfounded expansions of that graph. This property is referred to as\ncompleteness, as it shows that the model does not commit to any specific latent\nvariable explanation. In proving that the NE model is nested Markov, we also\ndevelop an ADMG-based theory for causality. Finally, we compare the NE model\nwith the closely related but different interpretation of ADMGs as directed\nacyclic graphs (DAGs) with latent variables that is commonly used in the\nliterature. We argue that the \"latent DAG\" interpretation is mathematically\nunnecessary, makes obscure ontological assumptions, and discourages\npractitioners from deliberating over important structural assumptions.",

Multiple\nbiodiversity drivers can stabilize ecosystem functions over time. However, we\nknow little about how local environmental conditions can influence these\nbiodiversity drivers, and consequently how they indirectly shape the ecological\nstability of ecosystems.\n  2. We hypothesized that environmental factors can have opposite influences\n(i.e., not necessarily either positive or negative) on the temporal stability\nof communities in different environmental ranges depending on the biodiversity\ndrivers involved. We tested this novel hypothesis by using data from a\n4-year-long field study of submerged macrophyte across a water depth gradient\nin 8 heterogeneous bays of Erhai lake (with total sample size of 30,071\nquadrats), a large lentic system in China.\n  3. Results indicate that a unimodal pattern of stability in temporal biomass\nmeasurements occurred along the water-depth gradient, and that multiple\nbiodiversity drivers (the asynchrony in species dynamics, and the stability of\ndominant species) generally increased the temporal stability of aquatic primary\nproducers. However, the effect of water depth either increased or decreased the\nstability of biomass according to the environmental conditions associated with\nsites along the water depth gradient.\n  4.

With the parent-ion beam in the experiment\ncontaining both $1s^2~^1S$ ground-state and $1s2s~^3S$ metastable B$^{3+}$\nions, double-core-hole resonances could be studied. Two series of hollow\nresonant states were observed, one populated by $K$-shell double excitation\n$1s^2~^1S \\to 2\\ell n\\ell'~^1P$ ($\\ell=s,p$; $\\ell'=p,s$; $n=2,3,..,6$) at\nphoton energies up to about 510~eV, the other by $K$-shell single excitation\n$1s2s~^3S \\to 2\\ell n\\ell'~^3P$ ($\\ell=s,p$; $\\ell'=p,s$; $n=2,3,..,6$) at\nenergies up to about 310~eV. High resolving powers up to approximately 29000\nwere achieved. The relativistic many-body perturbation theory was employed to\ndetermine level-to-level cross sections for $K$-shell excitation with\nsubsequent autoionization. The resonance energies were calculated with\ninclusion of electron correlation and radiative contributions. The energy\nuncertainties of the most prominent resonances are estimated to be below $\\pm\n1$ meV. Convergent close coupling (CCC) calculations provided\nsingle-photoionization cross sections $\\sigma_{34}$ for B$^{3+}$ including the\nresonant and non-resonant channels. Apart from the resonances, $\\sigma_{34}$ is\ndominated by direct ionization in the investigated energy range. The\ncontribution $\\sigma_{34}^{\\mathrm{dir}}$ of the latter process to\n$\\sigma_{34}$ was separately determined by using the random-phase approximation\nwith exchange and relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations which agree very well\nwith previous calculations. Direct ionization of one electron accompanied by\nexcitation of the remaining electron was treated by the CCC theory and found to\nbe a minor contribution to $\\sigma_{34}$.",

In the present study, we employ\ndensity-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the\nelectronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn.

Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like\ninteraction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a\nminor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a\nstrong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction\nparameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange\ninteractions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric\nexchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the\nexistence of magnetic chirality in the system.

This observation suggests that\nlanguage-style models have superior bit-level scaling laws, offering a better\ntradeoff between model quality and total bits. To dissect this phenomenon, we\nconduct extensive experiments and find that the primary reason is the discrete\nrepresentation space of language-style models, which is more tolerant of\ninformation loss during quantization. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that\nimproving the bit-level scaling law of quantized vision generative models is\nchallenging, with model distillation identified as a highly effective approach.\nSpecifically, we propose TopKLD to optimize the transfer of distilled knowledge\nby balancing ``implicit knowledge'' and ``explicit knowledge'' during the\ndistillation process.

With the success of the\nQUIJOTE survey of the TMC-1, the community has seen a \"boom\" in the number of\ndetected carbon chains. On the other hand, the Rosetta mission revealed the\nrelease of fully saturated hydrocarbons, C$_3$H$_8$, C$_4$H$_{10}$,\nC$_5$H$_{12}$, and (under specific conditions) C$_6$H$_{14}$ with\nC$_7$H$_{16}$, from the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The detection of the\nlatter two is attributed to dust-rich events. Similarly, the analysis of\nsamples returned from asteroid Ryugu by Hayabusa2 mission indicates the\npresence of long saturated aliphatic chains in Ryugu's organic matter. The\nsurface chemistry of unsaturated carbon chains under conditions resembling\nthose of molecular clouds can provide a possible link among these independent\nobservations. However, laboratory-based investigations to validate such a\nchemistry is still lacking. In the present study, we aim to experimentally\nverify the formation of fully saturated hydrocarbons by the surface\nhydrogenation of C$_{2n}$H$_2$ ($n>1$) polyynes under ultra-high vacuum\nconditions at 10 K. We undertook a two-step experimental technique. First, a\nthin layer of C$_2$H$_2$ ice was irradiated by UV-photons ($\\geq$ 121 nm) to\nachieve a partial conversion of C$_2$H$_2$ into larger polyynes: C$_4$H$_2$ and\nC$_6$H$_2$. Afterwards, the obtained photoprocessed ice was exposed to H atoms\nto verify the formation of various saturated hydrocarbons. In addition to\nC$_2$H$_6$, which was investigated previously, the formation of larger alkanes,\nincluding C$_4$H$_{10}$ and (tentatively) C$_6$H$_{14}$, is confirmed by our\nstudy. A qualitative analysis of the obtained kinetic data indicates that\nhydrogenation of HCCH and HCCCCH triple bonds proceeds at comparable rates,\ngiven a surface temperature of 10 K.}",

We searched for a very simple, accurate, and theoretically\nmotivated deprojection formula of the Sersic law, without free parameters, not\nbased on fits of the numerical deprojection, and holding for generic $n > 1$.\nThe formula has been found by requiring it to reproduce the analytical\nexpressions for the inner and outer asymptotic expansions of the deprojected\nSersic law of given $n$, and by matching the two expansions at intermediate\nradii with the request that the total luminosity coincides with that of the\noriginal Sersic profile of same $n$. The resulting formula is algebraically\nvery simple, by construction its inner and outer parts are the exact\n(asymptotic) deprojection of the Sersic law, and it depends on two coefficients\nthat are analytical functions of $n$ of immediate evaluation. The accuracy of\nthe formula over the whole radial range is very good and increases for\nincreasing $n$, with maximum relative deviations from the true numerical\ndeprojection of $\\simeq 8\\,10^{-3}$ for the de Vaucouleurs profile.

Intuitionistic logic is proved not to be\n\"point-wise\" complete on any kind of non-monotonic proof-theoretic semantics.\nThe way in which this result is proved, as well as the overall behaviour of\n\"point-wise\" soundness and completeness, is significantly different in the\nnon-monotonic framework as compared to what happens in the monotonic one -\nwhere the notions at issue can be used too to prove the \"point-wise\"\nincompleteness of intuitionistic logic.",

The latter splits in turn into a standard reading, and a\nvariant of it put forward by Sandqvist. I prove some results which, when\nsuitable conditions are met, permit one to shift from one approach to the\nother, and I draw some of the consequences of these results relative to the\nissue of completeness of (recursive) logical systems with respect to\nproof-theoretic notions of validity. This will lead me to focus on a notion of\nbase-completeness, which I will discuss with reference to known completeness\nresults for intuitionistic logic. The general interest of the proposed approach\nstems from the fact that reducibility semantics can be understood as a\nlabelling of base semantics with proof-objects typed on (sets of) formulas for\nwhich a base semantics consequence relation holds, and which witness this very\nfact. Vice versa, base semantics can be understood as a type-abstraction of a\nreducibility semantics consequence relation obtained by removing the witness of\nthe fact that this relation holds, and by just focusing on the input and output\ntype of the relevant proof-object.",

The successes of deep\nlearning has led many to use learning-based methods, where fixed functions or\noperators are replaced by learned neural networks. Regardless of their\nempirical superiority, establishing rigorous guarantees for these methods often\nrequires to impose structural constraints on neural architectures, in\nparticular convexity. The most popular way to do so is to use so-called Input\nConvex Neural Networks (ICNNs). In order to explore the expressivity of ICNNs,\nwe provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a ReLU neural network to be\nconvex. Such characterizations are based on product of weights and activations,\nand write nicely for any architecture in the path-lifting framework. As\nparticular applications, we study our characterizations in depth for 1 and\n2-hidden-layer neural networks: we show that every convex function implemented\nby a 1-hidden-layer ReLU network can be also expressed by an ICNN with the same\narchitecture; however this property no longer holds with more layers. Finally,\nwe provide a numerical procedure that allows an exact check of convexity for\nReLU neural networks with a large number of affine regions.",

This enables us to more efficiently\ncompare certain semantic dynamics, such as the shift from an original and\nfine-tuned model, revealing concept alteration and potential biases that may\noccur during fine-tuning.

Finally, our findings also have direct\napplications for MLLM steering, which can be used for model debiasing as well\nas enforcing safety in MLLM output.

Pixel MIM tends to capture low-level\nvisual details such as color and texture, while Latent MIM focuses on\nhigh-level semantics of an object. However, these distinct strengths of each\nmethod can lead to suboptimal performance in tasks that rely on a particular\nlevel of visual features. To address this limitation, we propose PiLaMIM, a\nunified framework that combines Pixel MIM and Latent MIM to integrate their\ncomplementary strengths. Our method uses a single encoder along with two\ndistinct decoders: one for predicting pixel values and another for latent\nrepresentations, ensuring the capture of both high-level and low-level visual\nfeatures. We further integrate the CLS token into the reconstruction process to\naggregate global context, enabling the model to capture more semantic\ninformation.

A pebbling move consists\nof removing two pebbles from a vertex $u$ and placing one pebble on an adjacent\nvertex $v$. A configuration $f$ is a $t$-restricted pebbling configuration\n($t$RPC) if no vertex has more than $t$ pebbles. The $t$-restricted optimal\npebbling number $\\pi_t^*(G)$ is the minimum weight of a $t$RPC on $G$ that\nallows any vertex to be reached by a sequence of pebbling moves. The\ndistinguishing number $D(G)$ is the minimum number of colors needed to label\nthe vertices of $G$ such that the only automorphism preserving the coloring is\nthe trivial one (i.e., the identity map). In this paper, we investigate the\n$2$-restricted optimal pebbling number of trees $T$ with $D(T)=2$ and radius at\nmost $2$ and enumerate their $2$-restricted optimal pebbling configurations.\nAlso we study the $2$-restricted optimal pebbling number of some graphs that\nare of importance in chemistry such as some alkanes.",

    "abstract": "A key processing step in ground-based astronomy involves combining multiple\nnoisy and blurry exposures to produce an image of the night sky with an\nimproved signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, this is achieved via image\ncoaddition, and can be undertaken such that the resulting night sky image has\nenhanced spatial resolution. Yet, this task remains a formidable challenge\ndespite decades of advancements. In this paper, we introduce ImageMM: a new\nframework based on the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for joint\nmulti-frame astronomical image restoration and super-resolution. ImageMM uses\nmultiple registered astronomical exposures to produce a nonparametric latent\nimage of the night sky, prior to the atmosphere's impact on the observed\nexposures. Our framework also features a novel variational approach to compute\nrefined point-spread functions of arbitrary resolution for the restoration and\nsuper-resolution procedure. Our algorithms, implemented in TensorFlow, leverage\ngraphics processing unit acceleration to produce latent images in near real\ntime, even when processing high-resolution exposures. We tested ImageMM on\nHyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) exposures, which are a precursor of the upcoming\nimaging data from the Rubin Observatory. The results are encouraging: ImageMM\nproduces sharp latent images, in which spatial features of bright sources are\nrevealed in unprecedented detail (e.g., showing the structure of spiral\ngalaxies), and where faint sources that are usually indistinguishable from the\nnoisy sky background also become discernible, thus pushing the detection\nlimits. Moreover, aperture photometry performed on the HSC pipeline coadd and\nImageMM's latent images yielded consistent source detection and flux\nmeasurements, thereby demonstrating ImageMM's suitability for cutting-edge\nphotometric studies with state-of-the-art astronomical imaging data.",

In this paper, we\npresent a gradient-based approach to obtain approximate NE in N-player\ngeneral-sum games.

In this\nwork, we study a particular class of non-local modular flows. They are\nassociated with the relativistic vacuum state and sub-regions whose boundaries\nlie on a planar null-surface.

In\nthis study, we focus on auditing black-box LLMs without access to their\nparameters, only to the provided service.

For instance, we may seek a non-toxic input that the target LLM\nresponds to with a toxic output or an input that induces the hallucinative\nresponse from the target LLM containing politically sensitive individuals.

    "abstract": "Both intrinsic and extrinsic orbital Hall effects (OHE) in bilayer transition\nmetal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are investigated in the presence of short-range\ndisorder using quantum kinetic theory. Bilayer TMDs provide an ideal platform\nto study the effects of inversion symmetry breaking on transport properties due\nto their unique structural and electronic characteristics. While bilayer TMDs\nare naturally inversion symmetric, applying a finite gate voltage to create a\nbias between the layers effectively breaks this symmetry. Our findings reveal\nthat slightly away from the band edges, the extrinsic OHE becomes the dominant\ncontribution in both inversion-symmetric and asymmetric cases, with its\nprominence increasing significantly as the Fermi energy rises. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that breaking inversion symmetry greatly enhances the extrinsic\nOHE. This enhancement arises from the fundamentally distinct behavior of\norbital angular momentum (OAM) in centrosymmetric systems, where intraband\ncomponents vanish due to symmetry constraints. As a result, in centrosymmetric\nsystems, only the off-diagonal components of the density matrix contribute to\nthe extrinsic OHE. In contrast, in noncentrosymmetric systems, both diagonal\nand off-diagonal components play a role. Our study suggests that in\nexperimentally relevant, highly doped systems, the OHE is predominantly\nextrinsic in nature, regardless of whether the system is centrosymmetric or\nnoncentrosymmetric. Importantly, we infer that even a weakly breaking of\ninversion symmetry can lead to a dramatic enhancement of the OHE, a finding\nwith significant implications for experimental investigations.",

    "abstract": "The study of gas bubble dynamics in liquids is justified by the numerous\napplications and natural phenomena where this two-phase flow is encountered.\nGas bubbles move as forces are applied to them; their dynamics are full of\nnuances that need to be addressed carefully. Since the mass of gas bubbles is\npractically negligible, in comparison to that of the surrounding liquid, their\nreaction to the fluid is controlled by the added mass acceleration and is thus\nimpacted by all the forces arising from the fluid action. Furthermore, since\ntheir surface can be deformed by the same forces acting on them, their shape\nmay change leading to changes in their resistance to move, the drag force, and\ntherefore affecting their speed and their interaction with the surrounding flow\nwhich is often turbulent. The liquid rheology, as well as its surfactant\ncontent can also affect the bubble shape and motion as well. Understanding\nthese issues, in addition to the effect of interactions with other bubbles,\nwalls, and non-uniform flows, provides sufficient elements to model and predict\nbubble behavior through the solution of dynamic equations. In this review, we\ncover the key aspects of non-condensable gas bubble dynamics. We survey\nclassical references on the subject and provide an overview of the main\nfindings in the past 20 years. We conclude with a scope and suggestions for\nfuture research directions, with special attention to the dynamics of bubble in\nturbulence, in non-Newtonian fluid and/or in the presence of electrolytes.",

This work aims to compare WSS results obtained from two\ndifferent finite element discretizations, quantify the differences between\ncontinuous and discontinuous stresses, and introduce a novel method for WSS\nevaluation through the formulation of a boundary-flux problem. Two benchmark\nproblems are considered - a 2D Stokes flow on a unit square and a 3D Poiseuille\nflow through a cylindrical pipe. These are followed by investigations of\nsteady-state Navier-Stokes flow in two patient-specific aneurysms. The study\nfocuses on P1/P1 stabilized and Taylor-Hood P2/P1 mixed finite elements for\nvelocity and pressure. WSS is computed using either the proposed boundary-flux\nmethod or as a projection of tangential traction onto First order Lagrange\n(P1), Discontinuous Galerkin first order (DG-1), or Discontinuous Galerkin zero\norder (DG-0) space. For the P1/P1 stabilized element, the boundary-flux and P1\nprojection methods yielded equivalent results. With the P2/P1 element, the\nboundary-flux evaluation demonstrated faster convergence in the Poiseuille flow\nexample but showed increased sensitivity to pressure field inaccuracies in\npatient-specific geometries compared to the projection method. In\npatient-specific cases, the P2/P1 element exhibited superior robustness to mesh\nsize when evaluating average WSS and low shear area (LSA), outperforming the\nP1/P1 stabilized element. Projecting discontinuous finite element results into\ncontinuous spaces can introduce artifacts, such as the Gibbs phenomenon.\nConsequently, it becomes crucial to carefully select the finite element space\nfor boundary stress calculations - not only in applications involving WSS\ncomputations for aneurysms.",

Using phase-resolved high-resolution spectroscopy, we\nanalyze the zoo of spectral-line profiles arising from the symbiotic activity.\nWe perform Doppler tomography of selected emission lines to resolve the\nsystem's gaseous components and their different velocity regimes. We find\nevidence of enhanced accretion through Roche lobe overflow during the\nsuper-active phase, as traced by the oxygen, helium, and hydrogen lines. The\naccretion disc is found to be fully viscously evolved and extends up to its\nmaximal radius. By mapping the kinematics of lines probing different excitation\nenergies, we can identify distinct interaction sites. These include the bright\nspot at the stream impact on the accretion disc outer radius, the irradiation\nat the red-giant facing side, the stream-disc overflow, the accretion disk\nwind, and an expanding bipolar nebula. The bipolar jet emerged at the rise of\nthe super-active phase and underwent an acceleration phase of about five years.\nThe temporal evolution of the lines supports the scenario where the departure\nfrom quiescence started in the disc, likely triggered by a disc instability\nsimilar to what occurs in dwarf novae outburst, leading to an increased mass\naccretion and causing important irradiation of the giant that has further\nenhanced the mass-transfer rate during the super-active phase.

Our central finding is that, macroscopically, multispecies\ntraffic behaves like water percolating through a porous medium. This hypothesis\nremained unresolved for years mainly due to the incompatibility of equilibrium\napproaches with phenomena that are quite far from equilibrium and the limited\nresonance of complexity theory in the transportation literature. DP entails the\nexistence of a nontrivial phase transition from a disordered subcritical phase\nto an ordered supercritical phase that depends on a temperature-like control\nparameter and is governed by a universal power-law.

We further assume that the\nattendant total energy of the specimen can be measured, e.g., with the aid of\nthe work-energy identity.

The cost function measures the maximum discrepancy between\nthe total elastic energy corresponding to a trial material law and the measured\ntotal elastic energy over a range of prescribed boundary displacements.

    "abstract": "Outlier detection refers to the identification of anomalous samples that\ndeviate significantly from the distribution of normal data and has been\nextensively studied and used in a variety of practical tasks. However, most\nunsupervised outlier detection methods are carefully designed to detect\nspecified outliers, while real-world data may be entangled with different types\nof outliers. In this study, we propose a fuzzy rough sets-based multi-scale\noutlier detection method to identify various types of outliers. Specifically, a\nnovel fuzzy rough sets-based method that integrates relative fuzzy granule\ndensity is first introduced to improve the capability of detecting local\noutliers. Then, a multi-scale view generation method based on granular-ball\ncomputing is proposed to collaboratively identify group outliers at different\nlevels of granularity. Moreover, reliable outliers and inliers determined by\nthe three-way decision are used to train a weighted support vector machine to\nfurther improve the performance of outlier detection. The proposed method\ninnovatively transforms unsupervised outlier detection into a semi-supervised\nclassification problem and for the first time explores the fuzzy rough\nsets-based outlier detection from the perspective of multi-scale granular\nballs, allowing for high adaptability to different types of outliers. Extensive\nexperiments carried out on both artificial and UCI datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed outlier detection method significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods, improving the results by at least 8.48% in terms of\nthe Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) index. { The source codes are released at\n\\url{https://github.com/Xiaofeng-Tan/MGBOD}. }",

However, extracting the parameters of the lens from the\nmodulated GWs requires accurate modeling of the lensing amplification factor,\naccounting for wave-optics effects. Analytic solutions to the lens equation\nhave not been found to date, except for a handful of simplistic lens models.\nWhile numerical solutions to this equation have been developed, the time and\ncomputational resources required to evaluate the amplification factor\nnumerically make large-scale parameter estimation of the lens (and source)\nparameters prohibitive. On the other hand, surrogate modeling of GWs has proven\nto be a powerful tool to accurately, and rapidly, produce GW templates at\narbitrary points in parameter space, interpolating from a finite set of\navailable waveforms at discrete parameter values. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat surrogate modeling can also effectively be applied to the evaluation of\nthe time-domain microlensing amplification factor $\\widetilde{F}(t)$. We show\nthis by constructing $\\widetilde{F}(t)$ for two lens models, viz. point-mass\nlens, and singular isothermal sphere, which notably includes logarithmic\ndivergence behaviour. We find both surrogates reproduce the original lens\nmodels accurately, with mismatches $\\lesssim 5 \\times 10^{-4}$ across a range\nof plausible microlensed binary black hole sources observed by the Einstein\nTelescope. This surrogate is between 5 and $10^3$ times faster than the\nunderlying lensing models, and can be evaluated in about 100 ms. The accuracy\nand efficiency attained by our surrogate models will enable practical parameter\nestimation analyses of microlensed GWs.",

New challenges arise accordingly in\nachieving both correct model training and fair reward allocation with\ncollective effort among all participating nodes, especially with the threat of\nthe Byzantine node jeopardising both tasks.\n  In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized Byzantine\nfault-tolerant federated learning framework based on a novel Proof-of-Data\n(PoD) consensus protocol to resolve both the \"trust\" and \"incentive\"\ncomponents. By decoupling model training and contribution accounting, PoD is\nable to enjoy not only the benefit of learning efficiency and system liveliness\nfrom asynchronous societal-scale PoW-style learning but also the finality of\nconsensus and reward allocation from epoch-based BFT-style voting.

    "abstract": "Generating visual text in natural scene images is a challenging task with\nmany unsolved problems. Different from generating text on artificially designed\nimages (such as posters, covers, cartoons, etc.), the text in natural scene\nimages needs to meet the following four key criteria: (1) Fidelity: the\ngenerated text should appear as realistic as a photograph and be completely\naccurate, with no errors in any of the strokes. (2) Reasonability: the text\nshould be generated on reasonable carrier areas (such as boards, signs, walls,\netc.), and the generated text content should also be relevant to the scene. (3)\nUtility: the generated text can facilitate to the training of natural scene OCR\n(Optical Character Recognition) tasks. (4) Controllability: The attribute of\nthe text (such as font and color) should be controllable as needed. In this\npaper, we propose a two stage method, SceneVTG++, which simultaneously\nsatisfies the four aspects mentioned above. SceneVTG++ consists of a Text\nLayout and Content Generator (TLCG) and a Controllable Local Text Diffusion\n(CLTD). The former utilizes the world knowledge of multi modal large language\nmodels to find reasonable text areas and recommend text content according to\nthe nature scene background images, while the latter generates controllable\nmultilingual text based on the diffusion model. Through extensive experiments,\nwe respectively verified the effectiveness of TLCG and CLTD, and demonstrated\nthe state-of-the-art text generation performance of SceneVTG++. In addition,\nthe generated images have superior utility in OCR tasks like text detection and\ntext recognition. Codes and datasets will be available.",

High-mass galaxies have higher $n$ than lower-mass\ngalaxies ($M_\\star=10^{9.5}~{\\text{M}}_\\odot$) at all redshifts, with a\nstronger dependence in the rest-frame near-IR than in the rest-frame optical at\n$z>1$. This wavelength dependence is caused by star-forming galaxies that have\nlower optical than near-IR $n$ at z>1 (but not at z<1). Both at optical and\nnear-IR wavelengths, star-forming galaxies have lower $n$ than quiescent\ngalaxies, fortifying the connection between star-formation activity and radial\nstellar mass distribution. At $z>1$ the median near-IR $n$ varies strongly with\nstar formation activity, but not with stellar mass. The scatter in near-IR $n$\nis higher in the green valley (0.25 dex) than on the star-forming sequence and\namong quiescent galaxies (0.18 dex) -- this trend is not seen in the optical\nbecause dust and young stars contribute to the variety in optical light\nprofiles.

For the case of ammonium nitrate NH4NO3,\nwe report the presence of two successive sharp steps in the molar magnetic\nsusceptibility along the a- and b-axes upon crossing its order-disorder phase\ntransition (from phase IV to phase II). We suggest the first step pertains to\nthe NO3- planes shifting away from facing only along the b-axis and onto the\na-axis by 45{\\deg}. The second step is attributed to the disordering\n(ungearing) of the NH4+ and NO3-. In contrast, only one step was observed in\nthe magnetic susceptibility along the c-axis and its large magnitude suggest\nthe NO3- remain weakly correlated even in phase I at 400 K. We also find\nevidence that the NH4+ become magnetically ordered (geared) along the c-axis\nonly until phase V.

    "abstract": "Data-driven soft sensors are crucial in predicting key performance indicators\nin industrial systems. However, current methods predominantly rely on the\nsupervised learning paradigms of parameter updating, which inherently faces\nchallenges such as high development costs, poor robustness, training\ninstability, and lack of interpretability. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, notably\nthrough In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables high-performance task\nexecution with minimal input-label demonstrations and no prior training. This\npaper aims to replace supervised learning with the emerging ICL paradigm for\nsoft sensor modeling to address existing challenges and explore new avenues for\nadvancement. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Few-shot\nUncertainty-aware and self-Explaining Soft Sensor (LLM-FUESS), which includes\nthe Zero-shot Auxiliary Variable Selector (LLM-ZAVS) and the Uncertainty-aware\nFew-shot Soft Sensor (LLM-UFSS). The LLM-ZAVS retrieves from the Industrial\nKnowledge Vector Storage to enhance LLMs' domain-specific knowledge, enabling\nzero-shot auxiliary variable selection. In the LLM-UFSS, we utilize text-based\ncontext demonstrations of structured data to prompt LLMs to execute ICL for\npredicting and propose a context sample retrieval augmentation strategy to\nimprove performance. Additionally, we explored LLMs' AIGC and probabilistic\ncharacteristics to propose self-explanation and uncertainty quantification\nmethods for constructing a trustworthy soft sensor. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance,\nstrong robustness, and flexibility, effectively mitigates training instability\nfound in traditional methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to establish soft sensor utilizing LLMs.",

The performance of the\ninformation engine depends on the cycle period $(\\tau)$, measurement distance\n$(x_m)$, and feedback location $(x_f)$ of the controller. Upon increasing the\nfeedback cycle time, the engine transitions from a high non-equilibrium steady\nstate to a completely relaxed state.

While\nincreasing the cycle time towards a fully relaxed state ($\\tau \\gg \\tau_r$),\nthe maximum extractable work that can be achieved with a feedback location is\nset to be twice that of $x_m^*$, as expected.

This type of problem is\nparticularly relevant in contexts such as the flow of sediments in rivers, the\nmovement of granular soils in reservoirs, or the interactions between a fluid\nand granular materials in industrial processes such as silos. The numerical\nsimulation of these phenomena is challenging because the solution depends not\nonly on the multiple phases that strongly interact with each other, but also on\nthe need to describe the geometric evolution of the different interfaces. This\npaper presents an approach to the simulation of fluid-granular phenomena\ninvolving strongly deforming free surfaces. The Discrete Element Method (DEM)\nis combined with the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) and the fluid-grain\ninterface is treated by a two-way coupling between the two phases. The\nfluid-air interface is solved by a free surface model. The geometric and\ntopological variations are therefore naturally provided by the full Lagrangian\ndescription of all phases.

Most approaches explore spatio-temporal\ninformation of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states\nfor each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation\nconsistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same\nobject being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core\nidea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the\ncomplete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels\nserve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates\npoint-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation.\nSpecifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to\nenrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the\ncluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of\nforeground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive\ncluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to\nrestore missing features due to occlusion.

    "abstract": "Solar wind is frequently categorized based on its respective solar source\nregion. Two well-established categorizations of the coronal hole wind, the\nscheme based on the charge-state composition, and the scheme based on proton\nplasma, identify a very different fraction of solar wind in the data from the\nAdvanced Composition Explorer (ACE) as coronal hole wind during the solar\nactivity minimum at the end of solar cycle 24. We investigate possible\nexplanations for the different identifications of the coronal wind in 2009 in\nthe scheme based on the charge-state composition (almost only coronal hole\nwind) and in the scheme based on the proton plasma (almost no coronal hole wind\nat the same time). We compared the properties of the respective coronal hole\nwind types and their changes with solar activity cycle in 2001- 2010. As a\ncomparison reference, we included the coronal hole wind as identified by an\nunsupervised machine-learning approach, k-means, in our analysis. We find that\nthe scheme based on charge-state composition likely misidentifies some slow\nsolar wind as coronal hole wind during the solar activity minimum. The k-means\nclassification we considered includes two types of coronal hole wind, the first\nof which is dominant during the solar activity maximum, whereas the second is\ndominant during the solar activity minimum. A low fraction of coronal hole wind\nfrom low-latitude coronal holes observed by ACE in 2009 is plausible because\nduring this time period, a very small number of low-latitude coronal holes was\nobserved. The results imply that the origin-oriented solar wind classification\nneeds to be revisited, and they also suggest that an explicit inclusion of the\nphase of the solar activity cycle can be expected to improve the classification\nof the solar wind.",

    "abstract": "Time-delayed differential equations (TDDEs) are widely used to model complex\ndynamic systems where future states depend on past states with a delay.\nHowever, inferring the underlying TDDEs from observed data remains a\nchallenging problem due to the inherent nonlinearity, uncertainty, and noise in\nreal-world systems. Conventional equation discovery methods often exhibit\nlimitations when dealing with large time delays, relying on deterministic\ntechniques or optimization-based approaches that may struggle with scalability\nand robustness. In this paper, we present BayTiDe - Bayesian Approach for\nDiscovering Time-Delayed Differential Equations from Data, that is capable of\nidentifying arbitrarily large values of time delay to an accuracy that is\ndirectly proportional to the resolution of the data input to it. BayTiDe\nleverages Bayesian inference combined with a sparsity-promoting discontinuous\nspike-and-slab prior to accurately identify time-delayed differential\nequations. The approach accommodates arbitrarily large time delays with\naccuracy proportional to the input data resolution, while efficiently narrowing\nthe search space to achieve significant computational savings. We demonstrate\nthe efficiency and robustness of BayTiDe through a range of numerical examples,\nvalidating its ability to recover delayed differential equations from noisy\ndata.",

Here we introduce a\nsimple machine learning model for predicting the band gap using only the\nchemical composition of the crystalline material. To motivate the form of the\nmodel, we first analyze the empirical distribution of the band gap, which sheds\nnew light on its atypical statistics. Specifically, our analysis enables us to\nframe band gap prediction as a task of modeling a mixed random variable, and we\ndesign our model accordingly. Our model formulation incorporates thematic ideas\nfrom chemical heuristic models for other material properties in a manner that\nis suited towards the band gap modeling task. The model has exactly one\nparameter corresponding to each element, which is fit using data. To predict\nthe band gap for a given material, the model computes a weighted average of the\nparameters associated with its constituent elements and then takes the maximum\nof this quantity and zero. The model provides heuristic chemical\ninterpretability by intuitively capturing the associations between the band gap\nand individual chemical elements.",

    "abstract": "Self-attention mechanisms have revolutionised deep learning architectures,\nyet their core mathematical structures remain incompletely understood. In this\nwork, we develop a category-theoretic framework focusing on the linear\ncomponents of self-attention. Specifically, we show that the query, key, and\nvalue maps naturally define a parametric 1-morphism in the 2-category\n$\\mathbf{Para(Vect)}$. On the underlying 1-category $\\mathbf{Vect}$, these maps\ninduce an endofunctor whose iterated composition precisely models multi-layer\nattention. We further prove that stacking multiple self-attention layers\ncorresponds to constructing the free monad on this endofunctor. For positional\nencodings, we demonstrate that strictly additive embeddings correspond to\nmonoid actions in an affine sense, while standard sinusoidal encodings, though\nnot additive, retain a universal property among injective (faithful)\nposition-preserving maps. We also establish that the linear portions of\nself-attention exhibit natural equivariance to permutations of input tokens,\nand show how the \"circuits\" identified in mechanistic interpretability can be\ninterpreted as compositions of parametric 1-morphisms. This categorical\nperspective unifies geometric, algebraic, and interpretability-based approaches\nto transformer analysis, making explicit the underlying structures of\nattention. We restrict to linear maps throughout, deferring the treatment of\nnonlinearities such as softmax and layer normalisation, which require more\nadvanced categorical constructions.

Nonetheless, on one hand, traditional DSE methods\nbased on Kalman filtering or particle filtering have high accuracy requirements\nfor system parameters, control inputs, phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, and\ncentralized DSE communication. Consequently, these methods often face accuracy\nbottlenecks when dealing with structural or system process errors, unknown\ncontrol vectors, PMU anomalies, and communication contingencies. On the other\nhand, deep learning-aided DSE, while parameter-free, often suffers from\ngeneralization issues under unforeseen operating conditions. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes an effective approach that leverages deep\ngenerative models from AI-generated content (AIGC) to assist DSE.

Finally, the code itself is much more modular, allowing\neasier maintainability and, over the longer term, a far easier prospect of\nmigrating to more recent versions of Blender.",

    "abstract": "According to the quantum chaos paradigm, the nature of a system's classical\ndynamics, whether integrable or chaotic, is universally reflected in the\nfluctuations of its quantum spectrum. However, since many-body spectra in the\nmean field limit are composed of independent single-particle energy levels,\ntheir spectral fluctuations always display Poissonian behavior and hence cannot\nbe used to distinguish underlying chaotic from integrable single-particle\ndynamics. We demonstrate that this distinction can, instead, be revealed from\nthe mean many-body level density (at fixed energy) and its variance after\naveraging over ensembles representing different types of single-particle\ndynamics. This is in strong contrast to the energy-averaged mean level density\n(of a given system) that is assumed not to carry such information and is\nroutinely removed to focus on universal signatures. To support our claim we\nsystematically analyze the role of single-particle level correlations, that\nenter through Poisson and random matrix statistics (of various symmetry\nclasses) into the ensemble-averaged density of states and its variance,\ncontrasting bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. Our analytical study,\ntogether with extensive numerical simulations for systems with $N \\ge 5$\nparticles consistently reveal significant differences (up to an order of\nmagnitude for fermions and even larger for bosons) in the mean many-body level\ndensities, depending on the nature of the underlying dynamics. Notably, in the\nfermionic case Poisson-type single-particle level fluctuations precisely cancel\ncontributions from indistinguishability, such that the average many-body\nspectral density equals the (Thomas-Fermi) volume term. We further highlight\nthe difference between the mean level density and its variance as functions of\nthe total energy $E$ and the excitation energy $Q$.",

In essence, an NNC is a duplication channel with structured,\nMarkov inputs, that is corrupted by memoryless noise. We first discuss a\n(tight) lower bound on the capacity of the NNC in the absence of random noise.\nNext, we present lower and upper bounds on the channel capacity of general\nnoisy nanopore channels. We then consider two interesting regimes of operation\nof an NNC: first, where the memory of the input process is large and the random\nnoise introduces erasures, and second, where the rate of measurements of the\nelectric current (also called the sampling rate) is high. For these regimes, we\nshow that it is possible to achieve information rates close to the noise-free\ncapacity, using low-complexity encoding and decoding schemes. In particular,\nour decoder for the regime of high sampling rates makes use of a change-point\ndetection procedure -- a subroutine of immediate relevance for practitioners.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that the states of any quantum system are vectors in a\nHilbert space. Not everyone agrees, however. The recent paper ``The\nunphysicality of Hilbert spaces'' by Carcassi, Calder\\'on and Aidala is a\nthoughtful dissection of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics that\nseeks to pinpoint supposedly unsurmountable difficulties inherent in\npostulating that the physical states are elements of a Hilbert space. Its\npivotal charge against Hilbert spaces is that by a change of variables, which\nis a change-of-basis unitary transformation, one ``can map states with finite\nexpectation values to those with infinite ones''. In the present work it is\nshown that this statement is incorrect and the source of the error is spotted.\nIn consequence, the purported example of a time evolution that makes ``the\nexpectation value oscillate from finite to infinite in finite time\" is also\nfaulty, and the assertion that Hilbert spaces ``turn a potential infinity into\nan actual infinity'' is unsubstantiated. Two other objections to Hilbert spaces\non physical grounds, both technically correct, are the isomorphism of separable\nHilbert spaces and the unavoidable existence of infinite-expectation-value\nstates. The former turns out to be quite irrrelevant but the latter remains an\nissue without a fully satisfactory solution, although the evidence so far is\nthat it is physically innocuous. All in all, while the authors' thesis that\nHilbert spaces must be given up deserves some attention, it is a long way from\nbeing persuasive as it is founded chiefly on a misconception and, subsidiarily,\non immaterial or flimsy arguments.",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations of star clusters with black holes find that there is\nonly a single dynamically active binary black hole (BBH), at odds with the\ntheoretical expectation of ~5 dynamically formed - or, commonly referred to as\nthree-body - BBHs in clusters with a few hundred BHs. We test the recent\nsuggestion that this tension is because interactions among three-body BBHs were\nneglected in the theory. We use the public catalogue of Cluster Monte Carlo\nmodels to obtain a sample of strong BBH-BBH interactions, which we integrate\nusing post-Newtonian equations of motion up to 3.5PN. We explore the nature of\nthe BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions in star clusters, as well as the\nvarious outcomes: gravitational wave (GW) captures and the associated\neccentricities at the frequencies of ground-based GW detectors, as well as BH\ntriple formation and their contribution to BBH mergers via the ZLK mechanism.\nWe find that almost all BBHs involved in BBH-BBH interactions are indeed\nthree-body binaries and that BBH formation and disruption in BBH-BBH\ninteractions occur at approximately the same rate, providing an explanation for\nthe finding of a single dynamically active BBH in N-body models. An important\nimplication is that the resulting rates of GW capture and triple formation are\nindependent of uncertain initial binary properties. With the use of a\npopulation synthesis model for BBH-BBH interactions in globular clusters, we\nobtain a local rate of GW captures of $R=1Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ as well as their\neccentricity distribution and redshift dependence. We find that a BBH-BBH\ninteraction is more likely to trigger a GW merger than a BH-BBH interaction. We\nalso confirm that stable triples that are assembled in BBH-BBH interactions can\nmerge via ZLK oscillations, although their merger rate is lower than GW\ncaptures. Our results will help with the interpretation of future GW signals\nfrom eccentric BBHs",

Co-evolutionary approaches address this\nchallenge by simultaneously evolving a parallel algorithm portfolio (PAP) and\nan instance population to eventually obtain PAPs with good generalization. Yet,\nwhen applied to a specific problem class, these approaches have a major\nlimitation. They require practitioners to provide instance generators specially\ntailored to the problem class, which is often non-trivial to design. This work\nproposes a general-purpose, off-the-shelf PAP construction approach, named\ndomain-agnostic co-evolution of parameterized search (DACE), for binary\noptimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. The key\nnovelty of DACE lies in its neural network-based domain-agnostic instance\nrepresentation and generation mechanism that eliminates the need for\ndomain-specific instance generators. The strong generality of DACE is validated\nacross three real-world binary optimization problems: the complementary\ninfluence maximization problem (CIMP), the compiler arguments optimization\nproblem (CAOP), and the contamination control problem (CCP). Given only a small\nset of training instances from these problem classes, DACE, without requiring\ndomain knowledge, constructs PAPs with even better generalization performance\nthan existing approaches on all three classes, despite their use of\ndomain-specific instance generators.",

Trained on ERA5 and CMPA high-resolution\nprecipitation datasets, the framework integrates deterministic and\nprobabilistic components. The deterministic model, based on a 3D\nSwinTransformer, captures average precipitation at mesoscale resolution and\nincorporates strategies to enhance performance, particularly for moderate to\nheavy rainfall. The probabilistic model employs conditional diffusion in latent\nspace to account for uncertainties in residual precipitation at convective\nscales. During inference, ensemble members are generated by repeatedly sampling\nlatent variables, enabling the model to represent precipitation uncertainty.\nOur model significantly enhances spatial resolution and forecast accuracy. Rank\nhistogram shows that the ensemble system is reliable and unbiased. In a case\nstudy of heavy precipitation in southern China, the model outputs align more\nclosely with observed precipitation distributions than ERA5, demonstrating\nsuperior capability in capturing extreme precipitation events.

Modern tooling and simulation platforms,\nsuch as NVIDIA Isaac Sim, have been enabling such advances. This article\nfocuses on demonstrating the applications of Isaac in local planning and\nobstacle avoidance as one of the most fundamental ways in which a mobile robot\ninteracts with its environments. Although there is extensive research on\nproprioception-based RL policies, the article highlights less standardized and\nreproducible approaches to exteroception. At the same time, the article aims to\nprovide a base framework for end-to-end local navigation policies and how a\ncustom robot can be trained in such simulation environment. We benchmark\nend-to-end policies with the state-of-the-art Nav2, navigation stack in Robot\nOperating System (ROS). We also cover the sim-to-real transfer process by\ndemonstrating zero-shot transferability of policies trained in the Isaac\nsimulator to real-world robots. This is further evidenced by the tests with\ndifferent simulated robots, which show the generalization of the learned\npolicy. Finally, the benchmarks demonstrate comparable performance to Nav2,\nopening the door to quick deployment of state-of-the-art end-to-end local\nplanners for custom robot platforms, but importantly furthering the\npossibilities by expanding the state and action spaces or task definitions for\nmore complex missions. Overall, with this article we introduce the most\nimportant steps, and aspects to consider, in deploying RL policies for local\npath planning and obstacle avoidance with Isaac Sim training, Gazebo testing,\nand ROS 2 for real-time inference in real robots.

However, as shown by our empirical study on assertions generated by\nfour LLMs for the HumanEval benchmark, over 62% of the generated assertions are\nincorrect (i.e., failed on the ground-truth problem solution). To detect\nincorrect assertions (given the docstring and the target function signature\nalong with a sample of example inputs and outputs), in this paper, we propose a\nnew approach named DeCon to effectively detect incorrect assertions via\nLLM-generated postconditions for the target problem (a postcondition is a\npredicate that must always be true just after the execution of the ground-truth\nproblem solution). Our approach requires a small set of I/O examples (i.e., a\nsample of example inputs and outputs) for the target problem (e.g., the I/O\nexamples included in the docstring for a target problem in HumanEval). We use\nthe given I/O examples to filter out those LLM-generated postconditions that\nare violated by at least one given I/O example. We then use the remaining\npostconditions to detect incorrect assertions as those assertions that violate\nat least one remaining postcondition. Experimental results show that DeCon can\ndetect averagely more than 64% (63% and 65.5% detected by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4,\nrespectively) incorrect assertions generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs, and\nDeCon can also improve the effectiveness of these LLMs in code generation by 4%\nin terms of Pass@1.

In this study, the simulations were extended by modeling the rate of\noxygen addition to polymer radicals (k_2) to reflect the effects of the O2\nconcentration.

Hence, effective frame selection is crucial.\nThis paper emphasizes that frame selection should follow three key principles:\nquery relevance, list-wise diversity, and sequentiality.

Thus, we propose Markov decision determinantal point process with\ndynamic programming (MDP3) for frame selection, a training-free and\nmodel-agnostic method that can be seamlessly integrated into existing\nVideo-LLMs. Our method first estimates frame similarities conditioned on the\nquery using a conditional Gaussian kernel within the reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace~(RKHS). We then apply the determinantal point process~(DPP) to the\nsimilarity matrix to capture both query relevance and list-wise diversity. To\nincorporate sequentiality, we segment the video and apply DPP within each\nsegment, conditioned on the preceding segment selection, modeled as a Markov\ndecision process~(MDP) for allocating selection sizes across segments.\nTheoretically, MDP3 provides a \\((1 - 1/e)\\)-approximate solution to the\nNP-hard list-wise frame selection problem with pseudo-polynomial time\ncomplexity, demonstrating its efficiency.

Thus, $k_T$ and $k$ are understood as running cutoffs\nfor thermal and quantum fluctuations, respectively. Quantum effects are taken\ninto account by moving along the thermal RG trajectory with fixed value of\n$\\tau$ producing the quantum effective action at a given dimensionless\ntemperature. The $\\tau$-evolution of the dimensionless Newton coupling\n$g(\\tau)$ and the dimensionless cosmological constant $\\lambda(\\tau)$ results\nin a vanishing $g$-coordinate of the Reuter (i.e., non-Gaussian UV) fixed point\nin the high temperature limit ($\\tau \\to \\infty$) which means that only the\nsymmetric phase of AS gravity survives at $\\tau = \\infty$. Thus, in case of\nlarge temperatures the cosmological constant takes on a negative value in the\nlimit $k\\to 0$ which was also initially predicted by certain string theories,\nhowever, in our approach this is not in disagreement with observations, since\nduring the thermal evolution of the Universe a phase transition occurs and the\ncosmological constant runs to the expected positive value at low temperatures.",

Understanding\nthe chemistry of their atmospheres and interpreting their observations requires\nthe use of chemical kinetic models including photochemistry. The thermal\ndependence of the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) absorption cross sections of\nmolecules used in these models is poorly known at high temperatures, leading to\nuncertainties in the resulting abundance profiles. The aim of our work is to\nstudy experimentally the thermal dependence of VUV absorption cross sections of\nmolecules of interest for exoplanet atmospheres and provide accurate data for\nuse in atmospheric models. This study focuses on acetylene (C2H2). We measured\nabsorption cross sections of C2H2 at seven temperatures ranging from 296 to 773\nK recorded in the 115-230 nm spectral domain using VUV spectroscopy and\nsynchrotron radiation. These data were used in our 1D thermo-photochemical\nmodel, to assess their impact on the predicted composition of a generic hot\nJupiter-like exoplanet atmosphere. The absolute absorption cross sections of\nC2H2 increase with temperature. This increase is relatively constant from 115\nto 185 nm and rises sharply from 185 to 230 nm. The abundance profile of C2H2\ncalculated using the model shows a slight variation, with a maximum decrease of\n40% near 5 x 10-5 bar, when using C2H2 absorption cross sections measured at\n773 K compared to those at 296 K. This is explained by the absorption, higher\nin the atmosphere, of the actinic flux from 150 to 230 nm due to the increase\nin the C2H2 absorption in this spectral range. This change also impacts the\nabundance profiles of other by-products such as methane (CH4) and ethylene\n(C2H4). We present the first experimental measurements of the VUV absorption\ncross sections of C2H2 at high temperatures.

    "abstract": "Recent advances of foundation models (FMs) have made navigating mobile\napplications (apps) based on high-level goal instructions within reach, with\nsignificant industrial applications such as UI testing. While existing\nbenchmarks evaluate FM-based UI navigation using the binary pass/fail metric,\nthey have two major limitations: they cannot reflect the complex nature of\nmobile UI navigation where FMs may fail for various reasons (e.g.,\nmisunderstanding instructions and failed planning), and they lack industrial\nrelevance due to oversimplified tasks that poorly represent real-world\nscenarios. To address the preceding limitations, we propose Sphinx, a\ncomprehensive benchmark for multi-dimensional evaluation of FMs in industrial\nsettings of UI navigation. Sphinx introduces a specialized toolkit that\nevaluates five essential FM capabilities, providing detailed insights into\nfailure modes such as insufficient app knowledge or planning issues. Using both\npopular Google Play applications and WeChat's internal UI test cases, we\nevaluate 8 FMs with 20 different configurations. Our results show that existing\nFMs universally struggle with goal-based testing tasks, primarily due to\ninsufficient UI-specific capabilities. We summarize seven lessons learned from\nbenchmarking FMs with Sphinx, providing clear directions for improving FM-based\nmobile UI navigation.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of multi-objective optimization, evolutionary algorithms are\ndistinguished by their capability to generate a diverse population of solutions\nthat navigate the trade-offs inherent among competing objectives. This has\ncatalyzed the ascension of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) as a\nprevalent approach. Despite the effectiveness of the EMO paradigm, the analysis\nof resultant solution sets presents considerable challenges. This is primarily\nattributed to the high-dimensional nature of the data and the constraints\nimposed by static visualization methods, which frequently culminate in visual\nclutter and impede interactive exploratory analysis. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces ParetoLens, a visual analytics framework\nspecifically tailored to enhance the inspection and exploration of solution\nsets derived from the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Utilizing a\nmodularized, algorithm-agnostic design, ParetoLens enables a detailed\ninspection of solution distributions in both decision and objective spaces\nthrough a suite of interactive visual representations. This approach not only\nmitigates the issues associated with static visualizations but also supports a\nmore nuanced and flexible analysis process. The usability of the framework is\nevaluated through case studies and expert interviews, demonstrating its\npotential to uncover complex patterns and facilitate a deeper understanding of\nmulti-objective optimization solution sets.

This paper focuses on a higher-lying isomer, which was previously\nidentified at 2933(14) keV by mass measurements with the Experimental Storage\nRing at GSI. The isomer of interest has been populated by a multi-nucleon\ntransfer reaction with a $^{136}$Xe primary beam incident on a natural tungsten\ntarget, using the KEK Isotope Separation System at RIKEN. New experimental\nfindings obtained in the present paper include the internal and external\n$\\beta$-decay branches from the high-spin isomer and a revised half-life of\n136(24) s.

    "abstract": "Text classification is a fundamental task in data mining, pivotal to various\napplications such as tabular understanding and recommendation. Although neural\nnetwork-based models, such as CNN and BERT, have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance in text classification, their effectiveness heavily relies on\nabundant labeled training data. This dependency makes these models less\neffective in dynamic few-shot text classification, where labeled data is\nscarce, and new target labels frequently appear based on application needs.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their\nextensive pretraining and contextual understanding ability. Current approaches\nprovide LLMs with text inputs, candidate labels, and additional side\ninformation (e.g., descriptions) to classify texts. However, their\neffectiveness is hindered by the increased input size and the noise introduced\nthrough side information processing. To address these limitations, we propose a\ngraph-based online retrieval-augmented generation framework, namely GORAG, for\ndynamic few-shot text classification. Rather than treating each input\nindependently, GORAG constructs and maintains a weighted graph by extracting\nside information across all target texts. In this graph, text keywords and\nlabels are represented as nodes, with edges indicating the correlations between\nthem. To model these correlations, GORAG employs an edge weighting mechanism to\nprioritize the importance and reliability of extracted information and\ndynamically retrieves relevant context using a minimum-cost spanning tree\ntailored for each text input. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GORAG\noutperforms existing approaches by providing more comprehensive and precise\ncontextual information.",

Its objectives\nincluded creating a heritage of scientific knowledge, developing advanced tools\nfor its annotation and reuse, and facilitating the dissemination of specialized\nresearch to a broad audience.At its core, the report outlines the development\nof an integrated environment that allows users to index, annotate, and classify\naudiovisual segments through personalized ontologies and thematic grids. The\nproposed methods rely on cutting-edge concepts, such as semantic web\ntechnologies, knowledge representation, and conceptual graph editing, to enable\nresearchers and educators to create tailored archives and new multimedia\nresources. This forward-thinking approach aligns with modern practices of\ncontent reuse and republication, demonstrating a vision well ahead of its\ntime.The program also emphasizes the importance of segmenting and indexing\naudiovisual materials based on user-defined criteria, enabling researchers to\nidentify and highlight specific thematic or conceptual elements within a vast\npool of data. By facilitating this level of granularity, the system supports\npersonalized academic and professional applications, including multimedia\npresentations, educational resources, and research dissemination. It introduces\ntools such as enhanced media players, ontology builders, and annotation editors\nto make this process accessible and collaborative.Finally, the report discusses\nthe Opales project, a collaborative initiative that exemplifies this innovative\nframework. The project developed a prototype environment integrating tools for\ncreating ''hyper-documents'' and supporting multilingual, multi-platform\ncontent dissemination. Despite the technological and methodological challenges\nof the time, the report's vision of interactive, richly annotated audiovisual\narchives has set the stage for the development of contemporary digital\nknowledge ecosystems.

However, conventional FL methods typically\nnecessitate multiple communication rounds, leading to significant communication\noverhead and delays, especially in environments with limited bandwidth.\nOne-shot federated learning addresses these issues by conducting model training\nand aggregation in a single communication round, thereby reducing communication\ncosts while preserving privacy. Among these, one-shot federated ensemble\nlearning combines independently trained client models using ensemble techniques\nsuch as voting, further boosting performance in non-IID data scenarios. On the\nother hand, existing machine learning methods in healthcare predominantly use\nunimodal data (e.g., medical images or textual reports), which restricts their\ndiagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness. Therefore, the integration of\nmulti-modal data is proposed to address these shortcomings. In this paper, we\nintroduce FedMME, an innovative one-shot multi-modal federated ensemble\nlearning framework that utilizes multi-modal data for medical image analysis.\nSpecifically, FedMME capitalizes on vision large language models to produce\ntextual reports from medical images, employs a BERT model to extract textual\nfeatures from these reports, and amalgamates these features with visual\nfeatures to improve diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that our\nmethod demonstrated superior performance compared to existing one-shot\nfederated learning methods in healthcare scenarios across four datasets with\nvarious data distributions. For instance, it surpasses existing one-shot\nfederated learning approaches by more than 17.5% in accuracy on the RSNA\ndataset when applying a Dirichlet distribution with ($\\alpha$ = 0.3).",

    "abstract": "In cloud-centric recommender system, regular data exchanges between user\ndevices and cloud could potentially elevate bandwidth demands and privacy\nrisks. On-device recommendation emerges as a viable solution by performing\nreranking locally to alleviate these concerns. Existing methods primarily focus\non developing local adaptive parameters, while potentially neglecting the\ncritical role of tailor-made model architecture. Insights from broader research\ndomains suggest that varying data distributions might favor distinct\narchitectures for better fitting. In addition, imposing a uniform model\nstructure across heterogeneous devices may result in risking inefficacy on less\ncapable devices or sub-optimal performance on those with sufficient\ncapabilities. In response to these gaps, our paper introduces Forward-OFA, a\nnovel approach for the dynamic construction of device-specific networks (both\nstructure and parameters). Forward-OFA employs a structure controller to\nselectively determine whether each block needs to be assembled for a given\ndevice. However, during the training of the structure controller, these\nassembled heterogeneous structures are jointly optimized, where the co-adaption\namong blocks might encounter gradient conflicts. To mitigate this, Forward-OFA\nis designed to establish a structure-guided mapping of real-time behaviors to\nthe parameters of assembled networks. Structure-related parameters and parallel\ncomponents within the mapper prevent each part from receiving heterogeneous\ngradients from others, thus bypassing the gradient conflicts for coupled\noptimization. Besides, direct mapping enables Forward-OFA to achieve adaptation\nthrough only one forward pass, allowing for swift adaptation to changing\ninterests and eliminating the requirement for on-device backpropagation.\nExperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency\nof Forward-OFA.",

    "abstract": "Prompt Tuning (PT) enables the adaptation of Pre-trained Large Language\nModels (PLMs) to downstream tasks by optimizing a small amount of soft virtual\ntokens, which are prepended to the input token embeddings. Recently, Decomposed\nPrompt Tuning (DePT) has demonstrated superior adaptation capabilities by\ndecomposing the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank\nmatrices. The product of the pair of low-rank matrices is added to the input\ntoken embeddings to offset them. Additionally, DePT achieves faster inference\ncompared to PT due to the shorter soft prompt. However, in this paper, we find\nthat the position-based token embedding offsets of DePT restrict its ability to\ngeneralize across diverse model inputs, and that the shared embedding offsets\nacross many token embeddings result in sub-optimization. To tackle these\nissues, we introduce Adaptive Decomposed Prompt Tuning (ADePT), which is\ncomposed of a short soft prompt and a shallow token-shared feed-forward neural\nnetwork. ADePT utilizes the token-shared feed-forward neural network to learn\nthe embedding offsets for each token, enabling adaptive embedding offsets that\nvary according to the model input and better optimization of token embedding\noffsets. This enables ADePT to achieve superior adaptation performance without\nrequiring more inference time or additional trainable parameters compared to\nvanilla PT and its variants. In comprehensive experiments across 23 natural\nlanguage processing tasks and 4 typical PLMs of different scales, ADePT\nconsistently surpasses the other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nmethods, and even outperforms the full fine-tuning in certain scenarios.

To this end, we consider an extremely simple domain: next\ntoken prediction on simple language tasks.

There are several known methods to measure the\nsimilarity between a pair of time series, such as cross-correlation, coherence,\ncross-recurrence, and dynamic time warping. But we have yet to find any\nmeasures with theoretical stability results.\n  Persistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with\ntheoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single\nunivariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we\npropose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity of one\nunivariate time series f1 given another f2, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive\ntheoretical stability results for the same. With the use of dimension reduction\nin mind, we prove a new stability result for score(f1|f2) under principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) when we use the projections of the time series\nembeddings onto their respective first K principal components. We show that the\nchange in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding\nto the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the\nfirst K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series\nembeddings. Finally we derive a lower bound on the minimum embedding dimension\nto use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings give\nscores that are within a given epsilon of each other.\n  We present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and\nimplement it on several pairs of synthetic signals.

    "abstract": "In the Hong Kong Observatory, the Analogue Forecast System (AFS) for\nprecipitation has been providing useful reference in predicting possible daily\nrainfall scenarios for the next 9 days, by identifying historical cases with\nsimilar weather patterns to the latest output from the deterministic model of\nthe European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Recent advances\nin machine learning allow more sophisticated models to be trained using\nhistorical data and the patterns of high-impact weather events to be\nrepresented more effectively. As such, an enhanced AFS has been developed using\nthe deep learning technique autoencoder. The datasets of the fifth generation\nof the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA5) are utilised where more meteorological elements\nin higher horizontal, vertical and temporal resolutions are available as\ncompared to the previous ECMWF reanalysis products used in the existing AFS.\nThe enhanced AFS features four major steps in generating the daily rain class\nforecasts: (1) preprocessing of gridded ERA5 and ECMWF model forecast, (2)\nfeature extraction by the pretrained autoencoder, (3) application of optimised\nfeature weightings based on historical cases, and (4) calculation of the final\nrain class from a weighted ensemble of top analogues. The enhanced AFS\ndemonstrates a consistent and superior performance over the existing AFS,\nespecially in capturing heavy rain cases, during the verification period from\n2019 to 2022.

However, the high costs of\nbuilding sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained\ndeployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this\nissue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs)\nextracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can\ninfer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors.

To do so, we first introduce\na notable theoretical observation: every group-fair model has an implicitly\ncorresponding transport map between the input spaces of each protected group.\nBased on this observation, we introduce a new group fairness measure termed\nMatched Demographic Parity (MDP), which quantifies the averaged gap between\npredictions of two individuals (from different protected groups) matched by a\ngiven transport map. Then, we prove that any transport map can be used in MDP\nto learn group-fair models, and develop a novel algorithm called Fairness\nThrough Matching (FTM), which learns a group-fair model using MDP constraint\nwith an user-specified transport map. We specifically propose two favorable\ntypes of transport maps for MDP, based on the optimal transport theory, and\ndiscuss their advantages.

This charge incentivizes customers to strategically shift\ntheir peak usage away from the system's collective peak, which helps reduce\nstress on electricity infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a\ngame-theoretic model to analyze how such strategic behavior affects overall\nsystem efficiency. We show that depending on the extent of customers'\ndemand-shifting capabilities, the resulting coincident peak shaving game can\nexhibit concavity, quasi-concavity with discontinuities, or non-concavity with\ndiscontinuities. In a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash\nequilibrium solutions for each scenario and generalize our findings to\nmulti-agent contexts. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and\npropose an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes under all game\nconfigurations. Our results indicate that the peak-shaving outcome at the\nequilibrium of the game model is comparable to the optimal outcome of the\nnatural centralized model. However, there is a significant loss in efficiency.\nUnder quasi-concave and non-concave conditions, this inefficiency grows with\nincreased customer flexibility and larger disparities in marginal shifting\ncosts; we also examine how the number of agents influences system performance.\nFinally, numerical simulations with real-world applications validate our\ntheoretical insights.",

Despite the high data rate\npotential of millimeter wave communications, millimeter wave (mmWave)\ncommunications in urban low altitude economy (LAE) environments are constrained\nby challenges such as signal attenuation and multipath interference. Specially,\nin urban environments, mmWave communication experiences significant attenuation\ndue to buildings, owing to its short wavelength, which necessitates developing\ninnovative approaches to improve the robustness of such communications in LAE\nnetworking. In this paper, we explore the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-carried intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to support low altitude\nmmWave communication. Specifically, we consider a typical urban low altitude\ncommunication scenario where a UAV-carried IRS establishes a line-of-sight\n(LoS) channel between the mobile users and a source user (SU) despite the\npresence of obstacles. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed\nat maximizing the transmission rates and minimizing the energy consumption of\nthe UAV by jointly optimizing phase shifts of the IRS and UAV trajectory. Given\nthe non-convex nature of the problem and its high dynamics, we propose a deep\nreinforcement learning-based approach incorporating neural episodic control,\nlong short-term memory, and an IRS phase shift control method to enhance the\nstability and accelerate the convergence.

Most existing methods utilize all given load records (dense\ndata) to indiscriminately extract the dependencies between historical and\nfuture time series. However, there exist important regular patterns residing in\nthe event-related associations among different appliances (sparse knowledge),\nwhich have yet been ignored. In this paper, we propose an Event-Response\nKnowledge Guided approach (ERKG) for RLF by incorporating the estimation of\nelectricity usage events for different appliances, mining event-related sparse\nknowledge from the load series. With ERKG, the event-response estimation\nenables portraying the electricity consumption behaviors of residents,\nrevealing regular variations in appliance operational states. To be specific,\nERKG consists of knowledge extraction and guidance: i) a forecasting model is\ndesigned for the electricity usage events by estimating appliance operational\nstates, aiming to extract the event-related sparse knowledge; ii) a novel\nknowledge-guided mechanism is established by fusing such state estimates of the\nappliance events into the RLF model, which can give particular focuses on the\npatterns of users' electricity consumption behaviors. Notably, ERKG can\nflexibly serve as a plug-in module to boost the capability of existing\nforecasting models by leveraging event response.

    "abstract": "Document retrieval techniques are essential for developing large-scale\ninformation systems. The common approach involves using a bi-encoder to compute\nthe semantic similarity between a query and documents. However, the scalar\nsimilarity often fail to reflect enough information, hindering the\ninterpretation of retrieval results. In addition, this process primarily\nfocuses on global semantics, overlooking the finer-grained semantic\nrelationships between the query and the document's content. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel method, $\\textbf{Ge}$neration $\\textbf{A}$ugmented\n$\\textbf{R}$etrieval ($\\textbf{GeAR}$), which not only improves the global\ndocument-query similarity through contrastive learning, but also integrates\nwell-designed fusion and decoding modules. This enables GeAR to generate\nrelevant context within the documents based on a given query, facilitating\nlearning to retrieve local fine-grained information. Furthermore, when used as\na retriever, GeAR does not incur any additional computational cost over\nbi-encoders. GeAR exhibits competitive retrieval performance across diverse\nscenarios and tasks. Moreover, qualitative analysis and the results generated\nby GeAR provide novel insights into the interpretation of retrieval results.\nThe code, data, and models will be released at\n\\href{https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps}{https://github.com/microsoft/LMOps}.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel planning framework to handle a multi-agent\npathfinding problem under team-connected communication constraint, where all\nagents must have a connected communication channel to the rest of the team\nduring their entire movements. Standard multi-agent path finding approaches\n(e.g., priority-based search) have potential in this domain but fail when\nneighboring configurations at start and goal differ. Their single-expansion\napproach -- computing each agent's path from the start to the goal in just a\nsingle expansion -- cannot reliably handle planning under communication\nconstraints for agents as their neighbors change during navigating. Similarly,\nleader-follower approaches (e.g., platooning) are effective at maintaining team\ncommunication, but fixing the leader at the outset of planning can cause\nplanning to become stuck in dense-clutter environments, limiting their\npractical utility. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel two-level\nmulti-agent pathfinding framework that integrates two techniques: adaptive path\nexpansion to expand agent paths to their goals in multiple stages; and dynamic\nleading technique that enables the reselection of the leading agent during each\nagent path expansion whenever progress cannot be made. Simulation experiments\nshow the efficiency of our planners, which can handle up to 25 agents across\nfive environment types under a limited communication range constraint and up to\n11-12 agents on three environment types under line-of-sight communication\nconstraint, exceeding 90% success-rate where baselines routinely fail.",

In industrial scenarios, reliance on manual\nannotation for map updates creates a critical bottleneck. Lane-level updates\nrequire precise change information and must ensure consistency with adjacent\ndata while adhering to strict standards. Traditional methods utilize a\nthree-stage approach-construction, change detection, and updating-which often\nnecessitates manual verification due to accuracy limitations. This results in\nlabor-intensive processes and hampers timely updates. To address these\nchallenges, we propose LDMapNet-U, which implements a new end-to-end paradigm\nfor city-scale lane-level map updating. By reconceptualizing the update task as\nan end-to-end map generation process grounded in historical map data, we\nintroduce a paradigm shift in map updating that simultaneously generates\nvectorized maps and change information. To achieve this, a Prior-Map Encoding\n(PME) module is introduced to effectively encode historical maps, serving as a\ncritical reference for detecting changes. Additionally, we incorporate a novel\nInstance Change Prediction (ICP) module that learns to predict associations\nwith historical maps. Consequently, LDMapNet-U simultaneously achieves\nvectorized map element generation and change detection. To demonstrate the\nsuperiority and effectiveness of LDMapNet-U, extensive experiments are\nconducted using large-scale real-world datasets.

When the Hubble horizon and particle horizon\nare chosen as the IR cutoff, the late-time accelerated expansion of universe is\nrealized. In this paper, we consider the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff to\ninvestigate holographic inflation and slow-roll inflation in this model. We\nfind that slow-roll inflation with the chaotic potential $V_{0}\\phi^{n}$ is\nfavored by Planck results for some special cases, such as $n=1/3$ and $n=1/2$,\nwhile holographic inflation is not supported by Planck results. Then, we\nanalyze the reheating temperature and the number of reheating e-folds in this\nmodel, and we find that the results favor the cases $n=1/3$ and $n=1/2$.\nFinally, we use the dynamical analysis method, statefinder diagnostic pairs,\nand the Hubble diagram to analyze this model. Our results indicate that when\n$b^{2}$ takes a small value, this model cannot be distinguished from the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model and can serve as an alternative to it.",

    "abstract": "The Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system has become a standard feature in recent\ncar models. While marketed as providing auto-steering capabilities, the\nsystem's operational characteristics and safety performance remain\nunderexplored, primarily due to a lack of real-world testing and comprehensive\ndata. To fill this gap, we extensively tested mainstream LKA systems from\nleading U.S. automakers in Tampa, Florida. Using an innovative method, we\ncollected a comprehensive dataset that includes full Controller Area Network\n(CAN) messages with LKA attributes, as well as video, perception, and lateral\ntrajectory data from a high-quality front-facing camera equipped with advanced\nvision detection and trajectory planning algorithms. Our tests spanned diverse,\nchallenging conditions, including complex road geometry, adverse weather,\ndegraded lane markings, and their combinations. A vision language model (VLM)\nfurther annotated the videos to capture weather, lighting, and traffic\nfeatures. Based on this dataset, we present an empirical overview of LKA's\noperational features and safety performance. Key findings indicate: (i) LKA is\nvulnerable to faint markings and low pavement contrast; (ii) it struggles in\nlane transitions (merges, diverges, intersections), often causing unintended\ndepartures or disengagements; (iii) steering torque limitations lead to\nfrequent deviations on sharp turns, posing safety risks; and (iv) LKA systems\nconsistently maintain rigid lane-centering, lacking adaptability on tight\ncurves or near large vehicles such as trucks. We conclude by demonstrating how\nthis dataset can guide both infrastructure planning and self-driving\ntechnology. In view of LKA's limitations, we recommend improvements in road\ngeometry and pavement maintenance. Additionally, we illustrate how the dataset\nsupports the development of human-like LKA systems via VLM fine-tuning and\nChain of Thought reasoning.",

We derive the\ndistributions of the channel state arising from these pointing errors and\ncalculate their average value.

We calculate the minimum number of satellites required\nin cooperative OISLs to achieve a targeted data transmission size while\nadhering to latency constraints. This involves exploring the balance between\nthe increased data rate of each link and the cumulative latency across all\nlinks.

    "abstract": "In recent years, attention-based models have excelled across various domains\nbut remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, often from downloading or\nfine-tuning on poisoned datasets. Many current methods to mitigate backdoors in\nNLP models rely on the pre-trained (unfine-tuned) weights, but these methods\nfail in scenarios where the pre-trained weights are not available. In this\nwork, we propose MBTSAD, which can mitigate backdoors in the language model by\nutilizing only a small subset of clean data and does not require pre-trained\nweights. Specifically, MBTSAD retrains the backdoored model on a dataset\ngenerated by token splitting. Then MBTSAD leverages attention distillation, the\nretrained model is the teacher model, and the original backdoored model is the\nstudent model. Experimental results demonstrate that MBTSAD achieves comparable\nbackdoor mitigation performance as the methods based on pre-trained weights\nwhile maintaining the performance on clean data. MBTSAD does not rely on\npre-trained weights, enhancing its utility in scenarios where pre-trained\nweights are inaccessible. In addition, we simplify the min-max problem of\nadversarial training and visualize text representations to discover that the\ntoken splitting method in MBTSAD's first step generates Out-of-Distribution\n(OOD) data, leading the model to learn more generalized features and eliminate\nbackdoor patterns.",

Current and upcoming gravitational wave (GW) detectors --\nPulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs), LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin -- offer unique access to\nthese processes by observing GW signals from SMBH binaries. We present a\nframework to infer galaxy and SMBH merger rates by combining mock LISA\ndetections of SMBH mergers with PTA constraints on the stochastic GW\nbackground, while incorporating observational uncertainties in stellar mass\nfunctions and $M_\\bullet$-$M_*$ relations. We find that the number of\nLISA-detected events and their joint distribution in mass and redshift are key\nto constraining merger rates -- datasets with around forty events yield results\nconsistent with galaxy pair observations, whereas limited event counts lead to\nbiases at high redshift. Including PTA data further reduces parameter\nuncertainties. Our method also effectively constrains the delay time between\ngalaxy and SMBH mergers, with longer delays suppressing high-redshift SMBH\nmerger rates and shifting mass growth from mergers to accretion. According to\nour mock analysis, the models with delay times longer than $0.5\\text{Gyr}$\n($0.8\\text{Gyr}$), accretion becomes the primary driver of SMBH mass growth\nbeyond $z \\sim 6$ ($4$). In contrast, the SMBH occupation fraction at $z>3$\nremains poorly constrained due to its degeneracies with delay time and the\ngalaxy merger rate.

In this paper, we propose a novel pre-processing method for\ndynamic ray-tracing to reduce the computational burden in high-mobility\nscenarios by prepending the intersection judgment to the pre-processing stage.\nThe proposed method generates an inter-visibility matrix that establishes\nvisibility relationships among static objects in the environment considering\nthe intersection judgment. Moreover, the inter-visibility matrix can be\nemployed to create the inter-visibility table for mobile transmitters and\nreceivers, which can improve the efficiency of constructing an image tree for\nthe three-dimensional (3D) dynamic ray-tracing method. The results show that\nthe proposed pre-processing method in dynamic ray-tracing has considerable\ntime-saving compared with the traditional method while maintaining the same\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention as it facilitates\ncollaborative machine learning among multiple clients without centralizing\ntheir data on a server. FL ensures the privacy of participating clients by\nlocally storing their data, which creates new challenges in fairness.\nTraditional debiasing methods assume centralized access to sensitive\ninformation, rendering them impractical for the FL setting. Additionally, FL is\nmore susceptible to fairness issues than centralized machine learning due to\nthe diverse client data sources that may be associated with group information.\nTherefore, training a fair model in FL without access to client local data is\nimportant and challenging. This paper presents AFed, a straightforward yet\neffective framework for promoting group fairness in FL. The core idea is to\ncircumvent restricted data access by learning the global data distribution.\nThis paper proposes two approaches: AFed-G, which uses a conditional generator\ntrained on the server side, and AFed-GAN, which improves upon AFed-G by\ntraining a conditional GAN on the client side. We augment the client data with\nthe generated samples to help remove bias. Our theoretical analysis justifies\nthe proposed methods, and empirical results on multiple real-world datasets\ndemonstrate a substantial improvement in AFed over several baselines.",

    "abstract": "To facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the\nwholesale market while maintaining the tractability of associated market\noperation tools such as unit commitment (UC), existing DER aggregation (DERA)\nstudies usually consider that each DERA is presented on a single node of the\ntransmission network. Nevertheless, the increasing scale and geographical\ndistribution of DERs spur the emergence of DERAs covering multiple transmission\nnodes, posing new challenges in modeling such multi-transmission-node DERAs\n(M-DERAs). Indeed, assessing the aggregated impact of an M-DERA on power flows\nis a non-trivial task, because the sensitivities of each transmission line to\nDERs at different transmission nodes are not identical. Inspired by the\ndistribution factor (DF) based shift factor (SF) aggregation strategy in\nindustry practice, this paper proposes a novel DF-based chance-constrained UC\n(CCUC) model to determine system optimal operation plans with M-DERAs. DFs,\ntreated as uncertain parameters to describe possible responses of DERs against\naggregated dispatch instructions from regional transmission organizations, are\nmodeled via a bounded hetero-dimensional mixture model (BHMM) by leveraging\nhistorical DF records distributed on multiple hyperplanes in a bounded space.\nWith this, power flow limits are modeled as chance constraints in CCUC, which\nis reformulated into a scenarios-based stochastic form and solved by Benders\ndecomposition. The proposed method is tested on an IEEE 24-bus system to\nillustrate its effectiveness in managing M-DERA integration while ensuring\noperational economics and mitigating the overloading of transmission lines.",

The high\nobliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation\nmechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's\nspin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star\nformation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between\nthe star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an\nindividual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet-planet\nscattering, the Lidov-Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of\nNewtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the\nframework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin-orbit coupling term\ninduces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum.\nThe orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of\ndeviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies' spins from the plane's\nnormal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star\nand the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied\nwithout restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.",

Within this context, we investigate a\ncosmological system composed of a black hole (BH) surrounded by Maxwell-Higgs\nvortices, forming the BH-vortex system. In the case of linear $f(R)$ gravity\nderived from quantum metric fluctuations, one shows the existence of a\nthree-dimensional ring-like BH-vortex system with quantized magnetic flux.\nWithin this system, one notes the BH at $r=0$ and its event horizon at $r=\nr_0$, while the magnetic vortices are at $r\\in (r_0, \\infty)$. A remarkable\nresult is the constancy of the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature ($T_H$),\nregardless of MGTs and vortex parameters. This invariance of $T_H$ suggests\nthat the BH-vortex system reaches thermodynamic stability.

    "abstract": "Although large models have shown a strong capacity to solve large-scale\nproblems in many areas including natural language and computer vision, their\nvoluminous parameters are hard to deploy in a real-time system due to\ncomputational and energy constraints. Addressing this, knowledge distillation\nthrough Teacher-Student architecture offers a sustainable pathway to compress\nthe knowledge of large models into more manageable sizes without significantly\ncompromising performance. To enhance the robustness and interpretability of\nthis framework, it is critical to understand how individual training data\nimpact model performance, which is an area that remains underexplored. We\npropose the \\textbf{Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Influence Weight\n(KD-AIF)} framework which leverages influence functions from robust statistics\nto assign weights to training data, grounded in the four key SAFE principles:\nSustainability, Accuracy, Fairness, and Explainability. This novel approach not\nonly optimizes distillation but also increases transparency by revealing the\nsignificance of different data. The exploration of various update mechanisms\nwithin the KD-AIF framework further elucidates its potential to significantly\nimprove learning efficiency and generalization in student models, marking a\nstep toward more explainable and deployable Large Models. KD-AIF is effective\nin knowledge distillation while also showing exceptional performance in\nsemi-supervised learning with outperforms existing baselines and methods in\nmultiple benchmarks (CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10-4k, SVHN-1k, and GLUE).",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained considerable traction in recent years\ndue to the unparalleled results they gathered. However, the cost behind\ntraining such sophisticated models is resource intensive, resulting in many to\nconsider DNNs to be intellectual property (IP) to model owners. In this era of\ncloud computing, high-performance DNNs are often deployed all over the internet\nso that people can access them publicly. As such, DNN watermarking schemes,\nespecially backdoor-based watermarks, have been actively developed in recent\nyears to preserve proprietary rights. Nonetheless, there lies much uncertainty\non the robustness of existing backdoor watermark schemes, towards both\nadversarial attacks and unintended means such as fine-tuning neural network\nmodels. One reason for this is that no complete guarantee of robustness can be\nassured in the context of backdoor-based watermark. In this paper, we\nextensively evaluate the persistence of recent backdoor-based watermarks within\nneural networks in the scenario of fine-tuning, we propose/develop a novel\ndata-driven idea to restore watermark after fine-tuning without exposing the\ntrigger set. Our empirical results show that by solely introducing training\ndata after fine-tuning, the watermark can be restored if model parameters do\nnot shift dramatically during fine-tuning. Depending on the types of trigger\nsamples used, trigger accuracy can be reinstated to up to 100%. Our study\nfurther explores how the restoration process works using loss landscape\nvisualization, as well as the idea of introducing training data in fine-tuning\nstage to alleviate watermark vanishing.",

Current methods for mitigating hallucinations\ngenerally focus on regularizing the language component, improving the fusion\nmodule, or ensembling multiple visual encoders to improve visual\nrepresentation. In this paper, we address the hallucination issue by directly\nenhancing the capabilities of the visual component.

    "abstract": "Spatially localised stationary patterns of arbitrary wide spatial extent\nemerge from subcritical Turing bifurcations in one-dimensional\nreaction-diffusion systems. They lie on characteristic bifurcation curves that\noscillate around a Maxwell point in a homoclinic snaking phenomenon. Here, a\ngeneralisation of the exponential asymptotics method by Chapman \\& Kozyreff is\ndeveloped to provide leading-order expressions for the width of the snaking\nregion close to a Turing bifurcation's super/sub-critical transition in\narbitrary $n$-component reaction-diffusion systems. First, general expressions\nare provided for the regular asymptotic approximation of the Maxwell point,\nwhich depends algebraically on the parametric distance from the codimension-two\nsuper/sub-critical Turing bifurcation. Then, expressions are derived for the\nwidth of the snaking, which is exponentially small in the same distance. The\ngeneral theory is developed using a vectorised form of regular and exponential\nasymptotic expansions for localised patterns, which are matched at a Stokes\nline. Detailed calculations for a particular example are algebraically\ncumbersome, depend sensitively on the form of the reaction kinetics, and rely\non the summation of a weakly convergent series obtained via optimal truncation.\nNevertheless, the process can be automated, and code is provided that carries\nout the calculations automatically, only requiring the user to input the model,\nand the values of parameters at a codimension-two bifurcation. The general\ntheory also applies to higher-order equations, including those that can be\nrecast as a reaction-diffusion system. The theory is illustrated by comparing\nnumerical computations of localised patterns in two versions of the\nSwift-Hohenberg equation with different nonlinearities, and versions of\nactivator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion systems.",
