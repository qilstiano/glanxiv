    "abstract": "Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) formalizes the problem of autocurricula\nthrough interactive training between a teacher agent and a student agent. The\nteacher generates new training environments with high learning potential,\ncurating an adaptive curriculum that strengthens the student's ability to\nhandle unseen scenarios. Existing UED methods mainly rely on regret, a metric\nthat measures the difference between the agent's optimal and actual\nperformance, to guide curriculum design. Regret-driven methods generate\ncurricula that progressively increase environment complexity for the student\nbut overlook environment novelty -- a critical element for enhancing an agent's\ngeneralizability. Measuring environment novelty is especially challenging due\nto the underspecified nature of environment parameters in UED, and existing\napproaches face significant limitations. To address this, this paper introduces\nthe Coverage-based Evaluation of Novelty In Environment (CENIE) framework.\nCENIE proposes a scalable, domain-agnostic, and curriculum-aware approach to\nquantifying environment novelty by leveraging the student's state-action space\ncoverage from previous curriculum experiences. We then propose an\nimplementation of CENIE that models this coverage and measures environment\nnovelty using Gaussian Mixture Models. By integrating both regret and novelty\nas complementary objectives for curriculum design, CENIE facilitates effective\nexploration across the state-action space while progressively increasing\ncurriculum complexity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that augmenting\nexisting regret-based UED algorithms with CENIE achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of\nnovelty-driven autocurricula for robust generalization.",

    "abstract": "Modern data analysis often involves massive datasets with hundreds of\nthousands of observations, making traditional inference algorithms\ncomputationally prohibitive. Coresets are selection methods designed to choose\na smaller subset of observations while maintaining similar learning\nperformance. Conventional coreset approaches determine these weights by\nminimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the likelihood\nfunctions of the full and weighted datasets; as a result, this makes them\nill-posed for nonparametric models, where the likelihood is often intractable.\nWe propose an alternative variational method which employs randomized\nposteriors and finds weights to match the unknown posterior predictive\ndistributions conditioned on the full and reduced datasets. Our approach\nprovides a general algorithm based on predictive recursions suitable for\nnonparametric priors.

To\naddress limitations in current benchmark setups, we introduce DirLinkBench, a\nrobust new benchmark with comprehensive coverage, standardized evaluation, and\nmodular extensibility.

In particular, we attempt to address the\nfollowing questions in a mathematically principled way: i) Where to add a new\ncapacity (layer) during the training process? ii) How to initialize the new\ncapacity? At the heart of our approach are two key ingredients: i) the\nintroduction of a ``shape functional\" to be minimized, which depends on neural\nnetwork topology, and ii) the introduction of a topological derivative of the\nshape functional with respect to the neural network topology. Using an optimal\ncontrol viewpoint, we show that the network topological derivative exists under\ncertain conditions, and its closed-form expression is derived. In particular,\nwe explore, for the first time, the connection between the topological\nderivative from a topology optimization framework with the Hamiltonian from\noptimal control theory. Further, we show that the optimality condition for the\nshape functional leads to an eigenvalue problem for deep neural architecture\nadaptation. Our approach thus determines the most sensitive location along the\ndepth where a new layer needs to be inserted during the training phase and the\nassociated parametric initialization for the newly added layer. We also\ndemonstrate that our layer insertion strategy can be derived from an optimal\ntransport viewpoint as a solution to maximizing a topological derivative in\n$p$-Wasserstein space, where $p>= 1$. Numerical investigations with fully\nconnected network, convolutional neural network, and vision transformer on\nvarious regression and classification problems demonstrate that our proposed\napproach can outperform an ad-hoc baseline network and other architecture\nadaptation strategies.

In this paper, we propose 4D Vector Quantised Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (4D-VQ-GAN), a model capable of generating realistic CT volumes of IPF\npatients at any time point. The model is trained using a two-stage approach. In\nthe first stage, a 3D-VQ-GAN is trained to reconstruct CT volumes. In the\nsecond stage, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) based temporal\nmodel is trained to capture the temporal dynamics of the quantised embeddings\ngenerated by the encoder in the first stage. We evaluate different\nconfigurations of our model for generating longitudinal CT scans and compare\nthe results against ground truth data, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\nFor validation, we conduct survival analysis using imaging biomarkers derived\nfrom generated CT scans and achieve a C-index comparable to that of biomarkers\nderived from the real CT scans.

However, there are two major\nchallenges for PNC, especially when using higher order modulations: 1) phase\nsynchronization and power control at the paired User Equipments (UEs); and 2)\nthe ambiguity removal of the PNC mapping at the relay node. To address these\nchallenges, in this paper, we apply power control at transmitting UEs and\nexploit Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to synchronize the phase of\nthe transmitted signals and ensure that they arrive at the relay with the same\npower and phase rotation. Then, we employ modular addition for an unambiguous\nPNC mapping for M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulations (M-QAM). We evaluate the\nperformance of the system in the framework of Orthogonal Frequency Division\nMultiplexing (OFDM)-PNC for different RIS sizes and modulation orders.\nFurthermore, we study the sensitivity of PNC systems for Channel Estimation\nError (CEE). The results reveal that 1) PNC systems show quite higher\nsensitivity to CEE compared with RIS-assisted one-way relay channel systems; 2)\nwhen the CEE is low, RIS can considerably enhance the Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n(SNR) of the PNC system, e.g., for a Bit Error Rate (BER) of $10^{-3}$ (without\nchannel coding), increasing the RIS size from one to 256 elements in 28 GHz\nband leads to 200% improvement in SNR.",

We propose a new measure of\nsimilarity, Word Confusion, that reframes semantic similarity in terms of\nfeature-based classification confusion. Word Confusion is inspired by Tversky's\nsuggestion that similarity features be chosen dynamically. Here we train a\nclassifier to map contextual embeddings to word identities and use the\nclassifier confusion (the probability of choosing a confounding word c instead\nof the correct target word t) as a measure of the similarity of c and t. The\nset of potential confounding words acts as the chosen features. Our method is\ncomparable to cosine similarity in matching human similarity judgments across\nseveral datasets (MEN, WirdSim353, and SimLex), and can measure similarity\nusing predetermined features of interest. We demonstrate our model's ability to\nmake use of dynamic features by applying it to test a hypothesis about changes\nin the 18th C. meaning of the French word \"revolution\" from popular to state\naction during the French Revolution.

    "abstract": "Context: 3C 273, a well-studied active galactic nucleus (AGN), displays\ncharacteristics of both jetted-AGN and Seyfert galaxies, making it an excellent\nsource to study the disc-jet connection in AGN. Aims: To investigate the\ndisk-jet scenario in 3C 273 using broadband (0.3--78 keV) X-ray spectra from\n{\\it XMM-Newton} and {\\it NuSTAR}. Methods: We used simultaneous {\\it\nXMM-Newton} and {\\it NuSTAR} observations of 3C 273 carried out between 2012\nand 2024. The 0.3--78 keV X-ray spectra were first fit with a simple power-law\n(PL) and then with the accretion-ejection-based JeTCAF model. The JeTCAF model\naccounts for emission from the jet, extending up to the sonic surface. In this\nframework, a reflection hump above 10 keV can also arise due to the bulk motion\nComptonization of coronal photons by the jet. Results: We found that the simple\nPL did not provide a good fit, leaving significant residuals at energies below\n1.5 keV. All the spectra were fitted well by the JeTCAF model. The\nweighted-averaged black hole mass of (7.77$\\pm$0.30) $\\times 10^8 M_\\odot$\nobtained from the JeTCAF model is comparable with the previous estimates based\non reverberation mapping observations and accretion disk models. Conclusions:\nThe 0.3--78 keV X-ray emission of 3C 273 can be fit by the\naccretion-ejection-based model in which the corona and the jet on top of it\nmake significant contributions to the X-ray flux. The Doppler boosting factor\nestimated from the jet flux ranges from 1.6 to 2.2, consistent with the lower\nlimit from the literature.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in robot tool use have unlocked their usage for novel\ntasks, yet the predominant focus is on rigid-body tools, while the\ninvestigation of soft-body tools and their dynamic interaction with rigid\nbodies remains unexplored. This paper takes a pioneering step towards dynamic\none-shot soft tool use for manipulating rigid objects, a challenging problem\nposed by complex interactions and unobservable physical properties. To address\nthese problems, we propose the Implicit Physics-aware (IPA) policy, designed to\nfacilitate effective soft tool use across various environmental configurations.\nThe IPA policy conducts system identification to implicitly identify physics\ninformation and predict goal-conditioned, one-shot actions accordingly. We\nvalidate our approach through a challenging task, i.e., transporting rigid\nobjects using soft tools such as ropes to distant target positions in a single\nattempt under unknown environment physics parameters. Our experimental results\nindicate the effectiveness of our method in efficiently identifying physical\nproperties, accurately predicting actions, and smoothly generalizing to\nreal-world environments.

This solution addresses the\nchallenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of\nexperience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate\nStreaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach\nleverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant\nstorage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual\nquality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to\nsupport efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the\nproposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video\nFrame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic\nambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless\ncommunication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed\nmethod achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage,\noutperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource\nefficiency.

The results reveal that the vast majority of sequences\nproduced during spatial navigation are structurally equivalent to one another.\nOnly a few classes of distinct sequences form an ordinal schema of serial\nactivity that remains stable as the pool of sequences consolidates.\nImportantly, the structure of both maps is upheld by combinations of short\nsequences, suggesting that brief activity motifs dominate physiological\ncomputations.

Most existing federated learning methods assume training\ndeep learning models, which are often computationally demanding. To deal with\nthis issue, we propose federated learning methods with reservoir state analysis\nto seek computational efficiency and data privacy protection simultaneously.\nSpecifically, our method relies on Mahalanobis Distance of Reservoir States\n(MD-RS) method targeting time series anomaly detection, which learns a\ndistribution of reservoir states for normal inputs and detects anomalies based\non a deviation from the learned distribution. Iterative updating of statistical\nparameters in the MD-RS enables incremental federated learning (IncFed MD-RS).\nWe evaluate the performance of IncFed MD-RS using benchmark datasets for time\nseries anomaly detection. The results show that IncFed MD-RS outperforms other\nfederated learning methods with deep learning and reservoir computing models\nparticularly when clients' data are relatively short and heterogeneous. We\ndemonstrate that IncFed MD-RS is robust against reduced sample data compared to\nother methods.

However, to what extent can low error rates on academic benchmarks\ntranslate to more realistic conditions? In practice, while the training set is\nfixed at one point in time, test-time conditions may exhibit distribution\nshifts relative to the training conditions, such as changes in speaker\ncharacteristics, emotional expressiveness, language and acoustic conditions,\nand the emergence of novel synthesis methods. Although some existing datasets\ntarget subsets of these distribution shifts, systematic analysis remains\ndifficult due to inconsistencies between source data and synthesis systems\nacross datasets. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the rapid\ndevelopment of new text-to-speech (TTS) and vocoder systems, which continually\nexpand the diversity of synthetic speech. To enable systematic benchmarking of\nmodel performance under distribution shifts, we introduce ShiftySpeech, a\nlarge-scale benchmark comprising over 3,000 hours of synthetic speech across 7\nsource domains, 6 TTS systems, 12 vocoders, and 3 languages. ShiftySpeech is\nspecifically designed to evaluate model generalization under controlled\ndistribution shifts while ensuring broad coverage of modern synthetic speech\ngeneration techniques.

    "abstract": "Though English sentences are typically inflexible vis-\\`a-vis word order,\nconstituents often show far more variability in ordering. One prominent theory\npresents the notion that constituent ordering is directly correlated with\nconstituent weight: a measure of the constituent's length or complexity. Such\ntheories are interesting in the context of natural language processing (NLP),\nbecause while recent advances in NLP have led to significant gains in the\nperformance of large language models (LLMs), much remains unclear about how\nthese models process language, and how this compares to human language\nprocessing. In particular, the question remains whether LLMs display the same\npatterns with constituent movement, and may provide insights into existing\ntheories on when and how the shift occurs in human language. We compare a\nvariety of LLMs with diverse properties to evaluate broad LLM performance on\nfour types of constituent movement: heavy NP shift, particle movement, dative\nalternation, and multiple PPs. Despite performing unexpectedly around particle\nmovement, LLMs generally align with human preferences around constituent\nordering.",

In this\nadversarial attack, we solve an optimization problem to construct perceptually\nrigid adversarial objects that have the same collision geometry and moments of\nmass to a reference object, so that they behave identically in rigid body\nsimulations but maximally different in more accurate deformable simulations. We\ndemonstrate the validity of our method by comparing simulations of several\nexamples in commercially available simulators.",

Current approaches employ external tool-based iterative\ndebuggers that use compiler or other tool-based runtime feedback to refine\ncoarse programs generated by various methods.

In this paper, we introduce CodeSim, a novel\nmulti-agent code generation framework that comprehensively addresses the stages\nof program synthesis-planning, coding, and debugging-through a human-like\nperception approach. As human verifies their understanding of any algorithms\nthrough visual simulation, CodeSim uniquely features a method of plan\nverification and internal debugging through the step-by-step simulation of\ninput/output. Extensive experiments across seven challenging competitive\nproblem-solving and program synthesis benchmarks demonstrate CodeSim's\nremarkable code generation capabilities.

In this\nframework, we consider a quantum interferometric circuit to obtain the\nprobability, visibility, and coherence. Naturally, these measurements provide\nus with wave-like information. Besides, one modifies the circuit to describe\nthe path distinguishability and the particle-like information. These results\nare promising, as they allow us to understand the influence of the Unruh effect\non the wave-particle duality. Thus, our findings announce that the increase in\nthe scalar field mass induces a decrease in information degradation. Finally,\nwe noted that the information concerning the Unruh effect remains preserved\nwhen $m \\geq \\Omega$.

    "abstract": "We show that the standard discrete update rule of transformer layers can be\nnaturally interpreted as a forward Euler discretization of a continuous\ndynamical system. Our Transformer Flow Approximation Theorem demonstrates that,\nunder standard Lipschitz continuity assumptions, token representations converge\nuniformly to the unique solution of an ODE as the number of layers grows.\nMoreover, if the underlying mapping satisfies a one-sided Lipschitz condition\nwith a negative constant, the resulting dynamics are contractive, causing\nperturbations to decay exponentially across layers. Beyond clarifying the\nempirical stability and expressivity of transformer models, these insights link\ntransformer updates to a broader iterative reasoning framework, suggesting new\navenues for accelerated convergence and architectural innovations inspired by\ndynamical systems theory.",

If each cube is individually solvable,\ncan all three be solved together in this configuration? This question motivates\na natural generalization of the Lights Out Puzzle, exploring the synergy\nbetween graph theory and group theory.\n  The classic Lights Out Puzzle is played on a $5 \\times 5$ grid where each\nsquare is either \"on\" or \"off.\" Clicking a square toggles its state and that of\nits neighbors, and the objective is to turn all squares \"off.\" A related\nquestion, solvable using linear algebra over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, the finite field\nof 2 elements, asks which states are possible to achieve starting from the\nall-on state. Here, we vastly generalize the setting in two ways: (1) the\nstates are allowed to be the elements of a group $G$, where \"clicking\" is done\nby selecting an element $g \\in G$ and multiplying all affected squares on the\nright by $g$, and (2) we not only allow square grids, but any graph $\\Gamma$,\nwhere clicking a vertex $v$ affects $v$ and all adjacent vertices.\n  Starting with the identity element $e \\in G$ for all vertices, the totality\nof all achievable state configurations forms a group $G^{\\Gamma}$. This group\ngeneralizes parallel products of group actions and provides a rich structure\nfor analysis. For many graphs, which we term \"RA\" (reducible to abelian), the\nproblem reduces - regardless of $G$ - to a linear algebra question over\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ (the integers).

This requires a versatile low-level humanoid\ncontroller that can handle such sparse, under-specified guidance, seamlessly\nswitch between skills, and recover from failures. Current approaches for\nlearning humanoid controllers from demonstration data capture some of these\ncharacteristics, but none achieve them all. To this end, we introduce the\nMasked Humanoid Controller (MHC), a novel approach that applies multi-objective\nimitation learning on augmented and selectively masked motion demonstrations.\nThe training methodology results in an MHC that exhibits the key capabilities\nof catch-up to out-of-sync input commands, combining elements from multiple\nmotion sequences, and completing unspecified parts of motions from sparse\nmultimodal input. We demonstrate these key capabilities for an MHC learned over\na dataset of 87 diverse skills and showcase different multi-modal use cases,\nincluding integration with planning frameworks to highlight MHC's ability to\nsolve new user-defined tasks without any finetuning.",

Unlike DNNs, which rely on multi-path arithmetic operations, a TM\nlearns propositional logic patterns from data literals using Tsetlin automata.\nThis fundamental shift from arithmetic to logic underpinning makes TM suitable\nfor empowering new applications with low-cost implementations.\n  In TM, literals are often included by both positive and negative clauses\nwithin the same class, canceling out their impact on individual class\ndefinitions. This property can be exploited to develop compressed TM models,\nenabling energy-efficient and high-throughput inferences for machine learning\n(ML) applications.\n  We introduce a training approach that incorporates excluded automata states\nto sparsify TM logic patterns in both positive and negative clauses. This\nexclusion is iterative, ensuring that highly class-correlated (and therefore\nsignificant) literals are retained in the compressed inference model, ETHEREAL,\nto maintain strong classification accuracy. Compared to standard TMs, ETHEREAL\nTM models can reduce model size by up to 87.54%, with only a minor accuracy\ncompromise. We validate the impact of this compression on eight real-world Tiny\nmachine learning (TinyML) datasets against standard TM, equivalent Random\nForest (RF) and Binarized Neural Network (BNN) on the STM32F746G-DISCO\nplatform.

Our proof proceeds by establishing a strong data processing\ninequality for relative Fisher information along the Gaussian channel under\nstrong log-concavity, and a data processing inequality along the reverse\nGaussian channel for a special distribution.

    "abstract": "Existing network paradigms have achieved lower downtime as well as a higher\nQuality of Experience (QoE) through the use of Artificial Intelligence\n(AI)-based network management tools. These AI management systems, allow for\nautomatic responses to changes in network conditions, lowering operation costs\nfor operators, and improving overall performance. While adopting AI-based\nmanagement tools enhance the overall network performance, it also introduce\nchallenges such as removing human supervision, privacy violations, algorithmic\nbias, and model inaccuracies. Furthermore, AI-based agents that fail to address\nthese challenges should be culpable themselves rather than the network as a\nwhole. To address this accountability gap, a framework consisting of a Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) model and a Machine Learning (ML) model is\nproposed to identify and assign numerical values of responsibility to the\nAI-based management agents involved in any decision-making regarding the\nnetwork conditions, which eventually affects the end-user. A simulation\nenvironment was created for the framework to be trained using simulated network\noperation parameters. The DRL model had a 96% accuracy during testing for\nidentifying the AI-based management agents, while the ML model using gradient\ndescent learned the network conditions at an 83% accuracy during testing.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the linear objective function optimization with respect\nto a more general class of bipolar fuzzy relational equations, where the fuzzy\ncompositions are defined by an arbitrary continuous Archimedean t-norm. In\naddition, a faster method for finding a global optimum is proposed. Analytical\nconcepts and properties of the Archimedean bipolar fuzzy equations are\ninvestigated and two necessary conditions are presented to conceptualize the\nfeasibility of the problem. It is shown that the feasible solution set can be\nresulted by a union of the finite number of compact sets, where each compact\nset is obtained by a function (called admissible function in this paper).\nMoreover, to accelerate identification of the mentioned compact sets (and\ntherefore, to speed up solution finding), four simplification techniques are\npresented, which are based on either omitting redundant constraints and/or\neliminating unknowns by assigning them a fixed value. Also, three additional\nsimplification techniques are given to reduce the search domain by removing\nsome parts of the feasible region that do not contain optimal solutions.\nSubsequently, a method is proposed to find an optimal solution for the current\nlinear optimization problems. The proposed method consists of two accelerative\nstrategies that are used during the problem solving process. By the first\nstrategy, the method neglects some candidate solutions that are not optimal, by\nconsidering only a subset of admissible functions (called modified functions in\nthis paper). As for the second strategy, a branch-and-bound method is used to\ndelete non-optimal branches. Then, the method is summarized in an algorithm\nthat represents all essential steps of the solution and finally, the whole\nmethod is applied in an example that has been chosen in such a way that the\nvarious situations are illustrated.",

For humans, iterative\nrefinement of problem analysis and responses is a common strategy to enhance\nanswer quality. However, we observe that existing LLMs exhibit limited ability\nto refine their outputs for quality improvement. In this paper, we first\ninvestigate mechanisms to unlock and progressively enhance self-refinement\nability in smaller models within an iterative preference optimization\nframework, aiming to bridge the performance gap with larger models. To this\nend, we propose EVOLVE, a novel post-training and inference framework that\niteratively integrates preference training with self-refinement-driven data\ncollection. During training, EVOLVE strengthens the model's direct\nquestion-answering ability while simultaneously unlocking its self-refinement\npotential. At inference, the framework leverages this capability to generate\nprogressively refined responses, which are filtered to construct datasets for\nsubsequent rounds of preference training. Experiments demonstrate EVOLVE's\nexceptional performance: when applied to Llama-3.1-8B base model and under the\nself-refinement setting, it surpasses state-of-the-art models including\nLlama-3.1-405B-Instruct and GPT-4o, achieving a 62.3% length-controlled win\nrate and 63.3% raw win rate on AlpacaEval 2, along with a 50.3% win rate on\nArena-Hard.

    "abstract": "Pick-and-place (PnP) operations, featuring object grasping and trajectory\nplanning, are fundamental in industrial robotics applications. Despite many\nadvancements in the field, PnP is limited by workspace constraints, reducing\nflexibility. Pick-and-throw (PnT) is a promising alternative where the robot\nthrows objects to target locations, leveraging extrinsic resources like gravity\nto improve efficiency and expand the workspace. However, PnT execution is\ncomplex, requiring precise coordination of high-speed movements and object\ndynamics. Solutions to the PnT problem are categorized into analytical and\nlearning-based approaches. Analytical methods focus on system modeling and\ntrajectory generation but are time-consuming and offer limited generalization.\nLearning-based solutions, in particular Model-Free Reinforcement Learning\n(MFRL), offer automation and adaptability but require extensive interaction\ntime. This paper introduces a Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL)\nframework, MC-PILOT, which combines data-driven modeling with policy\noptimization for efficient and accurate PnT tasks. MC-PILOT accounts for model\nuncertainties and release errors, demonstrating superior performance in\nsimulations and real-world tests with a Franka Emika Panda manipulator. The\nproposed approach generalizes rapidly to new targets, offering advantages over\nanalytical and Model-Free methods.",

    "abstract": "The latest WiFi standard, IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6), introduces a novel uplink\nrandom access mechanism called uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple\naccess-based random access (UORA). While existing work has evaluated the\nperformance of UORA using conventional performance metrics, such as throughput\nand delay, its information freshness performance has not been thoroughly\ninvestigated in the literature. This is of practical significance as WiFi 6 and\nbeyond are expected to support real-time applications. This paper presents the\nfirst attempt to fill this gap by investigating the information freshness,\nquantified by the Age of Information (AoI) metric, in UORA networks. We\nestablish an analytical framework comprising two discrete-time Markov chains\n(DTMCs) to characterize the transmission states of stations (STAs) in UORA\nnetworks. Building on the formulated DTMCs, we derive an analytical expression\nfor the long-term average AoI (AAoI), facilitating the optimization of UORA\nparameters for enhanced AoI performance through exhaustive search. To gain\ndeeper design insights and improve the effectiveness of UORA parameter\noptimization, we derive a closed-form expression for the AAoI and its\napproximated lower bound for a simplified scenario characterized by a fixed\nbackoff contention window and generate-at-will status updates. By analyzing the\napproximated lower bound of the AAoI, we propose efficient UORA parameter\noptimization algorithms that can be realized with only a few comparisons of\ndifferent possible values of the parameters to be optimized.

Simulation\nresults on synthetic and real-world datasets of the IEEE 118-bus power system\nand the Minnesota road network demonstrate that, in the tested scenarios, the\nproposed sampling allocation methods reduce the MSE by up to $50\\%$ compared to\nthe common sampling methods A-design, E-design, and LR-design. Thus, the\nproposed methods improve the estimation performance and reduce the required\nnumber of measurements in graph signal processing (GSP)-based signal recovery\nin the case of underdetermined systems.",

Using a combination of dynamic surface tensiometry and spatially\nresolved 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy, this study investigates if adsorption of a\nmodel IgG2a-\\k{appa} mAb to the oil-water interface affects its structure.\nLocalized NMR spectroscopy was performed using voxels of 375 um, incrementally\napproaching the oil-water interface. Dynamic interfacial tension progressively\ndecreases at the oil-water interface over time, confirming mAb adsorption to\nthe interface. Localized NMR spectroscopy results indicate that, while the\nnumber of mAb-related chemical resonances and chemical shift frequencies remain\nunaffected, spectral line broadening is observed as voxels incrementally\napproach the oil-water interface. Moreover, the spin-spin (T2) relaxation of\nthe mAb molecule was measured for a voxel centered at the interface and shown\nto be affected differentially across the mAb resonances, indicating a\nrotational restriction for mAb molecules due to presence of the interface.\nFinally, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the mAb for the voxel centered\nat the interface is lower than the bulk mAb. These results suggest that this\nspecific mAb interacts with and may be in exchange with bulk mAb phase in the\nvicinity of the interface. As such, these localized NMR techniques offer the\npotential to probe and quantify alterations of mAb properties near interfacial\nlayers.",

In\nStage I, all users jointly transmit pilots and recover the uncompressed\nreceived signals to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the\ndiscrete Fourier transform (DFT). Based on the observation that the overall\ncascaded MIMO channel can be decomposed into multiple sub-channels, the\ncascaded channel for a typical user is estimated in Stage II. Specifically,\nusing the invariance of angles and the linear correlation of gains related to\ndifferent cascaded subchannels, we use compressive sensing (CS), least squares\n(LS), and a one-dimensional search to estimate the Angles of Departure (AoDs),\nbased on which the overall cascaded channel is obtained. In Stage III, the\nremaining users independently transmit pilots to estimate their individual\ncascaded channel with the same approach as in Stage II, which exploits the\nequivalent common RIS-BS channel obtained in Stage II to reduce the pilot\noverhead. In addition, the hybrid combining matrix and the RIS phase shift\nmatrix are designed to reduce the noise power, thereby further improving the\nestimation performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nalgorithm can achieve high estimation accuracy especially when the number of\nantennas at the users is small, and reduce pilot overhead by more than five\ntimes compared with the existing benchmark approach.",

However, generative models require training using samples from the\nconstrained action space, which itself is challenging. To address such\nlimitations, first, we define a target distribution for feasible actions based\non constraint violation signals, and train normalizing flows by minimizing the\nKL divergence between an approximated distribution over feasible actions and\nthe target.

    "abstract": "While Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can successfully learn to handle\ncomplex tasks, effectively generalizing acquired skills to unfamiliar settings\nremains a challenge. One of the reasons behind this is the visual encoders used\nare task-dependent, preventing effective feature extraction in different\nsettings. To address this issue, recent studies have tried to pretrain encoders\nwith diverse visual inputs in order to improve their performance. However, they\nrely on existing pretrained encoders without further exploring the impact of\npretraining period. In this work, we propose APE: efficient reinforcement\nlearning through Adaptively Pretrained visual Encoder -- a framework that\nutilizes adaptive augmentation strategy during the pretraining phase and\nextracts generalizable features with only a few interactions within the task\nenvironments in the policy learning period. Experiments are conducted across\nvarious domains, including DeepMind Control Suite, Atari Games and Memory Maze\nbenchmarks, to verify the effectiveness of our method. Results show that\nmainstream RL methods, such as DreamerV3 and DrQ-v2, achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance when equipped with APE. In addition, APE significantly improves the\nsampling efficiency using only visual inputs during learning, approaching the\nefficiency of state-based method in several control tasks. These findings\ndemonstrate the potential of adaptive pretraining of encoder in enhancing the\ngeneralization ability and efficiency of visual RL algorithms.",

To tackle these challenges, researchers have separately\ndevised secure aggregation mechanisms to protect data privacy and robust\naggregation methods that withstand poisoning attacks. However, simultaneously\naddressing both concerns is challenging; secure aggregation facilitates\npoisoning attacks as most anomaly detection techniques require access to\nunencrypted local model updates, which are obscured by secure aggregation. Few\nrecent efforts to simultaneously tackle both challenges offen depend on\nimpractical assumption of non-colluding two-server setups that disrupt FL's\ntopology, or three-party computation which introduces scalability issues,\ncomplicating deployment and application. To overcome this dilemma, this paper\nintroduce a Dual Defense Federated learning (DDFed) framework. DDFed\nsimultaneously boosts privacy protection and mitigates poisoning attacks,\nwithout introducing new participant roles or disrupting the existing FL\ntopology. DDFed initially leverages cutting-edge fully homomorphic encryption\n(FHE) to securely aggregate model updates, without the impractical requirement\nfor non-colluding two-server setups and ensures strong privacy protection.\nAdditionally, we proposes a unique two-phase anomaly detection mechanism for\nencrypted model updates, featuring secure similarity computation and\nfeedback-driven collaborative selection, with additional measures to prevent\npotential privacy breaches from Byzantine clients incorporated into the\ndetection process. We conducted extensive experiments on various model\npoisoning attacks and FL scenarios, including both cross-device and cross-silo\nFL.

Most existing methods treat the detector monolithically,\nrelying on instance replay or knowledge distillation without analyzing\ncomponent-specific forgetting. Through dissection of Faster R-CNN, we reveal a\nkey insight: Catastrophic forgetting is predominantly localized to the RoI Head\nclassifier, while regressors retain robustness across incremental stages. This\nfinding challenges conventional assumptions, motivating us to develop a\nframework termed NSGP-RePRE. Regional Prototype Replay (RePRE) mitigates\nclassifier forgetting via replay of two types of prototypes: coarse prototypes\nrepresent class-wise semantic centers of RoI features, while fine-grained\nprototypes model intra-class variations. Null Space Gradient Projection (NSGP)\nis further introduced to eliminate prototype-feature misalignment by updating\nthe feature extractor in directions orthogonal to subspace of old inputs via\ngradient projection, aligning RePRE with incremental learning dynamics. Our\nsimple yet effective design allows NSGP-RePRE to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets under various settings.

Additionally, the large size of\nlocal learning models imposes heavy computational demands on end users,\nnecessitating strong computational capabilities that most commercial devices\nlack. To address the aforementioned challenges, a coalition-formation-guided\nheterogeneous federated learning (FL) framework is proposed.

Specifically, by utilizing a\ndistributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, each FL user\nintelligently and independently decides whether to join or leave a coalition,\naiming at improving channel estimation accuracy, while reducing local model\nsize and computational costs for end users. Moreover, to accelerate the DRL-FL\nconvergence process and reduce computational burdens on end users, a transfer\nlearning method is introduced.

Nonetheless, existing works mostly focus on one-shot\ndeterministic CO, while sequential stochastic CO (SSCO) has rarely been studied\ndespite its broad applications such as adaptive influence maximization (IM) and\ninfectious disease intervention. In this paper, we study the SSCO problem where\nwe first decide the budget (e.g., number of seed nodes in adaptive IM)\nallocation for all time steps, and then select a set of nodes for each time\nstep. The few existing studies on SSCO simplify the problems by assuming a\nuniformly distributed budget allocation over the time horizon, yielding\nsuboptimal solutions.

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel rate-matching\n(RM) framework based on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) that minimizes\nthe difference between the traffic demands and offered rates while\nsimultaneously minimizing transmit power for power-hungry satellite payloads.\nMoreover, channel phase perturbations arising from channel estimation and\nfeedback errors are considered to capture realistic multibeam LEO SATCOM\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "The enumeration of chemical graphs is an important topic in cheminformatics\nand bioinformatics, particularly in the discovery of novel drugs. These graphs\nare typically either tree-like multigraphs or composed of tree-like multigraphs\nconnected to a core structure. In both cases, the tree-like components play a\nsignificant role in determining the properties and activities of chemical\ncompounds. This paper introduces a method based on dynamic programming to\nefficiently count tree-like multigraphs with a given number $n$ of vertices and\n$\\Delta$ multiple edges. The idea of our method is to consider multigraphs as\nrooted multigraphs by selecting their unicentroid or bicentroid as the root,\nand define their canonical representation based on maximal subgraphs rooted at\nthe children of the root. This representation guarantees that our proposed\nmethod will not repeat a multigraph in the counting process. Finally, recursive\nrelations are derived based on the number of vertices and multiple edges in the\nmaximal subgraphs rooted at the children of roots. These relations lead to an\nalgorithm with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2(n + \\Delta (n + \\Delta^2\n\\cdot \\min\\{n, \\Delta\\})))$ and a space complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2(\\Delta^3+1))$. Experimental results show that the proposed\nalgorithm efficiently counts the desired multigraphs with up to 170 vertices\nand 50 multiple edges in approximately 930 seconds, confirming its\neffectiveness and potential as a valuable tool for exploring the chemical graph\nspace in novel drug discovery.",

This study addresses this gap by examining the statistical\ncharacteristics and dynamic mechanisms of 2D EIT, while exploring its\nsimilarities to and differences from three-dimensional (3D) EIT. We demonstrate\nthat the influence of elasticity on the statistical properties of 2D EIT\nfollows distinct trends compared to those observed in 3D EIT and drag-reducing\nturbulence (DRT). These differences can be attributed to variations in the\nunderlying dynamical processes. As nonlinear elasticity increases, the dominant\ndynamic evolution in 3D flows involves the gradual suppression of inertial\nturbulence (IT). In contrast, 2D flows exhibit a progressive enhancement of\nEIT. More strikingly, we identify an anomalous Reynolds stress in 2D EIT that\ncontributes negatively to flow resistance, a behavior opposite to that of IT.\nQuadrant analysis of velocity fluctuations reveals the predominance of motions\nin the first and third quadrants. These motions are closely associated with\npolymer sheet-like extension structures, which are inclined from the near-wall\nregion toward the channel center along the streamwise direction. Finally, we\npresent the dynamical budget of 2D EIT, which shows significant similarities to\nthat of 3D EIT, thereby providing compelling evidence for the objective\nexistence of the 2D nature of EIT.",

A first-order phase\ntransition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark\ncore, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational\nand theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger\nastrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER\nand spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron\nresonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS\nmodifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS\nmergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger\noscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions.

    "abstract": "Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) generally share common propagation features,\nleading to consistent spectral observations of secondary nuclei such as Li, Be,\nand B. However, the Li spectrum predicted by the CR diffusion coefficient\ninferred from B/C is significantly lower than the latest measurement of AMS-02.\nThis anomaly may be attributed to the missing contributions from the heavy\nnuclei components in cosmic rays. By including these missing contributions the\nexcess of the Li spectrum disappears. However, another inconsistency still\nexists since the calculated Li spectrum is now overestimated compared to the\ndata. In this work, we update the cross-section model used to calculate the Li\nproduction according to more cross-section measurements. We find that the cross\nsections of these added reactions are systematically overestimated, and should\nbe renormalized to the interpolations of available data. As a result, our\nprediction of the total Li spectrum is consistent with the measurement without\ndiscrepancy, and our prediction of the $\\rm^6Li$ and $\\rm^7Li$ spectra are\nconsistent with the preliminary measurements of AMS-02 within the cross-section\nuncertainties.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) is a\nfundamental challenge in astrophysics and nuclear physics. A first-order phase\ntransition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark\ncore, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational\nand theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger\nastrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER\nand spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron\nresonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS\nmodifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS\nmergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger\noscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing\noffers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and\nglitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing\nchallenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical\nsimulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals,\ntwin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including\nnext-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes,\nand improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase\ntransitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial\ninsights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS\ninteriors.",

We seek to minimize a loss function,\ndesigned to encompass conditions on the certificate to be learned that encode\nthe satisfaction of the associated property. Besides learning a certificate, we\nquantify probabilistically its generalization properties, namely, how likely it\nis for a certificate to be valid (and hence for the associated property to be\nsatisfied) when it comes to a new system trajectory not included in the\ntraining data set. We view this problem under the realm of probably\napproximately correct (PAC) learning under the notion of compression, and use\nrecent advancements of the so-called scenario approach to obtain scalable\ngeneralization bounds on the learned certificates. To achieve this, we design a\nnovel algorithm that minimizes the loss function and hence constructs a\ncertificate, and at the same time determines a quantity termed compression,\nwhich is instrumental in obtaining meaningful probabilistic guarantees.

Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by\nenabling adversaries to reconstruct training data from model outputs. While MI\nattacks on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely studied, Spiking\nNeural Networks (SNNs) remain largely unexplored in this context. Due to their\nevent-driven and discrete computations, SNNs introduce fundamental differences\nin information processing that may offer inherent resistance to such attacks. A\ncritical yet underexplored aspect of this threat lies in black-box settings,\nwhere attackers operate through queries without direct access to model\nparameters or gradients-representing a more realistic adversarial scenario in\ndeployed systems. This work presents the first study of black-box MI attacks on\nSNNs. We adapt a generative adversarial MI framework to the spiking domain by\nincorporating rate-based encoding for input transformation and decoding\nmechanisms for output interpretation. Our results show that SNNs exhibit\nsignificantly greater resistance to MI attacks than ANNs, as demonstrated by\ndegraded reconstructions, increased instability in attack convergence, and\noverall reduced attack effectiveness across multiple evaluation metrics.\nFurther analysis suggests that the discrete and temporally distributed nature\nof SNN decision boundaries disrupts surrogate modeling, limiting the attacker's\nability to approximate the target model.",

    "abstract": "Recent AI agents, such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, primarily rely on instruction\ntuning and reinforcement learning to calibrate the output of large language\nmodels (LLMs) with human intentions, ensuring the outputs are harmless and\nhelpful. Existing methods heavily depend on the manual annotation of\nhigh-quality positive samples, while contending with issues such as noisy\nlabels and minimal distinctions between preferred and dispreferred response\ndata. However, readily available toxic samples with clear safety distinctions\nare often filtered out, removing valuable negative references that could aid\nLLMs in safety alignment. In response, we propose PT-ALIGN, a novel safety\nself-alignment approach that minimizes human supervision by automatically\nrefining positive and toxic samples and performing fine-grained dual\ninstruction tuning. Positive samples are harmless responses, while toxic\nsamples deliberately contain extremely harmful content, serving as a new\nsupervisory signals. Specifically, we utilize LLM itself to iteratively\ngenerate and refine training instances by only exploring fewer than 50 human\nannotations. We then employ two losses, i.e., maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE) and fine-grained unlikelihood training (UT), to jointly learn to enhance\nthe LLM's safety. The MLE loss encourages an LLM to maximize the generation of\nharmless content based on positive samples. Conversely, the fine-grained UT\nloss guides the LLM to minimize the output of harmful words based on negative\nsamples at the token-level, thereby guiding the model to decouple safety from\neffectiveness, directing it toward safer fine-tuning objectives, and increasing\nthe likelihood of generating helpful and reliable content. Experiments on 9\npopular open-source LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our PT-ALIGN for\nsafety alignment, while maintaining comparable levels of helpfulness and\nusefulness.",

Results from the categorization\ntask indicate that LLMs struggle to classify VA values into discrete emotion\ncategories, particularly for emotions beyond basic polarities (e.g., happiness,\nsadness).

Among them, WD J1013-0427 shows an indication of\nreddening during the long-duration dip. Interpreting this as dust extinction\nmakes it the first system to indicate an abundance of small dust grains (radius\n$\\lesssim$$0.3~{\\rm \\mu m}$) in the occulting material. The same object also\nshows metal emission lines that map an optically thick eccentric gas disk\norbiting within the star's Roche limit. For each candidate, we infer the\nabundances of the photospheric metals and estimate accretion rates. We show\nthat transiting debris systems tend to have higher inferred accretion rates\ncompared to the general population of metal-polluted WDs. Growing the number of\nthese systems will further illuminate such comparative properties in the near\nfuture. Separately, we also serendipitously discovered an AM CVn showing a very\nlong-duration outburst $-$ only the fourth such system to be known.",

Inspired by human protocols that combine visual\nidentification with acoustic verification, this study proposes a deep\nlearning-based robotic system for autonomously detecting and classifying gas\nleaks and arc discharges in manufacturing settings. The system is designed to\nexecute all experimental tasks entirely onboard the robot. Utilizing a\n112-channel acoustic camera operating at a 96 kHz sampling rate to capture\nultrasonic frequencies, the system processes real-world datasets recorded in\ndiverse industrial scenarios. These datasets include multiple gas leak\nconfigurations (e.g., pinhole, open end) and partial discharge types (Corona,\nSurface, Floating) under varying environmental noise conditions. Proposed\nsystem integrates visual detection and a beamforming-enhanced acoustic analysis\npipeline. Signals are transformed using STFT and refined through Gamma\nCorrection, enabling robust feature extraction. An Inception-inspired CNN\nfurther classifies hazards, achieving 99% gas leak detection accuracy. The\nsystem not only detects individual hazard sources but also enhances\nclassification reliability by fusing multi-modal data from both vision and\nacoustic sensors. When tested in reverberation and noise-augmented\nenvironments, the system outperformed conventional models by up to 44%p, with\nexperimental tasks meticulously designed to ensure fairness and\nreproducibility. Additionally, the system is optimized for real-time\ndeployment, maintaining an inference time of 2.1 seconds on a mobile robotic\nplatform.

Clearly, in real-world scenarios, such a large number of algorithms\nis unnecessary. In other words, a large number of outlier detection algorithms\nare redundant. We believe the root cause of this redundancy lies in the current\nhighly customized (i.e., non-generic) optimization strategies. Specifically,\nwhen researchers seek to improve the performance of existing outlier detection\nalgorithms, they have to design separate optimized versions tailored to the\nprinciples of each algorithm, leading to an ever-growing number of outlier\ndetection algorithms. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce the\nexplosion from physics into the outlier detection task and propose a generic\noptimization strategy based on feature explosion, called OSD (Optimization\nStrategy for outlier Detection algorithms). In the future, when improving the\nperformance of existing outlier detection algorithms, it will be sufficient to\ninvoke the OSD plugin without the need to design customized optimized versions\nfor them. We compared the performances of 14 outlier detection algorithms on 24\ndatasets before and after invoking the OSD plugin.

In our work we determine the range of\nparameters in which modularity detects well the community structure of the\nrandom intersection graphs, as well as give a range of parameters for which\nthere is a community structure present but not revealed by modularity. We also\nrelate modularity of the random intersection graph to the modularity of other\nknown random graph models.",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a Mix Neural Network (MNN) based on CNN-FCNN for\npredicting magnetic loss of different materials. In traditional magnetic core\nloss models, empirical equations usually need to be regressed under the same\nexternal conditions. When the magnetic core material is different, it needs to\nbe classified and discussed. If external factors increase, multiple models need\nto be proposed for classification and discussion, making the modeling process\nextremely cumbersome. And traditional empirical equations still has the problem\nof low accuracy, although various correction equations have been introduced\nlater, the accuracy has always been unsatisfactory. By introducing machine\nlearning and deep learning, it is possible to simultaneously solve prediction\nproblems with low accuracy of empirical equations and complex conditions. Based\non the MagNet database, through the training of the newly proposed MNN, it is\nfound that a single model is sufficient to make predictions for at least four\ndifferent materials under varying temperatures, frequencies, and waveforms,\nwith accuracy far exceeding that of traditional models. At the same time, we\nalso used three other machine learning and deep learning models (Random Forest,\nXGBoost, MLP-LSTM) for training, all of which had much higher accuracy than\ntraditional models. On the basis of the predicted results, a hybrid model\ncombining MNN and XGBoost was proposed, which predicted through weighting and\nfound that the accuracy could continue to improve. This provides a solution for\nmodeling magnetic core loss under different materials and operating modes.",

For scalar\nperturbations, instabilities arise when this ratio exceeds $1.0$, with the\nthreshold value of $1.0$ itself included. In the case of axial perturbations,\nthe onset of instability occurs at smaller ratios, reflecting the impact of\ngravitational waves on the wormhole's stability. The findings suggest that the\nwormhole remains stable when the throat size significantly exceeds the\nSchwarzschild radius.

    "abstract": "Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to\ncomplex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization\nhave yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of\nrobotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot\noperation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as\naction-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we\nposit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more\neffective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that\ndirectly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In\nparticular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level\nVLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot\nend-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The\nintermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level,\n3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates\nthe high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the\nlow-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with\nthe hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant\ndomain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing\nscenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances\nand task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average\nof 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of\ngeneralization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

We used dense grids of\npre-computed stellar models to fit the data for the triply eclipsing systems\nwith a modified version of the SCEPtER pipeline.

For this last\nsystem we tested alternative scenarios for convective core overshooting. When\nall stars were assumed to have the same overshooting efficiency, significant\ndiscrepancies arose with the observed data for the tertiary star. This\ndiscrepancy may arise from the different assumptions regarding overshooting\nefficiency made for the observational characterisation of the system, in which\nan increasing overshooting efficiency with stellar mass was adopted. By\nallowing independent overshooting efficiencies for all stars, we recovered a\nsolution close to that adopted in the system observational characterisation.\nEncouragingly, despite the relevant differences between the adopted stellar\nmodels and those used for the observational characterisation, we found a system\nage of $2.33^{+0.18}_{-0.16}$ Gyr in all the tested scenarios, and this age is\nin agreement with independent determinations.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the dynamic reinsurance design problem under the\nmean-variance criterion, incorporating heterogeneous beliefs between the\ninsurer and the reinsurer, and introducing an incentive compatibility\nconstraint to address moral hazard. The insurer's surplus process is modeled\nusing the classical Cram\\'er-Lundberg risk model, with the option to invest in\na risk-free asset. To solve the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system,\nwe apply the partitioned domain optimization technique, transforming the\ninfinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one\ndetermined by several key parameters. The resulting optimal reinsurance\ncontracts are more complex than the standard proportional and excess-of-loss\ncontracts commonly studied in the mean-variance literature with homogeneous\nbeliefs. By further assuming specific forms of belief heterogeneity, we derive\nthe parametric solutions and obtain a clear optimal equilibrium solution.\nFinally, we compare our results with models where the insurer and reinsurer\nshare identical beliefs or where the incentive compatibility constraint is\nrelaxed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact of belief\nheterogeneity on optimal reinsurance strategies.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) methods have shown great promise in\nhandling data-scarce scenarios, particularly in medical image segmentation\ntasks. However, most existing FSS architectures lack sufficient\ninterpretability and fail to fully incorporate the underlying physical\nstructures of semantic regions. To address these issues, in this paper, we\npropose a novel deep unfolding network, called the Learned Mumford-Shah Network\n(LMS-Net), for the FSS task. Specifically, motivated by the effectiveness of\npixel-to-prototype comparison in prototypical FSS methods and the capability of\ndeep priors to model complex spatial structures, we leverage our learned\nMumford-Shah model (LMS model) as a mathematical foundation to integrate these\ninsights into a unified framework. By reformulating the LMS model into\nprototype update and mask update tasks, we propose an alternating optimization\nalgorithm to solve it efficiently. Further, the iterative steps of this\nalgorithm are unfolded into corresponding network modules, resulting in LMS-Net\nwith clear interpretability. Comprehensive experiments on three publicly\navailable medical segmentation datasets verify the effectiveness of our method,\ndemonstrating superior accuracy and robustness in handling complex structures\nand adapting to challenging segmentation scenarios. These results highlight the\npotential of LMS-Net to advance FSS in medical imaging applications. Our code\nwill be available at: https://github.com/SDZhang01/LMSNet",

First, DSGC introduces Violation Sign-Refine to\ndenoise the signed network by correcting noisy edges with high-order neighbor\ninformation. Subsequently, Density-based Augmentation enhances semantic\nstructures by adding positive edges within clusters and negative edges across\nclusters, following \\textit{Weak Balance} principles. The framework then\nutilizes \\textit{Weak Balance} principles to develop clustering-oriented signed\nneural networks to broaden cluster boundaries by emphasizing distinctions\nbetween negatively linked nodes.

To\naddress this limitation, this paper introduces decision-focused generative\nlearning (Gen-DFL), a novel framework that leverages generative models to\nadaptively model uncertainty and improve decision quality.

This can limit the model's\nability to capture the essence of certain actions that are contextually rich\nand continuous. Humans are capable of mapping visual concepts, object view\ninvariance, and semantic attributes available in static instances to comprehend\nnatural dynamic scenes or videos. Existing MAEs for videos and static images\nrely on separate datasets for videos and images, which may lack the rich\nsemantic attributes necessary for fully understanding the learned concepts,\nespecially when compared to using video and corresponding sampled frame images\ntogether. To this end, we propose CrossVideoMAE an end-to-end self-supervised\ncross-modal contrastive learning MAE that effectively learns both video-level\nand frame-level rich spatiotemporal representations and semantic attributes.\nOur method integrates mutual spatiotemporal information from videos with\nspatial information from sampled frames within a feature-invariant space, while\nencouraging invariance to augmentations within the video domain. This objective\nis achieved through jointly embedding features of visible tokens and combining\nfeature correspondence within and across modalities, which is critical for\nacquiring rich, label-free guiding signals from both video and frame image\nmodalities in a self-supervised manner.

Tumor heterogeneity is estimated using normalized\nentropy, with a threshold to classify tumors as having high or low\nheterogeneity.

Traditional Multi-agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks like centralized training\ndecentralized execution (CTDE) struggle with scalability and flexibility.

To\naddress decentralized multi-agent cooperation, we propose Decentralized\nAdaptive Knowledge Graph Memory and Structured Communication System (DAMCS) in\na novel Multi-agent Crafter environment. Our generative agents, powered by\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), are more scalable than traditional MARL agents by\nleveraging external knowledge and language for long-term planning and\nreasoning. Instead of fully sharing information from all past experiences,\nDAMCS introduces a multi-modal memory system organized as a hierarchical\nknowledge graph and a structured communication protocol to optimize agent\ncooperation. This allows agents to reason from past interactions and share\nrelevant information efficiently. Experiments on novel multi-agent open-world\ntasks show that DAMCS outperforms both MARL and LLM baselines in task\nefficiency and collaboration.

    "abstract": "Magnetic data inversion is an important tool in geophysics, used to infer\nsubsurface magnetic susceptibility distributions from surface magnetic field\nmeasurements. This inverse problem is inherently ill-posed, characterized by\nnon-unique solutions, depth ambiguity, and sensitivity to noise. Traditional\ninversion approaches rely on predefined regularization techniques to stabilize\nsolutions, limiting their adaptability to complex or diverse geological\nscenarios. In this study, we propose an approach that integrates variable\ndictionary learning and scale-space methods to address these challenges. Our\nmethod employs learned dictionaries, allowing for adaptive representation of\ncomplex subsurface features that are difficult to capture with predefined\nbases. Additionally, we extend classical variational inversion by incorporating\nmulti-scale representations through a scale-space framework, enabling the\nprogressive introduction of structural detail while mitigating overfitting. We\nimplement both fixed and dynamic dictionary learning techniques, with the\nlatter introducing iteration-dependent dictionaries for enhanced flexibility.\nUsing a synthetic dataset to simulate geological scenarios, we demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and robustness compared to\nconventional variational and dictionary-based methods. Our results highlight\nthe potential of learned dictionaries, especially when coupled with scale-space\ndynamics, to improve model recovery and noise handling. These findings\nunderscore the promise of our data-driven approach for advance magnetic data\ninversion and its applications in geophysical exploration, environmental\nassessment, and mineral prospecting.

However, fine-tuning these models through\nsupervised learning struggles to achieve robust performance due to limited,\ninconsistent demonstrations, especially in contact-rich environments.

In the\noffline stage, our method integrates behavior cloning and Q-learning to\neffectively extract policy from a small set of demonstrations and stabilize\nvalue estimating. In the online stage, the VLA model is further fine-tuned via\nconsistency policy, with human interventions to ensure safe exploration and\nhigh sample efficiency. We evaluate our approach on eight diverse real-world\nmanipulation tasks. It achieves an average success rate of 96.3% within 45-90\nminutes of online fine-tuning, outperforming prior supervised methods with a\n144% improvement in success rate and 1.9x shorter episode length.

    "abstract": "Despite the success of Gaussian process based Model Predictive Control (MPC)\nin robotic control, its applicability scope is greatly hindered by multimodal\ndisturbances that are prevalent in real-world settings. Here we propose a novel\nMixture of Gaussian Processes based Distributionally Robust MPC (MoGP-DR-MPC)\nframework for linear time invariant systems subject to potentially multimodal\nstate-dependent disturbances. This framework utilizes MoGP to automatically\ndetermine the number of modes from disturbance data. Using the mean and\nvariance information provided by each mode-specific predictive distribution, it\nconstructs a data-driven state-dependent ambiguity set, which allows for\nflexible and fine-grained disturbance modeling. Based on this ambiguity set, we\nimpose Distributionally Robust Conditional Value-at Risk (DR-CVaR) constraints\nto effectively achieve distributional robustness against errors in the\npredictive distributions. To address the computational challenge posed by these\nconstraints in the resulting MPC problem, we equivalently reformulate the\nDR-CVaR constraints into tractable second-order cone constraints. Furthermore,\nwe provide theoretical guarantees on the recursive feasibility and stability of\nthe proposed framework.

For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps,\nthe medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with\nvarious imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light\nimaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a\nsingle imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity.\nRecently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in\novercoming such issues.

In contrast to typical assumptions in related works, the\ntarget in our work is non-cooperative and capable of escaping the circle\ncontainment by boosting its speed to maximum for a short duration. Considering\nthe extreme environment, such as GPS denial, weight limit, and lack of ground\nguidance, two agents can only rely on their onboard single-modality perception\ntools to measure the distances to the target. The distance measurement allows\nfor creating a position estimator by providing a target position-dependent\nvariable. Furthermore, the construction of the unique distributed\nanti-synchronization controller (DASC) can guarantee that the two agents track\nand encircle the target swiftly. The convergence of the estimator and\ncontroller is rigorously evaluated using the Lyapunov technique.

Our algorithms\nmaximize the sum of the value function and a mutual information term that\nencourages exploration of the unknown environment (which quantifies the\ninformation gained about the environment through observed human feedback data).\nTo tackle the challenge of large state spaces and improve sample efficiency, we\nconstruct a simplified \\emph{surrogate environment} and introduce a novel\ndistance measure (named the \\emph{$\\ell_g$-distance}), enabling our IDS-based\nalgorithm to achieve a Bayesian regret upper bound of order\n$O(H^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\sqrt{\\log(K(\\epsilon)) T})$, where $H$ is the episode\nlength, $T$ is the number of episode and $K(\\epsilon)$ is related to the\ncovering number of the environment.

However, if the data in ITS is attacked, such as tampering or\nforgery, it will endanger public safety and cause social losses. Therefore,\nthis paper proposes a watermarking that can verify the integrity of copyright\nin response to the needs of ITS, termed ITSmark. ITSmark focuses on functions\nsuch as extracting watermarks, verifying permission, and tracing tampered\nlocations. The scheme uses the copyright information to build the multi-bit\nspace and divides this space into multiple segments. These segments will be\nassigned to tokens. Thus, the next token is determined by its segment which\ncontains the copyright. In this way, the obtained data contains the custom\nwatermark. To ensure the authorization, key parameters are encrypted during\ncopyright embedding to obtain cipher data. Only by possessing the correct\ncipher data and private key, can the user entirely extract the watermark.\nExperiments show that ITSmark surpasses baseline performances in data quality,\nextraction accuracy, and unforgeability. It also shows unique capabilities of\npermission verification and tampered location tracing, which ensures the\nsecurity of extraction and the reliability of copyright verification.\nFurthermore, ITSmark can also customize the watermark embedding position and\nproportion according to user needs, making embedding more flexible.",

A major obstacle is that graphs\nfrom different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies\nleverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual\ndescriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to\ntext-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to\nalign different feature distributions across domains, while generally\nneglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure\nAlignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and\ncross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT).

Specifically, we\nintroduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation\nacross source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain\nadaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific\nprompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and\nfine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain.\nFinally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to\nevaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.",

However, these methods\nconstruct node-to-node relations based on similarity thresholds, so there is a\nproblem that some latent relations are missing. These latent relations are\ncrucial for deep semantic representation of face aging. In this novel, we\npropose a new Latent Relation-Aware Graph Neural Network with Initial and\nDynamic Residual (LRA-GNN) to achieve robust and comprehensive facial\nrepresentation. Specifically, we first construct an initial graph utilizing\nfacial key points as prior knowledge, and then a random walk strategy is\nemployed to the initial graph for obtaining the global structure, both of which\ntogether guide the subsequent effective exploration and comprehensive\nrepresentation. Then LRA-GNN leverages the multi-attention mechanism to capture\nthe latent relations and generates a set of fully connected graphs containing\nrich facial information and complete structure based on the aforementioned\nguidance. To avoid over-smoothing issues for deep feature extraction on the\nfully connected graphs, the deep residual graph convolutional networks are\ncarefully designed, which fuse adaptive initial residuals and dynamic\ndevelopmental residuals to ensure the consistency and diversity of information.\nFinally, to improve the estimation accuracy and generalization ability,\nprogressive reinforcement learning is proposed to optimize the ensemble\nclassification regressor.

This raises the natural question of whether we can learn a\nunified CM for efficient multimodal generation (e.g., text-to-image) and\nunderstanding (e.g., image-to-text). Intuitively, such a model could be\nacquired by applying the consistency distillation (CD) to existing unified\nmultimodal models. However, the key challenge is establishing a unified\ndenoising perspective for both image and text generation, which is essential\nfor establishing the consistency mapping. To tackle this, at the representation\nlevel, we advocate for discrete tokens for both modalities to best preserve\nlanguage modeling capabilities. Critically, instead of defining the text\ndenoising trajectory via recent discrete diffusion language modeling\nprinciples, we specify it using the parallel decoding trace of an\nautoregressive language model, benefiting from the latter's superior\nperformance in general text generation tasks. The denoising trajectory of image\ntokens adheres to standard discrete diffusion. We train our unified consistency\nmodels (UniCMs) on these combined multimodal trajectories simultaneously with a\nunified objective. We introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy to further\nimprove the training convergence. Empirically, in text-to-image generation,\nUniCMs outperform SD3 on GenEval, Image Reward, and CLIP Score metrics, while\nrequiring only approximately ${1}/{8}$ of the sampling time.

It is important to understand the long-term nature of the cost\nof living and quality of life in major economies. A transparent and\ncomprehensive living index must include multiple dimensions of living\nconditions. In this study, we present an approach to quantifying the quality of\nlife through the Global Ease of Living Index that combines various\nsocio-economic and infrastructural factors into a single composite score. Our\nindex utilises economic indicators that define living standards, which could\nhelp in targeted interventions to improve specific areas. We present a machine\nlearning framework for addressing the problem of missing data for some of the\neconomic indicators for specific countries. We then curate and update the data\nand use a dimensionality reduction approach (principal component analysis) to\ncreate the Ease of Living Index for major economies since 1970. Our work\nsignificantly adds to the literature by offering a practical tool for\npolicymakers to identify areas needing improvement, such as healthcare systems,\nemployment opportunities, and public safety.

It has been\nsuggested that pre-supernova stars in the oxygen and silicon burning stages\nwould emit enough MeV neutrinos to be detectable on Earth, provided they are in\nthe local universe. In this study, we investigate the prospect of detecting\nneutrinos from red supergiants (RSGs) in the carbon-burning phase. In our\nGalaxy, around a thousand RSGs have been cataloged, and several are expected to\nbe in the carbon-burning phase. We first calculate the luminosity and energy\nspectrum of neutrinos emitted during the post-main-sequence evolution of\nmassive stars. For a nearby carbon-burning RSG located $\\sim200$ pc away, we\nestimate the neutrino flux reaching Earth to be as large as $\\sim10^5$\ncm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ with a spectrum peaking $\\sim0.6$ MeV. We then assess the\nfeasibility of detecting these neutrinos in underground facilities,\nparticularly in hybrid detectors equipped with water-based liquid scintillator\nand ultra-fast photodetectors. In detectors with a volume comparable to\nSuper-Kamiokande, for the above flux, we anticipate up to $\\sim50$ neutrino\nevents per year with directional information.

    "abstract": "Laser frequency combs (LFCs) are an important component of Doppler radial\nvelocity (RV) spectroscopy that pushes fractional precision to the $10^{-10}$\nlevel, as required to identify and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. However,\nlarge intensity variations across the LFC spectrum that arise in nonlinear\nbroadening limit the range of comb lines that can be used for optimal\nwavelength calibration with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore,\ntemporal spectral-intensity fluctuations of the LFC, that are coupled to\nflux-dependent detector defects, alter the instrumental point spread function\n(PSF) and result in spurious RV shifts. To address these issues and improve\ncalibration precision, spectral flattening is crucial for LFCs to maintain a\nconstant photon flux per comb mode. In this work, we demonstrate a dynamic\nspectral shaping setup using a spatial light modulator (SLM) over the\nwavelength range of 800nm to 1300nm. The custom shaping compensates for\namplitude fluctuations in real time and can also correct for\nwavelength-dependent spectrograph transmission, achieving a spectral profile\nthat delivers the constant readout necessary for maximizing precision.\nImportantly, we characterize the out-of-loop properties of the spectral\nflattener to verify a twofold improvement in spectral stability. This\ntechnique, combined with our approach of pumping the waveguide spectral\nbroadener out-of-band at 1550 nm, reduces the required dynamic range. While\nthis spectral region is tailored for the LFC employed at the Habitable-zone\nPlanet Finder (HPF) spectrograph, the method is broadly applicable to any LFC\nused for astronomical spectrograph calibration.",

A key challenge arises when demonstrations are temporally\nmisaligned due to variations in timing, differences in embodiment, or\ninconsistencies in execution. Existing approaches treat imitation as a\ndistribution-matching problem, aligning individual frames between the agent and\nthe demonstration. However, we show that such frame-level matching fails to\nenforce temporal ordering or ensure consistent progress. Our key insight is\nthat matching should instead be defined at the level of sequences. We propose\nthat perfect matching occurs when one sequence successfully covers all the\nsubgoals in the same order as the other sequence. We present ORCA (ORdered\nCoverage Alignment), a dense per-timestep reward function that measures the\nprobability of the agent covering demonstration frames in the correct order. On\ntemporally misaligned demonstrations, we show that agents trained with the ORCA\nreward achieve $4.5$x improvement ($0.11 \\rightarrow 0.50$ average normalized\nreturns) for Meta-world tasks and $6.6$x improvement ($6.55 \\rightarrow 43.3$\naverage returns) for Humanoid-v4 tasks compared to the best frame-level\nmatching algorithms.

    "abstract": "Spoken language understanding research to date has generally carried a heavy\ntext perspective. Most datasets are derived from text, which is then\nsubsequently synthesized into speech, and most models typically rely on\nautomatic transcriptions of speech. This is to the detriment of\nprosody--additional information carried by the speech signal beyond the\nphonetics of the words themselves and difficult to recover from text alone. In\nthis work, we investigate the role of prosody in Spoken Question Answering. By\nisolating prosodic and lexical information on the SLUE-SQA-5 dataset, which\nconsists of natural speech, we demonstrate that models trained on prosodic\ninformation alone can perform reasonably well by utilizing prosodic cues.\nHowever, we find that when lexical information is available, models tend to\npredominantly rely on it. Our findings suggest that while prosodic cues provide\nvaluable supplementary information, more effective integration methods are\nrequired to ensure prosody contributes more significantly alongside lexical\nfeatures.",

    "abstract": "We present a modular DNA origami design approach to address the challenges of\nassembling geometrically complex nanoscale structures, including those with\nnonuniform Gaussian curvature. This approach features a core structure that\ncompletely conserves the scaffold routing across different designs and\npreserves more than 70% of the DNA staples between designs, dramatically\nreducing both cost and effort, while enabling precise and independent\nprogramming of subunit interactions and binding angles through adjustable\noverhang lengths and sequences. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, gel\nelectrophoresis, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we validate\na set of robust design rules. We demonstrate the method's utility by assembling\na variety of self-limiting structures, including anisotropic shells with\ncontrolled inter-subunit interactions and curvature, and a toroid with globally\nvarying curvature. Our strategy is both cost-effective and versatile, providing\na promising and efficient solution for the synthetic fabrication of complex\nnanostructures.",

    "abstract": "Artistic style transfer aims to use a style image and a content image to\nsynthesize a target image that retains the same artistic expression as the\nstyle image while preserving the basic content of the content image. Many\nrecently proposed style transfer methods have a common problem; that is, they\nsimply transfer the texture and color of the style image to the global\nstructure of the content image. As a result, the content image has a local\nstructure that is not similar to the local structure of the style image. In\nthis paper, we present an effective method that can be used to transfer style\npatterns while fusing the local style structure into the local content\nstructure. In our method, dif-ferent levels of coarse stylized features are\nfirst reconstructed at low resolution using a Coarse Network, in which style\ncolor distribution is roughly transferred, and the content structure is\ncombined with the style structure. Then, the reconstructed features and the\ncontent features are adopted to synthesize high-quality structure-aware\nstylized images with high resolution using a Fine Network with three structural\nselective fusion (SSF) modules. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated\nthrough the generation of appealing high-quality stylization results and a\ncom-parison with some state-of-the-art style transfer methods.",

For this, we\nuse both a hybrid approach combining configuration interaction (CI) with\ncoupled-cluster (CC) method and a pure CI calculation for the complete\n16-electron system, ensuring convergence. The resulting very small theoretical\nuncertainty of only 0.05\\% allowed us to find the transition experimentally in\na few hours, yielding an energy of 20078.984(10) cm$^{-1}$. This level of\nagreement for a 16-electron system is unprecedented and qualifies our method\nfor future calculations of many other complex atomic systems. While paving the\nway for a high-precision optical clock based on Ni$^{12+}$, our theory and code\ndevelopment will also enable better predictions for other highly charged ions\nand other complex atomic systems.",

    "abstract": "Offline algorithms for Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (RLHF),\nwhich use only a fixed dataset of sampled responses given an input, and\npreference feedback among these responses, have gained increasing prominence in\nthe literature on aligning language models. In this paper, we study how the\ndifferent design choices made in methods such as DPO, IPO, SLiC and many\nvariants influence the quality of the learned policy, from a theoretical\nperspective. Our treatment yields insights into the choices of loss function,\nthe policy which is used to normalize log-likelihoods, and also the role of the\ndata sampling policy. Notably, our results do not rely on the standard\nreparameterization-style arguments used to motivate some of the algorithms in\nthis family, which allows us to give a unified treatment to a broad class of\nmethods. We also conduct a small empirical study to verify some of the\ntheoretical findings on a standard summarization benchmark.",
