    "abstract": "We consider time varying MIMO fading channels with known spatial and temporal\ncorrelation and solve the problem of joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and\nchannel estimation with prior distributions. The maximum a posteriori\nprobability (MAP) joint estimation is proved to be equivalent to a separate MAP\nestimation of the CFO followed by minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation\nof the channel while treating the estimated CFO as true. The MAP solution is\nuseful to take advantage of the estimates from the previous data packet. A low\ncomplexity universal CFO estimation algorithm is extended from the time\ninvariant case to the time varying case. Unlike past algorithms, the universal\nalgorithm does not need phase unwrapping to take advantage of the full range of\nsymbol correlation and achieves the derived Bayesian Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound\n(BCRLB) in almost all SNR range. We provide insight on the the relation among\nthe temporal correlation coefficient of the fading, the CFO estimation\nperformance, and the pilot signal structure. An unexpected observation is that\nthe BCRLB is not a monotone function of the temporal correlation and is\nstrongly influenced by the pilot signal structures. A simple rearrangement of\nthe 0's and 1's in the pilot signal matrix will render the BCRLB from being\nnon-monotone to being monotone in certain temporal correlation ranges. Since\nthe BCRLB is shown to be achieved by the proposed algorithm, it provides a\nguideline for pilot signal design.",

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for\nhealthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user\nvariability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and\nphysiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.\nConventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific\npatterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain\ngeneralization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal\ndependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose\nTemporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a\nnovel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential\ndecision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a\nTransformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that\ncapture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective\nreward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key\ninnovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)\nautoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a\nlabel-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.\nEvaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses\nstate-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior\naccuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant\ntemporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating\nadvancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and\ncontext-aware environments.",

Recent advances in natural language\nprocessing and language models (LMs) hold the promise of significant automation\nof identifying place name origins due to their powerful capability to exploit\nthe semantics of the stored documents. This chapter presents a retrieval\naugmented generation pipeline designed to search for place name origins over a\nbroad knowledge base, DBpedia.

Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for\neach attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple\nattributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,\npreventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this\nchallenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation\nto enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,\nCompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to\ncontrol multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel\ndisentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes\nwhile maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider\noperates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require\nretraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both\ntraining and inference.

    "abstract": "We present the stellar dynamical mass of the central black hole in the nearby\nSeyfert galaxy MCG$-$06-30-15 using the Schwarzschild orbit-superposition\nmethod implemented in the open-source code FORSTAND. We obtained spatially\nresolved $K$-band nuclear stellar spectra for this galaxy with SINFONI on the\nVLT. We extracted the bulk stellar kinematics using Gauss$-$Hermite (GH)\nparameterization of the line-of-sight velocity distributions. A multicomponent\nsurface brightness profile of the galaxy was determined from an $HST$\nmedium-band $V$ image. Our best-fit models indicate a black hole mass of\n$M_{BH}=(4.4\\pm1.4) \\times 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ and a stellar mass-to-light ratio of\n$M/L$=($3.0\\pm0.3$) $M_{\\odot}$/$L_{\\odot}$, within 1$\\sigma$ confidence\nintervals. Our constraint on $M_{BH}$ agrees with an upper limit on the mass\nfrom stellar dynamics based on the Jeans Anisotropic Method, but is $\\sim$10\ntimes larger than the reported mass from reverberation mapping. However, our\nbest-fit $M_{BH}$ may be systematically biased high due to the counter-rotating\ndisk in the nucleus of MCG$-$06-30-15 and the inability of the GH\nparameterization to fully describe such a complicated set of stellar\nkinematics. In addition, a dynamical $M_{BH}$ value depends heavily on the\nassumed source distance, which is not yet accurately constrained for this\ngalaxy. MCG$-$06-30-15 is only the fourth galaxy in which we can compare\n$M_{BH}$ from stellar dynamical modeling with that from reverberation mapping.\nA direct comparison of $M_{BH}$ allows us to identify and investigate the\npossible sources of bias associated with different mass measurement techniques,\nwhich may influence our understanding of black hole and galaxy coevolution\nacross cosmological timescales.",

In this highly saturated environment, communication has emerged as the\nmost central form of interaction, supported by a rapidly evolving technical\ninfrastructure. These new communication tools have created an overwhelming\nsurplus of information so much so that no human could process it all. In\nresponse, platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Google use algorithms to filter\nand suggest content. These algorithms act as sorting mechanisms, reducing the\ninformational noise and presenting users with content tailored to their habits\nand preferences. However, by placing themselves between users and data, these\nplatforms gain control over what users see and, in doing so, shape their\npreferences and behaviors. In physical terms, we might say they function like\nselective filters or control gates in an information system directing flows and\ncreating feedback loops. Over time, this can lead to a kind of informational\ninertia, where users become increasingly shaped by algorithmic influence and\nlose the ability to form independent judgments. This process reflects a broader\ntrend that Bernard Stiegler describes as a new kind of proletarianization where\nindividuals lose the knowledge and skills that are absorbed and automated by\ndigital systems. Borrowing from physics, we study this as a shift toward higher\nentropy. However, platforms like Wikipedia and arXiv demonstrate how digital\ntools can support collective knowledge without leading to cognitive\ndegradation. Inspired by Elinor Ostrom work on commons, we propose a model for\na digital commons economy where information is shared and governed\ncollaboratively, helping to restore a balance between entropy and organization\nin our digital environments.",

Due to this and the large redundancy in many data lakes (which can\ncontain many copies and versions of the same table), the most unionable tables\nmay be identical or nearly identical to the query table and may contain little\nnew information.

We perform an extensive experimental analysis of\nwell-known diversity algorithms applied to this novel problem and identify a\ngap that we address with a novel, clustering-based tuple diversity algorithm\ncalled DUST. DUST uses a novel embedding model to represent unionable tuples\nthat outperforms other tuple representation models by at least 15 % when\nrepresenting unionable tuples.

The present\nstudy employs a hybrid framework combining quantum and classical computing\nleveraging the strengths of QML and QI, without the penalty of quantum hardware\navailability. This is particularized for the optimization of the Quality of\nExperience (QoE) over cellular networks. The framework comprises an estimator\nfor obtaining the expected QoE based on user metrics, service settings, and\ncell configuration, and an optimizer that uses the estimation to choose the\nbest cell and service configuration. Although the approach is applicable to any\nQoE-based network management, its implementation is particularized for the\noptimization of network configurations for Cloud Gaming services. Then, it is\nevaluated via performance metrics such as accuracy and model loading and\ninference times for the estimator, and time to solution and solution score for\nthe optimizer. The results indicate that QML models achieve similar or superior\naccuracy to classical ML models for estimation, while decreasing inference and\nloading times.

In this paper, we introduce REConnect that\nre-centers RE on the human connection as central to the understanding of lived\nexperiences where impact is sought. REConnect advocates for a human-centered\nparticipatory approach \"that matters\" to the communities and beneficiaries\ninvolved, ensuring alignment with their values and aspirations. Drawing on\nthree case studies of societal impact: BloodSync in rural Nepal, Herluma\nsupporting women at risk of homelessness in Canada, and BridgingRoots to\nrevitalize Indigenous languages in the Canadian Arctic. REConnect argues that\nthree key principles and enablers: building trusting relationships,\nco-designing with and alongside stakeholders, and empowering users as agents of\nchange, can yield requirements that are culturally grounded, socially\nlegitimate, and sustainable beyond system delivery. REConnect also proposes a\nset of actionable practices (REActions) that embed relationality and ongoing\nstakeholder engagement throughout requirements elicitation, analysis, and\nvalidation of solution development. Finally, we situate REConnect in the era of\nGenerative AI.

    "abstract": "Understanding change over time within dyads, such as mentor-mentee or\ntherapist-client pairs, poses unique challenges, particularly in studies with\nsmall samples and distinguishable roles. This paper introduces a flexible\nhybrid longitudinal modeling that integrates features of the Actor-Partner\nInterdependence Model (APIM) and the Common Fate Growth Model (CFGM) to\nsimultaneously estimate individual-level and shared dyad-level effects. Using a\nhypothetical peer-mentoring example (novices paired with experts), the model\naddresses three key issues: (1) how the interpretation of model parameters when\nrole is dummy-coded versus effect-coded; (2) how model performance is affected\nby small sample sizes; and (3) how results differ between Maximum Likelihood\n(ML) and Bayesian estimation. Simulated data for 50 dyads across five time\npoints are analyzed, with subsampling at 30 and 5 dyads. Models are estimated\nin a multilevel modeling framework using R (lme4 for ML and brms for Bayesian\ninference). Results show that dummy and effect coding reflect distinct\ninterpretations: dummy coding expresses effects relative to a reference group,\nwhereas effect coding centers parameters on the grand mean across roles.\nAlthough model fit remains unchanged, the choice of coding impacts how\ngroup-level effects and interactions are interpreted. Very small samples (e.g.,\n5 dyads) lead to unstable estimates, whereas Bayesian credible intervals more\naccurately reflect uncertainty in such cases. In larger samples, ML and\nBayesian estimates converge. This APIM-CFGM hybrid offers a practical tool for\nresearchers analyzing longitudinal dyadic data with distinguishable roles and\nsmaller sample sizes.",

The online decentralized federated\nlearning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,\nsuch as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data\ndistribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in\nreal-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine\nclients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only\nwhen the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of\nclients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients\nwithin a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is\npossible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'\nbehavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to\nachieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.\nTherefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated\nmulti-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency\nwhen the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.\nOur proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the\nreceived signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a\ntrust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.\nOur simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a\nByzantine-free setting.",

This paper proposes a\nhybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and\ngraph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic\ndocument embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to\ncapture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The\nembeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings\nof documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the\ncombined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only\nor graph-only embeddings.

Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative\napproach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic\nmodeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the\nquality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the\nchosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic\nrecommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more\ncomprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of\ncluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance\nlegal relevance and trustworthiness.

This challenge is compounded\nby two persistent and intertwined factors: the language's vast dialectal\ndiversity and the prevalence of acoustic noise in real-world environments.\nWhile state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models have advanced ASR\nfor low-resource languages, they often lack explicit mechanisms to handle\nenvironmental noise during pre-training or specialized adaptation strategies\nfor the complex phonetic and lexical variations across Bengali dialects. This\npaper introduces a novel, unified framework designed to address these dual\nchallenges simultaneously. Our approach is founded on the WavLM model, which is\nuniquely pre-trained with a masked speech denoising objective, making it\ninherently robust to acoustic distortions. We propose a specialized multi-stage\nfine-tuning strategy that first adapts the model to general-domain standard\nBengali to establish a strong linguistic foundation and subsequently\nspecializes it for noise-robust dialectal recognition through targeted data\naugmentation. The framework is rigorously evaluated on a comprehensive\nbenchmark comprising multiple Bengali dialects under a wide range of simulated\nnoisy conditions, from clean audio to low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly\noutperforms strong baselines, including standard fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 and the\nlarge-scale multilingual Whisper model.

We delve into the diverse architectural patterns\nand interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate\nframeworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.\nFurthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse\napplication domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,\nincluding scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized\nsystems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research\nquestions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to\nprovide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.",

The system utilizes a low-cost sound sensor integrated with\nGPS-enabled modules to collect geotagged noise data at one-second intervals.\nThe sound nodes are calibrated against a reference sound level meter in a\nlaboratory setting to ensure accuracy using various machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms, such as Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression\n(MLR), Polynomial Regression (PR), Segmented Regression (SR), Support Vector\nRegression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While\nlaboratory calibration demonstrates high accuracy, it is shown that the\nperformance of the nodes degrades during data collection in a moving vehicle.\nTo address this, it is demonstrated that the calibration must be performed on\nthe IoT-based node based on the data collected in a moving environment along\nwith the reference device. Among the employed ML models, RFR achieved the best\nperformance with an R2 of 0.937 and RMSE of 1.09 for mobile calibration.

In this work, we therefore explore the quantization of\nTeukolsky scalars on Kerr.

The reconstruction scheme for the\nmetric perturbation allows us to keep track of the physical subalgebra.

Prior art has mainly focused\non reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level\nbehaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query\nconstraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a\nconstrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a\nfunctional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i)\nreconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under\n10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits,\nthen (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with\nvarying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer\nstudent recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry,\nwith only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood\n(NLL).

This approach diverges from\nreasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),\nand Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General\nSymbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:\ntool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary\nperformance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.\nNotably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66% on Livecodebench v6, 89% on\nInstruction-Following Evals, and 24.4% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an agentic\ncoding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which achieves\na state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3% on SWE-Bench Lite. We are able to achieve\nthese improvements without any fine-tuning or training costs. Our Reasoning\nLayer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift, ensuring that a model's\naccuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively impacted. We argue that\nincumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing returns in LLM\nperformance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques. This\ntechnical report details our approach at a high level and the availability of\nthe CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.",

However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by\nprocessing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies\napply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density\namong different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate\nrepresentation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and\nunnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we\npropose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a\nlightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft\ncaption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic\ndensity-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary\nfor downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios\nbased on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics\nhow humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)\nelicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler\nscenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our\nmethod reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive\nperformance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach\nadaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.",

As the biological samples are prone to electron damage, the samples can\nbe exposed to only a limited dosage of electrons, leading to noisy and\nincomplete measurements. Thus, the reconstructions are noisy and incomplete,\nleading to the missing wedge problem. Currently, self-supervised learning is\nused to compensate for this issue.

Contrails\nevolve through distinct stages, from formation and rapid growth to dissipation\nor transition into cirrus clouds, where the latter phase critically determines\ntheir radiative forcing. This long-term evolution is primarily driven by\nadvection-diffusion processes coupled with ice-particle growth dynamics.

The Eulerian model is solved using a recently\nproposed discretization approach to enhance both accuracy and computational\nefficiency. Additionally, the Eulerian model introduces several theoretical,\nadjustable parameters that can be calibrated using ground-truth data to\noptimize the built-in nonlinear advection-diffusion equations (ADEs). We\nfurther demonstrate that the governing nonlinear ADEs admit dimensional\nseparability under suitable assumptions, making the multi-physics Eulerian\nmodel particularly promising for large-scale simulations of contrail plumes\nand, ultimately, their associated radiative forcing.",

It was realized very soon\nthat a consistent picture of quantum electrodynamics (QED) requires the\nquantization of not just the electromagnetic field ${\\bf A}({\\bf r},t)$, but\nthe electron field ${\\bf \\psi}({\\bf r},t)$ as well. The electron field is now a\nDirac spinor field and it becomes a major partner for the vector potential.\nTogether these two fields form a duet which yearns for a unification which is\nnot often emphasized in text books, but no one knows how to do this yet. The\nunderlying structure appears to be a super-symmetric one where bosons and\nfermions live comfortably as a single field that could by some yet unknown\nprocess produce QED. This area is still at the forefront of current research\nwith names like Super-symmetric Quantum Electrodynamics (SQED), strings and\nothers. Ironically for a variety of reasons, the number of fields in SQED has\nto be increased and not decreased, defying the objective of an economical\nunification. Furthermore it is now known that Maxwell's theory is incomplete\nand that there are situations due to boundaries or topology that demand the\nvector potential must itself be gauge invariant.\n  (This paper is dedicated to the celebration of 100 years of quantum\nmechanics, on the anniversary of Heisenberg's founding paper on the subject in\nJuly 1925, delivered by Miguel Ortu\\~no at the IQSA 2025 Conference at Tropea\nin Calabria, Italy from 30 June to 4th July 2025.

    "abstract": "Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses\nfixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.\nThese static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which\ncan limit the overall performance of the model.\n  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that\nperiodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the\nclass-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1\nscores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to\nbe performed.\n  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and\noutlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to\nincrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that\nbetter aligns with the optimization objective.\n  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast\ndataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and\nalgorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique\n(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well\nas multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.\n  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On\ntabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests\n(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to\ntraining on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average\nof 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing\nmethods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the\nstrongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.",

We show\nthe comparison map is injective for any finite $p$-group and furthermore, an\nopen immersion when the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian. For elementary\nabelian $p$-groups, the twisted cohomology ring coincides with Balmer and\nGallauer's original construction.\n  To perform this construction, we utilize endotrivial complexes (i.e. the\ninvertible objects of the derived category of permutation modules) arising up\nto a shift from Bredon homology of representation spheres. This topological\nstructure allows us to construct certain $p$-local isomorphisms, from which we\nbuild a refined open cover of the Balmer spectrum indexed by conjugacy classes\nof subgroups of $G$. Under this open cover, every endotrivial is isomorphic to\na shift of the tensor unit in each localization, thus verifying that all\nendotrivials are line bundles.

AT 2024wpp is the most\nluminous LFBOT discovered to date, with $L_{\\rm{pk}}\\approx(2-4)\\times10^{45}$\nerg s$^{-1}$ (5-10 times that of the prototypical AT 2018cow). This extreme\nluminosity enabled the acquisition of the most detailed LFBOT UV light curve\nthus far. In the first ~45 d, AT 2024wpp radiated $>10^{51}$ erg, surpassing AT\n2018cow by an order of magnitude and requiring a power source beyond the\nradioactive $^{56}$Ni decay of traditional supernovae. Like AT 2018cow, the\nUV-optical spectrum of AT 2024wpp is dominated by a persistently blue thermal\ncontinuum throughout our monitoring, with blackbody parameters at peak of\nT>30,000 K and $R_{\\rm{BB}}/t\\approx0.2-0.3c$. A temperature of $\\gtrsim$20,000\nK is maintained thereafter without evidence for cooling. We interpret the\nfeatureless spectra as a consequence of continuous energy injection from a\ncentral source of high-energy emission which maintains high ejecta ionization.\nAfter 35 d, faint (equivalent width <10 {\\AA}) H and He spectral features with\nkinematically separate velocity components centered at 0 km s$^{-1}$ and -6400\nkm s$^{-1}$ emerge, implying spherical symmetry deviations. A near-infrared\nexcess of emission above the optical blackbody emerges between 20-30 d with a\npower-law spectrum $F_{\\rm\\nu,NIR}\\propto\\nu^{-0.3}$ at 30 d. We interpret this\ndistinct emission component as either reprocessing of early UV emission in a\ndust echo or free-free emission in an extended medium above the optical\nphotosphere. LFBOT asphericity and multiple outflow components (including\nmildly relativistic ejecta) together with the large radiated energy are\nnaturally realized by super-Eddington accretion disks around neutron stars or\nblack holes and their outflows.",

    "abstract": "To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining\nBIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare\ntheir performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language\nmodels in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions.\nIn this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with\npathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three\ncenters in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features\nwere extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram\nintegrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three\nradiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently\ninterpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for\nbiopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in\ninternal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused\nnomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and\nmalignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three\nradiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two\ntasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was\nsignificantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and\nboth ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction.\nExternal validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different\nultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric\nnomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in\nguiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable,\nexternally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies\nand enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.",

To\nbetter understand the many-body normal state from which superconductivity\narises, it is important to ascertain the nature and role of correlations in its\nelectronic structure. To provide insights into this question, we use a fully\ncharge self-consistent DFT+e-DMFT (eDMFT) approach to study La327 at several\ncompressive strain levels. At the strain level where superconductivity has been\nobserved experimentally (-2\\%), in contrast with DFT and DFT+$U$ results, the\nso-called $\\gamma$ pocket emerges and the associated band, of mostly $d_{z^2}$\ncharacter, crosses the Fermi level exhibiting `flat band''-like features when\ndynamical correlations are included.

Here we highlight some of the challenges that remain to be addressed\nto understand retinal processing of natural stimuli and describe emerging\nresearch avenues to overcome them.\n  A key issue is model complexity. When complexifying the probing stimuli\ntowards natural stimuli, the number of parameters required in models of retinal\ncomputations increases, raising issues of overfitting, generalization, and\ninterpretability. This increase in complexity is also a challenge for normative\napproaches as it makes it difficult to derive non-linear retinal computations\nfrom simple principles.\n  We describe two types of approaches that may help circumvent this issue in\nthe future. First, we propose that a new form of reductionism is emerging:\ninstead of breaking down natural stimuli into sums of simpler stimuli, it\nbecomes possible to 'divide and conquer' natural scenes into different visual\ninputs corresponding to different visual tasks, in order to study retinal\ncomputations separately for each of these visual tasks. Second, several studies\nsuggest that it will soon be possible to mitigate the issue of complexity, by\n'embodying' the models with more biological constraints, in particularly those\nderived from connectomic studies. Together, these approaches may offer a\npowerful strategy to move beyond current limitations and advance our\nunderstanding of how the retina processes natural visual environments, and\nsuggest approaches that could be used beyond, for other sensory areas.",

    "abstract": "In his paper on Community Detection [1], Fortunato introduced a quality\nfunction called performance to assess the goodness of a graph partition. This\nmeasure counts the number of correctly ``interpreted\" pairs of vertices, i. e.\ntwo vertices belonging to the same community and connected by an edge, or two\nvertices belonging to different communities and not connected by an edge. In\nthis paper, we explore Fortunato's performance measure (fp measure) for\ndetecting communities in unweighted, undirected networks. First, we give a\ngreedy algorithm fpGreed that tries to optimise the fp measure by working\niteratively at two-levels, vertex-level and community-level. At the vertex\nlevel, a vertex joins a community only if the fp value improves. Once this is\ndone, an initial set of communities are obtained. At the next stage, two\ncommunities merge only if the fp measure improves. Once there are no further\nimprovements to be made, the algorithm switches back to the vertex level and so\non. fpGreed terminates when there are no changes to any community. We then\npresent a faster heuristic algorithm fastFp more suitable for running on large\ndatasets. We present the quality of the communities and the time it takes to\ncompute them on several well-known datasets. For some of the large datasets,\nsuch as youtube and livejournal, we find that Algorithm fastFP performs really\nwell, both in terms of the time and the quality of the solution obtained.",

Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window\nattention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized\noperations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,\nthese methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their\ninability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT\n(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid\narchitecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and\napplies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token\nembedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that\nintegrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,\neach token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens\nthat summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity\nof full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory\ncost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT\nincurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate\nremains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We\nanalyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically\non long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba\nand SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same\ncomputational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling\nand common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales.

This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for\nnuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective\nreinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using\nSATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,\nparticularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,\nwe show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially\nimproves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,\nwhile highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation.

SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained\nresponse generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)\nfrom demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably\noutperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of\nstandard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the\nperformance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be\nmitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely\nunnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings\nhighlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the\nimportance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL\nperformance.",

Exemplified by the 15-Minute\nCity, this emerging planning paradigm assumes that spatially proximate\nprovision translates into localised use, yet evidence on actual behaviour\nremains limited. We advance a behaviourally grounded assessment by introducing\nthe K-Visitation framework, which identifies the minimal set of distinct\nvisited places needed to cover essential amenities under two orderings: one\nbased observed visitation frequency ($K_{\\text{freq}}$) and the other based on\nproximity to home ($K_{\\text{dist}}$). Applying it to a 18-month, anonymised\nmobility data from Finland, we directly compare local mobility potentials with\nhabitual destination choices. We find systematic misalignment between proximity\nand behaviour, and this is most pronounced in metropolitan cores--areas\ntraditionally viewed as ideal settings for local living--where residents\nvoluntarily overshoot nearby options, while peripheral routines remain more\nlocally constrained. The misalignment further revealed uneven amenity type\ninfluences, as distance differentials increase from everyday to specialised\namenity. Furthermore, the social consequences of localism are spatially\ncontingent: increased reliance on local options reduces experienced segregation\nin central districts but can exacerbate it elsewhere. The results stress that\nproximity is therefore necessary but insufficient for achieving the proximity\nliving ideal; implementation should be behaviourally informed and\nplace-sensitive, coupling abundant local provision of routine needs with access\nenhancement to specialised amenities to avoid unintended equity trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is one of the most important magnetic energy conversion\nprocesses observed in laboratory and space plasmas. It describes the breaking\nand joining of magnetic field lines, leading to the release of magnetic energy\nand the acceleration of charged particles. Finding regions where fast\nreconnection occurs is key to understanding this process. However, identifying\nsuch reconnection events within a turbulent environment in three dimensions\nremains a challenge. In this work, we develop a new framework for identifying\nmagnetic reconnection using 3D turbulent plasma simulations. First, we apply\nbifurcation lines from fluid visualization to magnetic fields and show that\nthey can be identified with X-lines of magnetic reconnection. For reconnection\nconfigurations with magnetic guide fields, we introduce a novel concept of\nquasi X-lines (QXL). Using the spatial information of X-lines in numerical\nsimulations, we present a local technique to estimate the reconnection rate,\nobtaining a distribution that features a local maximum near the normalized\nvalue 0.1. Additionally, we provide an alternative tool to highlight current\nsheets in turbulent plasma by measuring magnetic shear layers as the second\ninvariant of the shear strain tensor. These methods, avoiding traditional\nreliance on global methods, electric fields and current density, offer a new\nperspective to the quantitative study of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with\ncomplex magnetic field topologies. Validated across various plasma simulation\nmodels, including kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) and resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD), our approach enables efficient exploration of\nmagnetic field dynamics in turbulent plasma environments.",

NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally\nconnected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and\narrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with\na QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the\nscaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with\nthe graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size\ngrowth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential\nadvantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at\nleast polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm\nconsidered relative to the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Within the scope of\nour analyses, we observe that only 4 percent of the 50 considered graph\nfamilies offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20 percent\nof the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we\nobserve and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only\nfare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm\nbut also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial\nadvantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given\nthe limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical\nstudies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families\ninto one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs\nin it.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to\nneural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image\nquality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still\nstruggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time\napplications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based\naccelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting\noperations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical\ntrade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively\nreduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary\nrasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG\ngroups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across\ntiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During\nrasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small\ntiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG\nenables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping\ntiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with\nthe original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is\na lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be\nseamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental\nresults show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over\nstate-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.",

To simulate a realistic\nsearch, we used a search region of orbital parameter space of similar size to\nthe plausible parameter ranges for Sco X-1, but containing the parameters of\neach HW injection. Our self-blinded analysis confidently detected one of the\ninjections. The other, which was generated with a lower amplitude and in a more\nexpensive region of frequency space, was not detected.

To solve the formulated\nnon-convex problem with highly coupled variables, an alternating optimization\n(AO)-based algorithm is introduced by decoupling the original problem into two\nseparate subproblems. Specifically, for the subproblem of designing hybrid\nbeamformers, a semi-closed-form solution for the fully-digital beamformer is\nfirst derived by a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm.\nSubsequently, the digital and analog beamformers are determined by\napproximating the fully-digital beamformer through the manifold optimization\n(MO) technique. For the MA positions design subproblem, we utilize the\nmajorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to iteratively optimize each MA's\nposition while keeping others fixed. Extensive simulation results validate the\nconsiderable benefits of the proposed MA-aided near-field beam focusing\napproach in enhancing security performance compared to the traditional\nfar-field and/or the fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems.

    "abstract": "The unfolding problem in particle physics is to make inferences about the\ntrue particle spectrum based on smeared observations from a detector. This is\nan ill-posed inverse problem, where small changes in the smeared distribution\ncan lead to large fluctuations in the unfolded distribution. The forward\noperator is the response matrix which models the detector response. In\npractice, the forward operator is rarely known analytically and is instead\nestimated using Monte Carlo simulation. This raises the question of how to best\nestimate the response matrix and what impact this estimation has on the\nunfolded solutions. In most analyses at the LHC, response matrix estimation is\ndone by binning the true and smeared events and counting the propagation of\nevents between the bins. However, this approach can result in a noisy estimate\nof the response matrix, especially with a small Monte Carlo sample size.\nUnexpectedly, we also find that the noise in the estimated response matrix can\ninadvertently regularize the problem. As an alternative, we propose to use\nconditional density estimation to estimate the response kernel in the unbinned\nsetting followed by binning this estimator. Using simulation studies, we\ninvestigate the performance of the two approaches.",

A \\emph{distance oracle} is a data structure designed to\nanswer approximate distance queries, with the goal of achieving low stretch,\nefficient space usage, and fast query time. While much of the prior work\nfocused on distance oracles with constant query time, this paper presents a\ncomprehensive study of distance oracles with non-constant query time. We\nexplore the tradeoffs between space, stretch, and query time of distance\noracles in various regimes. Specifically, we consider both weighted and\nunweighted graphs in the regimes of stretch $< 2$ and stretch $\\ge 2$. Among\nour results, we present a new three-way trade-off between stretch, space, and\nquery time, offering a natural extension of the classical Thorup-Zwick distance\noracle [STOC'01 and JACM'05] to regimes with larger query time. Specifically,\nfor any $0 < r < 1/2$ and integer $k \\ge 1$, we construct a $(2k(1 - 2r) -\n1)$-stretch distance oracle with $\\tilde{O}(m + n^{1 + 1/k})$ space and\n$\\tilde{O}(\\mu n^r)$ query time.

    "abstract": "In the framework of open quantum systems, we study the dynamics of an\naccelerated quantum battery (QB), modeled as an Unruh-DeWitt detector\ninteracting with a real massless scalar quantum field. The QB is driven by an\nexternal classical force acting as a charger. A major challenge in this setup\nis the environment-induced decoherence, which leads to energy dissipation of\nthe QB. Accelerated motion exacerbates this dissipation, manifesting effects\nanalogous to those experienced by a static QB in a thermal bath in free space,\nconsistent with the Unruh effect. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a\nreflecting boundary in a space, which modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the\nfield and leads to a position-dependent suppression of dissipation for the\nUnruh-DeWitt QB. Our analysis reveals that as the QB approaches the boundary,\nthe relevant dissipation is significantly reduced. In particular, when the QB\nis placed extremely close to the boundary, the dissipation is nearly\neliminated, as if the QB were a closed system. Furthermore, we identify a\ncharacteristic length scale associated with the acceleration of QB. When the\ndistance between the QB and the boundary is much smaller than this scale, the\nboundary effectively suppresses dissipation, and this suppression effect\nbecomes identical for both an accelerated QB and a static QB in a thermal bath.\nConversely, when the distance is beyond this scale, the suppression effect\nweakens and manifests a significant difference between these two cases. Our\nfindings demonstrate the potential of boundary-induced modifications in vacuum\nfluctuations to effectively suppress dissipation, offering valuable insights\nfor optimizing QB performance. This work paves the way for the development of\nhigh-efficiency quantum energy storage systems in the relativistic framework.",

For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist\nmodels excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness\non hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the\nfine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model\nmaintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases.

So far,\nonly a few have been studied in detail, with special attention being paid to\nL1544 in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. $Aims.$ The aim is to identify nearby\n($<$200 pc) pre-stellar cores in an unbiased way, to build a sample that can\nthen be studied in detail. $Methods.$ We first used the Herschel Gould Belt\nSurvey archival data, selecting all those starless cores with central H$_2$\nnumber densities higher than or equal to 3$\\times$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$, the density\nof L1544 within the Herschel beam. The selected 40 (out of 1746) cores have\nthen been observed in N$_2$H$^+$(3-2) and N$_2$D$^+$(4-3) using the APEX\nantenna. $Results.$ A total of 17 bona-fide (i.e., with a deuterium fraction\nlarger than 10%) pre-stellar cores have been identified. Other 16 objects can\nalso be considered pre-stellar, as they are dynamically evolved starless cores,\nbut their deuterium fraction is relatively low ($<$10%). The remaining 7\nobjects have been found associated with very young stellar objects.\n$Conclusions.$ Dust continuum emission, together with spectroscopic\nobservations of N$_2$H$^+$(3-2) and N$_2$D$^+$(4-3), is a powerful tool to\nidentify pre-stellar cores in molecular clouds. Detailed modeling of the\nphysical structure of the objects is now required for reconstructing the\nchemical composition as a function of radius. This work has provided a\nstatistically significant sample of 33 pre-stellar cores, a crucial step in the\nunderstanding of the process of star and planet formation.",

To address this gap, this\nstudy introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural\nnetwork that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is\ndesigned to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,\nleadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students\nwithin an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational\ndata from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the\nlimitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various\naward records into talent categories and extracting features from students'\ndiverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908\nclassification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC).

Further, we find the contradiction between the\nperspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD\ngeneralization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can\ncause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,\nFQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a\nlayer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between\ndual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT\nproposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically\ndetermines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing\nthe challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder\nmetric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during\ntraining.

Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients\nof signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints.\nHowever, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the\nSDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have\nbeen introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration\nspace. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and\nthus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free\napproaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage\nlong-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these\nmethods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory\nsamples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost\nfunctions with heterogeneous physical units.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications\nin AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe\nmotion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly\nfollow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D\nGaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose\nestimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction\nresults. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework\nby incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS\nattributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and\nobject motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and\nformulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we\nintroduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and\nGaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with\nposes being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being\nuntouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive\nexperiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences\ndemonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction\nquality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.",

These algorithms are\nespecially valuable in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where\nquantum resources are constrained and classical optimization plays a central\nrole. Here, we improve the performance of a hybrid algorithm through\nprincipled, information-theoretic optimization. We focus on Quantum Likelihood\nEstimation (QLE) - a hybrid algorithm designed to identify the Hamiltonian\ngoverning a quantum system by iteratively updating a weight distribution based\non measurement outcomes and Bayesian inference. While QLE already achieves\nconvergence using quantum measurements and Bayesian inference, its efficiency\ncan vary greatly depending on the choice of parameters at each step. We propose\nan optimization strategy that dynamically selects the initial state,\nmeasurement basis, and evolution time in each iteration to maximize the mutual\ninformation between the measurement outcome and the true Hamiltonian. This\napproach builds upon the information-theoretic framework recently developed in\n[A. Te'eni et al.

With strong spin-layer\ncoupling, an applied vertical electric field induces an interlayer potential\nimbalance that modifies intralayer Heisenberg exchanges between adjacent\nlayers. This electric-field-driven modulation competes with the bilayer's\nintrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, enabling the accurate tuning of\nthe band topology and nonreciprocal dynamics of magnons. More importantly, such\nan electric control mechanism exhibits strong coupling with external magnetic\nfields, unveiling new perspectives on magnetoelectric coupling in\ncharge-neutral quasiparticles",

To remedy this,\nmost robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,\nfeatures, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve\nOOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD\nrobustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input\ninformation of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor\nproxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we\npropose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and\npre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming\nto preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further\nenhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an\nadditional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of\nperturbed samples.

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex\nchallenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited\nvisibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,\nhowever, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,\nparticularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge\nto create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity\ndeep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each\nGaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our\nmethod enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The\ndedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene\nunderstanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,\ncombining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to\nfurther enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results\nshow that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on\nSeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement\nof up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for\napplications in underwater exploration and marine perception.",

Our research using a simulator with known\nground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an\nensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs\nshows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are\npresent.

    "abstract": "Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used\nmetric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit\nof increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of\nSharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there\nexist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is\nthat dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other\nis that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we\nstudy the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both\nthe long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge\nwith the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a\nmean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization\nand the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when\nthe risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the\nsecond challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V\noptimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We\niteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that\nis used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V\nproblems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is\nmonotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both\naverage and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure\nand prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted\nfor validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that\nsolves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type\nalgorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving\nMDPs with other fractional objectives.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, AI and deep learning earthquake detectors, combined with an\nincreasing number of dense seismic networks deployed worldwide, have further\ncontributed to the creation of massive seismic catalogs, significantly lowering\ntheir magnitude of completeness. However, these automated catalogs are\ntypically released without systematic quality control, and may contain spurious\ndetections, mislocations, or inconsistent magnitudes. In challenging scenarios,\nsuch as microseismic monitoring applications, where weak and closely spaced\nevents often overlap in time, pick-based detection and location approaches\noften fail to reliably associate phases. This leads to missed detections or\ndegraded location accuracy producing seismic catalogues polluted with false or\nmislocated events. To address this limitation, we present a computer\nvision-based workflow that integrates waveform-based seismic location methods\nwith deep learning image classification to discriminate real seismic events\nfrom noise directly from coherence matrices. These matrices, computed via\nwaveform stacking, exhibit distinct patterns for real events (single, focused\nmaxima) versus noise (blurred, incoherent patterns) hence the problem of\ncleaning seismic catalogues can be solved as a binary image classification\nproblem. In addition, the robustness of waveform-based location methods allows\nto obtain an increased resolution in the location of seismic events. Another\nadvantage of this approach is that the training of neural networks can be based\nentirely on synthetic data. This synthetic-based training removes the need for\nlarge labeled datasets, enabling rapid deployment in newly instrumented areas.\nWe validate our workflow using the publicly available COSEISMIQ dataset from\nthe Hengill geothermal area, in Iceland.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a distinct form of online antisocial behavior, known as \"fanchuan\",\nhas emerged across online platforms, particularly in livestreaming chats.\nFanchuan is an indirect attack on a specific entity, such as a celebrity, video\ngame, or brand. It entails two main actions: (i) individuals first feign\nsupport for the entity, and exhibit this allegiance widely; (ii) they then\nengage in offensive or irritating behavior, attempting to undermine the entity\nby association. This deceptive conduct is designed to tarnish the reputation of\nthe target and/or its fan community. Fanchuan is a novel, covert and indirect\nform of social attack, occurring outside the targeted community (often in a\nsimilar or broader community), with strategic long-term objectives. This\ndistinguishes fanchuan from other types of antisocial behavior and presents\nsignificant new challenges in moderation. We argue it is crucial to understand\nand combat this new malicious behavior. Therefore, we conduct the first\nempirical study on fanchuan behavior in livestreaming chats, focusing on\nBilibili, a leading livestreaming platform in China. Our dataset covers 2.7\nmillion livestreaming sessions on Bilibili, featuring 3.6 billion chat\nmessages. We identify 130k instances of fanchuan behavior across 37.4k\nlivestreaming sessions.

Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)\nhave achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they\nremain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,\nObjaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the\nlarge domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal\ngeneralization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing\nIntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the\nabove-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.\nSpecifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by\nfine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual\npseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence\nthreshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative\npreference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This\nstrategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality\noutputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for\nsub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become\nmore accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that\nsequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt\nIntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our\nIntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets.",

As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from\none-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden\nperiodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of\nover-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.\n125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for\nvalidation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the\nproposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for\ntrams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.",

    "abstract": "This research proposes a real-time, adaptive decision-support framework for\nmitigating cyber incidents in cyber-physical systems, developed in response to\nan increasing reliance on these systems within critical infrastructure and\nevolving adversarial tactics. Existing decision-support systems often fall\nshort in accounting for multi-agent, multi-path attacks and trade-offs between\nsafety and operational continuity. To address this, our framework integrates\nhierarchical system modelling with Bayesian probabilistic reasoning,\nconstructing Bayesian Network Graphs from system architecture and vulnerability\ndata. Models are encoded using a Domain Specific Language to enhance\ncomputational efficiency and support dynamic updates. In our approach, we use a\nhybrid exposure probability estimation framework, which combines Exploit\nPrediction Scoring System and Common Vulnerability Scoring System scores via\nBayesian confidence calibration to handle epistemic uncertainty caused by\nincomplete or heterogeneous vulnerability metadata. Mitigation recommendations\nare generated as countermeasure portfolios, refined using multi-objective\noptimisation to identify Pareto-optimal strategies balancing attack likelihood,\nimpact severity, and system availability. To accommodate time- and\nresource-constrained incident response, frequency-based heuristics are applied\nto prioritise countermeasures across the optimised portfolios. The framework\nwas evaluated through three representative cyber-physical attack scenarios,\ndemonstrating its versatility in handling complex adversarial behaviours under\nreal-time response constraints. The results affirm its utility in operational\ncontexts and highlight the robustness of our proposed approach across diverse\nthreat environments.",

    "abstract": "Active flow control (AFC) methods for jet-type flows have been extensively\nexplored since the 1970s. Spectacular examples demonstrating the AFC power and\nthe beauty of fluid mechanics include bifurcating and blooming jets. Recent\nadvances in machine learning-based optimization have enabled efficient\nexploration of high-dimensional AFC, revealing control solutions beyond human\nintuition. The present paper focuses on one such discovery: the pseudo-rotating\nspiral jet. This phenomenon manifests as separate branches disconnected from\nthe main jet stream, formed by vortical structures aligned along curved paths\nrotating around the initial jet axis. We investigate the origin of these\njet-type patterns and formulate new rules for their control, showing that\nspiral jets belong to a family of multi-armed jets observable only at specific\ncontrol settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate how human perception of\nthree-dimensional imagery depends on the observable domain and vortex lifetime.\nNotably, the apparent rotation of spiral arms - despite having a well-defined\nfrequency - is an illusion arising from the tendency to connect neighboring\nmoving objects into continuous patterns. In contrast to the chaotic behavior of\nsmall-scale turbulence, we show that large-scale flow motion resulting from AFC\noperating in a deterministic manner is only seemingly unpredictable. Through\ntheoretical analysis and 3D simulations, we develop a remarkably simple yet\nprecise kinematic model that captures the formation and motion of these\nvortical paths. This model replicates the outcomes of complex flow simulations,\nreproduces the apparent jet shape, and facilitates the identification of the\nactual pattern. The findings offer new perspectives for both academic\nresearchers and industrial engineers.",

The\ninvestigations reveal that the intrinsic GeO${_2}$ ML is resistant to oxidation\ndue to strong electrostatic repulsion between surface oxygen ions and\napproaching O$_2$ molecules, effectively suppressing chemisorption. In\ncontrast, defective GeO$_2$ ML with surface O vacancies shows vulnerability to\noxidation with the O$_2$ molecule occupying the vacancy through a low-energy\nactivation energy ($E_a$) of 0.375 eV. Remarkably, the subsequent O$_2$\ndissociation into atomic species faces a higher activation barrier ($E_a$ =\n1.604 eV), suggesting self-limiting oxidation behavior. Electronic structure\nanalysis demonstrates that oxidation primarily modifies the valence bands of\ndefective GeO${_2}$ MLs through oxygen incorporation, while the conduction\nbands and electron effective mass recover to pristine-like characteristics. We\nfurther proved that the high O$_2$ pressure hinders the formation of the O\nvacancy, while high temperature increases the oxidation rate in GeO$_2$ ML.\nThese atomic-level insights not only advance our understanding of oxidation\nresistance in 2D oxides but also provide guidelines for developing stable\nGeO${_2}$-based nanoelectronic devices.",

Critically, we provide a proof-of-principle\nexperimental validation on an IonQ Aria quantum computer, successfully\nreproducing the paradox and its resolution in the presence of real-world noise.\nThis work establishes a practical pathway for quantum causal inference,\noffering a new computational tool to address deep-rooted challenges in\nalgorithmic fairness and explainable AI (XAI).",

This makes\nthe usual MSAR models no longer applicable due to the high computational cost.\nTo address this issue, we propose a factor-augmented spatial autoregression\n(FSAR) model. FSAR is a special case of MSAR but with a novel factor structure\nimposed on the high-dimensional random error vector. The latent factors of FSAR\nare assumed to be of a fixed dimension. Therefore, they can be estimated\nconsistently by the diversified projections method \\citep{fan2022learning}, as\nlong as the dimension of the multivariate response is diverging. Once the\nfixed-dimensional latent factors are consistently estimated, they are then fed\nback into the original SAR model and serve as exogenous covariates. This leads\nto a novel FSAR model. Thereafter, different components of the high-dimensional\nresponse can be modeled separately. To handle the high-dimensional feature, a\nsmoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) type penalized estimator is\ndeveloped for each response component. We show theoretically that the resulting\nSCAD estimator is uniformly selection consistent, as long as the tuning\nparameter is selected appropriately. For practical selection of the tuning\nparameter, a novel BIC method is developed. Extensive numerical studies are\nconducted to demonstrate the finite sample performance of the proposed method.",

Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The\nStability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance\nbetween the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The\nResource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on\nextensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource\nburden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies\nnot in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically\nmodulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that\nlightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning\nprocess. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive\nModulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new\npath for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural\nSynapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to\nstore expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these\nmodulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a\nsimilar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it\nselects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a\nfrozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its\ninternal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.\nExtensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets.

In this study, we investigate the relationship\nbetween consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG\nrecordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness,\nanesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN)\nmodel, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response\nfunction as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the\namplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical\nindicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response\nfunction in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous\ntheoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the\ntransition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a\npotential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics.\nEmpirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong,\nwidely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under\nanesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network\ndynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity.\nDuring recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the\ngradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the\nrestoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust,\nbrain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical\ncondition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying\nlevels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.",

These edge states exhibit a net circulation opposite to the\nparticles' intrinsic rotation and lead to a pronounced accumulation at the\nboundary, stronger than for their achiral counterparts. The directed nature of\nthese orbits provides a simple yet high-fidelity mechanism for chiral sorting\n-- even for solitary particles, unlike in T Barois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 125\n, 238003 (2020). We propose a unified theoretical framework for boundary\ninteractions of both chiral and achiral particles. In this model, an effective\noutward radial force, proportional to motility and chirality, explains the\nobserved boundary-hugging. Our theory predicts, and our experiments confirm, a\ntransition in the pairing of two particles of the same chirality, from apolar\nspinners to polar circle walkers, with increasing packing fraction of an\nambient medium of beads.",

In this survey, we focus on recent advances in open dataset search\nbeyond traditional approaches that rely on metadata and keywords.

All beam-formers are scheduled based on\nthe locally evaluated PELB. In this framework, we exploit multi-dimensional\ninformation fusion to assist in positioning. Firstly, a multi-subcarrier\ncollaborative positioning error lower bound (MSCPEB) is proposed to evaluate\nthe positioning error limits of wideband mmWave systems, which quantifies the\ncontribution of all subcarriers to positioning accuracy. Moreover, we prove\nthat the MSCPEB does not exceed the arithmetic mean of the PELBs of the\nindividual subcarriers. Subsequently, we develop an alternating optimization\n(AO) algorithm to optimize the hybrid beamformers targeted for MSCPEB\nminimization. By convexifying this problem, closed-form solutions of\nbeamformers are derived. Finally, we develop a multipath collaborative\npositioning method that quantifies the impact of path reliability on\npositioning accuracy, with a closed-form solution for user position derived.\nThe proposed method does not rely on path resolution and traditional triangular\nrelationships.

    "abstract": "The energy range from a few hundred keV to a few MeV includes important\nprobes such as nuclear gamma-rays and the 511 keV annihilation line. However,\ncompared to X-rays and GeV/TeV gamma-rays, this range suffers from lower\nsensitivity by orders of magnitude. The upcoming NASA SMEX satellite mission\nCompton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI), scheduled for launch in 2027, is\nexpected to break through this limitation with its Compton telescope utilizing\na germanium semiconductor detector, covering the 0.2-5 MeV energy range. In\naddition to the main instrument, two Background and Transient Observer (BTO)\ndetectors will be installed on COSI. The detectors are NaI(Tl) scintillators\ncoupled with SiPMs, and they are being developed as a student collaboration\nproject. BTO aims to 1) measure background radiation in orbit to maximize\nCOSI's sensitivity and 2) detect GRBs and other gamma-ray transients. For this\npurpose, it is required to cover the lower-energy range from 30 keV to 2 MeV\nwith < 20% FWHM energy resolution. In addition, large signals and afterglow\ngenerated by heavy ions penetrating the NaI(Tl) crystal should be appropriately\nhandled. To address these requirements, we have developed a compact signal\nprocessing and data acquisition system comprised of two main components: an\nanalog board and a digital board. The analog board amplifies signals from the\nSiPM, generates triggers, and performs AD conversion. The digital board\nfeatures a Microchip SAMV71 microcontroller, and we developed the software to\ncontrol the analog board, read ADC data via SPI interface, add timestamps, and\nbuffer event data. Through this development, we achieved the required wide\nbandpass and an energy resolution of 10% FWHM at 662 keV with a processing time\nof 20 us per event. We also implemented veto signal generation for large\nsignals using a discriminator and an onboard detection algorithm for transient\nevents.",

However, hallucination\nissues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text\nmodality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues\nwhile neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal\nscenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or\nauditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the\nintrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This\noversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden\naudio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose\nOmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations\nin OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing\ntext-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of\naudio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample\npairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.\nBy tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding\nand reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that\nOmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also\nsignificantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.\nAll code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Link failures occur frequently in Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks\nand pose significant challenges for Traffic Engineering (TE). Existing TE\nschemes either reroute traffic over vulnerable static paths, leading to\nperformance degradation, or precompute backup routes for a broad range of\nfailure scenarios, which introduces high overhead and limits scalability.\nHence, an effective failure recovery mechanism is required to offer sufficient\npath diversity under constrained overhead, thereby ensuring robust and\nperformant network operation. This paper presents ReWeave, a scalable and\nefficient link-level TE scheme that enables localized rerouting by equipping\neach link with a compact set of adjacent-only backup paths. Upon detecting a\nfailure, only the routers at both ends of the failed link reroute traffic\ndynamically using SRv6-based detours, without controller intervention or\nfull-path recomputation. Evaluation results on large-scale backbone networks\ndemonstrate that ReWeave outperforms existing TE schemes in link failure\nscenarios. Compared to HARP, the state-of-the-art failure recovery scheme based\non centralized control and dynamic traffic reallocation, our approach reduces\nthe average maximum link utilization by 10.5%~20.1%, and lowers the worst-case\nutilization by 29.5%~40.9%.

However, we observe that\nthis independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling\nsequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of\nnon-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose\nReward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an\nexternal reward model to provide a principled global signal during the\niterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS\nevaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token\nlogits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global\nsequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of\ntokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more\nnon-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical\njustification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial\nrank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.\nExperiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive\ngeneration orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.\nThese results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in\nenhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of\nMDMs.",

More precisely, at low electric fields,\nswitching proceeds via gradual domain-wall propagation, well described by the\nKolmogorov-Avram-Ishibashi model; meanwhile high fields trigger additional\nnucleation events, producing rapid and more homogeneous reversal, whose mixed\nswitching process is better described by the simultaneous non-linear nucleation\nand growth model.

We adapt object detection datasets\n(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design\ntrain/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen\nand unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection\nlayer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes\ncompared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level\nof generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those\nconcepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic\ninterpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in\nthe projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and\nunseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework\nfor alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM\ntraining with limited aligned data.",

    "abstract": "The computational fabrication pipeline for 3D printing is much like a\ncompiler - users design models in Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools that are\nlowered to polygon meshes to be ultimately compiled to machine code by 3D\nslicers. For traditional compilers and programming languages, techniques for\nchecking program invariants are well-established. Similarly, methods like\ndifferential testing are often used to uncover bugs in compilers themselves,\nwhich makes them more reliable. The fabrication pipeline would benefit from\nsimilar techniques but traditional approaches do not directly apply to the\nrepresentations used in this domain. Unlike traditional programs, 3D models\nexist both as geometric objects as well as machine code that ultimately runs on\nthe hardware. The machine code, like in traditional compiling, is affected by\nmany factors like the model, the slicer being used, and numerous\nuser-configurable parameters that control the slicing process. In this work, we\npropose a new algorithm for lifting G-code (a common language used in\nfabrication pipelines) by denoting a G-code program to a set of cuboids, and\nthen defining an approximate point cloud representation for efficiently\noperating on these cuboids. Our algorithm opens up new opportunities: we show\nthree use cases that demonstrate how it enables error localization in CAD\nmodels through invariant checking, quantitative comparisons between slicers,\nand evaluating the efficacy of mesh repair tools. We present a prototype\nimplementation of our algorithm in a tool, GlitchFinder, and evaluate it on 58\nreal-world CAD models. Our results show that GlitchFinder is particularly\neffective in identifying slicing issues due to small features, can highlight\ndifferences in how popular slicers (Cura and PrusaSlicer) slice the same model,\nand can identify cases where mesh repair tools (MeshLab and Meshmixer)\nintroduce new errors during repair.",

However, effectively\nincorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to\n(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained\ncontext windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews\nmost relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these\nchallenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework\ninspired by the \"browse-then-decide\" decision process commonly observed in\nonline user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based\nreranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate\nitems. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce\nPrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item\nrepresentations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves\npreference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive\nexperiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves\nconsistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its\ngeneralizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.\nFurthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse\noffers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews\ninfluence the final recommendation.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a unified, distribution-aware, and complexity-informed\nframework for understanding equity return dynamics in the Indian market, using\n34 years (1990 to 2024) of Nifty 50 index data. Addressing a key gap in the\nliterature, we demonstrate that the price to earnings ratio, as a valuation\nmetric, may probabilistically map return distributions across investment\nhorizons spanning from days to decades.\n  Return profiles exhibit strong asymmetry. One-year returns show a 74 percent\nprobability of gain, with a modal return of 10.67 percent and a reward-to-risk\nratio exceeding 5. Over long horizons, modal CAGRs surpass 13 percent, while\nworst-case returns remain negative for up to ten years, defining a historical\ntrapping period. This horizon shortens to six years in the post-1999 period,\nreflecting growing market resilience.\n  Conditional analysis of the P/E ratio reveals regime-dependent outcomes. Low\nvaluations (P/E less than 13) historically show zero probability of loss across\nall horizons, while high valuations (P/E greater than 27) correspond to\nunstable returns and extended breakeven periods.\n  To uncover deeper structure, we apply tools from complexity science. Entropy,\nHurst exponents, and Lyapunov indicators reveal weak persistence, long memory,\nand low-dimensional chaos. Information-theoretic metrics, including mutual\ninformation and transfer entropy, confirm a directional and predictive\ninfluence of valuation on future returns.\n  These findings offer actionable insights for asset allocation, downside risk\nmanagement, and long-term investment strategy in emerging markets.

We generalize this\nlearning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data\nReprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target\nattribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction\naccuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating\nhigh-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large\nsearch space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from\nutility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability.

Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq\nencoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and\nadversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals\nduring feature generation.

As a result,\nmodeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an\noverwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating\ntime-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,\nbut it cannot perform feature fusion directly.

Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of\nremote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine\nit with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module\nbased on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the\ntwo modalities.

We propose to\nreorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals\nand perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,\nproducing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference\njudgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,\nLLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a\ncompetitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs\ntrained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding\nbenchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).\nExtending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields\nLLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing\ncritic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.\nFinally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying\nself-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five\nrepresentative reasoning tasks without additional training.

We\ndevelop a PDE-based extension technique that systematically and automatically\nconstructs ghost point values with third-order accuracy near irregular\nboundaries, effectively circumventing the computational complexity of\ninterpolation in these regions. Another novel aspect of our work is the\napplication of the PDE-based extension technique to a nodal basis function,\nresulting in an explicit ghost value mapping that can be seamlessly\nincorporated into implicit time-stepping methods where the extended function\nvalues are treated as unknowns at the next time step. We present numerical\nexamples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, including its\napplication to domains with corners and to problems involving higher-order\ninteraction terms.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the unsteady lift response of compliant membrane wings in\nhovering kinematics by combining analytical inviscid theory with experimental\nresults. An unsteady aerodynamic model is derived for a compliant thin aerofoil\nimmersed in incompressible inviscid flow of variable freestream velocity at\nhigh angles of attack. The model, representing a spanwise section of a hovering\nmembrane wing, assumes small membrane deformation and attached flow. These\nassumptions are supported by experiments showing that passive membrane\ndeformation suppresses flow separation when hovering at angles of attack up to\n$55^\\circ$. An analytically derived expression is obtained for the unsteady\nlift response, incorporating the classical Wagner and Theodorsen functions and\nthe membrane dynamic response. This theoretical expression is validated against\nexperimental water-tank measurements that are performed on hovering membrane\nwings at angles of attack of $35^\\circ$ and $55^\\circ$. Data from membrane\ndeformation measurements is applied to the theoretical lift expression,\nproviding the theoretical lift response prediction for each of the available\nexperimental scenarios. Results of the comparison show that the proposed theory\naccurately predicts unsteady lift contributions from membrane deformation at\nhigh angles of attack, provided the deformation remains small and the flow is\nattached. This agreement between inviscid theory and experimental measurements\nsuggests that when flow separation is suppressed, the unsteady aerodynamic\ntheory is valid well beyond the typical low angle of attack regime.",

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\\ rain, fog,\nsnow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable\nground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.\nExisting methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which\nsuffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates\nphotometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to\nachieve weather-generalized depth estimation by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small amount of\nhigh-visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong performance in\nsemantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored for geometry --\ncentric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of balancing\neffective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge. To this\nend, we introduce the Selecting-Tuning-Maintaining (STM) strategy, which\nstructurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds of\neffective ranks (entropy-rank and stable-rank). In the tuning phase, we\nadaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task-aware singular\ndirections for initialization, based on the entropy-rank and full-tuned weight;\nwhile in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction regularization\nbased on the stable-rank. This design guarantees flexible task adaptation while\npreserving the strong generalization capability of the pretrained VFM.\nExtensive experiments on four real-world benchmarks across diverse weather\nconditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing PEFT methods and\nfull fine-tuning but also surpasses methods trained with adverse synthetic\ndata, and even the depth foundation model",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in\nbridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they\nface a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic\nunderstanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require\nprecise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent\narchitectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level\nsemantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture\nfine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to\nEnhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the\nsingle-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor\nencoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head\nCross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several\nchallenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as\nTextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms\nbaselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.\nThis work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient\nand effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current\nMLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems\nwith stronger perceptual capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or\nmood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing\nstylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning,\nwhich complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist\nnames are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers\nsampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for\nstylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish\n(vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use\nfifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions:\nbaseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts\nare generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and\nCLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including\na new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the\nstrongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors\nrecover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as\nthe restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully\nprevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that\ndescriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table\nacross ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens.\nTogether these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability\ndifference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown\nthrough a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.",

Existing\nattention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial\narrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they\ntend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training\ndata, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this\nstudy, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named\nMV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the\njoint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from\nmulti-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State\nSpace (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial\narrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's\ntraditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning\n(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate\nthat MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU\nPanoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP\n(+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

Unlike software flaws, which are\noften patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across\nproduct lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices,\nand IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021)\nrelied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and\nintroduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for\nhardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose\nLLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction\nand refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot\nLLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and\nprompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying\nLLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742\nhardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes,\nincluding privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in\nmobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven\nLLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy\n(99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our\nframework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses\n(MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our\npipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis,\nthereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These\nresults establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for\nsystematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap\nbetween expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual quality but\nincur high computational costs, making real-time, scalable deployment\nchallenging. Existing query-aware serving systems mitigate the cost by\ncascading lightweight and heavyweight models, but most rely on a fixed cascade\nconfiguration and route all prompts through an initial lightweight stage,\nwasting resources on complex queries. We present HADIS, a hybrid adaptive\ndiffusion model serving system that jointly optimizes cascade model selection,\nquery routing, and resource allocation. HADIS employs a rule-based prompt\nrouter to send clearly hard queries directly to heavyweight models, bypassing\nthe overhead of the lightweight stage. To reduce the complexity of resource\nmanagement, HADIS uses an offline profiling phase to produce a Pareto-optimal\ncascade configuration table. At runtime, HADIS selects the best cascade\nconfiguration and GPU allocation given latency and workload constraints.\nEmpirical evaluations on real-world traces demonstrate that HADIS improves\nresponse quality by up to 35% while reducing latency violation rates by\n2.7-45$\\times$ compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.",

    "abstract": "We construct a rigorous mathematical framework for an abstract continuous\nevolution of an internal state, inspired by the intuitive notion of a flowing\nthought sequence. Using tools from topology, functional analysis, measure\ntheory, and logic, we formalize an indefinitely proceeding sequence of states\nas a non-linear continuum with rich structure. In our development, a trajectory\nof states is modeled as a continuous mapping on a topological state space (a\npotentially infinite-dimensional Banach space) and is further conceptualized\nintuitionistically as a choice sequence not fixed in advance. We establish\nfundamental properties of these state flows, including existence and uniqueness\nof evolutions under certain continuity conditions (via a Banach fixed-point\nargument), non-measurability results (demonstrating the impossibility of\nassigning a classical measure to all subsets of the continuum of states), and\nlogical semantic frameworks (defining a Tarskian truth definition for\npropositions about states). Throughout, we draw on ideas of Brouwer, Banach,\nTarski, Poincar\\'e, Hadamard, and others--blending intuitionistic perspective\nwith classical analysis--to rigorously capture a continuous, ever-evolving\nprocess of an abstract cognitive state without resorting to category-theoretic\nnotions.",

    "abstract": "Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,\nsignificantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes\nat a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may\nunintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and\nethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,\nresearchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most\nof which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent\nexplicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these\napproaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign\nprompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,\nthis paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a\ncomprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by\nsystematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,\nii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,\nand iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright\nviolations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate\nthe effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,\noffering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of\ngenerative models.",
