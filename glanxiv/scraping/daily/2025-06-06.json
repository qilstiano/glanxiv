    "abstract": "We initiate the study of rate-constant-independent computation of Boolean\npredicates and numerical functions in the continuous model of chemical reaction\nnetworks (CRNs), which model the amount of a chemical species as a nonnegative,\nreal-valued *concentration*. Real-valued numerical functions have previously\nbeen studied, finding that exactly the continuous, piecewise rational linear\nfunctions $f: \\mathbb{R}_{> 0}^k \\to \\mathbb{R}_{> 0}$ can be computed\n*stably*, a.k.a., *rate-independently*, meaning that the CRN gets the answer\ncorrect no matter the rate at which reactions occur.\n  We show that, contrary to functions, continuous CRNs are severely limited in\nthe Boolean predicates they can stably decide, reporting an answer based only\non which inputs are 0 or positive.\n  This limitation motivates a slightly relaxed notion of rate-independent\ncomputation in CRNs that we call *robust computation*. The standard mass-action\nrate model is used, in which each reaction is assigned a rate equal to the\nproduct of its reactant concentrations and its rate constant. The computation\nis correct in this model if it converges to the correct output for any positive\nchoice of rate constants. This adversary is weaker than the stable computation\nadversary, the latter being able to run reactions at non-mass-action rates.\n  We show that CRNs can robustly decide every finite Boolean combination of\n*threshold predicates*: those predicates defined by taking a rational weighted\nsum of the inputs $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^k_{\\ge 0}$ and comparing to a\nconstant, answering the question ``Is $\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i \\cdot \\mathbf{x}(i) >\nh$?'', for rational weights $w_i$ and real threshold $h$. Turning to function\ncomputation, we show that CRNs can robustly compute any piecewise affine\nfunction with rational coefficients, where threshold predicates determine which\naffine piece to evaluate for a given input.",

To study this problem, we propose\nPrecise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models\nto generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short\nself-contained statements, known as verifiable claims, without adding any\nunsupported ones. For comprehensiveness, PIC includes a full setting that tests\na model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting\nthat requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We\npresent PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g.,\nsummarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are\nsupplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range\nof open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly,\nstate-of-the-art LMs still intrinsically hallucinate in over 70% of outputs. To\nalleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework,\nusing a weakly supervised preference data construction method, to train an 8B\nPIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full\nPIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines,\nPIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and\nfactual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace verification task, underscoring the\npotential of precisely grounded generation.",

Therefore, new ways of analyzing the data have to be explored in order\nto understand the origin of the new phenomena. In this paper, pp collisions\nsimulated with PYTHIA 8 are analyzed using different event estimators\n(mid-pseudorapidity multiplicity, spherocity, sphericity, $R_{\\rm T}$, forward\nmultiplicity and flattenicity). The features of the selected events for the top\n0.1 % using the different estimators are discussed.

    "abstract": "To understand the dynamics of jet-medium interaction in small systems such as\nproton-proton (pp) and proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ =\n5.02 TeV, particle production is studied in three distinct topological regions\ndefined with respect to the charged particle with the highest transverse\nmomentum in the event ($p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm trig}$). The jet-like yield is defined\nby the particle density in the toward region ($|\\Delta\\varphi|<\\pi/3$) after\nsubtracting that in the transverse region ($\\pi/3<|\\Delta\\varphi|<2\\pi/3$). The\nactivity on the transverse side is used as a proxy for medium-like effects.\nThree different Monte Carlo event generators -- \\textsc{Pythia8}, a multiphase\ntransport (AMPT) model, and EPOS4 -- are employed to investigate particle\nyields as a function of $p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm trig}$ in the interval 0.5-20\\,GeV/$c$.\nCalculations are performed for the $p_{\\rm T}$ threshold of 0.5 GeV/$c$ at\nmid-rapidity ($|\\eta| < 0.8$). The jet-like yield in the toward region for pp\ncollisions show interesting dynamics; they are significantly affected by the\nmedium-like effects in the low to intermediate $p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm trig}$\n($<8$\\,GeV/$c$) which is studied through color reconnection and hydrodynamics\nin \\textsc{Pythia8} and EPOS4, respectively. However, the results from AMPT\nshow that the jet-like yield is medium-like modified throughout the entire\n$p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm trig}$ range. The jet-like yield in p-Pb collisions using AMPT\nis also studied. Notably, a dip structure that is observed in the jet-like\nsignal ratio of pp to p-Pb at low $p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm trig}$ in ALICE data, is\nreproduced by AMPT model with string melting on, pointing to possible\nmedium-like behavior in small systems. The results of this article also\nunderscore the importance of high-$p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm trig}$ ($p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm trig}\n>$ 8 GeV/$c$) for minimizing underlying event biases in jet-related studies.",

However, global\nconvergence has only been proven for the case of $m=2$, and EM is known to fail\nto recover the ground truth when $m\\geq 3$.\n  In this paper, we consider the $\\textit{over-parameterized}$ setting, where\nthe learning model uses $n>m$ components to fit an $m$-component ground truth\nGMM. In contrast to the exact-parameterized case, we provide a rigorous global\nconvergence guarantee for gradient EM. Specifically, for any well separated\nGMMs in general position, we prove that with only mild over-parameterization $n\n= \\Omega(m\\log m)$, randomly initialized gradient EM converges globally to the\nground truth at a polynomial rate with polynomial samples. Our analysis\nproceeds in two stages and introduces a suite of novel tools for Gaussian\nMixture analysis.

    "abstract": "Traditional surface cleaning methods often suffer from drawbacks such as\nchemical harshness, potential for surface damage, and high energy consumption.\nThis study investigates an alternative approach: acoustic-driven surface\ncleaning using millimeter-sized bubbles excited at low, sub-cavitation\nfrequencies. We identify and characterize a distinct translational resonance of\nthese bubbles, occurring at significantly lower frequencies (e.g., 50 Hz for\n1.3 mm diameter bubbles) than the Minnaert resonance for a bubble of the same\nsize. Experiments reveal that at this translational resonance, stationary\nbubbles exhibit amplified lateral swaying, while bubbles sliding on an inclined\nsurface display pronounced \"stop-and-go\" dynamics. The theoretical model treats\nthe bubble as a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, where surface tension\nprovides the restoring force and the inertia is dominated by the hydrodynamic\nadded mass of the surrounding fluid. It accurately predicts the observed\nresonant frequency scaling with bubble size ($\\propto R_0^{-3/2}$). Cleaning\nefficacy, assessed using protein-based artificial soil on glass slides, was\nimproved by approximately 90\\% when bubbles were driven at their translational\nresonant frequency compared to off-resonant frequencies or non-acoustic\nconditions. These findings demonstrate that leveraging translational resonance\nenhances bubble-induced shear and agitation, offering an effective and\nsustainable mechanism for surface cleaning.",

This survey explores two complementary\nstrategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most\nsuitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference\n(HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident\nresponse is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using\nlightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We\nprovide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance\nmetrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges.

This type of research is descriptive research. The population in this\nstudy was visitors to the Nusliko Park Ecotourism area. The sample criteria\nwere visitors who had visited the Nusliko Park Ecotourism area at least twice\nand were domiciled in North Maluku. Data were collected through questionnaires,\nand 114 questionnaires were returned. The research method used non-probability\nsampling with purposive sampling techniques. These two techniques were used to\nmake it easier for the author to obtain samples because the Nusliko Park\nEcotourism area was closed when the research was conducted. After all, it was\nunder repair. Data were processed and analyzed using SEM and through SmartPLS\n4.0 software. The study results indicate that the tourist experience and\nsatisfaction positively influence the decision to revisit.

While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting\nthis threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system\nand fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We\npropose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients\nin a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution.\nGeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released\nnoisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence\nguarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal\ntransformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the\nprobability of gradient clipping under control.

This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs),\ntrained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for\nexpert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We\nanalyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use\npairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal\nexecutive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and\npredict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach\nand find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge\ninstitutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when\ncontrolling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows\nus to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the\nshock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs\noffer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional\nmeasurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for\nwhen researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.",

Years of research now enable modern perfect hash functions to be\nextremely fast to query, very space-efficient, and scale to billions of keys.\nDifferent approaches give different trade-offs between these aspects. For\nexample, the smallest constructions get within 0.1% of the space lower bound of\n$\\log_2(e)$ bits per key. Others are particularly fast to query, requiring only\none memory access. Perfect hashing has many applications, for example to avoid\ncollision resolution in static hash tables, and is used in databases,\nbioinformatics, and stringology.\n  Since the last comprehensive survey in 1997, significant progress has been\nmade. This survey covers the latest developments and provides a starting point\nfor getting familiar with the topic. Additionally, our extensive experimental\nevaluation can serve as a guide to select a perfect hash function for use in\napplications.",

Incorporating mask pooling\nresults in a 7% improvement over prior approaches on the OCID-VLG benchmark.\nFurthermore, we introduce RefGraspNet, an open-source dataset eight times\nlarger than existing alternatives, significantly enhancing model generalization\nfor open-vocabulary grasping. MapleGrasp scores a strong grasping accuracy of\n89\\% when compared with competing methods in the RefGraspNet benchmark.

In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of\nquantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a\nmultimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of\natomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos\nleads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution\nand the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground\nstate accumulating in it about 80-90\\% of total probability. Certain\nsimilarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\\\"ohlich condensate are discussed.\nBelow the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the\nKolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is\ncharacterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short\ntimes and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This\nbehavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the\nformation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion,\nenergy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave\ncollapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very\ndifferent from the open space case.

Considering the complex nature of 6G domain, we\npropose a novel hierarchical debate scheme: LLMs will first debate the sub-task\ndecomposition, and then debate each subtask step-by-step. Such a hierarchical\napproach can significantly reduce the overall debate difficulty by sub-task\ndecomposition, aligning well with the complex nature of 6G networks and\nensuring the final solution qualities. In addition, to better evaluate the\nproposed technique, we have defined a novel dataset named 6GPlan, including 110\ncomplex 6G network management tasks and 5000 keyword solutions.

In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic\nbiases in VLM representations systematically ``carry over'' or propagate into\nzero-shot retrieval tasks, revealing how deeply rooted biases shape a model's\noutputs. We introduce a controlled framework to measure this propagation by\ncorrelating (a) intrinsic measures of bias in the representational space with\n(b) extrinsic measures of bias in zero-shot text-to-image (TTI) and\nimage-to-text (ITT) retrieval. Results show substantial correlations between\nintrinsic and extrinsic bias, with an average $\\rho$ = 0.83 $\\pm$ 0.10. This\npattern is consistent across 114 analyses, both retrieval directions, six\nsocial groups, and three distinct VLMs. Notably, we find that\nlarger/better-performing models exhibit greater bias propagation, a finding\nthat raises concerns given the trend towards increasingly complex AI models.\nOur framework introduces baseline evaluation tasks to measure the propagation\nof group and valence signals.

Improved parallelism typically entails\nlighter local computation and weaker coupling, which unavoidably slow the\nglobal convergence. This paper presents a novel GPU algorithm that achieves\nconvergence rates comparable to fullspace Newton's method while maintaining\ngood parallelizability just like the Jacobi method. Our approach is built on a\nkey insight into the phenomenon of overshoot. Overshoot occurs when a local\nsolver aggressively minimizes its local energy without accounting for the\nglobal context, resulting in a local update that undermines global convergence.\nTo address this, we derive a theoretically second-order optimal solution to\nmitigate overshoot. Furthermore, we adapt this solution into a pre-computable\nform. Leveraging Cubature sampling, our runtime cost is only marginally higher\nthan the Jacobi method, yet our algorithm converges nearly quadratically as\nNewton's method. We also introduce a novel full-coordinate formulation for more\nefficient pre-computation.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) possess a remarkable ability to perform\nin-context learning (ICL), which enables them to handle multiple downstream\ntasks simultaneously without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Recent\nstudies have shown that even moderately sized LLMs, such as Mistral 7B, Gemma\n7B and Llama-3 8B, can achieve ICL through few-shot in-context fine-tuning of\nall tasks at once. However, this approach still lags behind dedicated\nfine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning\n(ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the\nprinciples of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of\nManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with\nnumerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of\nsolely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the\ncontext as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of\nmany-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through\nextensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification,\nsummarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we\ndemonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning\nand approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning. Furthermore, ManyICL\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting issues observed in\nzero/few-shot fine-tuning. The code will be made publicly available upon\npublication.",

    "abstract": "The box-and-whisker plot, introduced by Tukey (1977), is one of the most\npopular graphical methods in descriptive statistics. On the other hand,\nhowever, Tukey's boxplot is free of sample size, yielding the so-called\n\"one-size-fits-all\" fences for outlier detection. Although improvements on the\nsample size adjusted boxplots do exist in the literature, most of them are\neither not easy to implement or lack justification. As another common rule for\noutlier detection, Chauvenet's criterion uses the sample mean and standard\nderivation to perform the test, but it is often sensitive to the included\noutliers and hence is not robust. In this paper, by combining Tukey's boxplot\nand Chauvenet's criterion, we introduce a new boxplot, namely the\nChauvenet-type boxplot, with the fence coefficient determined by an exact\ncontrol of the outside rate per observation. Our new outlier criterion not only\nmaintains the simplicity of the boxplot from a practical perspective, but also\nserves as a robust Chauvenet's criterion. Simulation study and a real data\nanalysis on the civil service pay adjustment in Hong Kong demonstrate that the\nChauvenet-type boxplot performs extremely well regardless of the sample size,\nand can therefore be highly recommended for practical use to replace both\nTukey's boxplot and Chauvenet's criterion. Lastly, to increase the visibility\nof the work, a user-friendly R package named `ChauBoxplot' has also been\nofficially released on CRAN.",

The development of\ndynamical, first-principles approaches for simulating molecular polaritons is\nimportant for understanding their origins and properties. Herein, we present a\nhierarchy of first-principles methods to simulate the real-time dynamics of\nmolecular polaritons in the strong coupling regime. These methods are based on\nreal-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) and the\ncorresponding real-time nuclear-electronic orbital (RT-NEO) approach, in which\nspecified nuclei are treated quantum mechanically on the same level as the\nelectrons. The hierarchy spans semiclassical, mean-field-quantum, and\nfull-quantum approaches to simulate polariton dynamics under both electronic\nstrong coupling and vibrational strong coupling. In the semiclassical\napproaches, the cavity mode is treated classically, whereas in the full-quantum\napproaches, the cavity mode is treated quantum mechanically with propagation of\na joint molecule-mode density matrix. The semiclassical and full-quantum\napproaches produce virtually identical Rabi splittings and polariton peak\nlocations for the systems studied. However, the full-quantum approaches allow\nexploration of molecule-mode quantum entanglement in the real-time dynamics.\nAlthough the degree of light-matter entanglement is relatively small in the\nsystems considered, the oscillations of the von Neumann entropy reveal an\nentanglement Rabi splitting that differs from the Rabi splitting computed from\nthe time-dependent dipole moment. These results suggest that a classical\ntreatment of the cavity mode may provide an excellent description of polariton\ndynamics for macroscopic observables such as the Rabi splitting, but novel\nphysics may be detectable by considering molecule-mode entanglement.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic\nframework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks\ntrained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in\nthis regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus\nwhere neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons\nrapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step\nprocess: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a\ncost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each\nround, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and\na drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these\ndrops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and\nextends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks\nand attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular\nmodes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we\nprove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.\nApplying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give\nthe first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that\nnetworks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.\nAltogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning\nin neural networks.",

Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing\nenergy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of\nconverting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of\nenergy systems amidst these uncertainties.

    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of Continuous Integration and Continuous\nDeployment pipelines, securing software supply chains has become a critical\nchallenge for modern DevOps teams. This study addresses these challenges by\napplying a structured threat modeling approach to identify and mitigate risks\nthroughout the CI/CD lifecycle. By modeling a representative pipeline\narchitecture incorporating tools such as GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, and\nKubernetes and applying the STRIDE framework, we systematically analyze\nvulnerabilities at each stage, from source code management to deployment.\nThreats are documented and mapped to comprehensive security controls drawn from\nstandards like NIST SP 800-218, OWASP Top 10 CI/CD risks, and the SLSA\nframework. Controls are further evaluated against SLSA maturity levels to\nassess improvements in trust and provenance. To operationalize these findings,\nthe study outlines a practical security toolchain integration strategy grounded\nin Security as Code and Shift Left-Shield Right principles, enabling automated,\nenforceable security across the pipeline. This approach provides a pragmatic\nroadmap for enhancing CI/CD pipeline security against evolving software supply\nchain threats.",

Traditional on-board\nperception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,\nwhile cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them\nunsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in\ndynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative\nframework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that\nleverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,\nmulti-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key\nalgorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and\nVariable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data\nfrom multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where\nindividual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting\nmechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data\nfrom multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in\nreal-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We\ndevelop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped\nrobotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of\nimproved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional\nsingle-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,\nedge-driven real-time processing.

Its\ndesign is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small\nfraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training\niteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a\nlong period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching\ntensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO\naccurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each\ntensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process.\nWith the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor\noffloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via\nPyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the\noffloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor\nmigration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and\nmaximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art\nstudies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves\nthe training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves\n80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.",

Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating\nhigh-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically\nretain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling\nnodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns,\nand alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of\nnon-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in\nthe whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo\nAugmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling\nnodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes\nalong each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model\nidentifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a\nrevision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring\ntrajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying\nthe underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches,\nSIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH\nbenchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K\nsamples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples.

The\ncombination of these observations with theoretical calculations has revealed\npreviously inaccessible features of the equation of state (EoS) and the QCD\nphase diagram. In this thesis, I demonstrate how perturbative-QCD calculations\nat asymptotically high baryon densities provide robust constraints on the EoS\nat neutron-star densities. The method for constraint propagation is based\nsolely on thermodynamical causality, stability, and consistency of the EoS. By\nconstructing a large ensemble of EoSs using Gaussian processes regression and\nincorporating it into a Bayesian inference of EoS, I demonstrate that the novel\npQCD constraints go beyond those obtained from current astrophysical\nobservations alone, forcing the EoS to soften at the maximum densities of\nstable neutron stars. This softening of the EoS can be interpreted as an\nindication of approximate conformal symmetry restoration, a sign of a\nfirst-order phase transition (FOPT), or potentially both. I show that the\nconformal symmetry restoration is consistent with the hypothesis of quark\nmatter cores inside the most massive NSs. Although current astrophysical data\nand theoretical inputs cannot definitively distinguish between the two\nscenarios, they slightly favor the occurrence of a phase transition of some\nkind - whether a crossover to quark matter or a destabilizing FOPT - in the\ncores of the most massive neutron stars.",

Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and sharp\nmaneuvers can disrupt infant sleep, compromising both passenger comfort and\nparental convenience. To solve this problem, this paper explores the\nintegration of reinforcement learning (RL) within AD to personalize driving\nbehavior and optimally balance occupant comfort and travel efficiency. In\nparticular, we propose an intelligent cruise control framework that adapts to\nvarying driving conditions to enhance infant sleep quality by effectively\nsynergizing wearable sensing and vehicle data.

Based on the sleep quality indicators from the\nwearable sensors, driving action data from vehicle controllers, and map data\nfrom map applications, the model dynamically computes the optimal driving\naggressiveness level, which is subsequently translated into specific AD control\nstrategies, e.g., the magnitude and frequency of acceleration, lane change, and\novertaking.

    "abstract": "Digital commerce thrives on advertising, with many of the largest technology\ncompanies relying on it as a significant source of revenue. However, in the\ncontext of information-seeking behavior, such as search, advertising may\ndegrade the user experience by lowering search quality, misusing user data for\ninappropriate personalization, potentially misleading individuals, or even\nleading them toward harm. These challenges remain significant as conversational\nsearch technologies, such as ChatGPT, become widespread. This paper critically\nexamines the future of advertising in conversational search, utilizing several\nspeculative examples to illustrate the potential risks posed to users who seek\nguidance on sensitive topics. Additionally, it provides an overview of the\nforms that advertising might take in this space and introduces the \"fake friend\ndilemma,\" the idea that a conversational agent may exploit unaligned user trust\nto achieve other objectives. This study presents a provocative discussion on\nthe future of online advertising in the space of conversational search and ends\nwith a call to action.",

Crucially, the\ntokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference\nas well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the\ntoken vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the\ntokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the\ncanonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest\nthat large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences,\nand this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show\nthat, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate\n(partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive\ngeneration process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical\nresult, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method\nthat precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences.\nFurther, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the\ndistribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably\ncloser to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.",

However,\nprevious studies have reported discrepant values in key system parameters, such\nas stellar inclination and obliquity. To address this, we conducted multi-band,\nmulti-epoch transit observations of TOI-3884b using the MuSCAT instrument\nseries, along with photometric monitoring with the LCO 1m telescopes/Sinistro.\nWe detected time-dependent variations in the spot-crossing signals, indicating\nthat the spot is not exactly on the pole.

We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model\n(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)\nto accelerate future research in LLM safety.

The maximum mass splitting is of around $120$\nGeV within the members of each custodial multiplet, and up to $250$ GeV between\nthe members of different multiplets. In the GM model, these constraints become\nmore stringent: the triplet VEV is limited to below $15$ GeV, which tightens to\n$4$ GeV once the BSM scalar masses are below $160$ GeV.

    "abstract": "ESA's Ariel mission will be uniquely suited to performing population-level\nstudies of exoplanets. Most of these studies consist of quantifying trends\nbetween an Ariel-measured quantity, y, and an a priori planetary property, x;\nfor example, atmospheric metallicity as inferred from Ariel transit\nspectroscopy vs. planetary radius. We define the leverage of a survey with N\ntargets as L = sqrt(N)stdev(x) and show that it quantitatively predicts the\nprecision of population-level trends. The target selection challenge of Ariel\ncan therefore be summarized as maximizing L along some axes of diversity for a\ngiven cumulative observing time. To this end, we consider different schemes to\nselect the mission reference sample for a notional three year transit\nspectroscopy survey with Ariel. We divide the exoplanets in the mission\ncandidate sample into logarithmic classes based on radius, equilibrium\ntemperature, and host star temperature. We then construct a target list by\ncyclically choosing the easiest remaining target in each class. We find that in\nmany cases the leverage is greatest for a single class: dividing planets into\nmultiple classes increases the diversity of targets, but reduces their numbers.\nThe leverage on a single axis of diversity can be increased by dividing that\naxis into many planet classes, but this sacrifices leverage along other axes of\ndiversity. We conclude that a modest number of classes, possibly only one,\nshould be defined when selecting Ariel targets. Lastly, we note that the\nstatistical leverage of the Ariel transit survey would be significantly\nincreased if current candidate planets were confirmed. This highlights the\nurgency of vetting and confirming the easiest transmission and emission\nspectroscopy targets in the Ariel mission candidate sample.",

By constraining the timescale for SN ejecta to become transparent to\nFRB emission, we predict that it takes at least 6-10 years before the FRB\nemission can escape.

We\nderive the number of new, well-localized FRBs required to produce one FRB-SN\nmatch by chance, and find it will take ~ 22,700 FRBs to yield one chance\nassociation at the projected CHIME/FRB Outrigger detection rate.

Simulating fermionic systems is both a problem with clear\nreal-world applications and a computationally challenging task. In order to\nsimulate a system of fermions on a quantum computer, one has to first map the\nfermionic Hamiltonian to a qubit Hamiltonian. The most popular such mapping is\nthe Jordan-Wigner encoding, which suffers from inefficiencies caused by the\nhigh weight of some encoded operators. As a result, alternative local encodings\nhave been proposed that solve this problem at the expense of a constant factor\nincrease in the number of qubits required. Some such encodings possess local\nstabilizers, i.e., Pauli operators that act as the logical identity on the\nencoded fermionic modes. A natural error mitigation approach in these cases is\nto measure the stabilizers and discard any run where a measurement returns a -1\noutcome. Using a high-performance stabilizer simulator, we classically simulate\nthe performance of a local encoding known as the Derby-Klassen encoding and\ncompare its performance with the Jordan-Wigner encoding and the ternary tree\nencoding. Our simulations use more complex error models and significantly\nlarger system sizes (up to $18\\times18$) than in previous work. We find that\nthe high sampling requirements of postselection methods with the Derby-Klassen\nencoding pose a limitation to its applicability in near-term devices and call\nfor more encoding-specific circuit optimizations.",

In this paper we calculate such DM-induced\nhigh-energy neutrinos, from TXS 0506+056 as well as from a stacked blazar\nsample, in the four cases where DM-quark interactions are mediated by a new\nmassive vector, axial, scalar, and pseudoscalar particle. Intriguingly, we find\nthat this mechanism can saturate the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux\nobserved by IceCube at high energies. Our mechanism will be tested by\nadditional blazar observations and by various searches for sub-GeV DM.",

These galaxies are\nselected from the ASPIRE survey, a JWST Cycle-1 medium and ALMA Cycle-9 large\nprogram targeting 25 quasars and their environments at $z\\simeq6.5 - 6.8$.\nThese galaxies are identified as companions to UV-luminous quasars and robustly\ndetected in ALMA continuum and [C II] emission, yet they are extraordinarily\nfaint at the NIRCam wavelengths (down to $>28.0$ AB mag in the F356W band).\nThey are more obscured than galaxies like Arp220, and thus we refer to them as\n\"NIRCam-dark\" starburst galaxies (star formation rate $\\simeq 80 -\n250\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). Such galaxies are typically missed\nby (sub)-millimeter blank-field surveys. From the star-formation history (SFH),\nwe show that the NIRCam-dark galaxies are viable progenitors of massive\nquiescent galaxies at $z\\gtrsim4$ and descendants of UV-luminous galaxies at\n$z>10$. Although it is hard to constrain their number density from a quasar\nsurvey, we conclude that NIRCam-dark galaxies can be as abundant as\n$n\\sim10^{-5.5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ assuming a light halo occupation model. If true,\nthis would equal to $\\sim$30% of the number densities of both the quiescent\ngalaxies at $z\\gtrsim4$ and UV-luminous galaxies at $z>10$. We further predict\nthat analogs at $z\\sim8$ should exist according to the SFH of early massive\nquiescent galaxies. However, they may fall below the current detection limits\nof wide JWST and ALMA surveys, thus remaining \"JWST-dark\". To fully trace the\nevolution of massive galaxies and dust-obscured cosmic star formation at\n$z\\gtrsim8$, wide-field JWST/NIRCam imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys\nof early protoclusters are essential.",

    "abstract": "Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) by analyzing the eigenspectrum of\ntheir weights has been an active area of research in recent years. One of the\nmain approaches involves measuring the heavytailness of the empirical spectral\ndensities (ESDs) of weight matrices. This analysis has been shown to provide\ninsights to help diagnose whether a model is well-trained or undertrained, and\nhas been used to guide training methods involving layer-wise hyperparameter\nassignment. In this paper, we address an often-overlooked challenge in\nestimating the heavytailness of these ESDs: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices. We demonstrate that matrices of varying sizes (and aspect\nratios) introduce a non-negligible bias in estimating the heavytailness of\nESDs, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and layer-wise hyperparameter\nassignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio\nMatrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the weight matrices by\nsubsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead of measuring the\nheavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD of these\nsubsampled submatrices. We show that this method effectively mitigates the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly\nimproves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. In one of the LLM pruning experiments,\nFARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model by 17.3% when compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

This is true even for the idealized unlearning\nmethod of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to\nunwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient\nto achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a\nrandomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired\nbehaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,\ndistillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose\nUnlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an\nunlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a\ntunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto\nfrontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,\nUNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data\nfiltering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of\nthe pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies\nunlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)\nbenchmark.

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic\nunderstanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,\npartly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,\n``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval\nover deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically\ngenerated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are\neasier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this\npaper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can\ncomprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length\nmovies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,\nopen-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs\n-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.\nThese claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and\nemotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that\nhumans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice\nformats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models\nmust correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases\nlike answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art\nmodels fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of\nthe task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over\ncritical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.",

We detail several tests to validate the capability of the DR6\nparametric foreground model to describe current observations and complex\nsimulations, and show that cosmological parameter constraints are robust\nagainst model extensions and variations. We demonstrate consistency of the\nmodel with pre-DR6 ACT data and observations from Planck and the South Pole\nTelescope.

In all\nscenarios, the DR6 $\\Lambda$CDM and $\\Lambda$CDM+$N_{\\rm eff}$ cosmological\nparameters shift by less than $0.5\\sigma$ relative to the baseline constraints.\nSome foreground parameters shift more; we estimate their systematic\nuncertainties associated with modeling choices.

    "abstract": "Surprisingly compact substructures in galaxies and galaxy clusters, but also\nfield halos, have been observed by gravitational lensing. They could be\ndifficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those\nobjects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos\nconsisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple\nmodels of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact\nobjects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase,\nwhere a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos\nwhile avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe to which typical SIDM models are\nsubject. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM model\nconsisting of two species with unequal masses, which features only interactions\nbetween the different species but not within themselves. Employing $N$-body\nsimulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the evolution\nof an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its evolution with\nhigh central densities are simulated. We find that our two-species SIDM models\ncan produce density cores with their size depending on the mass ratio of the\ntwo species. Moreover, mass segregation caused by the unequal particle masses\nleads to a finite final density state or at least a slowly growing density,\nwhich depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction of the two DM species.\nSIDM models consisting of two DM species can simultaneously explain DM halos\nwith density cores, as well as systems that are denser in their centre than\nexpected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe.\nThey are a compelling alternative to single-species models, offering a rich\nphenomenology.",

    "abstract": "The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter\n(DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly\ncompact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions,\nhalos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the\ncentral region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse\nphase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand\nnumerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter\n(SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better\nunderstanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body\nsimulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external\ngravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of\nthe stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to\nenergy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially\nspeed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can\ndescribe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have\nsimulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we\nmake the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the\ncurrent numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late\ncollapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g.\nthat the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to\nrun simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations\nof GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.",

We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on\neach corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a\nCartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge\ncan be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus.

Instead, we propose\nself-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations\nabout the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.\nWe find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of\nICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve.

    "abstract": "Bandeira et al. (2022) introduced the Franz-Parisi (FP) criterion for\ncharacterizing the computational hard phases in statistical detection problems.\nThe FP criterion, based on an annealed version of the celebrated Franz-Parisi\npotential from statistical physics, was shown to be equivalent to low-degree\npolynomial (LDP) lower bounds for Gaussian additive models, thereby connecting\ntwo distinct approaches to understanding the computational hardness in\nstatistical inference. In this paper, we propose a refined FP criterion that\naims to better capture the geometric ``overlap\" structure of statistical\nmodels. Our main result establishes that this optimized FP criterion is\nequivalent to Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds -- another foundational\nframework in computational complexity of statistical inference. Crucially, this\nequivalence holds under a mild, verifiable assumption satisfied by a broad\nclass of statistical models, including Gaussian additive models, planted sparse\nmodels, as well as non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA), single-index (SI)\nmodels, and convex truncation detection settings. For instance, in the case of\nconvex truncation tasks, the assumption is equivalent with the Gaussian\ncorrelation inequality (Royen, 2014) from convex geometry.\n  In addition to the above, our equivalence not only unifies and simplifies the\nderivation of several known SQ lower bounds -- such as for the NGCA model\n(Diakonikolas et al., 2017) and the SI model (Damian et al., 2024) -- but also\nyields new SQ lower bounds of independent interest, including for the\ncomputational gaps in mixed sparse linear regression (Arpino et al., 2023) and\nconvex truncation (De et al., 2023).",

The proposed method builds upon the concept of Velocity\nObstacles (VO) that was later extended to Nonlinear Velocity Obstacles (NLVO)\nto account for obstacles moving along nonlinear trajectories. The NLVO is\nextended in this paper to Acceleration Obstacles (AO) and Nonlinear\nAcceleration Obstacles (NAO) that account for velocity and acceleration\nconstraints. Multi-robot navigation is achieved by using the same avoidance\nalgorithm by all robots. At each time step, the trajectories of all robots are\npredicted based on their current velocity and acceleration to allow the\ncomputation of their respective NLVO, AO and NAO.\n  The introduction of AO and NAO allows the generation of safe avoidance\nmaneuvers that account for the robot dynamic constraints better than could be\ndone with the NLVO alone. This paper demonstrates the use of AO and NAO for\nrobot navigation in challenging environments. It is shown that using AO and NAO\nenables simultaneous real-time collision avoidance while accounting for robot\nkinematics and a direct consideration of its dynamic constraints.

This study addresses\nthe critical need for a tool that provides scaffolds for novice educators in\nselecting literature texts that are diverse -- in terms of genre, theme,\nsubtheme, and author -- yet similar in context and pedagogical merits. We have\ndeveloped a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher\nScaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based\non pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph.\nWe constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and\nRepresentation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which\nwas then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both\napproaches.

    "abstract": "The invariant-mass distribution for the coherent photoproduction of dipions\nin ultraperipheral PbPb collisions is measured using data, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of $ 224.6 \\pm 9.6\\ \\mu$b$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb\nexperiment in 2018 at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=5.02$ TeV. The dominant contribution is due to the $\\rho^0$ meson but a\nconsistent description across the full invariant-mass range requires accounting\nfor the $\\omega$ meson and introducing two resonances at masses of $1350\\pm20$\nMeV and $1790\\pm20$ MeV with widths of about 300 MeV. The cross-section for\neach meson is measured differentially in twelve bins of rapidity from 2.05 to\n4.90. Significant nuclear suppression is observed for the $\\rho^0$ meson\ncompared to expectations based on photoproduction on the proton.",

    "abstract": "Optical galaxy cluster identification algorithms such as redMaPPer promise to\nenable an array of astrophysical and cosmological studies, but suffer from\nbiases whereby galaxies in front of and behind a galaxy cluster are mistakenly\nassociated with the primary cluster halo. These projection effects caused by\nirreducible photometric uncertainty must be quantified to facilitate the use of\noptical cluster catalogues. We present measurements of galaxy cluster\nprojection effects and velocity dispersion using spectroscopy from the Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Representative data from DESI enables\ncharacterizing these properties of clusters identified with the redMaPPer\nalgorithm. Our findings are as follows: we confirm that the fraction of\nredMaPPer putative member galaxies mistakenly associated with cluster haloes is\nrichness dependent, being more than twice as large at low richness than high\nrichness; we present the first spectroscopic evidence of an increase in\nprojection effects with increasing redshift, by as much as 25 per cent from\n$z\\sim0.1$ to $z\\sim0.2$; moreover, we find qualitative evidence for luminosity\ndependence in projection effects, with fainter galaxies being more commonly far\nbehind clusters than their bright counterparts; finally we fit the scaling\nrelation between measured mean spectroscopic richness and velocity dispersion,\nfinding an implied linear scaling between spectroscopic richness and halo mass.\nWe discuss further directions for the application of spectroscopic datasets to\nimprove use of optically selected clusters to test cosmological models.",

    "abstract": "Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training\nEnergy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational\ndescription of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a\nchallenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire\nsystem trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of\nboundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized\nLagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational\nformulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields\ndifferent learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the\nsystem, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that\nHamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed\nRecurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation\n(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is\nthe only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a\ndesirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it\noperates in a \"forward-only\" manner (i.e. using the same system for both\ninference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more\npasses through the system regardless of model size), and enables local\nlearning.",

This hypothesis integrates Bystryn's antibody\nfeedback phenomenon and Imbiakha's immune cost theory, proposing for the first\ntime a \"Consumption-Driven Dynamic Competition of Antibody Clones\" mechanism.\nThis mechanism posits that the immune system may regulate the proliferation and\ndifferentiation of corresponding B cell clones by sensing and responding to the\nconsumption rate of specific antibodies. This competition, driven by\ndifferences in consumption rates, might not only influence pathogen clearance\nefficiency and associated acute pathology during the antigen growth phase but\nalso critically mediate the onset, development, and even resolution of\npost-infection sequelae during the antigen decay and homeostasis\nre-establishment phases. The proposed three-phase \"consumption-driven dynamic\ncompetition\" model provides a unified and dynamic explanatory framework for\nunderstanding the significant individual variability and dynamic evolution of\npost-infection immune outcomes (including the emergence and self-limitation of\nacute symptoms, the formation and persistence of chronic sequelae, and symptom\nfluctuations or resolution). It emphasizes not just specific molecules but the\nmacroscopic dynamics of competition and selection within the immune system,\noffering a theoretical basis for exploring new intervention strategies for\nsequelae (e.g., by regulating the balance of antibody competition).",

It is a crucial component\nin modern recommendation systems, where users' previously engaged items serve\nas trigger items to retrieve relevant content for future engagement. However,\nexisting I2I retrieval models in industry are primarily built on co-engagement\ndata and optimized using the recall measure, which overly emphasizes\nco-engagement patterns while failing to capture semantic relevance.

Our model consists of two key components: 1) a multi-task learning\nloss for formally optimizing the trade-off between recall and semantic\nrelevance, and 2) a multi-head I2I retrieval architecture for retrieving both\nhighly co-engaged and semantically relevant items. We evaluate MTMH using\nproprietary data from a commercial platform serving billions of users and\ndemonstrate that it can improve recall by up to 14.4% and semantic relevance by\nup to 56.6% compared with prior state-of-the-art models.

We find two distinct types\nof ground states, one with a well defined parity and another with an\nalternating parity where a doubly degenerate ground state takes place at\nexceptional points, known as parity switching points. The double ground state\nhosts edge states weakly affected by the cavity coupling, even in the low\nfrequency regime, in contrast with higher excited states showing strong\ndependence with the cavity coupling.

    "abstract": "Networks of interconnected neurons display diverse patterns of collective\nactivity. Relating this collective activity to the network's connectivity\nstructure is a key goal of computational neuroscience. We approach this\nquestion for clustered networks, which can form via biologically realistic\nlearning rules and allow for the re-activation of learned patterns. Previous\nstudies of clustered networks have focused on metastabilty between fixed\npoints, leaving open the question of whether clustered spiking networks can\ndisplay more rich dynamics--and if so, whether these can be predicted from\ntheir connectivity. Here, we show that in the limits of large population size\nand fast inhibition, the combinatorial threshold linear network (CTLN) model is\na mean-field theory for inhibition-stabilized nonlinear Hawkes networks with\nclustered connectivity. The CTLN has a large body of ``graph rules'' relating\nnetwork structure to dynamics. By applying these, we can predict the dynamic\nattractors of our clustered spiking networks from the structure of\nbetween-cluster connectivity. This allows us to construct networks displaying a\ndiverse array of nonlinear cluster dynamics, including metastable periodic\norbits and chaotic attractors. Relaxing the assumption that inhibition is fast,\nwe see that the CTLN model is still able to predict the activity of clustered\nspiking networks with reasonable inhibitory timescales. For slow enough\ninhibition, we observe bifurcations between CTLN-like dynamics and global\nexcitatory/inhibitory oscillations.",

Experiments\nreveal that, in thinner $HfO_2$ films ($<100\\,nm$), $E_c$ increases with\ndecreasing thickness but at a slower rate than predicted by the JKD theory. In\nthicker films, $E_c$ saturates and is independent of thickness. Prior studies\nattributed the thick film saturation to the thickness-independent grain size,\nwhich limits the domain growth. However, the reduced dependence in thinner\nfilms is poorly understood. In this work, we expound the reduced thickness\ndependence of $E_c$, attributing it to the anisotropic crystal structure of the\npolar orthorhombic (o) phase of $HfO_2$. This phase consists of continuous\npolar layers (CPL) along one in-plane direction and alternating polar and\nspacer layers (APSL) along the orthogonal direction. The spacer layers decouple\nadjacent polar layers along APSL, increasing the energy barrier for domain\ngrowth compared to CPL direction. As a result, the growth of nucleated domains\nis confined to a single polar plane in $HfO_2$, forming half-prolate elliptical\ncylindrical geometry rather than half-prolate spheroid geometry observed in\nperovskites. By modeling the nucleation and growth energetics of these confined\ndomains, we derive a modified scaling law of $E_c \\propto d^{-1/2}$ for $HfO_2$\nthat deviates from the classical JKD dependence of $E_c \\propto d^{-2/3}$.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image\nretrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications\nremains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot\naction. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,\nthat is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental\nrepresentations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task\nof Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored\nsetting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through\nmulti-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful\ninteractive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with\nclear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or\nabstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective\nfor users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative\nmulti-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to\nexplicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic\nvisual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to\nrefine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully\nautomated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.\nExperimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing\ninteractive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with\na dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation\nfor future research in this direction.",

    "abstract": "We introduce STSBench, a scenario-based framework to benchmark the holistic\nunderstanding of vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The\nframework automatically mines pre-defined traffic scenarios from any dataset\nusing ground-truth annotations, provides an intuitive user interface for\nefficient human verification, and generates multiple-choice questions for model\nevaluation. Applied to the NuScenes dataset, we present STSnu, the first\nbenchmark that evaluates the spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs\nbased on comprehensive 3D perception. Existing benchmarks typically target\noff-the-shelf or fine-tuned VLMs for images or videos from a single viewpoint\nand focus on semantic tasks such as object recognition, dense captioning, risk\nassessment, or scene understanding. In contrast, STSnu evaluates driving expert\nVLMs for end-to-end driving, operating on videos from multi-view cameras or\nLiDAR. It specifically assesses their ability to reason about both ego-vehicle\nactions and complex interactions among traffic participants, a crucial\ncapability for autonomous vehicles. The benchmark features 43 diverse scenarios\nspanning multiple views and frames, resulting in 971 human-verified\nmultiple-choice questions. A thorough evaluation uncovers critical shortcomings\nin existing models' ability to reason about fundamental traffic dynamics in\ncomplex environments. These findings highlight the urgent need for\narchitectural advances that explicitly model spatio-temporal reasoning. By\naddressing a core gap in spatio-temporal evaluation, STSBench enables the\ndevelopment of more robust and explainable VLMs for autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "Many centralized mechanisms for two-sided matching markets that enjoy strong\ntheoretical properties assume that the planner solicits full information on the\npreferences of each participating agent. In particular, they expect that\nparticipants compile and communicate their complete preference lists over\nagents from the other side of the market. However, real-world markets are often\nvery large and agents cannot always be expected to even produce a ranking of\nall options on the other side. It is therefore important to understand the\nimpact of incomplete or truncated lists on the quality of the resultant\nmatching.\n  In this paper, we focus on the Serial Dictatorship mechanism in a model where\neach agent of the proposing side (students) has a random preference list of\nlength $d$, sampled independently and uniformly at random from $n$ schools,\neach of which has one seat. Our main result shows that if the students\nprimarily care about being matched to any school of their list (as opposed to\nending up unmatched), then all students in position $i\\leq n$ will prefer\nmarkets with longer lists, when $n$ is large enough. Schools on the other hand\nwill always prefer longer lists in our model. We moreover investigate the\nimpact of $d$ on the rank of the school that a student gets matched to.\n  Our main result suggests that markets that are well-approximated by our\nhypothesis and where the demand of schools does not exceed supply should be\ndesigned with preference lists as long as reasonable, since longer lists would\nfavor all agents.",

Flashing-induced instability occurring\nin the open NCS will cause the system structural vibration as well as\nmechanical damage and bring safety problems. The study on flashing-flow\nbehaviors in an open NPS has been conducted experimentally in this paper.\nHigh-speed camera, thermal needle probe and wire-mesh sensor were adopted to\nrecord the flow pattern and measure the void fraction in the polycarbonate\nvisualization riser section. In the start-up process, with the inlet\ntemperature in the riser section increasing, the open NCS has experienced\nsingle-phase stable flow, intermittent oscillation between single-phase and\ntwo-phase, high subcooling two-phase stable flow, flashing-induced\ninstabilities flow, and low subcooling two-phase stable flow. The flow pattern\nevolution of flow flashing goes through bubble flow, cap-slug flow, churn flow\nand wispy annular flow, in which the length of churn can account for more than\n40% length of the two-phase regime.

By contrasting augmented\nviews of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various\ndownstream tasks, such as node and graph classification.

Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset\nand estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared\nsemantics and structure.

In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks\nconsisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to\ndiscover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and\niterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,\nexploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent\nprogress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings\nremains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a\nlarge-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess\nstep-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is\nannotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive\nskill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic\nanalysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,\nwith the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise\naccuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that\nfine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from\n4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near\nzero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,\nare bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack\nsketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning.

    "abstract": "Modern robot navigation systems encounter difficulties in diverse and complex\nindoor environments. Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small\nmodels or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To\naddress this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture,\nAstra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a\nmultimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal\nlocalization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and\noutperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a\nmultitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D\nspatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates\nrobust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow\nmatching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for\ngenerating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor\ninputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot.\nDeployed on real in-house mobile robots, Astra achieves high end-to-end mission\nsuccess rate across diverse indoor environments.",

    "abstract": "Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce\noverall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed\nto mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,\nfor example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the\nwind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust\nwake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning\napproaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.\nThis work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a\nwake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces\na novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head\nself-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.\nThe resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy\nproduction in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on\nsteady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires\napproximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural\nnetwork and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization\nbaseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering\ncontroller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in\na low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.",

    "abstract": "Manipulation has long been a challenging task for robots, while humans can\neffortlessly perform complex interactions with objects, such as hanging a cup\non the mug rack. A key reason is the lack of a large and uniform dataset for\nteaching robots manipulation skills. Current robot datasets often record robot\naction in different action spaces within a simple scene. This hinders the robot\nto learn a unified and robust action representation for different robots within\ndiverse scenes. Observing how humans understand a manipulation task, we find\nthat understanding how the objects should move in the 3D space is a critical\nclue for guiding actions. This clue is embodiment-agnostic and suitable for\nboth humans and different robots. Motivated by this, we aim to learn a 3D flow\nworld model from both human and robot manipulation data. This model predicts\nthe future movement of the interacting objects in 3D space, guiding action\nplanning for manipulation. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale 3D optical\nflow dataset, named ManiFlow-110k, through a moving object auto-detect\npipeline. A video diffusion-based world model then learns manipulation physics\nfrom these data, generating 3D optical flow trajectories conditioned on\nlanguage instructions. With the generated 3D object optical flow, we propose a\nflow-guided rendering mechanism, which renders the predicted final state and\nleverages GPT-4o to assess whether the predicted flow aligns with the task\ndescription. This equips the robot with a closed-loop planning ability.\nFinally, we consider the predicted 3D optical flow as constraints for an\noptimization policy to determine a chunk of robot actions for manipulation.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate strong generalization across diverse robotic\nmanipulation tasks and reliable cross-embodiment adaptation without\nhardware-specific training.",

    "abstract": "Quantum guessing games offer a structured approach to analyzing quantum\ninformation processing, where information is encoded in quantum states and\nextracted through measurement. An additional aspect of this framework is the\ninfluence of partial knowledge about the input on the optimal measurement\nstrategies. This kind of side information can significantly influence the\nguessing strategy and earlier work has shown that the timing of such side\ninformation, whether revealed before or after the measurement, can affect the\nsuccess probabilities. In this work, we go beyond this established distinction\nby introducing the concept of metainformation. Metainformation is information\nabout information, and in our context it is knowledge that additional side\ninformation of certain type will become later available, even if it is not yet\nprovided. We show that this seemingly subtle difference between having no\nexpectation of further information versus knowing it will arrive can have\noperational consequences for the guessing task. Our results demonstrate that\nmetainformation can, in certain scenarios, enhance the achievable success\nprobability up to the point that post-measurement side information becomes as\nuseful as prior-measurement side information, while in others it offers no\nbenefit. By formally distinguishing metainformation from actual side\ninformation, we uncover a finer structure in the interplay between timing,\ninformation, and strategy, offering new insights into the capabilities of\nquantum systems in information processing tasks.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of the bodys\nmetabolic state and behaviors related to survival. Despite its importance\nhowever, many questions exist regarding the intrinsic and extrinsic connections\nof the hypothalamus in humans, especially its relationship with the cortex. As\na heterogeneous structure, it is possible that the hypothalamus is composed of\ndifferent subregions, which have their own distinct relationships with the\ncortex. Previous work on functional connectivity in the human hypothalamus have\neither treated it as a unitary structure or relied on methodological approaches\nthat are limited in modeling its intrinsic functional architecture. Here, we\nused resting state data from ultrahigh field 7 Tesla fMRI and a data driven\nanalytical approach to identify functional subregions of the human\nhypothalamus. Our approach identified four functional hypothalamic subregions\nbased on intrinsic functional connectivity, which in turn showed distinct\npatterns of functional connectivity with cortex. Overall, all hypothalamic\nsubregions showed stronger connectivity with a cortical network, Cortical\nNetwork 1 composed primarily of frontal, midline, and limbic cortical areas and\nweaker connectivity with a second cortical network composed largely of\nposterior sensorimotor regions, Cortical Network 2. Of the hypothalamic\nsubregions, the anterior hypothalamus showed the strongest connection to\nCortical Network 1, while a more ventral subregion containing the anterior\nhypothalamus extending to the tuberal region showed the weakest connectivity.\nThe findings support the use of ultrahigh field, high resolution imaging in\nproviding a more incisive investigation of the human hypothalamus that respects\nits complex internal structure and extrinsic functional architecture.",

However,\nthese methods struggle with complex scenes, especially when dynamic changes in\nobject position, material, and size significantly alter sound effects. These\ncontinuous variations lead to fluctuating acoustic transfer distributions,\nmaking it challenging to represent with basic data structures and render\nefficiently in real time. To address this challenge, we present Neural Acoustic\nTransfer, a novel approach that utilizes an implicit neural representation to\nencode precomputed acoustic transfer and its variations, allowing for real-time\nprediction of sound fields under varying conditions. To efficiently generate\nthe training data required for the neural acoustic field, we developed a fast\nMonte-Carlo-based boundary element method (BEM) approximation for general\nscenarios with smooth Neumann conditions. Additionally, we implemented a\nGPU-accelerated version of standard BEM for scenarios requiring higher\nprecision. These methods provide the necessary training data, enabling our\nneural network to accurately model the sound radiation space. We demonstrate\nour method's numerical accuracy and runtime efficiency (within several\nmilliseconds for 30s audio) through comprehensive validation and comparisons in\ndiverse acoustic transfer scenarios. Our approach allows for efficient and\naccurate modeling of sound behavior in dynamically changing environments, which\ncan benefit a wide range of interactive applications such as virtual reality,\naugmented reality, and advanced audio production.",

    "abstract": "Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning\nalgorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These\nmethods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient\nascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy\ngradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.\nIndeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve\nefficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as\nprevious gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received\nsubstantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of\n$O(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored\nfrom a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous\ntheoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can\nsignificantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean\ncorrection to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG\n(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new\ntrajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under\nestablished assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We\nfurther validate empirically our approach against PG methods with\nstate-of-the-art rates.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Delphos, a deep reinforcement learning framework for assisting\nthe discrete choice model specification process. Unlike traditional approaches\nthat treat model specification as a static optimisation problem, Delphos\nrepresents a paradigm shift: it frames this specification challenge as a\nsequential decision-making problem, formalised as a Markov Decision Process. In\nthis setting, an agent learns to specify well-performing model candidates by\nchoosing a sequence of modelling actions - such as selecting variables,\naccommodating both generic and alternative-specific taste parameters, applying\nnon-linear transformations, and including interactions with covariates - and\ninteracting with a modelling environment that estimates each candidate and\nreturns a reward signal. Specifically, Delphos uses a Deep Q-Network that\nreceives delayed rewards based on modelling outcomes (e.g., log-likelihood) and\nbehavioural expectations (e.g., parameter signs), and distributes rewards\nacross the sequence of actions to learn which modelling decisions lead to\nwell-performing candidates. We evaluate Delphos on both simulated and empirical\ndatasets, varying the size of the modelling space and the reward function. To\nassess the agent's performance in navigating the model space, we analyse the\nlearning curve, the distribution of Q-values, occupancy metrics, and Pareto\nfronts. Our results show that the agent learns to adaptively explore strategies\nto identify well-performing models across search spaces, even without prior\ndomain knowledge. It efficiently explores large modelling spaces, concentrates\nits search in high-reward regions, and suggests candidates that define Pareto\nfrontiers balancing model fit and behavioural plausibility. These findings\nhighlight the potential of this novel adaptive, learning-based framework to\nassist in the model specification process.",

The main extensions are to account for the attractive nature of\nelectron-ion interactions and to model short-range quantum effects using the\nKelbg potential. By reducing the electron-ion force inside the deBroglie\nwavelength, the Kelbg potential causes a decay at high frequencies and a\ndecrease in magnitude of the low frequency bremsstrahlung spectrum. The\nattractive electron-ion interaction also allows for classically bound states\nthat show up as peaks in the emission spectrum. Results show that the Kelbg\npotential can capture quantum modifications to classical Gaunt factors, but is\nlimited in describing emission at very high frequencies. This work further\nsupports the notion that there is a peak in emission near the plasma frequency\nat strong coupling that cannot be captured using the common Drude correction.\nImportantly, the linear response framework used to calculate the bremsstrahlung\nemission coefficient is related to both the absorption coefficient and the real\npart of the dynamic electrical conductivity. This means that the conclusions\ndrawn from this study can be applied to these transport coefficients as well.\nFinally, this work compares the results with commonly used classical and\nquantum mechanical Gaunt factors, and discusses the impact of a Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution of electrons on emission and why screening slightly reduces the\nbremsstrahlung power in weakly coupled and non-degenerate plasmas.",

Complex dynamical systems\nare characterized by temporal complexity associated with intermittent\nbirth-death events of self-organizing behavior. These rapid transition events\n(RTEs) can be modelled as a stochastic point process on the time axis, with\ninter-event times (IETs) revealing rich dynamics. In particular, IETs with\npower-law distribution mark a departure from the Poisson statistics and\nindicate the presence of nontrivial complexity that is quantified by the\npower-law exponent $\\mu$ of the IET distribution. However, detection of RTEs in\nnoisy signals remains a challenge, since false positives can obscure the\nstatistical structure of the underlying process. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of quantifying the effect of the event detection tool on the accuracy\nof complexity estimation. This is reached through a systematic evaluation of\nthe Event-Driven Diffusion Scaling (EDDiS) algorithm, a tool exploiting\nevent-driven diffusion to estimate temporal complexity.After introducing the\nevent detection method RTE-Finder (RTEF), we assess the performance of the\nRTEF-EDDiS pipeline using event-driven synthetic signals. The reliability of\nthe RTEF is found to strongly depend on parameters such as the percentile and\nthe number of false positives can be much higher than the number of genuine\ncomplex events.

However, due to\nsparse in-situ measurements and the limitation of remote sensing, properties of\nthese clouds remain largely unknown. Based on research conducted in past\ndecades, this article reviews the observational structure of cloud properties,\nthe progress of microphysical and simplified cloud model developments, and\nperspectives of future directions of this research field. Several possible\nsolutions to the challenges associated with the coupling effect, ultraviolet\nabsorption, and habitability are proposed and discussed in details, providing\ninsights for future Venus' explorations.",

Existing graph based BCSA approaches capture more binary code\nsemantics and demonstrate remarkable performance.

To address this issue, we develop ORCAS, an Obfuscation-Resilient\nBCSA model based on Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG). The DESG is an\noriginal binary code representation, capturing more binaries' implicit\nsemantics without control flow structure, including inter-instruction relations\n(e.g., def-use), inter-basic block relations (i.e., dominance and\npost-dominance), and instruction-basic block relations. ORCAS takes binary\nfunctions from different obfuscation options, optimization levels, and\ninstruction set architectures as input and scores their semantic similarity\nmore robustly. Extensive experiments have been conducted on ORCAS against eight\nbaseline approaches over the BinKit dataset. For example, ORCAS achieves an\naverage 12.1% PR-AUC improvement when using combined three obfuscation options\ncompared to the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, an original\nobfuscated real-world vulnerability dataset has been constructed and released\nto facilitate a more comprehensive research on obfuscated binary code analysis.\nORCAS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches over this newly released\nreal-world vulnerability dataset by up to a recall improvement of 43%.",

With the rapid advancement of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), a recent study explored the integration of HGNNs with\nLLMs for generalizable heterogeneous graph learning. However, this approach\ntypically encodes structural information as HG tokens using HGNNs, and\ndisparities in embedding spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias\nthe LLM's comprehension of HGs. Moreover, since these HG tokens are often\nderived from node-level tasks, the model's ability to generalize across tasks\nremains limited. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Masked Language\nModeling-based method, called MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual\nsequences instead of HG tokens to extract structural and semantic information\ninherent in HGs, and designs customized textual templates to unify different\ngraph tasks into a coherent cloze-style 'mask' token prediction paradigm.\nSpecifically,MLM4HG first converts HGs from various domains to texts based on\nmetapaths, and subsequently combines them with the unified task texts to form a\nHG-based corpus. Moreover, the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for\nfine-tuning with a constrained target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to\ngeneralize to unseen target HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task\nexperiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior generalization\nperformance of MLM4HG over state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and\nzero-shot scenarios.

    "abstract": "The interstellar hydride hydroxyl (OH) is a potential tracer of CO-dark\nmolecular gas. We present new absorption line observations of OH at 18-cm\nwavelength towards four continuum sources. We compare these to the [CII] line\nat 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21\ncm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large\nrange of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with\nrespect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity\nand spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We\nidentify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet\nseveral with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of\n[CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one\nsightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across\ndiffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity\nlimits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular\ngas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH\nabsorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper\nobservations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full\npotential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an\nexclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting\ntransitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we\ndetect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the\nOH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand,\nand the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides\nadditional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures\ntypical of HII regions.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the ground-state phase diagram and topological properties\nof the spinless 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with nearest-neighbor (NN)\ninteractions at quarter filling.

This approach enables\nprecise identification of phase transition critical points.

    "abstract": "Data quality is fundamental to modern data science workflows, where data\ncontinuously flows as unbounded streams feeding critical downstream tasks, from\nelementary analytics to advanced artificial intelligence models. Existing data\nquality approaches either focus exclusively on static data or treat streaming\nas an extension of batch processing, lacking the temporal granularity and\ncontextual awareness required for true streaming applications. In this paper,\nwe present a novel data quality monitoring model specifically designed for\nunbounded data streams. Our model introduces stream-first concepts, such as\nconfigurable windowing mechanisms, dynamic constraint adaptation, and\ncontinuous assessment that produces quality meta-streams for real-time pipeline\nawareness. To demonstrate practical applicability, we developed Stream DaQ, an\nopen-source Python framework that implements our theoretical model. Stream DaQ\nunifies and adapts over 30 quality checks fragmented across existing static\ntools into a comprehensive streaming suite, enabling practitioners to define\nsophisticated, context-aware quality constraints through compositional\nexpressiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates that the model's implementation\nsignificantly outperforms a production-grade alternative in both execution time\nand throughput while offering richer functionality via native streaming\ncapabilities compared to other choices. Through its Python-native design,\nStream DaQ seamlessly integrates with modern data science workflows, making\ncontinuous quality monitoring accessible to the broader data science community.",

Retrieval systems typically treat\nthese modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and\nsubpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where\nrelevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple\nmodalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must\ndynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the\nquery. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that\njointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,\nand metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal\nbackbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic\nmodality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training\ndata for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale\nsynthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in\nvarious languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we\npropose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard\ncontrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality\nusage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation\nstrategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade\nperformance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR\nconsistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR\nimproves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4\nover the best multi-modality retriever.

In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO\nmethods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated\nResearch Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark\ntasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important\ntypes of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and\nmulti-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark\ncollections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to\nlibrary to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies\non a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and\nbenchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the\nevaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of\ntasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.\nTo address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the\nstar discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a\nresult, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task\ntype, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become\navailable, enabling efficient evaluations.

Recent JWST observations\nfound evidence for an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and\nstar formation rate up to $z\\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It\nis crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by\nthe IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of\nhigh-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflow\nparameters. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by\nthe cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation\nrate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\\sim 4-10$. Using the\nsemi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles\nalong merger trees built from a high-resolution cosmological simulation.\nStellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering\nthe full metallicity range ($Z \\sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass\nrange ($m_\\star\\sim2 - 600\\ \\rm M_\\odot$) including the metal yields from\nstellar winds and all types of SNe.

Despite clear biological\ninterpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental\nvalidation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on\nthis framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the\n\\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived\nfrom a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of\nthree coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,\nlateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,\nintermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral\nsynaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,\nrespectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove\nconvergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first\nlevel (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and\nglobal exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At\nthe second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the\ncost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow\ndynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final\nlevel (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,\nprovide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure\nconvergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.\nThese results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported\nby thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of\nour approach via a numerical example.",

    "abstract": "The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn\nmultiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general\nhidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant\nchallenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced\noptimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient\ndescent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the\nmultitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would\nhinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge\narises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different\nmagnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to\ninterfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient\nsurgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting\ngradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a\nnovel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery\n(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient\nmagnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS\nsurgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order\nmomentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS\non synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks.

To overcome this bottleneck, researchers have\nintroduced event cameras and proposed event-guided low-light image enhancement\nalgorithms. However, these methods neglect the influence of global\nlow-frequency noise caused by dynamic lighting conditions and local structural\ndiscontinuities in sparse event data. To address these issues, we propose an\ninnovative Bidirectional guided Low-light Image Enhancement framework (BiLIE).\nSpecifically, to mitigate the significant low-frequency noise introduced by\nglobal illumination step changes, we introduce the frequency high-pass\nfiltering-based Event Feature Enhancement (EFE) module at the event\nrepresentation level to suppress the interference of low-frequency information,\nand preserve and highlight the high-frequency edges.Furthermore, we design a\nBidirectional Cross Attention Fusion (BCAF) mechanism to acquire high-frequency\nstructures and edges while suppressing structural discontinuities and local\nnoise introduced by sparse event guidance, thereby generating smoother fused\nrepresentations.Additionally, considering the poor visual quality and color\nbias in existing datasets, we provide a new dataset (RELIE), with high-quality\nground truth through a reliable enhancement scheme. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed BiLIE outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods by 0.96dB in PSNR and 0.03 in LPIPS.",

    "abstract": "As satellite systems become increasingly vulnerable to physical layer attacks\nvia SDRs, novel countermeasures are being developed to protect critical\nsystems, particularly those lacking cryptographic protection, or those which\ncannot be upgraded to support modern cryptography. Among these is transmitter\nfingerprinting, which provides mechanisms by which communication can be\nauthenticated by looking at characteristics of the transmitter, expressed as\nimpairments on the signal.\n  Previous works show that fingerprinting can be used to classify satellite\ntransmitters, or authenticate them against SDR-equipped attackers under simple\nreplay scenarios. In this paper we build upon this by looking at attacks\ndirectly targeting the fingerprinting system, with an attacker optimizing for\nmaximum impact in jamming, spoofing, and dataset poisoning attacks, and\ndemonstrate these attacks on the SatIQ system designed to authenticate Iridium\ntransmitters. We show that an optimized jamming signal can cause a 50% error\nrate with attacker-to-victim ratios as low as -30dB (far less power than\ntraditional jamming) and demonstrate successful identity forgery during\nspoofing attacks, with an attacker successfully removing their own\ntransmitter's fingerprint from messages. We also present a data poisoning\nattack, enabling persistent message spoofing by altering the data used to\nauthenticate incoming messages to include the fingerprint of the attacker's\ntransmitter.\n  Finally, we show that our model trained to optimize spoofing attacks can also\nbe used to detect spoofing and replay attacks, even when it has never seen the\nattacker's transmitter before. Furthermore, this technique works even when the\ntraining dataset includes only a single transmitter, enabling fingerprinting to\nbe used to protect small constellations and even individual satellites,\nproviding additional protection where it is needed the most.",

    "abstract": "The rising prevalence of chronic wounds, especially in aging populations,\npresents a significant healthcare challenge due to prolonged hospitalizations,\nelevated costs, and reduced patient quality of life. Traditional wound care is\nresource-intensive, requiring frequent in-person visits that strain both\npatients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Therefore, we present\nWoundAIssist, a patient-centered, AI-driven mobile application designed to\nsupport telemedical wound care. WoundAIssist enables patients to regularly\ndocument wounds at home via photographs and questionnaires, while physicians\nremain actively engaged in the care process through remote monitoring and video\nconsultations. A distinguishing feature is an integrated lightweight deep\nlearning model for on-device wound segmentation, which, combined with\npatient-reported data, enables continuous monitoring of wound healing\nprogression. Developed through an iterative, user-centered process involving\nboth patients and domain experts, WoundAIssist prioritizes an user-friendly\ndesign, particularly for elderly patients. A conclusive usability study with\npatients and dermatologists reported excellent usability, good app quality, and\nfavorable perceptions of the AI-driven wound recognition. Our main contribution\nis two-fold: (I) the implementation and (II) evaluation of WoundAIssist, an\neasy-to-use yet comprehensive telehealth solution designed to bridge the gap\nbetween patients and HCPs. Additionally, we synthesize design insights for\nremote patient monitoring apps, derived from over three years of\ninterdisciplinary research, that may inform the development of similar digital\nhealth tools across clinical domains.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of computing a perfect matching problem in a\nsynchronous distributed network, where the network topology corresponds to a\ncomplete bipartite graph. The communication between nodes is restricted to\nactivating communication links, which means that instead of sending messages\ncontaining a number of bits, each node can only send a pulse over some of its\nincident links in each round. In the port numbering model, where nodes are\nunaware of their neighbor's IDs, we give a randomized algorithm that terminates\nin $O( \\log n )$ rounds and has a pulse complexity of $O( n\\log n )$, which\ncorresponds to the number of pulses sent over all links. We also show that\nrandomness is crucial in the port numbering model, as any deterministic\nalgorithm must send at least $\\Omega( n^2 )$ messages in the standard LOCAL\nmodel, where the messages can be of unbounded size. Then, we turn our attention\nto the KT_1 assumption, where each node starts out knowing its neighbors' IDs.\nWe show that this additional knowledge enables significantly improved bounds\neven for deterministic algorithms. First, we give an $O( \\log n )$ time\ndeterministic algorithm that sends only $O( n )$ pulses. Finally, we apply this\nalgorithm recursively to obtain an exponential reduction in the time complexity\nto $O( \\log^*n\\log\\log n )$, while slightly increasing the pulse complexity to\n$O( n\\log^*n )$.

    "abstract": "The recent advance in video understanding has been driven by multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs). But these MLLMs are good at analyzing short videos,\nwhile suffering from difficulties in understanding videos with a longer\ncontext. To address this difficulty, several agent paradigms have recently been\nproposed, using MLLMs as agents for retrieving extra contextual knowledge in a\nlong video. However, most existing agents ignore the key fact that a long video\nis composed with multiple shots, i.e., to answer the user question from a long\nvideo, it is critical to deeply understand its relevant shots like human.\nWithout such insight, these agents often mistakenly find redundant even noisy\ntemporal context, restricting their capacity for long video understanding. To\nfill this gap, we propose VideoChat-A1, a novel long video agent paradigm.\nDifferent from the previous works, our VideoChat-A1 can deeply think with long\nvideos, via a distinct chain-of-shot reasoning paradigm. More specifically, it\ncan progressively select the relevant shots of user question, and look into\nthese shots in a coarse-to-fine partition. By multi-modal reasoning along the\nshot chain, VideoChat-A1 can effectively mimic step-by-step human thinking\nprocess, allowing to interactively discover preferable temporal context for\nthoughtful understanding in long videos. Extensive experiments show that, our\nVideoChat-A1 achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the mainstream long\nvideo QA benchmarks, e.g., it achieves 77.0 on VideoMME and 70.1 on EgoSchema,\noutperforming its strong baselines (e.g., Intern2.5VL-8B and\nInternVideo2.5-8B), by up to 10.8\\% and 6.2\\%.

LinGuinE samples points inside\nthis tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.\nA click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;\nthese are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We\ntest LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung\ntumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE\nimproves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63\nlongitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting\npoint, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields\nthe best results on both test datasets.",

    "abstract": "LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and\nflexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate\nmedical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have\nbeen equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical\nknowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and\nintegrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,\nunstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs\nto effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to\nbest surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,\neach rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical\nliterature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,\ngrounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on\nunstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an\noperationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.\nExperiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with\nMIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with\nthe same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,\nMIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to\n37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive\nmap of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to\nvisually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to\nunlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information\nretrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,\nwhich ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The conventional FL methods face critical challenges in realistic wireless\nedge networks, where training data is both limited and heterogeneous, often\nleading to unstable training and poor generalization. To address these\nchallenges in a principled manner, we propose a novel wireless FL framework\ngrounded in Bayesian inference. By virtue of the Bayesian approach, our\nframework captures model uncertainty by maintaining distributions over local\nweights and performs distribution-level aggregation of local distributions into\na global distribution. This mitigates local overfitting and client drift,\nthereby enabling more reliable inference. Nevertheless, adopting Bayesian FL\nincreases communication overhead due to the need to transmit richer model\ninformation and fundamentally alters the aggregation process beyond simple\naveraging. As a result, conventional Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp), widely\nused to improve communication efficiency in standard FL, is no longer directly\napplicable. To overcome this limitation, we design a dedicated AirComp scheme\ntailored to Bayesian FL, which efficiently aggregates local posterior\ndistributions at the distribution level by exploiting the superposition\nproperty of wireless channels. In addition, we derive an optimal transmit power\ncontrol strategy, grounded in rigorous convergence analysis, to accelerate\ntraining under power constraints. Our analysis explicitly accounts for\npractical wireless impairments such as fading and noise, and provides\ntheoretical guarantees for convergence. Extensive simulations validate the\nproposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in test accuracy and\ncalibration performance over conventional FL methods, particularly in\ndata-scarce and heterogeneous environments.",

We investigate strategies for distributing quantum entanglement\nbetween two distant parties through noisy quantum channels. Specifically, we\ncompare two configurations: one where the entanglement source is placed at the\nmidpoint of the communication line, and another where it is located at one end.\nFor certain families of qubit channels we show analytically that the midpoint\nstrategy is optimal. Based on extensive numerical analysis, we conjecture that\nthis strategy is generally optimal for all qubit channels. Focusing on the\nmidpoint configuration, we develop semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques to\nassess whether entanglement can be successfully distributed through the\nnetwork, and to quantify the amount of entanglement that can be distributed in\nthe process. In many relevant cases the SDP formulation reliably captures the\nmaximal amount of entanglement which can be distributed, if entanglement is\nquantified using the negativity. We analyze several channel models and\ndemonstrate that, for various combinations of amplitude damping and\ndepolarizing noise, entanglement distribution is only possible with weakly\nentangled input states.

    "abstract": "Controlling autonomous vehicles at their handling limits is a significant\nchallenge, particularly for electric vehicles with active four wheel drive\n(A4WD) systems offering independent wheel torque control. While traditional\nVehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) methods use complex physics-based models, this\nstudy explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop a unified,\nhigh-performance controller. We employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nalgorithm to train an agent for optimal lap times in a simulated racecar\n(TORCS) at the tire grip limit. Critically, the agent learns an end-to-end\npolicy that directly maps vehicle states, like velocities, accelerations, and\nyaw rate, to a steering angle command and independent torque commands for each\nof the four wheels. This formulation bypasses conventional pedal inputs and\nexplicit torque vectoring algorithms, allowing the agent to implicitly learn\nthe A4WD control logic needed for maximizing performance and stability.\nSimulation results demonstrate the RL agent learns sophisticated strategies,\ndynamically optimizing wheel torque distribution corner-by-corner to enhance\nhandling and mitigate the vehicle's inherent understeer. The learned behaviors\nmimic and, in aspects of grip utilization, potentially surpass traditional\nphysics-based A4WD controllers while achieving competitive lap times. This\nresearch underscores DRL's potential to create adaptive control systems for\ncomplex vehicle dynamics, suggesting RL is a potent alternative for advancing\nautonomous driving in demanding, grip-limited scenarios for racing and road\nsafety.",

This work\ninvestigates their behavior under the increasingly popular split conformal\nprediction (SCP) framework, which theoretically guarantees a given error level\non output sets by leveraging a labeled calibration set. However, the zero-shot\nperformance of VLMs is inherently limited, and common practice involves\nfew-shot transfer learning pipelines, which cannot absorb the rigid\nexchangeability assumptions of SCP.

Moreover, we complement this\nframework with SS-Text, a novel training-free linear probe solver for VLMs that\nalleviates the computational cost of such a transductive approach. We provide\ncomprehensive experiments using 3 different modality-specialized medical VLMs\nand 9 adaptation tasks.

The gold\nstandard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after\ndeletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This\ndefinition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only\nthe unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \\setminus\nU$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning\nalgorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In\nthis work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to\nprovide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain\naccess to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and\nnot all of $S\\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple\nintuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning\nupdates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a\nsystem-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware\nunlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based\napproach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function\nclasses.

Our key insight is that when\nevaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is\nlittle difference between LLM-generated and human-written code.

Via ground state quantum fluctuations engineering, this pseudospin\nsqueezing enables an enhancement and control of coupling between the magnonic\nmodes and other excitations. Finally, we evaluate the quantum superpositions\nthat comprise a squeezed pseudospin ground state and delineate a qubit\nspectroscopy protocol to detect them. Our results are applicable to any system\nof coupled bosons and thus introduce quantum fluctuations engineering of a\ngeneral bosonic pseudospin.",

For a simple model system, He in a 6-31G basis, it is here shown\nthat calculated excitation energies depend on the specifically chosen orbitals,\neven when the ground-state is the FCI solution, if the LR is truncated to a\nsingles expansion. This holds for naive, projected, self-consistent, and\nstate-transfer parametrizations of the LR operators. With a focus on the\nstate-transfer parameterization, this problem is shown to also hold for more\ncomplicated systems, and is also present when the LR is truncated to singles\nand doubles. This problem can be alleviated by performing a ground-state\nconstrained trace optimization of the Hessian matrix before performing the LR\ncalculation. It is finally shown that spectra can be further improved for small\nLR expansions by targeting only a few states in the constrained trace\noptimization using constrained state-averaged UCC.",

In this work, we provide the results of one of the\nfirst studies in this regard. We explore minoritised ethnic people's\nexperiences of using essential online services across three sectors: health,\nsocial housing, and energy, their security and privacy-related concerns, and\nresponses towards these services. We conducted a thematic analysis of 44\nsemi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised\nethnicities in the UK. Privacy concerns and lack of control over personal data\nemerged as a major theme, with many interviewees considering privacy as their\nmost significant concern when using online services. Several creative tactics\nto exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent\ndisclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was\ndriven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination,\ninfluenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The\nincreased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people\ngrappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal\ninformation online or not. Furthermore, trust in institutions, or lack thereof,\nwas found to be embedded throughout as a basis for adapting behaviour.

In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may\nface imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability\nat the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal\ncoalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or\nsupply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient\nmanagement of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that\nidentify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of\nthe energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the\noptimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a\nstrategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An\nindividual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of\npopulation of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and\nmutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total\nvalue generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when\nthe energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the\nenergy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the\nprofit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during\nperiods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy\non the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the\ntrading process.

Existing dataset-inference methods\ntypically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,\nyet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This\nreality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of\nidentifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.\n  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference\nframework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM\nto overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a\nsuspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion\nof it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;\nconversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the\nmodel's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known\nnon-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious\nset is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.\nExtensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate\nCatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and\npractical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.",

This creates the challenge of\nwatermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and\ntemporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for\nmultivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and\nspatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark\ndirectly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is\nthe $\\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction\nerror distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to\ndetect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time\nseries and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively\nevaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark\ndetectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5\ndatasets and baselines of different temporal lengths.

To achieve this, ChatMyopia\nintegrates an image classification tool and a retrieval-augmented knowledge\nbase built from literature, expert consensus, and clinical guidelines. Myopic\nmaculopathy grading task, single question examination and human evaluations\nvalidated its ability to deliver personalized, accurate, and safe responses to\nmyopia-related inquiries with high scalability and interpretability. In a\nrandomized controlled trial (n=70, NCT06607822), ChatMyopia significantly\nimproved patient satisfaction compared to traditional leaflets, enhancing\npatient education in accuracy, empathy, disease awareness, and patient-eyecare\npractitioner communication. These findings highlight ChatMyopia's potential as\na valuable supplement to enhance patient education and improve satisfaction\nwith medical services in primary eye care settings.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between\nneuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in\ndecoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in\naccurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from\ntheir elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and\nmultifaceted semantic information.\n  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)\nThe AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,\ncapturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to\nCLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These\ncomplementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the\nfinal reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information\nfrom complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions\ndescribing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images\nsynthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that\nHAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic\ninformation of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in\nmultimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such\nsettings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the\npotential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the\nmultimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the\nMultimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,\nMulti-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this\nrole as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056\nmultimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level\nmathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in\nLean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide\nrange of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate\nsophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of\nmathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal\nproofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language\nmodels. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH\nproblems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research\non automated theorem proving.",

However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or\ndiversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due\nto repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,\nwe propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel\npre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of\ndemonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training\ndata, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the\n\"sufficiency\" and \"necessity\" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a\ntree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once\npre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full\ntraining data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in\nICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,\nwhere we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training\nefficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from\n300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over\n20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various\ndownstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise\nfrom the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward\ndiffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse\ngenerative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected\nto the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled\nby a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this\npaper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be\ndifferent. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should\nbe injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new\nframework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).\nSpecifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data\npoint deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,\nbased on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to\nadaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise\ninjections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods\nresults in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10\nand ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels\nto different samples in DBP methods.

    "abstract": "Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world\ndata science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine\nlearning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost\nall physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks\nthat often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general\nproblem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we\naddress the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with\nthe discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant\nvulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we\ndubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally\nillustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle\nsuppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of\nparameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data\nprocessing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting\nfor invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish\nbetween continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with\nregression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings\nalign with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and\nto a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for\ninversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding\nperceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation\nobjective.

In this\npaper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal\nwatermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models.

    "abstract": "The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is\nessential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of\ninfectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising\nsolutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature\nmonitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban\nenvironments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance,\ncoverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we\npropose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO)\nalgorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal\nscreening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex\noptimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing\ntrajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum\nscreening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency\ncompared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides\ncritical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient\nmulti-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas.

In\nturn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main\nstrategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference\ntime verification.

However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to\nsolution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access\nthe broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL\nbased on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,\nobtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded\nthin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to\nsystematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven\napproach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and\nsputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition\ndistribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ\nmeasurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter\nchamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of\nthe sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using\nGaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of\nthe deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of\nthe deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We\ninvestigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully\nBayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best\nperformance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10\nexperiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions\nwas verified experimentally.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in robot navigation, particularly with end-to-end\nlearning approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL), have demonstrated\nstrong performance. However, successful navigation still depends on two key\ncapabilities: mapping and planning (explicitly or implicitly). Classical\napproaches rely on explicit mapping pipelines to register egocentric\nobservations into a coherent map. In contrast, end-to-end learning often\nachieves this implicitly -- through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that fuse\ncurrent and historical observations into a latent space for planning. While\nexisting architectures, such as LSTM and GRU, can capture temporal\ndependencies, our findings reveal a critical limitation: their inability to\neffectively perform spatial memorization. This capability is essential for\nintegrating sequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial\nrepresentations that support planning. To address this, we propose\nSpatially-Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs) -- a simple yet effective\nmodification to existing RNNs -- that enhance spatial memorization. We further\nintroduce an attention-based network architecture integrated with SRUs,\nenabling long-range mapless navigation using a single forward-facing stereo\ncamera. We also employ regularization techniques to facilitate robust\nend-to-end recurrent training via RL. Experimental results show 23.5% overall\nimprovement in long-range navigation compared to existing RNNs. With SRU\nmemory, our method outperforms RL baselines -- one relying on explicit mapping\nand the other on stacked historical observations -- by 29.6% and 105.0%,\nrespectively, across diverse environments requiring long-horizon mapping and\nmemorization. Finally, we address the sim-to-real gap by leveraging large-scale\npretraining on synthetic depth data, enabling zero-shot transfer for deployment\nacross diverse and complex real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "Correlated quantum systems can exhibit thermodynamic behaviors that defy\nclassical expectations, with anomalous energy flow (AEF) against temperature\ngradients serving as a paradigmatic example. While AEF has been shown to arise\nfrom the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about\nwhether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous\ntransport exists for conserved quantities--dubbed charges--other than energy.\nHere, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe\ncharge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For\nenergy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially\nuncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby\ncomplementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved\ncharges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations\nbut is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of non-energy\ncharges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we\ngeneralize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any\nconserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples.\nThese findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum\nthermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in\ncorrelated quantum systems.",

While\nseveral efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent\ncharacteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional\naccelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)\noffers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing\ndesigns suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work\naddresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework\nthat significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model\ninference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning\ncriterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which\nminimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.\nAdditionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative\ndata placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the\nwidespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that\nimplementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\\times$ to $21.30\n\\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields\n$4.35\\times$ to $207.12\\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.\nThese results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM\ncapacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based\nmodel acceleration.",

We\nthen address these limitations by deriving a new model that incorporates: (i)\nrandom mutations of stem cells at a rate that increases with age and (ii)\nimmune response whose strength may also vary over time.\n  Our model accurately reproduces a wide range of real-world cancer data: the\ntypical age-specific cumulative risk of most human cancers, the progression of\nbreast cancer in mice, and the unusual age-specific cumulative risk of breast\ncancer in women. In the last case, we use a moving extinction threshold to\nreflect the different immune response at different phases of the menstrual\ncycle and menopausal treatment.

The radial trends of spectral\nindices are compared to those for the bulge of M31, observed with the same\ninstrument. For M87, most K-band indices exhibit flat radial profiles, with the\nexception of NaI2.21, that decreases outwards, with a negative radial gradient.\nSignificant offsets are found between indices for M87 and those for the bulge\nof M31, the latter having weaker line-strengths for almost all features, but Fe\nand Ca, for which we find similar trends in both systems. We find that the\nbehavior of CO features - most prominent in giant stars - is difficult to\nexplain, consistent with previous results for the central regions of massive\ngalaxies. In particular, the CO indices are stronger in M87 than M31, and do\nnot exhibit significant radial gradients in M87, despite its IMF being bottom\nheavier than M31 especially in its central region. Predictions of\nstate-of-the-art stellar population models, based on results from the optical\nspectral range, are able to match only the Na and Ca indices of M87, while a\nsignificant mismatch is found for all other indices.

    "abstract": "Future wireless systems, known as gigantic multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO), are expected to enhance performance by significantly increasing the\nnumber of antennas, e.g., a few thousands. To enable gigantic MIMO overcoming\nthe scalability limitations of digital architectures, microwave linear analog\ncomputers (MiLACs) have recently emerged. A MiLAC is a multiport microwave\nnetwork that processes input microwave signals entirely in the analog domain,\nthereby reducing hardware costs and computational complexity of gigantic MIMO\narchitectures. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits on the rate\nachievable in MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. We model a MIMO system employing\nMiLAC-aided beamforming at the transmitter and receiver, and formulate the rate\nmaximization problem to optimize the microwave networks of the MiLACs, which\nare assumed lossless and reciprocal for practical reasons. Under the lossless\nand reciprocal constraints, we derive a global optimal solution for the\nmicrowave networks of the MiLACs in closed form. In addition, we also\ncharacterize in closed-form the capacity of MIMO systems operating MiLAC-aided\nbeamforming. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations,\nreveals that MiLAC-aided beamforming achieves the same capacity as digital\nbeamforming, while significantly reducing the number of radio frequency (RF)\nchains, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs)\nresolution requirements, and computational complexity.",

However, existing CAPTCHA schemes\nencompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and\nobfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based\nquestions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal\nbenchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness.

Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune\nspecialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent,\ncross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench\neffectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under\nvaried attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of\nhow challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate.\nBased on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and\nidentify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA\nhardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

    "abstract": "Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires\nunderstanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban\nenvironments. Previous work has mainly focused on rule-based agent-based\nmodeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of\ninternal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy. In contrast, deep\nlearning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable\nand require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the\ncognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel\nLLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban\ncontext. A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine\nActivity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to\nprocess rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal behavior.\nHowever, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating\nenvironmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be\nchallenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated\ndataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a\ntraining-free textual gradient method. Experiments across four major U.S.\ncities demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep\nlearning baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution\naccuracy, achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.\nFurthermore, we conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and\npolicy interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime\npatterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual scenarios.\nOverall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual behaviors and\nfacilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.",

However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously\noptimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new\nmethod, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill\nDiversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill\ndiversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify\nand define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of\nexploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining\nphase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives\nof exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance\non heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a\nskill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream\ntasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves\nperformance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These\nresults highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and\ndiversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and\ngeneralizable skill learning.

    "abstract": "JUICE was launched in April 2023, and it is now in its cruise phase to\nJupiter, where it is scheduled to arrive in July 2031. JUICE carries a\nradiation monitor, namely the RADiation hard Electron Monitor (RADEM) to\nmeasure protons, electrons, and ions, detecting particles coming mainly from\nthe anti-Sun direction. On 2024 May 13, a large solar energetic particle (SEP)\nevent took place in association with an eruption close to the western limb of\nthe Sun as seen from Earth. Providentially, at that time JUICE was located very\nclose to STEREO-A, being separated by 0.13 au in radial distance, 0.3 deg in\nlatitude, and 1.6 deg in longitude. Methods. We analysed the IP context using\nin-situ measurements and studied the proton anisotropies measured by near-Earth\nspacecraft and STEREO-A. We focused on an isotropic period during the decay\nphase of the SEP event to compute the proton energy spectrum. We fit the\nSTEREO-A spectrum and compared it to that measured by SOHO and JUICE.\nConclusions. The RADEM instrument aboard JUICE is a valuable tool for measuring\nSEP events in the heliosphere, providing an excellent opportunity to study and\ncharacterise the energetic particle environment in the solar wind between 0.65\nand 5.2 au. The intercalibration factors between the fluxes measured by\nSTEREO-A and JUICE at the effective energies of 6.9 MeV, 13.3 MeV, 21.6 MeV,\nand 31.2 MeV are 1.02, 1.23, 1.12, and 0.95 respectively. These\nintercalibration factors are valid only until 2024 July 10, when the\nconfiguration of the RADEM instrument was changed.",

The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not\ndesigned for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated\nenvironments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the\nchallenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions\nand device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting\nand degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a\nnovel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion\nmechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,\nFedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally\nseparating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained\nrepresentations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks\nto clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.\nThis enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated\nenvironments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive\nexperiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,\nFedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after\nfine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without\ndegrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.",

Real-world\nbenchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular\nfor validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,\nthis is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical\nunderpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is\nrequired. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph\ntasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with\nsynthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used\ntasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,\nlong-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the\nlong-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of\nnew datasets and architectures.",

Since fine-tuning LLMs on\nToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time\nmethods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing\ninference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from\ncontexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new\ninference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes\nfewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO\nprefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put\nourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We\nevaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and\nnarrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it\nconsistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis\nsuggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the\nToM performance.",

These algorithms\nfor continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,\nwhich often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the\neffectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into\nactor-critic frameworks.

While one-dimensional GLE models are commonly used, many\nsystems require multi-dimensional reaction coordinates to account for coupled\ndynamics.

Existing\nNeRF-based SLAM approaches addressing dynamic challenges typically rely on\nRGB-D inputs, with few methods accommodating pure RGB input. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\nSLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic\ninterference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a\nprobabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network\niteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry.\nBased on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain\nthe pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss\nof dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and\nocclusion caused by dynamic objects.

The paper focuses on this area. The assumption of unknown\n\"common noise\" is formulated first, analysis of theoretical properties and\nillustrations follow. Although the results are disappointing from the\nperspective of a single upper bound of mean square error matrices, the partial\nknowledge demonstrates improvement over no knowledge in suboptimal cases and\nfrom the perspective of families of upper bounds.",

    "abstract": "Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for\nGW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital\neccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for\nPE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill\nthis gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE\nof GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge\n(AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes\nparameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the\nMetropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To\nguarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential\nScale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB\ndynamically increasing the sample size until R < 1.05 for all parameters. Our\nresults demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full\nMCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of\ngravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal\ncomputers.

Under the\ncommunication functionality, the receiver aims to detect all independent\ncommunication symbols while treating the computing streams as aggregate\ninterference which it seeks to mitigate; and conversely, under the computing\nfunctionality, to minimize the distortion over the computing streams while\nminimizing their mutual interference as well as the interference due to data\nsymbols.

To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a\nvariational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply\nVFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce\nExponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents\nheterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We\nhereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,\nenabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and\ndiscrete variables.

Our results reveal that interfacial anisotropy\nin the Co/Pd multilayers drives the magnetization towards the local surface\nnormal. In contrast to typical labyrinth domains observed in planar films, the\npresence of curved nanowires significantly alters the domain structure, with\ndomains preferentially aligning along the nanowire axis in close proximity,\nwhile adopting random orientations farther away. We report direct experimental\nobservation of a curvature-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI),\nwhich is quantified to be approximately one-third of the intrinsic DMI in Co/Pd\nstacks. The curvature induced DMI enhances stability of Neel-type domain walls.\nThese experimental observations are further supported by micromagnetic\nsimulations.

Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid\nexcessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in\ncongestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are\ncommonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,\nwhen applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping\nprojects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands\nof times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper\ninvestigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict\nnetwork-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the\nproblem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered\ntraffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,\nensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under\nan online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The\nexperimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a\nreasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most\nregression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which\nachieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost\nsignificantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly\nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a\nMAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.\nThis modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of\nlarge-scale traffic assignment problems in maintenance planning.",

We argue that this model, while\nuseful for improving performance, also makes it easier to introduce reentrancy\nbugs.

In addition, the Hall voltage\ntime traces feature clear unilateral steps, which we interpret as Barkhausen\nsteps, i.e., as experimental evidence for abrupt reorientations of magnetic\n(Hall vector) domains in the altermagnetic candidate material. A quantitative\nanalysis yields a Barkhausen length of around 18nm in the Hall bar devices with\nthe smallest width of 100 nm.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating\ncounter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical\nchallenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.\nExisting models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but\nthis approach is computationally expensive.

MisMitiFact\ngenerates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses\nare grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models\ntrained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify\nand correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in\nLLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses\nof comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller\ncritique models.

    "abstract": "Recently, Zhang & Liu (2024) proposed a turbulent convection model for\nmultiscale anisotropies of cosmic rays (CRs), with an assumption of isotropic\ndiffusion such that the anisotropies are statistically isotropic. However, this\nassumption may be unrealistic for TeV CRs, whose observations have revealed the\nsignificance of the local interstellar background magnetic field. To meet the\ndifficulty, the turbulent convection scenario needs to be extended to cover\nanisotropic diffusion. In this paper, we focus on the parallel diffusion with\nisotropic pitch-angle scattering, which may be an approximation to the\ntransport process driven by weak hydromagnetic waves in a magnetic flux tube,\nwhere fluctuations of the wave velocities lead to the turbulent convection. The\nconsequence is the breaking of the statistical isotropy, while the overall\nshape of the angular power spectrum, $ \\overline{C_\\ell}\\propto\\ell ^{-\\gamma\n-1} $ ($ \\ell\\gg 1 $), remains similar to that in the isotropic diffusion\nmodel, where $ \\ell $ are degrees of spherical harmonics, and $ \\gamma $ is the\nturbulence spectral index of the convection field. It is then expected that the\npower-law index of the TeV CR small-scale angular power spectrum can be\nexplained with the Kolmogorov law $ \\gamma =5/3 $, irrespective of the\nbackground magnetic field to some extent.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in data collection technologies have led to the widespread\navailability of functional data observed over time, often exhibiting strong\ntemporal dependence. However, existing methodologies typically assume\nindependence across functions or impose restrictive low-order dependence\nstructures, limiting their ability to capture the full dynamics of functional\ntime series. To address this gap, we investigate higher-order functional\nautoregressive (FAR) models in Hilbert spaces, focusing on the statistical\nchallenges introduced by infinite dimensionality. A fundamental challenge\narises from the ill-posedness of estimating autoregressive operators, which\nstems from the compactness of the autocovariance operator and the consequent\nunboundedness of its inverse. We propose a regularized Yule-Walker-type\nestimation procedure, grounded in Tikhonov regularization, to stabilize the\nestimation. Specializing to $L^2$ spaces, we derive explicit and\ncomputationally feasible estimators that parallel classical finite-dimensional\nmethods. Within a unified theoretical framework, we study the asymptotic\nproperties of the proposed estimators and predictors. Notably, while the\nregularized predictors attain asymptotic normality, the corresponding\nestimators of the autoregressive operators fail to converge weakly in\ndistribution under the operator norm topology, due to the compactness of the\nautocovariance operator. We further analyze the mean squared prediction error\n(MSPE), decomposing it into components attributable to regularization bias,\ntruncation, and estimation variance. This decomposition reveals the advantages\nof our approach over traditional linear truncation schemes. Extensive\nsimulations and an application to high-frequency wearable sensor data\ndemonstrate the practical utility and robustness of the proposed methodology in\ncapturing complex temporal structures in functional time series.",

We now aim to highlight the\ncapabilities of SBI for high-resolution spectra, as what will be provided by\nthe newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU). The large number of channels\nencourages us to use compressed representations of the spectra, taking\nadvantage of the likelihood-free inference aspect of SBI. Two compression\nschemes are explored, using either simple summary statistics, such as the\ncounts in arbitrary bins or ratios between these bins. We benchmark the\nefficiency of these approaches using simulated X-IFU spectra with various\nspectral models, including smooth comptonised spectra, relativistic reflexion\nmodels and plasma emission models. We find that using simple and meaningful\nsummary statistics is much more efficient than working directly with the full\nspectrum, and can derive posterior distributions comparable to those from exact\ncomputation using nested sampling. Multi-round inference converges quickly to\nthe good solution. Amortized single round inference requires more simulations,\nhence longer training time, but can be used to infer model parameters from many\nobservations afterwards. Information from the emission lines must be accounted\nfor using dedicated summary statistics. SBI for X-ray spectral fitting is a\nrobust technique that delivers well calibrated posteriors. This approach shows\ngreat promises for high-resolution spectra, offering its potential for the\nscientific exploitation of the X-IFU. We now plan to apply it to the current\nera of high-resolution telescopes, and further challenge this approach with\nreal data.",

In particular, transformer-based segmentation models can\nextract global information more effectively, compensating for the drawbacks of\nCNN modules that focus on local features. However, utilizing transformer\narchitecture is not easy, because training transformer-based models can be\nresource-demanding. Moreover, due to the distinct characteristics in the\nmedical field, especially when encountering mid-sized and small organs with\ncompact regions, their results often seem unsatisfactory.

In this paper,\nwe used Mask2Former with deformable attention to reduce computation and\nproposed offset adjustment strategies to encourage sampling points within the\nsame organs during attention weights computation, thereby integrating compact\nforeground information better. Additionally, we utilized the 4th feature map in\nMask2Former to provide a coarse location of organs, and employed an FCN-based\nauxiliary head to help train Mask2Former more quickly using Dice loss. We show\nthat our model achieves SOTA (State-of-the-Art) performance on the HaNSeg and\nSegRap2023 datasets, especially on mid-sized and small organs.Our code is\navailable at link\nhttps://github.com/earis/Offsetadjustment\\_Background-location\\_Decoder\\_Mask2former.",

    "abstract": "Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against\nclimate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is\na significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of\nsmart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the\nmain electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces\nvaluable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;\nnevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different\nappliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to\napprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of\nestimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of\nindividual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods\nproposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning\napproach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of\nindividual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and\nextremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in\nhouseholds to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a\nweakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only\nrequires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be\ntrained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an\nexplainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.\nOur experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates\nthat CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and\nthat current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more\nlabels to reach CamAL performances.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical\nsuccess, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic\ngames. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for\napproximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this\npaper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for\ncontinuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the\nstructural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization\nin which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their\nprivate state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We\ndevelop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy\ngradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population\ndistribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove\nlinear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and\nestablish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.\nThe analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over\ninfinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the\nconvergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon\nstructures, noise levels, and action frequencies.",

Actuator saturation presents a significant challenge in real-world\nsystems, often resulting in degraded performance. However, since these\nlimitations are typically known in advance, incorporating them into the\nguidance design can enhance overall performance. To address the FOV constraint,\na time-to-go error-based approach is adopted. Furthermore, to incorporate the\nlateral acceleration constraints, the engagement kinematics are augmented with\nan input saturation model. Subsequently, the guidance strategy that constrains\nthe lateral acceleration and the time-to-go values within their respective\nbounds is derived using Lyapunov stability concepts and the backstepping\ntechnique. Furthermore, a multi-stage approach is suggested to expand the\nachievable range of impact time. Numerical simulations are performed to\nvalidate the efficacy of the proposed scheme for different initial engagement\ngeometries.",

    "abstract": "The architectures of exoplanet systems are likely set during the initial\nplanet-formation phase in the circumstellar disk. To understand this process,\nwe have to study the earliest phases of planet formation. Complex\nsub-structures, believed to be driven by embedded planets, have been detected\nin a significant portion of disks observed at high angular resolution. We aim\nto extend the sample of such disks to low stellar masses and to connect the\ndisk morphology to the expected proto-planet properties.\n  We resolve the disk in the 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system for the first time\nin scattered near-infrared light on scales of 10 au using VLT/SPHERE and reveal\nan exceptionally structured disk. We find an inner disk (inside 40 au) with two\nspiral arms, separated by a gap from an outer ring. By comparison with\nhydrodynamic models, we find that these structures are consistent with the\npresence of an embedded gas giant with a mass range between 0.1 and 5 MJup\ndepending on the employed model. Our SPHERE observations find a tentative\ncandidate point source within the disk gap, which may be consistent with this\nmass range if it indeed traces thermal emission by an embedded planet. This\ninterpretation is somewhat strengthened by the proximity of this signal to\ncompact mm continuum emission in the disk gap, which may trace circumplanetary\nmaterial. It is, however, unclear if this tentative companion candidate could\nbe responsible for the observed disk gap size, given its close proximity to the\ninner disk.\n  The 2MASSJ16120668-3010270 system is one of only a few systems that shows\nthis exceptional morphology of spiral arms located inside a scattered light gap\nand ring.

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for\nfirst-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure\nto AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering\nstudents often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal\nimplications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to\naddress this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can\na) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any\ndomain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans\nmathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our\nlives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from\nboth engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role\nas both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental\nchallenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around\nprivacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job\ndisplacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this\ncourse lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical\napproach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results\nrevealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse\nmetrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b)\nefficient corrective solutions for AI fairness.

    "abstract": "To tackle the threat of fake news, the task of detecting and grounding\nmulti-modal media manipulation DGM4 has received increasing attention. However,\nmost state-of-the-art methods fail to explore the fine-grained consistency\nwithin local content, usually resulting in an inadequate perception of detailed\nforgery and unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach\nnamed Contextual-Semantic Consistency Learning (CSCL) to enhance the\nfine-grained perception ability of forgery for DGM4. Two branches for image and\ntext modalities are established, each of which contains two cascaded decoders,\ni.e., Contextual Consistency Decoder (CCD) and Semantic Consistency Decoder\n(SCD), to capture within-modality contextual consistency and across-modality\nsemantic consistency, respectively. Both CCD and SCD adhere to the same\ncriteria for capturing fine-grained forgery details. To be specific, each\nmodule first constructs consistency features by leveraging additional\nsupervision from the heterogeneous information of each token pair. Then, the\nforgery-aware reasoning or aggregating is adopted to deeply seek forgery cues\nbased on the consistency features. Extensive experiments on DGM4 datasets prove\nthat CSCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially for the results\nof grounding manipulated content.

    "abstract": "Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights,\nhave emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power\nconsumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems.\nHowever, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations\nof conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel\nparadigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum\ncomputing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to\ngenerate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum\nphenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of\na broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this\napproach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO),\nwhen direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in\nsimulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as\ncommonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE),\nimproving trainability and generalization.",

This\npaper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of\nexplanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with\nthe epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders.\nThe framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based,\nhuman-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating\naccessible, natural language explanations.

    "abstract": "Assessing the degradation state of an industrial asset first requires\nevaluating its current condition and then to project the forecast model\ntrajectory to a predefined prognostic threshold, thereby estimating its\nremaining useful life (RUL). Depending on the available information, two\nprimary categories of forecasting models may be used: physics-based simulation\ncodes and datadriven (machine learning) approaches. Combining both modelling\napproaches may enhance prediction robustness, especially with respect to their\nindividual uncertainties. This paper introduces a methodology for fusion of\nheterogeneous data in degradation prognostics. The proposed approach acts\niteratively on a computer model's uncertain input variables by combining\nkernel-based sensitivity analysis for variable ranking with a Bayesian\nframework to inform the priors with the heterogeneous data. Additionally, we\npropose an integration of an aggregate surrogate modeling strategy for\ncomputationally expensive degradation simulation codes. The methodology updates\nthe knowledge of the computer code input probabilistic model and reduces the\noutput uncertainty. As an application, we illustrate this methodology on a toy\nmodel from crack propagation based on Paris law as well as a complex industrial\nclogging simulation model for nuclear power plant steam generators, where data\nis intermittently available over time.",

    "abstract": "Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total\npower consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity\nsuppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback\non the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates\nhave relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly\nconsumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.\nNon-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a\nhousehold's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power\nfor individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM\nare based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire\nhousehold consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world\nsmart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each\nsegmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper\nintroduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new\nsubsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the\ndistribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only\non the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world\ndatasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.\nOur solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's\n(Electricit\\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed\ninsights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power\nconsumption.

    "abstract": "Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative\ndevelopment, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert\nguidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\ncan be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists\n(SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We\nconducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three\nexperienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three\ncore behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we\ndeveloped a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained\nbehavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention\nquality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child\ninteraction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in\nperceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert\njudgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based\nbehaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the\nstructuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries\ngrounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses\nbased on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This\nwork provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise,\ndemonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using\nMLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to\nsupport parent-child interaction analysis.",

Training then involves projecting onto\nthese constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the\nnetwork. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this\nparadigm.

    "abstract": "Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an\ninformed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's\nactions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver\nto verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating\ncooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces\ncomputational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions,\nwhere the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes\nand future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the\nbargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and\nwell-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable\nproperties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction\nbetween two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational\nadvantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the\nstandard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the\ngame structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,\nthereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information\nbargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage\nvalidation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and\nDeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We\nthen apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with\nwhat our information-bargaining framework suggests.

Here, we introduce an universal strategy for this selective\ntransfer based on a strong time-periodic energy modulation, which is\nexperimentally demonstrated by using a GHz acoustic wave to control the gain\nand loss of confined modes of an exciton-polariton BEC in a microcavity. The\nharmonic acoustic field shifts the energy of the excitonic BEC component\nrelative to the photonic ones, which generates a dynamic population transfer\nwithin a multimode BEC that can be controlled by the acoustic amplitude. In\nthis way, the full BEC population can be selectively transferred to the ground\nstate to yield a single-level emission consisting of a spectral frequency comb\nwith GHz repetition rates as well as picosecond-scale correlations. A\ntheoretical model reproduces the observed time evolution and reveals a\ndynamical interplay between bosonic stimulation and the adiabatic\nLandau-Zener-like population transfer.

While\ndata augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot\nlearning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for\nboth visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as\ncopy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve\nthe correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target\ndomain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided\ncompositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG\nconsists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided\nbackground generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the\ninput image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then\nretrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative\nmodel in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and\nretrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the\nnewly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without\nrequiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces\nhigh-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including\nCD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show\nconsistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new\nstate-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search\n(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation\ncosts by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of\npredictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While\ntraditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the\nabsolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various\nranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to\nfocus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,\nthe effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been\nthoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive\nstudy on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three\nmain types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we\nassess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks\nacross five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss\nfunctions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.\nFurthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting\nappropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides\nmeaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for\npredictor-based methods in the NAS community.",

The use of historical public data from the matches and the players'\nranking has made this study possible.

Different machine\nlearning methods are applied for this work such as, e.g. logistic regression,\nRandom forest, ADABoost, and XGBoost.

The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)\ndevice was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32\nimages to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which\nleads to a diagnosis.\n  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected\ninhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate\nwheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by\ndrawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT\ndevice, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a\ncustom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural\nnetwork component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an\nalgorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the\nwheals.\n  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation\nset of $217$ patients.

    "abstract": "In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation\napproach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence\nChallenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),\nthe goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective\n(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion\nmodule that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and\ntextual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the\nvisual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object\nalignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,\nthereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed\nmethod ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object\ncorrespondence benchmark. Code will be made available at\nhttps://github.com/lovelyqian/ObjectRelator.",

In this work, we combine Classical\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) to systematically\ninvestigate the stability of ferrite-cementite interfaces within the\nBagaryatskii Orientation Relationship. Three interface orientations and several\ncementite terminations are considered to identify the most stable\nconfigurations.\n  MD simulations reveal that the (010)||(11-2) and (001)||(1-10) orientations\nare energetically favourable for selected terminations, and these predictions\nare validated and refined by subsequent DFT calculations. A key result of our\nstudy is the destabilizing effect of interfacial carbon atoms, which increase\nthe interface energy and decrease the Griffith energy, indicating a reduced\nresistance to fracture. This finding contrasts with earlier reports suggesting\na stabilizing role for carbon.\n  Our analysis of the electronic structure shows that Fe-C bonding at the\ninterface perturbs the metallic environment of interfacial Fe atoms. This\nbonding response explains the observed variations in magnetic moment and helps\nrationalize the trends in interface energy. We also establish correlations\nbetween interface energy, magnetic perturbation, and a bond-based descriptor\nquantifying new and broken bonds.

Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with\nverifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by\nexposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning\nmodels (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is\nnot yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual\nLRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of\nthe GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,\nKorean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and\nlanguage consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key\nfindings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading\nto the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;\n(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the\nexpense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting\nlanguage collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent\nfine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original\ntarget-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a\nremarkable conclusion: \\textit{not all languages are trained equally for\nreasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,\ndata difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.",

Recent studies\nat the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) have shown that several observables, such as the collective flow and\ntransverse-momentum correlations of the produced particles, can be sensitive to\nvarious nuclear structure and deformation parameters. Femtoscopy, another\nessential tool for investigating the space-time geometry of the matter created\nin nuclear collisions, has not yet been widely applied to such studies. Using a\nmultiphase transport model (AMPT), in this Letter, it is demonstrated that the\nfemtoscopic source parameters of pion pairs can also serve as a robust signal\nof unique nuclear structure. Through an analysis of $^{208}$Pb+$^{20}$Ne and\n$^{208}$Pb+$^{16}$O collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 68.5 GeV, two\ncollision systems especially relevant to the SMOG2 program of the LHCb\nexperiment, it is shown that a deformed initial shape can significantly affect\nfemtoscopic source parameters.

The results allow the role played by the\ndifferent sulfur ligands on hydrothermal transport of metals and ore deposit\nformation to be evaluated. An outline of major challenges and emerging\nperspectives for sulfur-related research in geological fluids ends up this\nchapter.",

Recent approaches\nfurther improve control over font styles through fine-tuning with predefined\nfont dictionaries. However, adapting unseen fonts outside the preset is\ncomputationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes, making real-time\ncustomization impractical. In this paper, we present FontAdapter, a framework\nthat enables visual text generation in unseen fonts within seconds, conditioned\non a reference glyph image. To this end, we find that direct training on font\ndatasets fails to capture nuanced font attributes, limiting generalization to\nnew glyphs. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning\napproach: FontAdapter first learns to extract font attributes from isolated\nglyphs and then integrates these styles into diverse natural backgrounds. To\nsupport this two-stage training scheme, we construct synthetic datasets\ntailored to each stage, leveraging large-scale online fonts effectively.\nExperiments demonstrate that FontAdapter enables high-quality, robust font\ncustomization across unseen fonts without additional fine-tuning during\ninference. Furthermore, it supports visual text editing, font style blending,\nand cross-lingual font transfer, positioning FontAdapter as a versatile\nframework for font customization tasks.",

In this paper, we propose to\nswitch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural\naxis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings\ninto hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the\nentailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across\nmodels while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further\nenhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that\ndynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old\nembeddings.

While being a routine task in the optical regime, interferometric\nmeasurements of phase shifts in the x-ray frequency regime are notoriously\nchallenging due to the short wavelengths and associated stability requirements.\nAs a result, the methods demonstrated to date are unsuitable for nanoscopic\nsystems. Here, we demonstrate a nanoscale interferometer, inspired by Young's\ndouble-slit experiment, to measure the dispersive phase shift due to the 14.4\nkeV nuclear resonance of the M\\\"ossbauer isotope $^{57}$Fe coupled to an x-ray\nwaveguide.

Then, we present a\nheuristics-based controller that balances exploratory and exploitative\nbehaviors in order to peel the velcro efficiently. Finally, we evaluate our\nproposed method in environments with complex geometric uncertainties and sensor\nnoises, achieving 100% success rate with less than 80% increase in energy cost\ncompared to the optimal solution when the environment is fully-observable,\noutperforming the baselines by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for\nautonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has\nemerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game\nframework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels.\nHowever, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among\nagents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead\ntreating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations\nare introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a\nmetric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents\nwithin the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the\ninherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated\ndriving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical\nsignals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction\nresults of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal\nis utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed\nTrajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a\nsimple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while\nreducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan\ndatasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning\ntasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,\nwith precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for\nplanning.",

China introduced the HPV vaccine in\n2016 and has made significant advancements in both prevention and treatment\nstrategies. However, due to the relatively late introduction of the vaccine,\nthe burden of cervical cancer in China continues to rise. In light of this, we\ndevelop a compartmental model to assess the impact of the WHO's 90-70-90\nstrategy, along with adult catch-up vaccination, on the control of HPV-induced\ncervical cancer in China. We analyze the basic properties of the model and\nprovide proofs of the local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium\npoints. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed, and we use the MCMC\nalgorithm to fit the number of new cervical cancer cases and deaths in China\nfrom 1990 to 2021. The estimated basic reproduction number before and after the\nintroduction of the HPV vaccine in China is 1.5026 (95% CI: 1.4051-1.6002) and\n1.0726 (95% CI: 0.9384-1.2067), respectively. The sensitivity analysis reveals\nthat screening, as a non-pharmaceutical intervention, plays a crucial role in\ncontrolling the spread of the disease. We apply the 90-70-90 strategy to\npredict the future number of new cervical cancer cases and deaths in China. The\nresults indicate that prioritizing the 70-90 target combination is the most\ncost-effective approach and can achieve the goal of zero new cervical cancer\ncases by 2061. Finally, an optimal control model is developed to explore the\nbest implementation strategies for HPV vaccination and screening under various\nplausible scenarios.",

However, their substantial\ncomputational requirements have constrained their deployment in real-time\ninteractive avatar applications, where stringent speed, latency, and duration\nrequirements are paramount. We present a novel audio-driven portrait video\ngeneration framework based on the diffusion model to address these challenges.\nFirstly, we propose robust variable-length video generation to reduce the\nminimum time required to generate the initial video clip or state transitions,\nwhich significantly enhances the user experience. Secondly, we propose a\nconsistency model training strategy for Audio-Image-to-Video to ensure\nreal-time performance, enabling a fast few-step generation.

To mitigate the stability loss incurred by the diffusion process and\nmodel quantization, we introduce a new inference strategy tailored for\nlong-duration video generation. These methods ensure real-time performance and\nlow latency while maintaining high-fidelity output.

The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been\nproposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work\nthat extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for\npractical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar\nphenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the\ncumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal\nNeural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following\nthree properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to\ntheir within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class\nmeans align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a\none-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to\nlogits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the\nclass order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly\nlocal and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables\nand the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM\nframework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a\nvariety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,\nhighlighting the use of fixed thresholds.",

The\npresent work explores, for the first time, the low-temperature afterglow (AG)\nand spectrally resolved thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) of\nUV-irradiated colloidal core/shell InP/ZnS QDs in the range of 7-340 K. It is\nshown that, when localized during irradiation and released after additional\nstimulation, charge carriers recombine involving defect centers based on indium\nand phosphorus dangling bonds. The mechanisms of the observed luminescent\nphenomena can be caused by both thermal activation and tunneling processes. By\nmeans of the initial rise method, the formalism of general-order kinetics, and\nthe analytical description using the Lambert W function, we have analyzed the\nkinetic features of possible thermally stimulated mechanisms.

    "abstract": "The elastic response of the crystalline sheet to the stretching deformation\nin the form of wrinkles has been extensively investigated. In this work, we\nextend this fundamental scientific question to the plastic regime by exploring\nthe adaptations of crystalline sheets to the large uniaxial mechanical\nstretching. We reveal the intermittent plastic shear deformations leading to\nthe complete fracture of the sheets wrapping the cylinder. Specifically,\nsystematic investigations of crystalline sheets of varying geometry show that\nthe fracture processes can be classified into defect-free and defective\ncategories depending on the emergence of topological defects. We highlight the\ncharacteristic mechanical and geometric patterns in response to the large\nstretching deformation, including the shear-driven intermittent lattice\ntilting, the vortex structure in the displacement field, and the emergence of\nmobile and anchored dislocations as plastic excitations. The effects of noise\nand initial lattice orientation on the plastic deformation of the stretched\ncrystalline sheet are also discussed. These results advance our understanding\nof the atomic level on the irreversible plastic instabilities of 2D crystals\nunder large uniaxial stretching and may have potential practical implications\nin the precise engineering of structural instabilities in packings of\ncovalently bonded particulate systems.",

We\nshow that the impacts of various parameters on the bending delays visually\nmatch with those observed for a non-rotating black holes, because the magnitude\nof the spin as well as the orientation of the spin axis of the black hole\nintroduce changes in the nanosecond order and other parameters do so in the\nmicrosecond order. Consequently, the distortion of the beam and the resulting\nchanges in the pulse shape are minimally influenced by spin-related parameters\nof the black hole. We also investigate the impact of various parameters on the\ndifference of the delays with and without the spin of the black hole and notice\nnanosecond scale discontinuities at orbital phases where the path of the light\nray changes its direction with respect to the direction of the spin of the\nblack hole. Moreover, as in the Schwarzschild case, the bending delays become\nirregular (on the microsecond scale) near the superior conjunction. We also\nexplore the effect of bending on the pulse profiles and bending delays if the\ncompanion of the pulsar is a rotating super-massive black hole. We find\nsignificant enhancement and change in the shape of the profiles at and near the\nsuperior conjunction in comparison to stellar mass black holes.

    "abstract": "Semantic ID-based recommendation models tokenize each item into a small\nnumber of discrete tokens that preserve specific semantics, leading to better\nperformance, scalability, and memory efficiency. While recent models adopt a\ngenerative approach, they often suffer from inefficient inference due to the\nreliance on resource-intensive beam search and multiple forward passes through\nthe neural sequence model. As a result, the length of semantic IDs is typically\nrestricted (e.g. to just 4 tokens), limiting their expressiveness. To address\nthese challenges, we propose RPG, a lightweight framework for semantic ID-based\nrecommendation. The key idea is to produce unordered, long semantic IDs,\nallowing the model to predict all tokens in parallel. We train the model to\npredict each token independently using a multi-token prediction loss, directly\nintegrating semantics into the learning objective. During inference, we\nconstruct a graph connecting similar semantic IDs and guide decoding to avoid\ngenerating invalid IDs. Experiments show that scaling up semantic ID length to\n64 enables RPG to outperform generative baselines by an average of 12.6% on the\nNDCG@10, while also improving inference efficiency.

Temporal\nmisalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state\nestimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are\ncritical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address\nthis problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar\nboth relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor\nfusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor\nstaleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into\na perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple\nLiDARs, radars and cameras.

Additionally, Pegasus employs\nPrimitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus\nadopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.\nOur implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively\nsupport various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and\nAutoEncoder models on the dataplane.

We previously demonstrated how machine\nlearning (ML) can accelerate property predictions for the CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$\nperovskite alloy. However, the substantial computational demand of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations required for model training prevents\napplications to more complex materials. Here, we introduce a data-efficient\nscheme to facilitate model training, validated initially on CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$\ndata and extended to the ternary alloy CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$. Our approach employs\nclustering to construct a compact yet diverse initial dataset of atomic\nstructures. We then apply a two-stage active learning approach to first improve\nthe reliability of the ML-based structure relaxations and then refine accuracy\nnear equilibrium structures. Tests for CsPb(Cl/Br)$_3$ demonstrate that our\nscheme reduces the number of required DFT calculations during the different\nparts of our proposed model training method by up to 20% and 50%. The fitted\nmodel for CsSn(Cl/Br/I)$_3$ is robust and highly accurate, evidenced by the\nconvergence of all ML-based structure relaxations in our tests and an average\nrelaxation error of only 0.5 meV/atom.",

In particular, we review how fingerprint\nis currently used in the neuroscience literature, highlight mismatches with the\nbiometric community definition, and offer clear guidelines for distinguishing\ngenuine biometric fingerprints from exploratory similarity metrics. By\nclarifying terminology and criteria, we aim to align practices and facilitate\ncommunication across fields.",

    "abstract": "Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet\nmost existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are\ndeveloped around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.\nConsequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted\nstructures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of\nreal-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often\nmissing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to\nenable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method\ncomprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that\naligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected\nfrom structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and\n(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate\nbinding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without\nprecise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated\nbenchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment\nfactor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong\nperformance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our\napproach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios\nlacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.",

However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety\nconcerns. In recent years, LLM-generated content has occasionally exhibited\nunsafe elements like toxicity and bias, particularly in adversarial scenarios,\nwhich has garnered extensive attention from both academia and industry. While\nnumerous efforts have been made to evaluate the safety risks associated with\nLLMs, there remains a lack of systematic reviews summarizing these research\nendeavors. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic overview\nof recent advancements in LLMs safety evaluation, focusing on several key\naspects: (1) \"Why evaluate\" that explores the background of LLMs safety\nevaluation, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance\nof such evaluation; (2) \"What to evaluate\" that examines and categorizes\nexisting safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including\ndimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness,\ntruthfulness, and so on; (3) \"Where to evaluate\" that summarizes the evaluation\nmetrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (4) \"How\nto evaluate\" that reviews existing evaluation toolkit, and categorizing\nmainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators. Finally, we\nidentify the challenges in LLMs safety evaluation and propose potential\nresearch directions to promote further advancement in this field.

Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality\ndomain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to\ngenerate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present\nBioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is\ncomposed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and\nmolecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions\nthat designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over\nmultimodal KG to answer questions.

Inspired by human vision\nstudies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision\nlanguage models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.\nHowever, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished\nactual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine\ncognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question\nanswering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along\nwith corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies\nbetween actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same\nactual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar\ngeometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and\nfake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and\napparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to\nrecognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,\nthey predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA\nquestions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge\nof illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available\nat https://github.com/ynklab/FILM",

    "abstract": "Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply\ndemand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of\nLOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has\ndemonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive\nperformance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat\nmodel complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine\nwhether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to \"blackbox ish\" neural\nnetworks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are\nprimarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We\nbenchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic\nregression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT\nLOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly\navailable Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,\nSavitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)\nlabeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,\nlatency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing\nand hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the\nperformance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater\ninterpretability.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that\neffective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on\npre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit\ndistribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this\nlimitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which\nleverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising\nresults, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future\ntrajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history\ntransitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders\nthe discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to\ncritical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we\nintroduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework\nfor offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any\nintermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task\ninto two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating\nforward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating\nbackward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can\nefficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially\nvaluable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating\ndataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite\ndemonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other\nadvanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.",

Assuming a single-pole dominance\nparameterization, the hadronic form factor ratios are extracted to be\n$r_V=V(0)/A_1(0)=1.42 \\pm\\, 0.03_{\\rm stat} \\pm\\, 0.02_{\\rm syst}$ and\n$r_2=A_2(0)/A_1(0)=0.75 \\pm\\, 0.03_{\\rm stat} \\pm\\, 0.01_{\\rm syst}$.\n  Based on the first comprehensive angular and the decay-rate $CP$ asymmetry\nanalysis, the full set of averaged angular and $CP$ asymmetry observables are\nmeasured as a function of the momentum-transfer squared; they are consistent\nwith expectations from the Standard Model. No evidence for violation of $\\mu-e$\nlepton-flavor universality is observed in either the full range or the five\nchosen bins of momentum-transfer squared.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong\nperformance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\napproaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted\nlearning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present\nWriting-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance\nlong-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key\ncomponents: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with\nhigh learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides\ndiscriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and\nDynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role\nby adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.\nExperiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely\nimproves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines.

In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture\nrepresentations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a\nlog-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes.\nThis log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a\nsmooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for\ngradient-based learning and inference.\n  A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both\nthe number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression,\nenabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of\nthe LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase\ntransformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological\ngene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability\ndistributions.

Correlations between quantities are\nthe most reliable approach to describe relationships between different\nvariables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations\nis often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure\ncorrelations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local\nregions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract\nsuch correlations and represent them in phase space.

The authors of these studies compared\ntheir schemes to determine the best one. The initial measure used to assess the\ngoodness of fit of a polygonal approximation was the figure of merit. Later,it\nwas noted that this measure was not an appropriate metric for a valid reason\nwhich is why Rosin-through mathematical analysis-introduced a measure called\nmerit. However,this measure involves an optimal scheme of polygonal\napproximation,so it is time-consuming to compute it to assess the goodness of\nfit of an approximation. This led many researchers to use a weighted figure of\nmerit as a substitute for Rosin's measure to compare sub optimal schemes. An\nattempt is made in this communication to investigate whether the two\nmeasures-weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure-are related so that one\ncan be used instead of the other, and toward this end, theoretical analysis,\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis are carried out. The\nmathematical formulas for the weighted figure of merit and Rosin's measure are\nanalyzed, and through proof of theorems,it is found that the two measures are\ntheoretically independent of each other. The graphical analysis of experiments\ncarried out using a public dataset supports the results of the theoretical\nanalysis. The statistical analysis via Pearson's correlation coefficient and\nnon-linear correlation measure also revealed that the two measures are\nuncorrelated. This analysis leads one to conclude that if a suboptimal scheme\nis found to be better (worse) than some other suboptimal scheme,as indicated by\nRosin's measure,then the same conclusion cannot be drawn using a weighted\nfigure of merit,so one cannot use a weighted figure of merit instead of Rosin's\nmeasure.",

Perturbing payoffs or values are known to\nbe effective in stabilizing learning dynamics and finding an exact solution or\nequilibrium. However, it requires careful adjustment of the perturbation\nmagnitude; otherwise, learning dynamics converge to only an equilibrium. We\nestablish an impossibility result that it almost never reaches an exact\nequilibrium as long as both players' payoff functions are perturbed. To\novercome this, we introduce an asymmetric perturbation approach, where only one\nplayer's payoff function is perturbed. This ensures convergence to an\nequilibrium without requiring parameter adjustments, provided the perturbation\nstrength parameter is sufficiently low. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate\nfast convergence toward equilibria in both normal-form and extensive-form\ngames.",

This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats\nposed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing\non contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal\nthe significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy\nleakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction\nperformance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks.

    "abstract": "Diffusiophoresis of charged particles in the presence of electrolytes has\nbeen extensively studied in the literature.

Here, we theoretically investigate the conditions under which a\nparticle can reverse its diffusiophoretic direction within the same setup,\nleading to the formation of a focusing band under steady-state concentration\ngradients. Using multi-ion diffusiophoresis calculations, we simulate particle\ntransport in an acid-based reaction system where salt is added alongside the\nacid. For a range of salt concentrations, particles focus within the channel.\nOur analysis reveals that a pH-dependent zeta potential is necessary for this\nfocusing to occur, and determines where the particles focus, i.e., on or off\nthe acid-base reaction front. We report qualitative agreement with prior\nexperimental observations and derive analytical conditions governing particle\nfocusing, highlighting the delicate balance between concentration gradients and\nzeta potential variations. The work elucidates the crucial physics of\npH-dependent zeta potential and opens new avenues for exploring\ndiffusiophoresis in acid-base systems, with implications for microfluidic\ndesign and biophysical transport processes.",

This\nleads us to propose novel geometric modifications to the propagation and update\nsteps of the EKF and revisit recent work on the geometry of the reset step.

Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational\nlinks between entities in a database and converting the structured data into\nflat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical\nrelational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM\ncontext lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a\ngraph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational\nprompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.\nUnlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves\nthe inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to\neffectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,\nthe GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature\nrepresentations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal\ndependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts\nusing a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over\nrelational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nRel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and\nefficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources.

A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large\nproportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,\nwhich can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification\nand classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC\napplications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease\nidentification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative\ndata. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further\ncomplicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies.

We use a unified network to generate\npoint-wise semantic labels and centroid offsets, allowing points from the same\npart instance to vote for the same centroid.

In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown\npromise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency\nand algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called\nEnsemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step\nupdates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two\nmajor challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample\nefficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants\nacross the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral\nlearning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that\nEEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,\noutperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art\nensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These\nfindings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic\nimprovements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when\ncarefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.",

    "abstract": "Apples are among the most widely consumed fruits worldwide. Currently, apple\nharvesting fully relies on manual labor, which is costly, drudging, and\nhazardous to workers. Hence, robotic harvesting has attracted increasing\nattention in recent years. However, existing systems still fall short in terms\nof performance, effectiveness, and reliability for complex orchard\nenvironments. In this work, we present the development and evaluation of a\ndual-arm harvesting robot. The system integrates a ToF camera, two 4DOF robotic\narms, a centralized vacuum system, and a post-harvest handling module. During\nharvesting, suction force is dynamically assigned to either arm via the vacuum\nsystem, enabling efficient apple detachment while reducing power consumption\nand noise. Compared to our previous design, we incorporated a platform movement\nmechanism that enables both in-out and up-down adjustments, enhancing the\nrobot's dexterity and adaptability to varying canopy structures. On the\nalgorithmic side, we developed a robust apple localization pipeline that\ncombines a foundation-model-based detector, segmentation, and clustering-based\ndepth estimation, which improves performance in orchards. Additionally,\npressure sensors were integrated into the system, and a novel dual-arm\ncoordination strategy was introduced to respond to harvest failures based on\nsensor feedback, further improving picking efficiency. Field demos were\nconducted in two commercial orchards in MI, USA, with different canopy\nstructures. The system achieved success rates of 0.807 and 0.797, with an\naverage picking cycle time of 5.97s. The proposed strategy reduced harvest time\nby 28% compared to a single-arm baseline. The dual-arm harvesting robot\nenhances the reliability and efficiency of apple picking. With further\nadvancements, the system holds strong potential for autonomous operation and\ncommercialization for the apple industry.",

This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning\nwith Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL\nagents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be\nachieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive\nContinual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework\ndecouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an\naction representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of\naction representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between\nstability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three\nenvironments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by\ngeneralizing the policy across action spaces.",

    "abstract": "This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is\nunderdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing\nframeworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in\nreal-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered\nAI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing\nmonitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them\nill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We\ncontend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient\nand statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative\nto current practices. We use the term \"statistically valid\" to refer to methods\nthat provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable\nformal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support\nreproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.\nSpecifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model\nperformance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis\ntesting problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a\nreproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of\nclinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the\ntechnical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically\nprincipled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model\nfailures in real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by\ntransferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,\nreducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.\nHowever, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts\nin the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as\ncatastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning\nframework inspired by the strength training principle of \"progressive overload\"\n(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD\napproaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two\ncore components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training\nsamples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally\nintroduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while\napplying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting\nwith the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the\napproach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive\nexperiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL\nconsistently improves the performance of distilled student models across\nvarious white-box KD methods and model families.

In this\npaper, we develop a taxonomy of AI harm reparation based on a thematic analysis\nof real-world incidents.

We apply this framework to a dataset of\n1,060 AI-related incidents, analyzing the prevalence of each action and the\ndistribution of stakeholder involvement.

While\nrecent learning-based auction frameworks have improved context modeling by\ncapturing intra-list dependencies among ads, they remain limited in addressing\nglobal externalities and often suffer from inefficiencies caused by sequential\nprocessing. In this work, we introduce the Non-autoregressive Generative\nAuction with global externalities (NGA), a novel end-to-end framework designed\nfor industrial online advertising. NGA explicitly models global externalities\nby jointly capturing the relationships among ads as well as the effects of\nadjacent organic content. To further enhance efficiency, NGA utilizes a\nnon-autoregressive, constraint-based decoding strategy and a parallel\nmulti-tower evaluator for unified list-wise reward and payment computation.\nExtensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B testing on commercial\nadvertising platforms demonstrate that NGA consistently outperforms existing\nmethods in both effectiveness and efficiency.",

EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a\nsystematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained\nedge settings.

Analytical modeling is used to\nestimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption.

Inference speeds\nare observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge\ndevices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for\nINT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as\nRaspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super.

    "abstract": "We present a comparative observational investigation of two Dirac-Born-Infeld\n(DBI) k-essence scalar field models that address late-time cosmic acceleration\nand dark sector dynamics. The first model involves a non-canonical scalar field\nrepresenting dark energy alongside standard matter, which is regulated by the\nLagrangian, $\\mathcal{L} = -\\left[f(\\phi)\\sqrt{1- \\frac{2X}{f(\\phi)}} - f(\\phi)\n+ V(\\phi)\\right] + \\mathcal{L}_m$. The second model combines dark matter and\ndark energy with $ \\mathcal{L} = -V(\\phi)\\sqrt{1-2X}$. The background evolution\nis based on modified Friedmann and scalar field equations constrained by\nPantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter data, and BAO (including\nDESBAO). A hybrid inference methodology is chosen, which includes Bayesian\nparameter estimation using the NUTS sampler in {\\it NumPyro} and a\ndeep-learning emulator employing supervised neural networks to speed up\nlikelihood computations. A nuisance parameter $\\mu_0$ is added to reduce\nsystematics and improve the estimate of $H_0$, $r_d$, and $\\Omega_{d0}$. The\ndeceleration parameter $q(z)$ exhibits significant differences: Model I yields\n$q^{\\text{Bayes}}_0 = -0.538$, $q^{\\text{ML}}_0 = -0.509$, with\n$z^{\\text{Bayes}}_{\\text{trans}} = 0.650$, $z^{\\text{ML}}_{\\text{trans}} =\n0.602$, consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM, while Model II results in stronger\npresent acceleration ($q^{\\text{Bayes}}_0 = -0.831$, $q^{\\text{ML}}_0 =\n-0.780$). Model I performs better statistically and dynamically than Model II,\nas shown by lower $\\chi^2_\\nu$, AIC, and BIC values. We additionally use\nsymbolic regression ({\\it PySR}) to rebuild analytic forms of\n$\\omega_{\\text{eff}}(z)$, which improves interpretability.

By dynamically sensing modality information within attention\nheads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial\nreductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency\n(1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various\nmultimodal long-context tasks.

    "abstract": "Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a practical solution to reduce\nradiation dose, but the resulting ill-posed inverse problem poses significant\nchallenges for accurate image reconstruction. Although deep learning and\ndiffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical\ninterpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative\nsampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,\nparticularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image\nsynthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose\nResidual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate\nsparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional\nguidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to\nsignificantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.\nHowever, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce\nunrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each\niteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements. Yet, PFGM sampling\nrelies on a fixed ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory induced by\nelectrostatic fields, which can be disrupted by step-wise data consistency,\nresulting in unstable or degraded reconstructions. Inspired by ResNet, we\nintroduce a residual fusion module to linearly combine generative outputs with\ndata-consistent reconstructions, effectively preserving trajectory continuity.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of Poisson flow\nmodels to sparse-view CT. Extensive experiments on synthetic and clinical\ndatasets demonstrate that ResPF achieves superior reconstruction quality,\nfaster inference, and stronger robustness compared to state-of-the-art\niterative, learning-based, and diffusion models.",

However,\nmost existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,\nfailing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization\nnoise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization\nbitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make\nkey assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be\nexpressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat\nformulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose\nclosed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise\nquantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as\nthe equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed\n\\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm\nachieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows\nBAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal\noverhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,\nachieving up to 56$\\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large\nlanguage models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters.

    "abstract": "We present a framework for propagating products of displaced\nLaguerre-Gaussian beams under the free-space paraxial wave equation. Using an\noptical analogy to quantum coherent states, we express the product as a linear\nsuperposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams, with complex coefficients that encode\ndisplacements and mode overlaps. Our formalism enables direct calculation of\nthe net orbital angular momentum and reduces propagation to tracking the\nevolution of independent weighted modes. These components share a common\nspherical phase and radial coordinate scaling, while acquiring distinct Gouy\nphases set by their total modal numbers. By absorbing the Gouy phase into the\ndisplacement coefficients, we make the transverse rotational dynamics governed\nby orbital angular momentum explicit. Our framework supports the engineering of\nstructured light beams from the product of multiple optical vortices for\napplications that require controlled three-dimensional positioning.",

Normalizing flows\ncan emulate population synthesis runs to enable simulation-based inference from\nobserved catalogs and data augmentation for feature prediction in rarely\nsynthesizable sub-populations.

However, existing methods commonly overlook the key\ndifferences between aerial and close-range settings, such as varying depth\nranges along epipolar lines and insensitive feature-matching associated with\nlow-detailed aerial images. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive\nDepth Range MVS (ADR-MVS), which integrates monocular geometric cues to improve\nmulti-view depth estimation accuracy. The key component of ADR-MVS is the depth\nrange predictor, which generates adaptive range maps from depth and normal\nestimates using cross-attention discrepancy learning. In the first stage, the\nrange map derived from monocular cues breaks through predefined depth\nboundaries, improving feature-matching discriminability and mitigating\nconvergence to local optima. In later stages, the inferred range maps are\nprogressively narrowed, ultimately aligning with the cascaded MVS framework for\nprecise depth regression. Moreover, a normal-guided cost aggregation operation\nis specially devised for aerial stereo images to improve geometric awareness\nwithin the cost volume. Finally, we introduce a normal-guided depth refinement\nmodule that surpasses existing RGB-guided techniques. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ADR-MVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WHU,\nLuoJia-MVS, and M\\\"unchen datasets, while exhibits superior computational\ncomplexity.",

However, the limited understanding of their FIV responses and\nhydrodynamic features presents a major challenge to the development of reliable\nengineering designs. To bridge this gap, the present study systematically\ninvestigates the FIV characteristics of a rigidly coupled twin-pipe model with\nelastic support using a virtual physical framework (VPF), which enables\nflexible control of structural parameters during physical testing. A\ndistinctive feature of twin-pipe structures is the presence of in-line\nhydrodynamic interactions and torsional moments arising from the rigid\ncoupling. The in-line interaction is primarily compressive and becomes more\npronounced as the mass ratio increases. The torsional moment coefficient\nexhibits a rise-fall trend with increasing reduced velocity $U_R$ and\nstabilizes around 0.46 at low mass ratios. In addition, an \"amplitude drop\"\nphenomenon is observed at $U_R=6$, attributed to energy dissipation from the\ndownstream pipe. The mass ratio significantly affects FIV amplitude, frequency,\nand hydrodynamic coefficients. As the mass ratio decreases, the synchronization\nregion broadens and the hydrodynamic coefficients become more stable. At mass\nratio of 1.0, a \"resonance forever\" behavior is observed. Damping primarily\nsuppresses FIV amplitude, with minimal impact on dominant frequency and\nhydrodynamic coefficients. These findings provide valuable insights into\ntwin-pipe FIV mechanisms and support a scientific basis for future structural\ndesign optimization.",

Our platform features modular, multi-degree-of-freedom\npneumatic displays, where different signal types, such as pressure, frequency,\nand contact area, can be activated or combined using fluidic logic circuits.\nThese circuits simplify control by reducing reliance on specialized electronics\nand enabling coordinated actuation of multiple haptic elements through a\ncompact set of inputs. Our approach allows rapid reconfiguration of haptic\nsignal rendering through hardware-level logic switching without rewriting code.\nPersonalization of the haptic interface is achieved through the combination of\nmodular hardware and software-driven signal selection. To determine which\ndisplay configurations will be most effective, we model haptic communication as\na signal transmission problem, where an agent must convey latent information to\nthe user. We formulate the optimization problem to identify the haptic hardware\nsetup that maximizes the information transfer between the intended message and\nthe user's interpretation, accounting for individual differences in\nsensitivity, preferences, and perceptual salience. We evaluate this framework\nthrough user studies where participants interact with reconfigurable displays\nunder different signal combinations. Our findings support the role of\nmodularity and personalization in creating multimodal haptic interfaces and\nadvance the development of reconfigurable systems that adapt with users in\ndynamic human-machine interaction contexts.",

In living cells, mitochondria form architectures\nthat span across these regimes, transitioning between fragmented, partly\nconnected, and highly fused structures depending on cell type and state.\nDiffusive transport of biomolecular components through these networks limits\nthe heterogeneity of the mitochondrial population. Here we address the\nconnection between dynamic network architecture and the rate of diffusive\nmixing through simulations and analytic models that incorporate fusion,\nfission, and rearrangement. We find that the material delivered from a source\nto the rest of the network depends on the network dimensionality and a balance\nof competing timescales for encounter, fusion, and diffusive dispersion. We\nextract morphological and dynamic parameters for mitochondrial networks in\nthree human cell lines, demonstrating that different cells span across both the\nphysical and social network regimes. Mixing in mitochondrial networks is shown\nto be limited by material transport through connected tubules for\nslowly-diffusing particles and by inter-mitochondrial encounter rates for\nrapidly diffusing ones. These results provide a quantitative basis for\npredicting the homogenization of proteins, lipids, ions, or genetic material\nthrough the mitochondrial population. The general principles identified in this\nwork capture diffusive spreading through both social and physical networks,\nunifying a continuum of spatial network architectures.",

In\naddition, we investigate the behaviour of other quantum correlations, including\nquantum discord and coherence, and analyze their hierarchy under decoherence.\nTo counteract the detrimental effects of the channels, we apply the weak\nmeasurement and quantum measurement reversal (WMR) protocol, comparing the\neffectiveness of single-qubit and two-qubit WMR techniques. Our results show\nthat the two-qubit WMR protocol significantly outperforms the single-qubit\napproach in preserving quantum correlations. Furthermore, we employ a neural\nnetwork model to enhance our analysis of the relationship between different\nquantum correlation measures during the evolution. Using a MATLAB-based\nartificial neural network with 80 neurons across three hidden layers and\ntrained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we successfully predict trace\ndistance discord from other correlations, achieving low prediction errors.\nBesides, our analysis of the neural network weights suggests that concurrence\nand EPR steering have the most positive influence on the accurate discord\npredictions.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework for training and\nfine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging computational resources\nacross organizations while keeping sensitive data on local devices. It\naddresses privacy and security concerns while navigating challenges associated\nwith the substantial computational demands of LLMs, which can be prohibitive\nfor small and medium-sized organizations. FL supports the development of\ntask-specific LLMs for cross-silo applications through fine-tuning but remains\nvulnerable to inference attacks, such as membership inference and gradient\ninversion, which threaten data privacy. Prior studies have utilized\nDifferential Privacy (DP) in LLM fine-tuning, which, despite being effective at\npreserving privacy, can degrade model performance.
