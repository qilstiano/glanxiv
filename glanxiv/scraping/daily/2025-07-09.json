    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the received power at a user\nequipment via reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) characterized by\nphase-dependent amplitude (PDA) and discrete phase shifts over a limited phase\nrange. Given complex RIS coefficients, that is, discrete phase shifts and PDAs,\nwe derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the optimal\nsolution. To this end, we propose an optimal search algorithm that is proven to\nconverge in linear time within at most NK steps, significantly outperforming\nthe exhaustive search approach that would otherwise be needed for RISs with\namplitude attenuation. Furthermore, we introduce a practical quantization\nframework for PDA-introduced RISs termed amplitude-introduced polar\nquantization (APQ), and extend it to a novel algorithm named extended\namplitude-introduced polar quantization (EAPQ) that works with geometric\nprojections. We derive closed-form expressions to assess how closely the\nperformance of the proposed RIS configuration can approximate the ideal case\nwith continuous phases and no attenuation. Our analysis reveals that increasing\nthe number of discrete phases beyond K = 4 yields only marginal gains,\nregardless of attenuation levels, provided the RIS has a sufficiently wide\nphase range R. Furthermore, we also show and quantify that when the phase range\nR is limited, the performance is sensitive to attenuation for larger R, and\nsensitive to R when there is less attenuation. Finally, the proposed optimal\nalgorithm provides a generic upper bound that could serve as a benchmark for\ndiscrete beamforming in RISs with amplitude constraints.",

Our work studies the\nalignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of\nunsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the\ninput prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after\ngeneration. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering\nboth prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there\nare no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful\nbehavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable\nfrom benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies\na natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All\nof our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In\naddition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation\napproaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that\nsafety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals\n(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not\nsuffice.

In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA\nfine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,\nConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift\nproblem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and\nfine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a\nclosed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and\nfine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during\ninitialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and\ndown matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed\ninitialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image\ngeneration, image classification and image understanding.

Over-parameterized\nmodels such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property\nin their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning\nand has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model\nincreases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional\nbias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number\nof observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become\ninfinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the\ndouble descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation.\nMoreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor\nthat Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when\npossible. We develop comprehensive theoretical foundations including Dawid's\nmodel comparison theory, Dickey-Savage results, and connections to generalized\nridge regression and shrinkage methods.

Phys. 18, 406\n(2022)]. To better understand the physical origin of this pressure-induced\nphenomenon, here we have studied the structural, electronic, and magnetic\nproperties of undoped and O-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) under\npressures based on density-functional theory calculations. We first identified\nthe crystal structure of undoped Bi2212 with the armchair distortions in the\nBiO layers and reproduced the insulating feature of the parent compound. Then\nwe added an extra O atom to the parent compound to simulate the hole-doping\neffect and found that the structure with O dopant located in the van der Waals\n(vdW) gap is energetically the most stable. Further calculations on O-doped\n(0.125 holes/Cu) Bi2212 revealed that the pressure can induce charge\nredistributions between CuO$_2$ planes and BiO layers; specifically,\nCu-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals gain electrons and Cu atoms rather than O atoms\ndominate around the Fermi level under high pressure. Along with the increasing\npressure, the density of states at the Fermi level first reaches the maximum at\n$\\sim$ 10 GPa and then shows a valley near the Fermi level above 20 GPa, which\nmay be responsible for the insulatinglike state observed in recent experiments.\nWe suggest that the competition among several factors, such as the increase of\nelectrons in the CuO$_2$ plane, the variation of in-plane hopping due to the\nshortened Cu-O distance, and the enhanced Coulomb repulsion among the Cu-3$d$\nelectrons, could lead to the exotic transition under pressure. Our work\nprovides an explanation of the high-pressure behaviors of Bi2212, which may\nfacilitate a comprehensive understanding of cuprate superconductors.",

    "abstract": "Previous work has shown that the addition of haptic feedback to the hands can\nimprove awareness of tool-tissue interactions and enhance performance of\nteleoperated tasks in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However,\nhand-based haptic feedback occludes direct interaction with the manipulanda of\nsurgeon console in teleoperated surgical robots. We propose relocating haptic\nfeedback to the wrist using a wearable haptic device so that haptic feedback\nmechanisms do not need to be integrated into the manipulanda. However, it is\nunknown if such feedback will be effective, given that it is not co-located\nwith the finger movements used for manipulation. To test if relocated haptic\nfeedback improves force application during teleoperated tasks using da Vinci\nResearch Kit (dVRK) surgical robot, participants learned to palpate a phantom\ntissue to desired forces. A soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device with an\nanchoring system renders tool-tissue interaction forces to the wrist of the\nuser. Participants performed the palpation task with and without wrist-worn\nhaptic feedback and were evaluated for the accuracy of applied forces.\nParticipants demonstrated statistically significant lower force error when\nwrist-worn haptic feedback was provided. Participants also performed the\npalpation task with longer movement times when provided wrist-worn haptic\nfeedback, indicating that the haptic feedback may have caused participants to\noperate at a different point in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the lensing event KMT-2024-BLG-0404. The light curve of\nthe event exhibited a complex structure with multiple distinct features,\nincluding two prominent caustic spikes, two cusp bumps, and a brief\ndiscontinuous feature between the caustic spikes. While a binary-lens model\ncaptured the general anomaly pattern, it could not account for a discontinuous\nanomaly feature between the two caustic spikes. To explore the origin of the\nunexplained feature, we conducted more advanced modeling beyond the standard\nbinary-lens framework. This investigation demonstrated that the previously\nunexplained anomaly was resolved by introducing an additional lens component\nwith planetary mass. The estimated masses of the lens components are $M_{\\rm\np}= 17.3^{+25.5}_{-8.8}~M_{\\rm E}$ for the planet, and $M_{\\rm\nh,A}=0.090^{+0.133}_{-0.046}~M_\\odot$ and $M_{\\rm\nh,B}=0.026^{+0.038}_{-0.013}~M_\\odot$ for the binary host stars.

In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative\ntraining, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information\nfrom devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data\ninformation, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it\nis necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal\ntransmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to\neach model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization\nproblem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while\nmeeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve\nthis problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning\nframework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that\nenables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the\ndeceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models\nassigned to each model training device without knowing the position and\nmonitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module\nto encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to\ndetermine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving\ntraining efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method\nimproves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to\neavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.",

In our model, several base stations (BSs)\nwith heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with\nnon-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL\ntraining incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can\nprocess only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource\nblocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter\ntransmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user\nscheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL\nmethod requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to\ndetermine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication\noverhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the\ntraining loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB\nallocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we\npropose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to\nindependently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the\nconnected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks\nacross all BSs.

However, the reliable explanation using model-based\nprobabilistic causal analysis has not been explored when the MDP's transition\nprobabilities are uncertain. This paper proposes a method to identify potential\ncauses of undesired behaviors in an uncertain parametric MDP (upMDP) using\nparameter sampling, model checking, and a set covering for the samples.

This cascade is predominantly inverse and driven by\ncompressions of the reference field's relative deformation tensor and their\naligments with the uncertainty velocity field. Three other subdominant cascade\nmechanisms are also present, two of which are forward and also dominated by\ncompressions and one of which, the weakest and the only non-linear one of the\nfour, is inverse. The uncertainty production and dissipation scalings which may\nfollow from the self-similar equilibrium cascade of decorrelation lead to power\nlaw growths of the uncertainty integral scale and the average uncertainty\nenergy which are also investigated. Compressions are not only key to\nchaoticity, as previously shown, but also to stochasticity.",

    "abstract": "While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced\nreasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging\ncompetitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that\nare easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a\nbroad set of such \"easy\" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the\nliterature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,\nincluding counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with\nchangeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a\nmath problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required\nto produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While\nprevious work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail\non such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models\nconsistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical\nshortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long\ncontexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the\nunpuzzles dataset, a different \"easy\" benchmark consisting of trivialized\nversions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs\nexcel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized\nversions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing\nthe originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able\nto solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our\nresults highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic\nfor frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even\nfor simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply\nimproved performance.",

Specifically, when voting costs are either high or negligible,\nalternative A wins in all equilibria. However, at intermediate cost levels,\nthis alignment breaks down.

    "abstract": "Financial time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to\ncomplex nonlinear relationships, temporal dependencies, variable\ninterdependencies and limited data availability, particularly for tasks\ninvolving low-frequency data, newly listed instruments, or emerging market\nassets. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution\nthrough pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific\nadaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos)\nacross three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes,\nEUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM\nexhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version\nof TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained\nversion achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and\n15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's\nzero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting\nand equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can\nsurpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model\nconsistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable\nperformance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant\nsample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines,\ntraditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of\nthree tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific\noptimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer\nsubstantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy,\ndata-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires\ndomain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial\ntime series characteristics.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative imaging method using reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces (RISs) by combining radar coincidence imaging (RCI) and\ncomputational imaging techniques. In the proposed framework, RISs\nsimultaneously redirect beams toward a desired region of interest (ROI). The\ninterference of these beams forms spatially diverse speckle patterns that carry\ninformation about the entire ROI. As a result, this method can take advantage\nof the benefits of both random patterns and spotlight imaging. Since the\nspeckle pattern is formed by directive beams (instead of random patterns\ntypically used in computational imaging), this approach results in a higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced clutter. In contrast to raster\nscanning, which requires the number of measurements to be at least equal to the\nnumber of unknowns, our proposed approach follows a computational imaging\nframework and can obtain high-quality images even when only a few measurements\nare taken. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate this method's\ncapabilities and contrast it against other conventional techniques. The\nproposed imaging approach can be applied to security screening, wireless user\ntracking, and activity recognition.",

    ],
    "abstract": "As the demand for compute power in traditional neural networks has increased\nsignificantly, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential\nsolution to increasingly power-hungry neural networks. By operating on 0/1\nspikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate\noperations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for\nmore efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating\nand simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and\nSpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider\ncommunity. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve\nas a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many\nproposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN\ntopology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN\nacceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting\nany-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a\nsynaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture\ntargets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources.\nThe framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves\ncompetitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img). Further\nexperiments also show accurate simulation of hand coded any-to-any spiking\nneural networks on toy problems.

    "abstract": "Nonogram is a popular combinatorial puzzle (similar in nature to Sudoku or\nMinesweeper) in which a puzzle solver must determine if there exists a setting\nof the puzzle parameters that satisfy a given set of constraints. It has long\nbeen known that the problem of deciding if a solution exists is a\ncomputationally difficult problem. Despite this fact, humans still seem to\nenjoy playing it. This work aims to reconcile these seemingly contradictory\nfacts by (1) analyzing the complexity of the inference problem for Nonogram\n(the problem of determining if there exists a puzzle parameter that can be\ninferred from the constraints without guessing) and (2) experimentally\nestablishing the existence of a phase transition behavior for this inference\nproblem. Our results show that the difficulty of the inference problem is\nlargely determined by the density of filled cells (positive parameters) in a\ngiven puzzle. Along the way we implement an efficient encoding of a Nonogram\nboard as a Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) through the use of\nregular expressions in order to make our experiments feasible.",

    "abstract": "The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity theory can be modeled\nby the family of dynamical systems on the torus, which is known as the RSJ\nmodel. This family admits an equivalent description by a family of second-order\ndifferential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present\npaper, we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be\nequivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four\nsingular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The\nfirst family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be\ndenoted by dRSJ. The phase-lock areas of a family of dynamical systems on the\ntorus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have\nnonempty interiors. It is known that for the RSJ model, the rotation number\nquantization effect occurs: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation\nnumber values. Moreover, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated\nby points. Those separation points that do not lie on the abscissa axis are\ncalled constrictions. In the present paper, we study phase-lock areas in the\nnew family dRSJ. The quantization effect remains valid in this family. On the\nother hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive efforts, discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrino\nsources remains elusive. We present an event-level simultaneous maximum\nlikelihood analysis of tracks and cascades using IceCube data collected from\nApril 6, 2008 to May 23, 2022 to search the whole sky for neutrino sources and,\nusing a source catalog, for coincidence of neutrino emission with gamma-ray\nemission. This is the first time a simultaneous fit of different detection\nchannels is used to conduct a time-integrated all-sky scan with IceCube.\nCombining all-sky tracks, with superior pointing-power and sensitivity in the\nnorthern sky, with all-sky cascades, with good energy-resolution and\nsensitivity in the southern sky, we have developed the most sensitive\npoint-source search to date by IceCube which targets the entire sky. The most\nsignificant point in the northern sky aligns with NGC 1068, a Seyfert II\ngalaxy, which shows a 3.5$\\sigma$ excess over background after accounting for\ntrials. The most significant point in the southern sky does not align with any\nsource in the catalog and is not significant after accounting for trials. A\nsearch for the single most significant Gaussian flare at the locations of NGC\n1068, PKS 1424+240, and the southern highest significance point shows results\nconsistent with expectations for steady emission. Notably, this is the first\ntime that a flare shorter than four years has been excluded as being\nresponsible for NGC 1068's emergence as a neutrino source. Our results show\nthat combining tracks and cascades when conducting neutrino source searches\nimproves sensitivity and can lead to new discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Accurate computational modeling of damage and fracture remains a central\nchallenge in solid mechanics. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used\nfor numerical modeling of fracture problems; however, classical damage models\nwithout gradient regularization yield mesh-dependent and usually inaccurate\npredictions. The use of gradient damage with FEM improves numerical robustness\nbut introduces significant mathematical and numerical implementation\ncomplexities. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can encode the governing\npartial differential equations, boundary conditions, and constitutive models\ninto the loss functions, offering a new method for fracture modeling. Prior\napplications of PINNs have been limited to small-strain problems and have\nincorporated gradient damage formulation without a critical evaluation of its\nnecessity. Since PINNs in their basic form are meshless, this work presents a\nPINN framework for modeling fracture in elastomers undergoing large deformation\nwithout the gradient damage formulation. The PINN implementation here does not\nrequire training data and utilizes the collocation method to formulate\nphysics-informed loss functions. We have validated the PINN's predictions for\nvarious defect configurations using benchmark solutions obtained from FEM with\ngradient damage formulation. The crack paths obtained using the PINN are\napproximately insensitive to the collocation point distribution. This study\noffers new insights into the feasibility of using PINNs without gradient damage\nand suggests a simplified and efficient computational modeling strategy for\nfracture problems. The performance of the PINN has been evaluated through\nsystematic variations in key neural network parameters to provide guidance for\nfuture applications. The results provide motivation for extending PINN-based\napproaches to a broader class of materials and damage models in mechanics.",

We propose a framework for modelling\ntreatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling\nthe extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak\neffect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and\nverifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt\nSemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the\ncausal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our\napproach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of\nclinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting\ndomain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis.

Explicit expressions are provided for the vacuum expectation values\n(VEVs) of the electric and magnetic field squares, field condensate, and for\nthe VEV of the energy-momentum tensor. In the zero-mass limit the VEVs of the\nelectric and magnetic field squares and the condensate reduce to the\ncorresponding expressions for a massless vector field. The same is the case for\nthe VEV of the energy-momentum tensor in the problem with PEC conditions.\nHowever, for PMC conditions the zero-mass limit for the vacuum energy-momentum\ntensor differs from the corresponding VEV for a massless field. This difference\nin the zero-mass limits is related to the different influences of the boundary\nconditions on the longitudinal polarization mode of a massive vector field. The\nPMC conditions constrain all the polarization modes including the longitudinal\nmode, whereas PEC conditions do not influence the longitudinal mode. The vacuum\nenergy-momentum tensor is diagonal. The normal stress is uniformly distributed\nin the region between the plates and vanishes in the remaining regions.

X-ray methods\ndeliver three-dimensional imaging of integrated circuits but lack the spatial\nresolution to characterize atomic-scale features, while conventional electron\nmicroscopy offers atomic-scale imaging but limited depth information. We\ndemonstrate how multislice electron ptychography (MEP), a computational\nelectron microscopy technique with sub-\\r{A}ngstr\\\"om lateral and\nnanometer-scale depth resolution, enables 3D imaging of buried features in\ndevices. By performing MEP on prototype gate-all-around transistors we uncover\nand quantify distortions and defects at the interface of the 3D gate oxide\nwrapped around the channel. We find that the silicon in the 5-nm-thick channel\ngradually relaxes away from the interfaces, leaving only 60% of the atoms in a\nbulk-like structure. Quantifying the interface roughness, which was not\npreviously possible for such small 3D structures but strongly impacts carrier\nmobility, we find that the top and bottom interfaces show different\natomic-scale roughness profiles, reflecting their different processing\nconditions. By measuring 3D interface roughness simultaneously with strain\nrelaxation and atomic-scale defects, from a single MEP dataset, we provide\ndirect experimental values of these performance-limiting parameters needed for\nmodeling and early fabrication optimization.",

What happens if instead of exactly matched accelerations,\nthe changing tension in the string introduces small fluctuations that disrupt\nthe lockstep acceleration? This relaxation of the requirement of lockstep\nacceleration dramatically changes the motion of the two ships.

    "abstract": "As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of\ninternet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which\nmodels are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension\nof security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed\npipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and\ncommunication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential\nadversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy\nspecifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing\nthe original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple\nstatistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to\nenable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic\nexperimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models\ntrained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,\ntremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings\nunderscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the\ndesign of secure distributed deep learning systems.",

The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of\nIoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both\nprivacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)\noffers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without\nexposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx\noften fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and\nnon-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint\nmalware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E\n(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports\nindirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.\nEach client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact\nsummaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to\nclients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based\naugmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than\nrelying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables\nclients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns\nobserved across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.\nThis targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity\nwith minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset\nunder realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.",

    "abstract": "Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide\npersonalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,\ne.g., \"I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor\". Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural\nlanguage processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework\nthat mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge\nof an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation\nsystems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with\nlanguage-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,\nimplemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the\nMovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base\nalgorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit\nrates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our\nframework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use\nrating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test\nsplit. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on\nusers' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more\npersonalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly\nsurpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of\nup to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a\nslight increase in computational overhead.",

The image is segmented into\nthree-dimensional blocks, and a tree-structured vector quantizer is built for\neach block. These trees are manipulated using an iterative algorithm until the\nresulting block satisfies a required criterion, which establishes the embedded\nmark.

It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a\nsystem responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property.\nApplications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To\nprove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry\nproperty, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of\ncertain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS\nrelation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH),\nwhich explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation\ncontains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size.\nNon-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed\nrecently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum\nmany-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as\nusual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we\nargue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a\nHeisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational\ncapacity, indirectly support the larger correction.

The fundamental challenge of disassembly is to identify\ninstruction and function boundaries. Classic approaches rely on file-format\nassumptions and architecture-specific heuristics to guess the boundaries,\nresulting in incomplete and incorrect disassembly, especially when the binary\nis obfuscated. Recent advancements of disassembly have demonstrated that deep\nlearning can improve both the accuracy and efficiency of disassembly. In this\npaper, we propose Disa, a new learning-based disassembly approach that uses the\ninformation of superset instructions over the multi-head self-attention to\nlearn the instructions' correlations, thus being able to infer function\nentry-points and instruction boundaries. Disa can further identify instructions\nrelevant to memory block boundaries to facilitate an advanced block-memory\nmodel based value-set analysis for an accurate control flow graph (CFG)\ngeneration. Our experiments show that Disa outperforms prior deep-learning\ndisassembly approaches in function entry-point identification, especially\nachieving 9.1% and 13.2% F1-score improvement on binaries respectively\nobfuscated by the disassembly desynchronization technique and popular\nsource-level obfuscator.

Although many studies describe data preparation within the context of\ndata science workflows, there has been little research on data preparation in\ndata journalism. We address this gap with a hybrid form of thematic analysis\nthat combines deductive codes derived from existing accounts of data science\nworkflows and inductive codes arising from an interview study with 36\nprofessional data journalists. We extend a previous model of data science work\nto incorporate detailed activities of data preparation. We synthesize 60 dirty\ndata issues from 16 taxonomies on dirty data and our interview data, and we\nprovide a novel taxonomy to characterize these dirty data issues as\ndiscrepancies between mental models.

    "abstract": "Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear\nphysical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,\ncomputational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning\ntechniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would\nenable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty\nquantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such\napproach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack\nnucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques\nhave shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely\non overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the\nfracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark\nand advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three\nenergy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial\ncrack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100\ntime steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this\ndataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks\n(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and\nexplore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this\ncombination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim\nto provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine\nlearning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise\nand limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this\ndataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces and develops the \"Spectral Fingerprint Philosophy\" for\ndetecting algebraic cycles on complex algebraic varieties, particularly K3\nsurfaces. This framework proposes that algebraic cycles can be revealed through\nintrinsic Hodge-theoretic and arithmetic data, leveraging the algebraic\nstructure of period relations, Picard-Fuchs differential equations, and special\nvalues of motivic L-functions. The methodology extends to $(k,k)$-Hodge cycles\non higher-dimensional K\\\"ahler manifolds, formulating a general criterion that\nlinks vanishing linear combinations of periods (interpreted as \"spectral\nfingerprints\") to the algebraicity of cycles and the arithmetic of\ncorresponding L-functions. This perspective reframes the Hodge Conjecture as a\nstatement about the algebraicity of spectral data within the variation of Hodge\nstructures. A key contribution is the proposal and proof of a novel algebraic\ndivisor on the Kummer K3 surface $X_{-1}$, which arises from complex\nmultiplication (CM) on the elliptic curve $E_{2}(-1)$. By explicitly analyzing\nthe period structure of $X_{-1}$, a non-trivial linear relation among period\nintegrals, constituting the spectral fingerprint of this divisor, is derived.\nThis result exemplifies how CM relations induce additional Hodge cycles and\nillustrates the broader philosophy behind spectral criteria for algebraicity,\ngrounding the theory in established mathematical results and presenting\nconcrete examples through case studies of genus-2 Riemann surfaces and Kummer\nK3 surfaces.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a hybrid approach integrating advanced plasmonic\nnanomaterials and machine learning (ML) for high-precision biomolecule\ndetection. We leverage aluminum concave nanocubes (AlCNCs) as an innovative\nplasmonic substrate to enhance the native fluorescence of neurotransmitters,\nincluding dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic\nacid (DOPAC). AlCNCs amplify weak fluorescence signals, enabling probe-free,\nlabel-free detection and differentiation of these molecules with great\nsensitivity and specificity. To further improve classification accuracy, we\nemploy ML algorithms, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks playing a\ncentral role in analyzing time-dependent fluorescence data. Comparative\nevaluations with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) demonstrate\nthe superior performance of LSTM in distinguishing neurotransmitters. The\nresults reveal that AlCNC substrates provide up to a 12-fold enhancement in\nfluorescence intensity for DA, 9-fold for NE, and 7-fold for DOPAC compared to\nsilicon substrates. At the same time, ML algorithms achieve classification\naccuracy exceeding 89%. This interdisciplinary methodology bridges the gap\nbetween nanotechnology and ML, showcasing the synergistic potential of\nAlCNC-enhanced native fluorescence and ML in biosensing. The framework paves\nthe way for probe-free, label-free biomolecule profiling, offering\ntransformative implications for biomedical diagnostics and neuroscience\nresearch.",

SiPMs are arranged into modular\nphotosensors called Tiles, each integrating 24 SiPMs onto a printed circuit\nboard (PCB) that provides signal amplification, power distribution, and a\nsingle-ended output for simplified readout. 16 Tiles are further grouped into\nPhoto-Detector Units (PDUs). This paper details the production of the Tiles and\nthe quality assurance and quality control (QA-QC) protocol established to\nensure their performance and uniformity. The production and QA-QC of the Tiles\nare carried out at Nuova Officina Assergi (NOA), an ISO-6 clean room facility\nat LNGS. This process includes wafer-level cryogenic characterisation,\nprecision flip-chip bonding, wire bonding, and extensive electrical and optical\nvalidation of each Tile. The overall production yield exceeds 83.5%, matching\nthe requirements of the DarkSide-20k production plan.

    "abstract": "Navigation and inspection in confined environments, such as tunnels and\npipes, pose significant challenges for existing robots due to limitations in\nmaneuverability and adaptability to varying geometries. Vine robots, which are\nsoft growing continuum robots that extend their length through soft material\neversion at their tip, offer unique advantages due to their ability to navigate\ntight spaces, adapt to complex paths, and minimize friction. However, existing\nvine robot designs struggle with navigation in manmade and natural passageways,\nwith branches and sharp 3D turns. In this letter, we introduce a steerable vine\nrobot specifically designed for pipe and burrow environments. The robot\nfeatures a simple tubular body and an external tip mount that steers the vine\nrobot in three degrees of freedom by changing the growth direction and, when\nnecessary, bracing against the wall of the pipe or burrow. Our external tip\nsteering approach enables: (1) active branch selection in 3D space with a\nmaximum steerable angle of 51.7{\\deg}, (2) navigation of pipe networks with\nradii as small as 2.5 cm, (3) a compliant tip enabling navigation of sharp\nturns, and (4) real-time 3D localization in GPS-denied environments using\ntip-mounted sensors and continuum body odometry. We describe the forward\nkinematics, characterize steerability, and demonstrate the system in a 3D pipe\nsystem as well as a natural animal burrow.",

To address these, we propose a modular data center architecture based\non Compute Express Link (CXL) that enables disaggregated scaling of memory,\ncompute, and accelerators. We further explore accelerator-optimized\ninterconnects-collectively termed XLink (e.g., UALink, NVLink, NVLink\nFusion)-and introduce a hybrid CXL-over-XLink design to reduce long-distance\ndata transfers while preserving memory coherence. We also propose a\nhierarchical memory model that combines local and pooled memory, and evaluate\nlightweight CXL implementations, HBM, and silicon photonics for efficient\nscaling.

    "abstract": "The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear\ndynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic\nmode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to\nidentify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this\nidea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to\nlearn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these\nmethods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable\noperations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value\ndecomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can\nintroduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In\nthis work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning\nthe top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical\nsystems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates\nthe need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into\nmodern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned\nsingular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as\neigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.",

Existing solutions predominantly rely on\nrigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable\ngarments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior\nrobotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control\nstrategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and\nadaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the\nSelf-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth\nmechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches,the\nSWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling based deployment method,\neliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient\ndressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its\ndesign and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance.\nThe proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various\ngarment configurations, presenting a promising alternative to conventional\nrobotic dressing assistance.",

The solutions, formulated with CTAB/NaSal and CPyCl/NaSal,\nexhibit comparable bulk rheology and equilibrium microstructural properties. By\nvarying the TC gap size, we systematically examine elasticity number over a\nrange of 128000-4470000, while flow curvature spans from 0.022 to 0.171. Under\na step shear into the stress plateau, both solutions exhibit a pronounced\nstress overshoot that intensifies with increasing elasticity number and flow\ncurvature, followed by the development of growing flow heterogeneities. Beyond\na critical threshold of elasticity number and curvature, the CTAB/NaSal\nsolution exhibits transient flow reversal, whereas the CPyCl/NaSal solution,\ndespite developing similar heterogeneities, does not undergo flow reversal\nunder any tested conditions. We hypothesize that this difference arises from\nthe stronger electrostatic repulsions between CPyCl head groups due to their\nlarger size, coupled with the higher dissociation rate of Cl counterions.\nAdditionally, the quasi-steady velocity profiles are significantly influenced\nby elasticity number and flow curvature. Wall slip at the outer cylinder\nexhibits a non-monotonic dependence on these parameters: it is negligible at\nlow values of elasticity number and flow curvature, peaks at intermediate\nvalues, and diminishes at high values.

On the other hand, multimodal\nLLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially\nwhen compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to\ninsufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper\naims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image\nmodels, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a\nnovel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating\nimages that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text\nprompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable\nDiffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and\nStable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro\n1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions\ngenerated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used\nto generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the\nText-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o\nusing the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two\ndescriptions.

A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a sharp\npeak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and\nabove 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a\nspherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile\nagrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly\nshallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic\nuncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In\nparticular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative\nto the LAT standard background model, which does not depend on GALPROP or other\nmodel templates.

The\nalignment based on RAdiative Torques (RATs), known as RAT Alignment or RAT-A\nmechanism is the most acceptable mechanism. In this work, we investigate the\ngrain alignment mechanisms in F13 (F13N and F13C) and F13S filamentary regions\nof the Cocoon Nebula (IC 5146) using polarized thermal dust emission\nobservations from JCMT/POL-2 at 850 $\\mu$m. We find that the polarization\nfraction decreases with increasing total intensity and gas column density in\neach region, termed as polarization hole. We investigate for any role of\nmagnetic field tangling on the observed polarization hole by estimating the\npolarization angle dispersion function. Our study finds that the polarization\nhole is not significantly influenced by magnetic field tangling, but majorly\ndue to decrease in RAT alignment efficiency of grains in denser regions. To\ntest whether RAT-A mechanism can reproduce the observational results, we\nestimate minimum alignment size of grains using RAT theory. Our study finds\nstrong evidence for RAT-A mechanism that can explain the polarization hole. We\nalso find potential hints that the observed higher polarization fractions in\nsome regions of F13 filament can be due to combined effects of both\nsuprathermal rotation by RATs and enhanced magnetic relaxation, supporting the\nMagnetically-Enhanced RAT (M-RAT) mechanism.",

To provide a computationally efficient yet accurate\nalternative-particularly for modeling 2D spectra or collective coupling for\nlarge, heavy-element systems-this article introduces a two-component\nlinear-response QEDFT method based on exact two-component (X2C) Hamiltonian\nmodels. We derive how the parent four-component Hamiltonian for coupled\nelectron-photon systems undergoes the X2C transformation. Moreover, we show\nthat, under common weak-field and dipole approximations, it suffices to apply\nthe X2C transformation only during the ground-state self-consistent field\nprocedure, with the subsequent calculations performed fully in the\ntwo-component regime using the same X2C decoupling matrix. The current\nimplementation includes the atomic mean-field (amfX2C), extended atomic\nmean-field (eamfX2C), and molecular mean-field (mmfX2C) Hamiltonian models.\nBenchmark calculations demonstrate that the X2C approach closely reproduces\nreference four-component results, enabling us to efficiently tackle systems\nthat would be otherwise computationally too expensive. As applications, we\ncompute 2D spectra of a mercury porphyrin complex in a Fabry-Perot cavity,\ndemonstrating off-resonant coupling and the appearance of multiple polaritonic\nbranches.

This paper\npresents a learning-based travel demand modeling framework that synthesizes\nhousehold-coordinated daily activity patterns based on a household's\nsocio-demographic profiles. The whole framework integrates population\nsynthesis, coordinated activity generation, location assignment, and\nlarge-scale microscopic traffic simulation into a unified system. It is fully\ngenerative, data-driven, scalable, and transferable to other regions. A\nfull-pipeline implementation is conducted in Los Angeles with a 10 million\npopulation. Comprehensive validation shows that the model closely replicates\nreal-world mobility patterns and matches the performance of legacy ABMs with\nsignificantly reduced modeling cost and greater scalability. With respect to\nthe SCAG ABM benchmark, the origin-destination matrix achieves a cosine\nsimilarity of 0.97, and the daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network\nyields a 0.006 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and a 9.8% mean absolute\npercentage error (MAPE). When compared to real-world observations from Caltrans\nPeMS, the evaluation on corridor-level traffic speed and volume reaches a 0.001\nJSD and a 6.11% MAPE.",

This enables learning\nfrom the probabilistic structure of prediction residuals, leveraging the\nauxiliary model's prediction distribution as a source to reduce learning\ndifficulty and refine forecasts. CGFM incorporates historical data as both\nconditions and guidance, uses two-sided conditional paths (with source and\ntarget conditioned on the same history), and employs affine paths to expand the\npath space, avoiding path crossing without complex mechanisms, preserving\ntemporal consistency, and strengthening distribution alignment.

The\nredness of LRDs is likely intrinsic, suggesting optically thick gas emitting at\na characteristic effective temperature of $\\sim5000{\\rm~K}$. Meanwhile, many\nLRD spectra exhibit a Balmer break, often attributed to absorption by a dense\ngas shell surrounding an AGN. Using semi-analytical atmosphere models and\nradiation transport calculations, we show that a super-Eddington accretion\nsystem can give rise to a Balmer break and a red optical color simultaneously,\nwithout invoking external gas absorption for the break or dust reddening. The\nbreak originates from a discontinuity in opacity across the Balmer limit,\nsimilar to that of early-type stars, but the lower photosphere density of\nsuper-Eddington systems, $\\rho<10^{-9}{\\rm~g~cm^{-3}}$, implies a significant\nopacity contrast even at a cool photosphere temperature of $\\sim5000{\\rm~K}$.\nFurthermore, while accretion in the form of a standard thin disk requires fine\ntuning to match the optical color of LRDs, an alternative scenario of a\ngeometrically thick, roughly spherical accretion flow implies an effective\ntemperature $4000{\\rm~K}\\lesssim T_{\\rm eff}\\lesssim6000{\\rm~K}$ that is very\ninsensitive to the accretion rate (analogous to the Hayashi line in stellar\nmodels). The continuum spectra from the latter scenario align with the Balmer\nbreak and optical color of currently known LRDs.

After defining the winding number\nof the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we\nsystematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal\n(opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation\nfor this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian\nwinding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change\nsign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This\ntransition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect\nlocalization, is rendered invisible by postselection.

Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data.

    "abstract": "We use Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) to factorize the polarized Deep\nInelastic Scattering (DIS) structure functions $g_1(x)$ and $g_2(x)$, and to\nsum Sudakov double logarithms of $1-x$. The analysis is done both in terms of\nlightcone parton distributions and their moments. Computing $g_2$ requires\nsubleading SCET operators which contain gluons. We calculate the one-loop\nmatching coefficients from QCD onto these subleading SCET operators, and the\none-loop matching from SCET onto the parton distribution function (PDF). The\nPDF in SCET is given by a bilocal operator, rather than the trilocal operator\nused in the QCD analysis of $g_2$ for generic $x$. We compute the one-loop\nanomalous dimension of the PDF operator for any $x$, and show that as $x \\to\n1$, it factors into a single-variable evolution.\n  We comment on the QCD anomalous dimensions of twist-three operators, their\nequation-of-motion relation, and connection to the SCET analysis. We briefly\ndiscuss the definition of axial operators in the BMHV scheme. As a side result,\nwe derive the $1/N$ dependence of the QCD coefficient functions for $F_1$,\n$F_L$ and $g_1$ in the $N \\to \\infty$ limit, where $N$ is the moment, which is\nexpected to hold to all orders in $\\alpha_s$.",

When the index counts black hole microstates, crossing\nsuch walls of marginal stability amounts to the appearance or disappearance of\na large number of such states. While wall-crossing has been understood in\nstring theory and through the disappearance of extremal Lorentzian supergravity\nsolutions as the moduli are varied, there has been no understanding about how\nthe discontinuous changes in the index occur at the level of the gravitational\npath integral. In this paper, we find the finite-temperature saddles in $4d$\nflatspace supergravity in which fermionic fields are periodic when going around\nthe thermal circle that correspond to the multi-center black hole contributions\nto the index. By analyzing these saddles, we can explain how wall-crossing\noccurs: as the scalar moduli in supergravity are varied at the asymptotic\nboundary, for a given split of the charges, the saddle point equations can no\nlonger be solved and, consequently, the corresponding multi-center saddle no\nlonger contributes to the index. While the values of the scalars and the jump\nin the index when a wall is crossed all agree with the prediction from\npreviously found Lorentzian supergravity solutions, the saddles in the index\nexhibit a much richer moduli space, which we analyze in detail.",

Previous studies have shown that planets orbiting Sun-like stars\nexhibit an eccentricity-radius trend such that larger planets have higher\norbital eccentricities, and that radius gap planets may have modestly higher\norbital eccentricities than planets on either side of the radius gap. In this\nwork, we investigate the trend for a sample of smaller M dwarf stars. For a\nsample of 236 single- and multi-transit confirmed planets or candidates\ndiscovered by the TESS and Kepler missions, we constrain orbital eccentricity\nfor each planet from the transit photometry together with a stellar density\nprior. We investigate the binned eccentricity-planet radius relation for the\ncombined planet sample and present evidence for a positive eccentricity-radius\nrelationship with elevated eccentricities for planets larger than 3.5 R_earth,\nsimilar to the trend for planets orbiting Sun-like stars. We find modest\nevidence that single-transit M dwarf planets near the radius gap exhibit higher\neccentricity, consistent with trends for Sun-like stars. However, we see no\nevidence for an increased eccentricity near the radius gap among multi-transit\nM dwarf planets.

However, the measured\nmass outflow rates are highly uncertain because JWST observations can only\nprobe the column density of trace elements such as sodium, while most of the\ngas is in the form of hydrogen. The conversion between the column density of\nsodium and that of hydrogen is based on observations of gas clouds within the\nMilky Way, and has not been directly tested for massive galaxies at high\nredshift. In order to test this conversion, we study a unique system consisting\nof a massive quiescent galaxy (J1439B) at z = 2.4189 located at a projected\ndistance of 38 physical kpc from the bright background quasar QSO J1439. The\nneutral outflow from the galaxy is observed as a sub-damped Lyman-alpha\nabsorber in the spectrum of the background quasar, which enables a direct\nmeasurement of the hydrogen column density from Lyman transitions. We obtain\nnew near-infrared spectroscopy with Magellan/FIRE and detect Na I D and other\nresonant absorption lines from Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II. We are thus able to\nderive new, empirical calibrations between the column density of trace elements\nand the hydrogen column density, that can be used to estimate the mass and the\nrate of neutral gas outflows in other massive quiescent galaxies at high\nredshift. The calibration we derive for Na I is only 30% lower than the local\nrelation that is typically assumed at high redshift, confirming that the\nneutral outflows observed with JWST at z > 2 are able to remove a large amount\nof gas and are thus likely to play a key role in galaxy quenching. However,\nusing the local calibration for Mg II yields an order-of-magnitude discrepancy\ncompared to the empirical calibration, possibly because of variations in the\ndust depletion.",

    "abstract": "Pioneering thermal transport measurements on two-dimensional electron gases\nin high magnetic fields have demonstrated that the quantized Hall state at\nfilling factor $\\nu=5/2$ has a thermal Hall conductance $\\kappa$ quantized in\nhalf-integer multiples of $\\kappa_0 = {\\pi^2 k_B^2 T}/{3h}$. Half-integer\n$\\kappa/\\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked\nto the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the\nexperimentally observed value of $\\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian'\nstate, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the\nPfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to\nexplain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments\nor else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group\nstudies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge\nstructure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an\n'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the\ntheory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can \"screen'' a Pfaffian or\nAntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from\nthose of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is\nconsistent with experiment.",

    "abstract": "Understanding variations in the dust extinction curve is imperative for using\ndust as a tracer of local structure in the interstellar medium, understanding\ndust chemistry, and observational color corrections where dust is a nuisance\nparameter. However, the extinction curve is complicated and exhibits features\nacross a wide range of wavelength scales, from narrow atomic lines and diffuse\ninterstellar bands (\"DIBs\"), to intermediate-scale and very broad structures\n(\"ISS\" and \"VBS\"), and the overall slope of the optical extinction curve,\nparameterized by R(V). Robust, population-level studies of variations in these\nfeatures are only now possible with large, all-sky, spectroscopic surveys.\nHowever, these features are often studied independently because they require\ndrastically different spectral resolution. In this work, we couple features\nwith disparate wavelength scales by cross-matching precision catalogs of DIB\nmeasurements from APOGEE and Gaia RVS with low-resolution extinction-curve\nmeasurements from Gaia XP. Using this combination, we show that there are\nmeaningful correlations between the strengths of extinction-curve features\nacross all wavelength scales. We present a model that statistically explains\npart of the excess scatter in DIB strength versus extinction, and we show\nvariation in line shapes of two DIBs as a function of R(V). We find that most\nDIBs increase in strength with increasing R(V) and/or increasing strength of\nthe ISS, though we found one DIB that anomalously decreases in strength with\nincreasing R(V). Using the behavior of the ensemble of DIBs in APOGEE, we\npresent this as the first evidence of systematic chemical variation\naccompanying R(V) variation.",

Spectral modeling reveals a dominant disc\nblackbody component and a Comptonising emitting region, with evidence of a\nbroad iron line associated with a reflection component. Spectropolarimetric\nfits suggest differing polarisation properties for the disc and Comptonised\ncomponents, slightly favouring a spreading layer geometry. The polarisation of\nthe Comptonised component exceeds the theoretical expectations, but is in line\nwith the results for other Z-sources with similar inclination. A study of the\nreflection's polarisation is also reported, with polarisation degree ranging\naround 10% depending on the assumptions. Despite GX 349+2's classification as a\nSco-like source, these polarimetric results align more closely with the\nCyg-like system GX 340+0 of similar inclination.

To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders.

In this work, we revisit small\nbatch sizes all the way down to batch size one, and we propose a rule for\nscaling Adam hyperparameters to small batch sizes. In particular, rather than\nholding the decay rate of the second moment fixed across batch sizes, we\npropose to hold its half-life fixed in terms of tokens. We find that small\nbatch sizes (1) train stably, (2) are consistently more robust to\nhyperparameter choices, (3) achieve equal or better per-FLOP performance than\nlarger batch sizes, and (4) notably enable stable language model training with\nvanilla SGD, even without momentum, despite storing no optimizer state.\nBuilding on these results, we provide practical recommendations for selecting a\nbatch size and setting optimizer hyperparameters.

We find that when\nKerr-type nonlinearity (or saturable gain) is introduced, the linear ER splits\ninto two concentric ERs, with the larger-radius ring being a ring of\nthird-order EPs. Transitioning from linear to nonlinear regime, we present a\nrigorous analysis of spectral topology and report enhanced and adjustable\nperturbation response in the nonlinear regime. Whereas certain features are\nspecific to our system, the results on non-Hermitian spectral topology and\nnonlinearity-enhanced perturbation response are generic and equally relevant to\na broad class of other nonlinear non-Hermitian systems, providing a universal\nframework for engineering ERs and EPs in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.",

Previous analyses have\nruled out GeV-bright blazars as the predominant contributor to the high-energy\nastrophysical neutrino flux under simple correlation assumptions about the\nrelationship between the fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos. We present results\nfrom a more general and more sensitive search for correlation between neutrinos\nand GeV-selected AGN using improvements in the IceCube statistical methods and\n13 years of data. We detect no correlation and set stringent constraints on\nneutrino emission by populations of GeV-detected AGN. These include constraints\non the neutrino emission from subclasses of GeV-detected AGN, including BL\nLacs, flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) and non-blazar AGN, using stacking\nanalyses testing a variety of hypothesized relationships between neutrino and\ngamma-ray flux.

Despite a 12 billion dollars\ninfrastructure investment in 2022, Florida ranks eighth nationally for fatal\nwork zone crashes involving commercial motor vehicles (CMVs).

    "abstract": "The widely anticipated outburst of recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB),\nwhich is near the end of its 80-year cycle, provides an excellent opportunity\nto search for neutrinos from novae. Novae are an energetic class of transients,\nwhich have been studied for hundreds of years. Because many of them are located\nnearby, novae provide an excellent astrophysical laboratory to study\nshock-powered emission in our own backyard. Several recent novae have\npreviously been detected in GeV gamma rays, and the 2021 outburst of RS\nOphiuchi was detected up to TeV energies, with evidence for a hadronic origin\nof the observed emission. Previous searches for GeV-TeV neutrinos from novae,\npredicted to occur alongside their gamma-ray emission, have been performed\nusing data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. However, no significant\nneutrino signals from novae have yet been observed. We present plans for\nfollow-up of T CrB in real time with IceCube, using datasets spanning GeV to\nPeV neutrino energies. Due to its closer distance and higher optical flux,\nwhich has been well measured in two historical eruptions, the expected neutrino\nsignal from T CrB is several times stronger than that from RS Ophiuchi.\nFurthermore, T CrB is located in the Northern sky at a declination where\nIceCube's sensitivity is an additional factor of a few better than at the\nlocation of RS Ophiuchi, which is beneficial to this search.",

For any Tate ring $\\mathcal{A}$ with a Noetherian ring of definition\n$\\mathcal{A}_{0}$ and pseudo-uniformizer $\\varpi\\in\\mathcal{A}_{0}$, we prove\nthat the Shilov boundary for $\\mathcal{A}$ naturally coincides with the set of\nRees valuation rings of the principal ideal $(\\varpi)_{\\mathcal{A}_{0}}$ of\n$\\mathcal{A}_{0}$.\n  Furthermore, we characterize the Shilov boundary for a wide class of Tate\nrings by means of minimal open prime ideals in the subring of power-bounded\nelements. For affinoid algebras, in the sense of Tate, whose underlying rings\nare integral domains, this recovers a well-known result of Berkovich.

In this work, we present a\nmethod for measuring FRB DMs in IllustrisTNG that continuously traces rays\nthrough the simulation while reconstructing all traversed line segments within\nthe underlying Voronoi mesh. Leveraging this technique, we create over $20$\npublicly available DM catalogs, including a full-sky DM map observed from a\nMilky Way-like environment. Our method addresses a problem in previous\nTNG-based studies, in which a sparse snapshot sampling in the path integral\nleads to a misestimation of the standard deviation and higher moments of the DM\ndistribution $p(\\rm{DM}|z)$ by over $50\\%$. We show that our results are\nconsistent with the most recent observational data from the DSA-110, ASKAP, and\nCHIME. We offer a functional form for $p(\\rm{DM}| z)$ that provides very good\nfits across all redshifts from $0$ to $5.5$, showing that the previously\nproposed log-normal distribution is not well matched to the data. We find that\nusing simulation box sizes smaller than $35\\,h^{-1}\\,$Mpc or resolutions with\nbaryonic masses of less than $5\\times10^{8}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$ can distort the\nderived DM signal by more than $8\\%$. Our findings provide new insights into\nhow the cosmic web shapes FRB signals, and highlight the importance of accurate\nmethodology when comparing cosmological simulations against observations.",

Yet while many SNRs have been observed in nonthermal emission\nin radio, X-rays, and gamma rays, there is no evidence for any individual\nobject contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular\nspectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent\nescape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by\ntens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux\nuncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily\ndetectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the\nresulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach.

    "abstract": "Estimating the position of a speech source based on\ntime-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) is often adversely affected by background\nnoise and reverberation. A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a\nmicrophone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase\ntransform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone\npairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of\nmicrophone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of\nmicrophone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently\na more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs\nby computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT\nfunction reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on\nthe TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT\nfunctions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral\ndensities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we\nincrease the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs\ncomputed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals\nrecorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially\ndistributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in\nterms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error.\nExperimental results for different source and microphone configurations and\nthree reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering\nmultiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation\naccuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely\non a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position\nestimation.",

    "abstract": "We propose two novel solutions to the domain wall problem of the QCD axion by\nintroducing a massless or light axion that also couples to gluons. The first\nsolution applies when the new axion forms strings after inflation. Due to its\nmixing with the QCD axion, domain walls of the QCD axion are bounded by these\nstrings and confined into cosmologically safe string bundles. This scenario\npredicts the existence of such string bundles, which may survive until today\nand leave observable signatures, such as gravitational waves, cosmic\nbirefringence, and CMB anisotropies. The simultaneous detection of the QCD\naxion and any of these cosmological signatures would serve as a smoking-gun\nsignal. The second solution assumes a homogeneous initial condition for the new\naxion. If it is sufficiently light, its potential temporarily induces a bias in\nthe QCD axion potential before the onset of oscillations, rendering the domain\nwalls unstable. In both scenarios, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism remains\neffective, and the strong CP problem is not reintroduced. We identify the\nviable parameter regions and discuss the resulting dark matter abundance.",

While curriculum learning has demonstrated success in\nsingle-agent domains, principled approaches for multi-agent coordination remain\nlimited due to the absence of validated task complexity metrics. This approach\npresents a graph-based coordination complexity metric that integrates agent\ndependency entropy, spatial interference patterns, and goal overlap analysis to\npredict task difficulty in multi-agent environments. The complexity metric\nachieves strong empirical validation with rho = 0.952 correlation (p < 0.001)\nbetween predicted complexity and empirical difficulty determined by random\nagent performance evaluation. This approach evaluates the curriculum learning\nframework using MADDPG across two distinct coordination environments: achieving\n56x performance improvement in tight coordination tasks (MultiWalker) and\ndemonstrating systematic task progression in cooperative navigation (Simple\nSpread). Through systematic analysis, coordination tightness emerges as a\npredictor of curriculum learning effectiveness, where environments requiring\nstrict agent interdependence benefit substantially from structured progression.\nThis approach provides a validated complexity metric for multi-agent curriculum\ndesign and establishes empirical guidelines for multi-robot coordination\napplications.",

    "abstract": "The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric\ndeep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object\nunder consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a\ntriangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),\nand computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is\nthe number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when\nrepeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control\napplications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions\nabout the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution\nto this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the\nLB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant\ncomputational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB\nspectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a\nrich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,\nand principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make\navailable, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical\nCAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training\nand testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time\nof the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering\ncompetitive accuracy.",

These signatures largely defy description by\ncommonly known exciton transport mechanisms and are related to the currents of\nincoherent magnons induced by laser excitation instead. We propose that the\ndrag forces exerted by these currents can effectively imprint characteristic\nproperties of spin excitations onto the motion of excitons.

Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as\nsimulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate\nsite-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there\nis a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality\n(sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews\nrecent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital\ntwins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real\ngap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between\ndigital twin-generated and real data.

This work explores parameter pruning to\nimprove parameter efficiency while maintaining recommendation quality, thereby\nenabling easier deployment. Unlike existing approaches that focus primarily on\ninter-layer redundancy, we uncover intra-layer redundancy within components\nsuch as self-attention and MLP modules. Building on this analysis, we propose a\nmore fine-grained pruning approach that integrates both intra-layer and\nlayer-wise pruning. Specifically, we introduce a three-stage pruning strategy\nthat progressively prunes parameters at different levels and parts of the\nmodel, moving from intra-layer to layer-wise pruning, or from width to depth.\nEach stage also includes a performance restoration step using distillation\ntechniques, helping to strike a balance between performance and parameter\nefficiency. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach:\nacross three datasets, our models achieve an average of 88% of the original\nmodel's performance while pruning more than 95% of the non-embedding\nparameters. This underscores the potential of our method to significantly\nreduce resource requirements without greatly compromising recommendation\nquality.

The eigenvalues determine the theoretical\ncritical time step for numerical stability for a forward Euler time\nintegration, which are then verified numerically across several regularization\nfunctions, elastic models, and parameter choices. New doubly periodic\nregularized Stokeslets are presented, allowing for comparison of the stability\nproperties of different regularization functions.

We start by explaining the need\nfor global completion of the field content: the fluxes, the gauge potentials\nand the gauge transformations on the worldvolume of a single M5 brane in\neleven-dimensional supergravity, and how this is encoded by the choice of flux\nquantization law.\n  \\smallskip Assuming Hypothesis H that the 4-flux in M-Theory is flux\nquantized in a non-abelian cohomology theory called 4-cohomotopy, and the\nthree-flux on the M5 brane worldvolume in (twisted) 3-cohomotopy, we generalize\nsome previous calculations known in the literature to include twisting by\nbackground gravity and placing M5 branes on orbifolds. We show that the null\nconcordances of cohomotopically charged fluxes give rise to the traditional\ngauge potentials and the null concordances of concordances give rise to the\ncorresponding gauge transformations via surjections, in the cases of\ntangentially twisted cohomotopy, twistorial cohomotopy and equivariant\ntwistorial cohomotopy. We construct the surjections explicitly for these cases\nand check the consistency relations with the corresponding Bianchi identities.\n  \\smallskip Thus, we show how the traditional formulas for the local gauge\npotentials on M5 brane worldvolume on curved spacetimes and orbifolds are\nindeed reproduced by the homotopy theory and, as such, become amenable to\nglobal completion in cohomotopical charge quantization.",

Our evaluation across eight LMMs\n(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of\ncontextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images\nalone.

    "abstract": "The progression from traditional prompt engineering to a more rigorous\ndiscipline of prompt design marks a pivotal shift in human-LLM interaction. As\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in mission-critical\napplications, there emerges a pressing need for frameworks that are not only\nexplicit and systematic but also minimal enough to remain practical and broadly\naccessible. While many existing approaches address prompt structuring through\nelaborate Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) or multi-layered templates, such\nmethods can impose significant token and cognitive overhead, potentially\nconstraining the model's creative capacity. In this context, we propose the 5C\nPrompt Contract, a framework that distills prompt design into five intuitive\ncomponents: Character, Cause, Constraint, Contingency, and Calibration. This\nminimal cognitive schema explicitly integrates fallback and output optimization\ndirectives, fostering reliable, interpretable, and creatively flexible AI\ninteractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the 5C framework\nconsistently achieves superior input token efficiency while maintaining rich\nand consistent outputs across diverse LLM architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic,\nDeepSeek, and Gemini), making it particularly suited for individuals and\nSmall-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with limited AI engineering resources.",

In IceCube, long muon tracks from\n$\\nu_\\mu$ charged-current interactions are easily identified but the detector\ngeometry does not allow sufficient resolution to distinguish cascade-type\nevents. The Neutron Echo - a delayed light signal in the detector from neutron\ncapture and de-excitation - can probe the shower's hadronic content and thus\nthe underlying interaction. A significant background arises from late PMT\nafterpulses, which are temporally coincident with the physics signal. The\ntraditional IceCube data acquisition system has a limited readout window with\nsignificant deadtime between triggers, which is insufficient to capture the\nlate pulses. A recently developed deadtime-free readout mode, with an extended\nwindow, enables their detection. An observed excess in the delayed time\nspectrum over the background would be compatible with the Neutron Echo\nhypothesis. In this contribution, we summarize the physics scope of delayed\nsignals, discuss the timing spectrum of signal and PMT background, highlight\nthe capabilities of the new system for recording late pulses, and emphasize the\npotential of IceCube for particle identification through delayed signals.",

We train two\ndistinct models, one for a five by one array of jets (83 simulations) and one\nfor a three by three array of jets (100 simulations). We introduce a method to\nextrapolate predictions to higher Reynolds numbers (Re < 10,000) using a\ncorrelation-based scaling. The surrogate models achieve high accuracy, with a\nnormalized mean average error below 2% on validation data for the five by one\nsurrogate model and 0.6% for the three by three surrogate model. Experimental\nvalidation confirms the model's predictive capabilities. This work provides a\nfoundation for model-based control strategies in advanced thermal management\napplications.",

However, CL and, more\nbroadly, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often demand a large amount of\ndata and computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on\nresource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility and\nefficiency of SSL techniques for edge-based learning, focusing on trade-offs\nbetween model performance and energy efficiency. In particular, we analyze how\ndifferent SSL techniques adapt to limited computational, data, and energy\nbudgets, evaluating their effectiveness in learning robust representations\nunder resource-constrained settings. Moreover, we also consider the energy\ncosts involved in labeling data and assess how semi-supervised learning may\nassist in reducing the overall energy consumed to train CL models. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that tailored SSL strategies can achieve\ncompetitive performance while reducing resource consumption by up to 4X,\nunderscoring their potential for energy-efficient learning at the edge.",

    "abstract": "As AI models become ubiquitous in our daily lives, there has been an\nincreasing demand for transparency in ML services. However, the model owner\ndoes not want to reveal the weights, as they are considered trade secrets. To\nsolve this problem, researchers have turned to zero-knowledge proofs of ML\nmodel inference. These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is\ncorrect, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on\nthese provers can be placed into two categories. The first method compiles the\nML model into a low-level circuit, and proves the circuit using a ZK-SNARK. The\nsecond method uses custom cryptographic protocols designed only for a specific\nclass of models. Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making\nit impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not\ngeneralize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of\nmachine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end\nproving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations\ncalled basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols. ZKTorch is built\non top of a novel parallel extension to the Mira accumulation scheme, enabling\nsuccinct proofs with minimal accumulation overhead. These contributions allow\nZKTorch to achieve at least a $3\\times$ reduction in the proof size compared to\nspecialized protocols and up to a $6\\times$ speedup in proving time over a\ngeneral-purpose ZKML framework.",

Eccentric binaries exhibit oscillatory\nfrequency evolution, causing GW frequencies to recur multiple times through\ntheir coalescence. Consequently, generating eccentric waveform templates for\nearly warning requires specification of initial conditions. While the standard\napproach involves initiating waveform generation when the orbit-averaged\nfrequency enters the detector band, we compare this with an alternative\napproach that uses the periastron frequency as the starting point. Our analysis\nshows that initializing at the periastron frequency yields an improved\nsignal-to-noise ratio and sky localization.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical and formal response to the collapse in the\nmarginal cost of ideation caused by artificial intelligence (AI). In\nchallenging the foundational assumption of knowledge scarcity, the paper argues\nthat the key economic constraint is no longer the generation of ideas, but the\nalignment of ideation with the recursive structure of human needs. Building on\nprevious work, we further develop Experiential Matrix Theory (EMT), a framework\nthat models innovation as a recursive optimisation process in which alignment,\nrather than ideation, becomes the binding constraint. Accordingly, we formalise\ncore mechanisms of EMT and apply it to the dynamics of ideation collapse and\ninstitutional realignment under AI. Using a series of defensible economic\nmodels, we show that in this post-scarcity paradigm, the creation of economic\nand social value increasingly accrues to roles that guide, interpret, and\nsocially embed ideation, rather than to those that merely generate new ideas.\nThe paper theorises a transition from a knowledge economy to an alignment\neconomy, and derives policy implications for labor hierarchies, subsidy\nstructures, and institutional design. The university, in this context, must\ninvert its function from knowledge transmission to epistemic alignment. The\npaper concludes by reframing growth not as a function of knowledge\naccumulation, but of how well society aligns its expanding cognitive capacity\nwith the frontier of experiential human value. This redefinition of the\ninnovation constraint implies a transformation of growth theory, policy design,\nand institutional purpose in the AI era.",

This\npaper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:\ndistillation path selection and knowledge drift.

This represents a situation\nwhere an agent moving on the circle is able to sense its proximity to some\nlandmarks, and the goal is to estimate the number of these landmarks and their\npossible locations -- which can in turn enable control tasks such as motion\nplanning and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, the exact values of the function at\nits discontinuities (which correspond to disk boundaries for the individual\nindicator functions) are not assumed to be known to the agent. We introduce\nsuitable notions of robustness and degrees of freedom to single out those\ndecompositions that are more desirable, or more likely, given this non-precise\ndata collected by the agent. We provide a characterization of robust\ndecompositions and give a procedure for generating all such decompositions.\nWhen the given function admits a robust decomposition, we compute the number of\npossible robust decompositions and derive bounds for the number of\ndecompositions maximizing the degrees of freedom.",

    "abstract": "Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer\ndiagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning\nhave become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI\nface challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to\nsubjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology\ncaptions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce\na novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from\nhistopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor\ngenerates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically\nclustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting\nrepresentative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph\nby connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and\napply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The\naggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space\nthrough a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large\nlanguage model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric\ndatasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for\nclassification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569\nfor captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms\nstate of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for\nmicroscopy based patient diagnosis.",

Thus, consumers neither negotiate the price nor the\ncharacteristics of the service. In recent years, providers have adopted more\ndynamic trading mechanisms, as e.g. Amazon's EC2 platform shows: In addition to\nthe reservation marketspace and the on-demand marketspace, Amazon offers a spot\nmarketspace where consumers can bid for virtual machines. This spot marketspace\nwas extended with spot blocks, and recently Amazon reworked the bidding\noptions. In addition, other cloud providers, such as Virtustream, adopt dynamic\ntrading mechanisms. The scientific community envisions autonomous multi-round\nnegotiations for realizing future cloud marketspaces. Consequently, consumers\nand providers exchange offers and counteroffers to reach an agreement. This\nhelps providers increase the utilization of their datacenters, while consumers\ncan purchase highly customized cloud services.\n  In the paper at hand, we present a survey on multi-round bilateral\nnegotiation strategies for trading cloud resources.

The dataset comprises 3D CT images and\ncorresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and\noverall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning\napproach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each\ntailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting\n3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node\nfeatures and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion\nprocess is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model\nutilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism\nimproves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more\neffective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach\ndemonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival\nprediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for\nprognostic models in this context.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nradiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to\ndifficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to\ntheir corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature\nextraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report\nGeneration (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual\nfeatures with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation\nprocess. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing\nlesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The\nvisual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored\nenhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure\nto improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching\nloss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.\nAdditionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality\nconcept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual\nmedical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.\nExperiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate\nthat MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in\nradiology report generation.",

BarkBeetle\nemploys a bottom-up recovery strategy that uses targeted fault injection at\nspecific nodes to efficiently infer feature splits and threshold values. Our\nproof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that BarkBeetle requires\nsignificantly fewer queries and recovers more structural information compared\nto prior approaches, when evaluated on DTs trained with public UCI datasets. To\nvalidate its practical feasibility, we implement BarkBeetle on a Raspberry Pi\nRP2350 board and perform fault injections using the Faultier voltage glitching\ntool. As BarkBeetle targets general DT models, we also provide an in-depth\ndiscussion on its applicability to a broader range of tree-based applications,\nincluding data stream classification, DT variants, and cryptography schemes.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a new class of BDF schemes proposed in [F. Huang and J. Shen, SIAM\nJ Numer. Anal., 62.4, 1609--1637] for the parabolic type equations are studied\nin this paper. The basic idea is based on the Taylor expansions at time\n$t^{n+\\beta}$ with $\\beta>1$ being a tunable parameter. These new BDF schemes\nallow larger time steps at higher order r for stiff problems than that which\nallowed with a usual higher-order scheme. However, multi-step methods like BDF\nexhibit inherent disadvantages relative to one-step methods in practical\nimplementations. In this paper, inspired by their excellent work, we construct\na new class of high-order one-step schemes for linear parabolic-type equations.\nThese new schemes, with several suitable $\\beta_i$, can achieve A-stable, or\neven L-stable. Specially, the new scheme with special parameters $\\beta_i$ can\nbe regarded as the classical one-step Runge-Kutta scheme with a stabilized\nterm. Besides, we provide two different techniques to construct the one-step\nhigh-order schemes: the first one is by choosing different parameters\n$\\beta_i$, and the second one is by increasing the number of intermediate\nlayers. Both methods have been proven to be highly effective and even exhibit\nsuperconvergence property. Finally, we also conducted several numerical\nexperiments to support our conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code\ngeneration, particularly when augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting\ntechniques. They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps,\nwhich act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human\nprogrammers. Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the\ncorrectness and reliability of the generated code. However, little is known\nabout the quality of CoT generated by LLMs. To what extent can we trust the\nthoughts generated by LLMs? How good are they? This paper empirically explores\nthe external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by\nanalyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation\nbenchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by\nanalyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting\nLLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such\nas unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while\ninternal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs' misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even\nwhen CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to\ninstruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with\nflawed CoTs. (3) Refining low-quality CoTs is feasible, i.e., LLMs improve when\ngiven detailed problem descriptions. These findings highlight key challenges in\nCoT-based code generation and suggest directions for improving LLM reasoning\nand reliability.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning\n(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.\nWhile multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve\ngeneralization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional\nviews suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This\napproach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple\noptimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it\nfails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits\nfundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL\nlosses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view\nmultiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations\nthrough two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to\nincorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data\npoint, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views\nwhile scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches\nare theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for\nalignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to\nmulti-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three\nother datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing\nmulti-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.\nWe also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to\nother contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most\nsignificantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views\neffectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding\nspace, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.",

These tasks are typically constrained to single-object\nscenarios, which limits their practical applications in multi-object\nrecognition tasks. Here, we propose an anti-interference diffractive deep\nneural network (AI D2NN) that can accurately and robustly recognize targets in\nmulti-object scenarios, including intra-class, inter-class, and dynamic\ninterference. By employing different deep-learning-based training strategies\nfor targets and interference, two transmissive diffractive layers form a\nphysical network that maps the spatial information of targets all-optically\ninto the power spectrum of the output light, while dispersing all interference\nas background noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in\nclassifying unknown handwritten digits under dynamic scenarios involving 40\ncategories of interference, achieving a simulated blind testing accuracy of\n87.4% using terahertz waves. The presented framework can be physically scaled\nto operate at any electromagnetic wavelength by simply scaling the diffractive\nfeatures in proportion to the wavelength range of interest.

    "abstract": "While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic\naccidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation\ncaused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,\nwhich enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to\novercoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in\nadverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of\nLiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present\na novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under\nadverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception\ncapabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due\nto the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior\nto communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose\nDenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective\nperception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates\nvoxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse\nconvolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with\ntwo-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and\ncomputational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing\nnon-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating\nrain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We\ndemonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in\nadverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while\nmaintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for\ncooperative vehicles.",

By integrating FRB data with supernovae (SNe), BAO from DESI\nDR2, and cosmic chronometers (CC), we derive constraints on the Hubble constant\n($H_0$), the deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and the jerk parameter ($j_0$).\nFor the reconstruction method, our MCMC analysis with FRB-only provides $H_0 =\n69.9 \\pm 5.8 \\, \\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, corresponding\nto a precision of $\\sim 8\\%$. A joint analysis with FRB+SNe+(BAO+BBN+CMB) gives\n$H_0 = 68.85_{-0.48}^{+0.47} \\, \\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$,\nreaching a precision below $1\\%$.

Yet, their effectiveness\nin practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional\nchanges, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.\nTherefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the\nuse of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample\npredictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA\nmethods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or\nmake unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and\ntest data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and\nuniversally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the\nflexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model\nthe test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among\ntest samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous\naccess--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages\nby introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from\nVLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each\nonline test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA\nachieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population\ndeclines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches\nare crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA\nbarcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic\ntaxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on\nindividual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in\nlarge-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample\nSegmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic\nclassifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging\ndata at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual\nspecimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two\ntasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual\narthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining\nthe taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of\nbulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of\ninsect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection\nand instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine\nlearning research.",

    "abstract": "Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,\nenabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\\deg} surround view in a\nsingle shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete\npanoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation\npipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing\nstreet view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration\ncapabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing\ndatasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In\nthis paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for\nautonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data\nwith control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on\ntwo key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the\ninherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose\nthe Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama\ngeneration as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps\nbetween different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable\ngeneration of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method\n(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling\ncontrollable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the\ngenerated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,\nno-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in\nreal-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data\nconsistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality\nmetrics and enhances downstream perception models.

In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is\nimportant to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk.\nHowever, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so\neffectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for\nthe supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy\nsupervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk\n$O(\\eta)$ below $\\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily\n$d_N\\log d_N\\gtrsim N_s \\eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$\nis the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies\nto the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled\nnoisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone\ndoes not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show\nempirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\\sigma^2$\nunder such conditions.

Methods: A progressively refined\nregistration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T\nMR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation\nconsistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR\nLinac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour\npropagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose\naccumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.\nResults: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice\nSimilarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,\nperformance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL\ndataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain\nperformance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose\naccumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95\n>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients\nachieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under\nupper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain\nMR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary\nfeasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.",

Experiments show that CheXPO\nachieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching\nstate-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a\nscalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This work presents the development and pilot implementation of a\ncomprehensive remote dosimetry audit for Ir-192 High Dose Rate interstitial\nbrachytherapy, integrating experimental and computational dosimetry procedures\ninto a unified workflow. TG43 and Model Based Dose Calculations Algorithms\n(MBDCAs) are both considered. Methods: A compact, water-equivalent phantom was\ndesigned to hold two catheters, ten Optically Stimulated Luminescent Dosimeters\n(OSLDs) and two radiochromic films, enabling point and 2D dose measurements. A\nuser-selected treatment plan was created using a clinical Treatment Planning\nSystem (TPS), tailored to the optimal dose range of the dosimeters. A\ncomputational dosimetry audit test was also performed via Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations, enabling independent 3D dose calculations for the same plan and\nphantom geometry. All dosimetry results were compared to TPS calculations (TG43\nand an MBDCA) using the Gamma Index (GI) test, dose difference maps, and\ndose-volume histogram comparisons, wherever applicable. The protocol was\ndesigned to minimize clinical workload. Results: This study was completed\nwithin ten days of phantom delivery to the clinic. If necessary, measurements\nwere corrected using appropriate correction factors determined through side\nstudies. GI passing criteria were adapted to the uncertainty of each dosimetry\nsystem. Excellent agreement was found between MBDCA and experimental or MC\nresults. Within the volume of interest, TG43 systematically overestimated dose\ncompared to MC (median difference: 2.16%), attributed to missing scatter and\nphantom material. Conclusion: Despite the labor-intensive workflow, this\nprotocol supports remote Ir-192 audits with acceptable uncertainties. Combining\nexperimental and computational methods enhances the robustness of the audit.\nThis hybrid approach shows clear advantages for rigorous dosimetry auditing\nprograms.",

    "abstract": "In 2016, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory launched its realtime program. When\na neutrino candidate of likely astrophysical origin is detected, a public alert\nis issued, typically within one minute. These alerts allow the astrophysical\ncommunity to follow up on the region of the sky where the neutrino likely\noriginated. Initially, the system issued around six track-signature alerts per\nyear, with a highlight being IceCube-170922A, which was later associated with\nthe flaring blazar TXS 0506+056. Since 2019, IceCube has expanded the selection\ncriteria for neutrino candidates, increasing the track alert rate to around 30\nper year with additional alerts for cascade signatures of probable\nastrophysical origin implemented in 2020. This work describes several\nimprovements in the reconstruction of track alerts, which were introduced into\nthe realtime stream in 2024, and details the two algorithms that are\nalternately used for reconstruction, depending on the reconstructed muon\nenergy. The improvements result in more precise directional localizations, with\na factor of 5 (4) reduction in the 50% (90%) contour area. Systematic errors\naffecting the reconstructions, such as the ice model or the geometry of the\ndetector, have also been investigated to ensure statistical coverage. In\naddition to its application in the realtime stream, the improvements described\nhere are also being applied to historical alerts with an updated catalog of\ntrack alerts forthcoming.",

Unlike many existing works that assume a\nparticular probability distribution model for fading channels (which is\ntypically Gaussian), our approach merely relies on the first and second moments\nof fading channels. For the stochastic precoding problem, a naive idea is to\ndirectly apply the fractional programming (FP) method to the data rate inside\nthe expectation; it does not work well because the auxiliary variables\nintroduced by FP are then difficult to decide. To address the above issue, we\npropose using a lower bound to approximate the expectation of data rate. This\nlower bound stems from a nontrivial use of the matrix FP, and outperforms the\nexisting lower bounds in that it accounts for generalized fading channels whose\nfirst and second moments are known. The resulting approximate problem can be\nefficiently solved in closed form in an iterative fashion. Furthermore, for\nlarge-scale MIMO, we improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by\neliminating the large matrix inverse.

We do this by showing that the substack of\nsingular curves has positive codimension in the moduli stack of finite flat\ncovers with desired pushforward. To compute the dimension of the space of\nsingular curves, we prove a (relative) ``minimization theorem'', which is the\ngeometric analogue of Bhargava's sieving argument when computing the densities\nof discriminants of quintic number fields.",

It excels in experimental characterization in the low data\nregime, and when the measurements have degrees of freedom. A decisive factor\nfor its performance is the numerical representation of the Bayesian probability\ndistributions. In this work, we explore advanced statistical methods for this\npurpose, and numerically analyze their performance against the state-of-the-art\nin quantum parameter learning. In particular, we consider sequential importance\nresampling, tempered likelihood estimation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, random\nwalk Metropolis (RWM), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variants (stochastic\ngradients with and without friction, energy conserving subsampling), block\npseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings with subsampling, hybrid HMC-RWM\napproaches, and Gaussian rejection filtering. We demonstrate advantages of\nthese approaches over existing ones, namely robustness under multi-modality and\nhigh dimensionality. We apply these algorithms to the calibration of\nsuperconducting qubits from IBMQ, surpassing the standard quantum limit and\nachieving better results than Qiskit's default tools. In Hahn echo and Ramsey\nexperiments, we reduce the uncertainty by factors of 10 and 3 respectively,\nwithout increasing the number of measurements; conversely, we match the\nperformance of Qiskit's methods while using up to to 99.5% less experimental\ndata.

    "abstract": "Probabilistic programming has become a standard practice to model stochastic\nevents and learn about the behavior of nature in different scientific contexts,\nranging from Genetics and Ecology to Linguistics and Psychology. However,\ndomain practitioners (such as biologists) also need to be experts in statistics\nin order to select which probabilistic model is suitable for a given particular\nproblem, relying then on probabilistic inference engines such as Stan, Pyro or\nEdward to fine-tune the parameters of that particular model. Probabilistic\nProgramming would be more useful if the model selection is made automatic,\nwithout requiring statistics expertise from the end user. Automatically\nselecting the model is challenging because of the large search space of\nprobabilistic programs needed to be explored, because the fact that most of\nthat search space contains invalid programs, and because invalid programs may\nonly be detected in some executions, due to its probabilistic nature. We\npropose a type system to statically reject invalid probabilistic programs, a\ntype-directed synthesis algorithm that guarantees that generated programs are\ntype-safe by construction, and an heuristic search procedure to handle the vast\nsearch space. We collect a number of probabilistic programs from the\nliterature, and use them to compare our method with both a type-agnostic random\nsearch, and a data-guided method from the literature (DaPPer). Our results show\nthat our technique both outperforms random search and DaPPer, specially on more\ncomplex programs. This drastic performance difference in synthesis allows for\nfast sampling of programs and enables techniques that previously suffered from\nthe complexity of synthesis, such as Genetic Programming, to be applied.",

Existing datasets only contain non-critical RFOs,\nlike necklace or zipper, further limiting their utility for developing\nclinically impactful detection algorithms. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce \"Hopkins RFOs Bench\", the first and largest dataset of its kind,\ncontaining 144 chest X-ray images of critical RFO cases collected over 18 years\nfrom the Johns Hopkins Health System. Using this dataset, we benchmark several\nstate-of-the-art object detection models, highlighting the need for enhanced\ndetection methodologies for critical RFO cases. Recognizing data scarcity\nchallenges, we further explore image synthetic methods to bridge this gap.

In this paper, we introduce an adaptive\npart discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent\nobject parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a\nset of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring\nany additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min\ncontrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,\nwhich adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar\ncategories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other\nparts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can\neasily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS\ntoken feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements\non fine-grained datasets.",

In this model,\noriginal results [Goldreich-Ron, RSA 2008; Eden-Ron-Seshadhri, SIDMA 2019] on\nthis problem prove that the complexity of getting\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-multiplicative approximations to the average degree, ignoring\n$\\varepsilon$-dependencies, is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$.

Our algorithm makes $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ queries exploiting\nthe power of pair queries. We also analyze the ``full neighborhood access\"\nmodel wherein the entire adjacency list of a vertex can be obtained with a\nsingle query; this model is relevant in many practical applications.

Charmed baryon decays decaying into an octet baryon and a\npseudoscalar meson have been studied in the framework of rescattering dynamics\nat the hadron level and topological amplitudes at the quark level. In this\nwork, we investigate the relation between topological amplitudes and\nrescattering dynamics in the $ B_{c\\overline{3}}\\to B_8P$ decays. Note that the\nchiral Lagrangian is constructed using (1,1)-rank octet tensors. The (1,1)-rank\namplitudes, which are linear combinations of topological diagrams, are used to\nmatch the chiral Lagrangian. Possible meson-meson or meson-baryon coupling\nconfigurations are constructed from the (1,1)-rank amplitudes via tensor\ncontractions. The rescattering amplitudes derived from topological amplitudes\nare consistent with those derived directly from the chiral Lagrangian. Isospin\nsum rules for all isospin systems in $ B_{c\\overline{3}}\\to B_8P$ decays are\nchecked in terms of $s$- and $t$-channel rescattering amplitudes. Rescattering\namplitudes contributing to quark-loop diagrams are found to be comparable to\nthose contributing to tree diagrams, indicating potential observable $CP$\nviolation in charmed baryon decays.

The measured observables, the initial state of the physical system and\neven the Hilbert space are unknown; we nonetheless assume a promise on the\nenergy distribution of the state. Investigating to what extent extrapolation is\npossible in this framework, we discover highly problematic datasets that allow\nfull predictability at any future time $\\tau$, but only when past averages are\nknown up to precision superexponential in $\\tau$. We also find families of\n\"self-testing datasets\", which allow practical predictability under reasonable\nnoise levels and whose approximate realization singles out specific\nHamiltonians, states and measurement operators. We identify \"aha! datasets\",\nwhich drastically increase the predictability of the future statistics of an\nunrelated measurement, as well as \"fog banks\": fairly simple datasets that\nexhibit complete unpredictability at some future time $\\tau$, but full\npredictability for a later time $\\tau'>\\tau$.

To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged\nO-RAN and AI-RAN architecture that unifies orchestration and management of both\ntelecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed\narchitecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and\ncloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments.

The\nproposed system supports flexible deployment options, allowing AI workloads to\nbe orchestrated with specific timing requirements (real-time or batch\nprocessing) and geographic targeting.

We achieve\nthis unified control through key technologies: sequence skill acquisition for\nprogressive learning complexity, residual action modeling for fine-grained\ncontrol adjustments, command polynomial interpolation for smooth motion\ntransitions, random delay release for robustness to deploy variations, load\nrandomization for generalization to external disturbances, and\ncenter-of-gravity tracking for providing explicit policy gradients to maintain\nstability.

However, their close integration with personal devices\nraises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor\nattacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose\nVisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to\nlocate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.\nVisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and\ndoes so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical\nfeasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can\neffectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and\nhighly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack\ncan be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,\nthe injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,\ne.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.\nThese findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor\nattack risks in GUI agents.",

SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no\nfinetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via\nmultifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses\ndue to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of\nself-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.",

We construct an auxiliary hypergraph to facilitate\nefficient partitioning and introduce a framework for local motif-based\nclustering. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework and provide a comparative analysis of the two\nproposed clustering strategies in terms of clustering quality and computational\nefficiency.",

    "abstract": "Cyber-attacks jeopardize the safe operation of smart microgrids. At the same\ntime, existing diagnostic methods either depend on expensive multi-point\ninstrumentation or stringent modelling assumptions that are untenable under\nsingle-sensor constraints. This paper proposes a Fractional-Order\nMemory-Enhanced Attack-Diagnosis Scheme (FO-MADS) that achieves low-latency\nfault localisation and cyber-attack detection using only one VPQ\n(Voltage-Power-Reactive-power) sensor. FO-MADS first constructs a dual\nfractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and\nGr\\\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and\nslow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then\npinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch,\neffectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened\nthrough Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose\nattack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining\n(OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a\nfour-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under\nfour attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0\n% (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining\n96.7 % under attack-free conditions.

    "abstract": "Manifold optimization (MO) is a powerful mathematical framework that can be\napplied to solving complex optimization problems with objective functions (OFs)\nand constraints on complex geometric structures, which is particularly useful\nin advanced power systems. We explore the application of MO techniques, which\noffer a robust framework for solving complex, non-convex optimization problems\nin electrical power distribution systems (EPDS) and electrical power\ntransmission systems (EPTS), particularly for power flow analysis. This paper\nintroduces the principles of MO and demonstrates its advantages over\nconventional methods by applying it to power flow optimization. For EPDS, a\ncost function derived from a backward-forward sweep (BFS) algorithm is\noptimized using the Manopt toolbox, yielding high accuracy and competitive\ncomputational times on 14-bus, 33-bus, and 69-bus systems when compared to\nestablished solvers. Similarly, for EPTS, MO applied via Manopt to 3-bus and\n4-bus systems effectively solves power flow equations, matching traditional\nmethods such as Newton-Raphson in performance. The study highlights that tools\nsuch as Manopt can mitigate implementation complexities, positioning MO as an\nefficient and accessible tool for power system analysis and potentially broader\nplanning applications. The paper provides a comprehensive tutorial on MO,\ndetailing its theoretical foundations, practical methodologies, and specific\napplications in power systems, particularly in power flow optimization.",

Specifically, we employ a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer after the photon pairs are generated from two\nnonlinear crystals.

    "abstract": "Multi-domain recommendation leverages domain-general knowledge to improve\nrecommendations across several domains. However, as platforms expand to dozens\nor hundreds of scenarios, training all domains in a unified model leads to\nperformance degradation due to significant inter-domain differences. Existing\ndomain grouping methods, based on business logic or data similarities, often\nfail to capture the true transfer relationships required for optimal grouping.\nTo effectively cluster domains, we propose Causal Domain Clustering (CDC). CDC\nmodels domain transfer patterns within a large number of domains using two\ndistinct effects: the Isolated Domain Affinity Matrix for modeling\nnon-interactive domain transfers, and the Hybrid Domain Affinity Matrix for\nconsidering dynamic domain synergy or interference under joint training. To\nintegrate these two transfer effects, we introduce causal discovery to\ncalculate a cohesion-based coefficient that adaptively balances their\ncontributions. A Co-Optimized Dynamic Clustering algorithm iteratively\noptimizes target domain clustering and source domain selection for training.\nCDC significantly enhances performance across over 50 domains on public\ndatasets and in industrial settings, achieving a 4.9% increase in online eCPM.\nCode is available at\nhttps://github.com/Chrissie-Law/Causal-Domain-Clustering-for-Multi-Domain-Recommendation",

Social media provide a window into the sensemaking around these events,\nsurfacing hopes and fears and showing who chooses to engage in the discourse\nand when. We demonstrate that public sensemaking about AI is shaped by economic\ninterests and cultural values of those involved. We analyze 3.8 million tweets\nposted by 1.6 million users across 117 countries in response to the public\nlaunch of ChatGPT in 2022. Our analysis shows how economic self-interest,\nproxied by occupational skill types in writing, programming, and mathematics,\nand national cultural orientations, as measured by Hofstede's individualism,\nuncertainty avoidance, and power distance dimensions, shape who speaks, when\nthey speak, and their stance towards ChatGPT. Roles requiring more technical\nskills, such as programming and mathematics, tend to engage earlier and express\nmore positive stances, whereas writing-centric occupations join later with\ngreater skepticism. At the cultural level, individualism predicts both earlier\nengagement and a more negative stance, and uncertainty avoidance reduces the\nprevalence of positive stances but does not delay when users first engage with\nChatGPT. Aggregate sentiment trends mask the dynamics observed in our study.\nThe shift toward a more critical stance towards ChatGPT over time stems\nprimarily from the entry of more skeptical voices rather than a change of heart\namong early adopters.

    "abstract": "Recently it has been shown that the third law of black hole mechanics can be\nviolated: an exactly extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole can form in finite\ntime in gravitational collapse of matter with a large charge to mass ratio.\nHowever, it has also been proved that this cannot happen if the matter\nsatisfies a ``supersymmetric'' lower bound on its energy in terms of its\ncharge. This paper proves an analogous result for black holes with a negative\ncosmological constant. The result states that a supersymmetric Kerr-Newman-anti\nde Sitter black hole cannot form in gravitational collapse of charged matter\nsatisfying the supersymmetric bound. The results for zero or negative\ncosmological constant are extended to apply to two-sided black holes: it is\nproved that an initially non-extremal black hole cannot evolve to a\nsupersymmetric black hole in finite time, irrespective of whether or not the\ninitial black hole was formed in gravitational collapse.",

In order for prediction sets to be\nuseful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional\ncoverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the\nprediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify\ncandidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when\napplied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice\nbetween small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good\nclass-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods\nwith guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and\nclass-conditional coverage. First, we propose a conformal score function,\nprevalence-adjusted softmax, that targets a relaxed notion of class-conditional\ncoverage called macro-coverage. Second, we propose a label-weighted conformal\nprediction method that allows us to interpolate between marginal and\nclass-conditional conformal prediction. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet\nand iNaturalist, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes,\nrespectively.",

Our goal is to\nextract a catalog of voids from constrained simulations of the large-scale\nstructure that are consistent with the observed galaxy positions, effectively\nrepresenting statistically independent realizations of the probability\ndistribution of the cosmic web. This allows us to carry out a full Bayesian\nanalysis of the structures emerging in the Universe. We use 50 posterior\nrealizations of the large-scale structure in the Manticore-Local suite,\nobtained from the 2M++ galaxies. Running the VIDE void finder on each\nrealization, we extract 50 independent void catalogs. We perform a posterior\nclustering analysis to identify high-significance voids at the 5$\\sigma$ level,\nand we assess the probability distribution of their properties. We produce a\ncatalog of 100 voids with high statistical significance, available at\nhttps://voids.cosmictwin.org/, including the probability distributions of the\ncenters and radii of the voids. We characterize the morphology of these\nregions, effectively producing a template for density environments that can be\nused in astrophysical applications such as galaxy evolution studies. While\nproviding the community with a detailed catalog of voids in the nearby\nUniverse, this work also constitutes an approach to identifying cosmic voids\nfrom galaxy surveys that allows us to account rigorously for the observational\nsystematics intrinsic to direct detection, and provide a Bayesian\ncharacterization of their properties.",

We present new observational constraints\nbased on a sample of around 18,000 stars in the inner Galaxy, combining Gaia\nDR3 RVS and APOGEE DR17 spectroscopy. Gaia-RVS complements APOGEE by improving\nsampling of the metallicity, [Fe/H] in the -2.0 to -0.5 dex range. This work\nmarks the first application of Gaia-RVS spectroscopy to the bulge region,\nenabled by a novel machine learning approach (hybrid-CNN) that derives stellar\nparameters from intermediate-resolution spectra with precision comparable to\nAPOGEE's infrared data. We performed full orbit integrations using a barred\nGalactic potential and applied orbital frequency analysis to disentangle the\nstellar populations in the inner Milky Way. For the first time, traced by the\nfield stars, we are able to robustly identify the long-sought pressure\nsupported bulge. We show this stellar population to be chemically and\nkinematically distinct from the other main components co-existing in the same\nregion. The spheroidal bulge has a metallicity distribution function (MDF) peak\nat around -0.70 dex extending to solar value, is dominated by a high-[alpha/Fe]\npopulation with almost no dependency on metallicity, consistent with very rapid\nearly formation, predating the thick disc and the bar. We find evidence that\nthe bar has influenced the dynamics of the spheroidal bulge, introducing a mild\ntriaxiality and radial extension. We identify a group of stars on X4 orbits,\nlikely native to the early spheroid, as this population mimics the chemistry of\nthe spheroidal bulge, with a minor contamination from the more metal-poor\n([Fe/H] < -1.0) halo.

    "abstract": "A strategy to construct physics-based local surrogate models for parametric\nStokes flows and coupled Stokes-Darcy systems is presented. The methodology\nrelies on the proper generalized decomposition (PGD) method to reduce the\ndimensionality of the parametric flow fields and on an overlapping domain\ndecomposition (DD) paradigm to reduce the number of globally coupled degrees of\nfreedom in space. The DD-PGD approach provides a non-intrusive framework in\nwhich end-users only need access to the matrices arising from the (finite\nelement) discretization of the full-order problems in the subdomains. The\ntraces of the finite element functions used for the discretization within the\nsubdomains are employed to impose arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions at\nthe interface, without introducing auxiliary basis functions. The methodology\nis seamless to the choice of the discretization schemes in space, being\ncompatible with both LBB-compliant finite element pairs and stabilized\nformulations, and the DD-PGD paradigm is transparent to the employed\noverlapping DD approach. The local surrogate models are glued together in the\nonline phase by solving a parametric interface system to impose continuity of\nthe subdomain solutions at the interfaces, without introducing Lagrange\nmultipliers to enforce the continuity in the entire overlap and without solving\nany additional physical problem in the reduced space. Numerical results are\npresented for parametric single-physics (Stokes-Stokes) and multi-physics\n(Stokes-Darcy) systems, showcasing the accuracy, robustness, and computational\nefficiency of DD-PGD, and its capability to outperform DD methods based on\nhigh-fidelity finite element solvers in terms of computing times.",

In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack\nframework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on\nperceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.\nSpecifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by\nleveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the\nsusceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human\nvisual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a\ngradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible\nperturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and\nmodel architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive\nattack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch\ninvisibility compared to existing baselines.

    "abstract": "Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a foundational problem in\nchemistry, with profound implications for compound identification, synthesis,\nand drug development. Traditional methods rely heavily on expert interpretation\nand lack scalability. Pioneering machine learning methods have introduced\nretrieval-based strategies, but their reliance on finite libraries limits\ngeneralization to novel molecules. Generative models offer a promising\nalternative, yet most adopt autoregressive SMILES-based architectures that\noverlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In\nthis work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers\nboth 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using\ndiffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional\ngeneration process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion\nMolecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates\ntopological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,\na transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral\ndependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact\nstructures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through\nsampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,\nSpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. These results highlight\nthe effectiveness of spectrum-conditioned diffusion modeling in addressing the\nchallenge of molecular structure elucidation. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is\nthe first framework to unify multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D\ngenerative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.",

While\nSCC-recursive semantics such as \\cft and \\stgt have proven effective for finite\nAFs, Baumann and Spanring showed the failure of SCC-recursive semantics to\ngeneralize reliably to infinite AFs due to issues with well-foundedness.\n  We propose two approaches to extending SCC-recursiveness to the infinite\nsetting.

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the\nsecurity of LLMs used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents,\nhighlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving\ncomplete computer takeover. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust\nboundaries - Direct Prompt Injection, RAG Backdoor, and Inter Agent Trust - can\nbe leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can\neffectively coerce popular LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-4 and Gemini-2.5) into\nautonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines.

Notably, we tested trust boundaries\nwithin multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other,\nand we revealed a critical security flaw: LLMs which successfully resist direct\ninjection or RAG backdoor will execute identical payloads when requested by\npeer agents. Our findings show that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised\nthrough Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks and that every model exhibits\ncontext-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots.

Notably, incorporating GW data helps not only avoid biases\ninduced by the $H_0$ tension, but also mitigate those from the parameters of\ndiffuse baryon fraction and DM distribution models. Although the current\nprecision ($\\sim 13\\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of\nboth FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift\ncosmology.",

Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to\nsubstantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot\nbe directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,\nUS speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body\nmicrostructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that\nobtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by\npioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also\ncannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm\nfor speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is\nthat applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces\ntissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,\nwhile preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective\nspeckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and\nisolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,\nSpeckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based\ndenoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic\nsimulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from\nmultiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and\nadaptability to images from unseen domains.

Findings\nfrom this study revealed a higher dependency, 92.1%, on using personal vehicles\nwhen making trips in rural areas. Multinomial logistic regression results\nshowed that socio-demographics, household, and trip characteristics affect the\nmode of transport used in a trip. Older adults, females, and individuals with\nhigher education levels than high school graduates are less likely to use\npublic transit when making trips. For household characteristics, the\navailability of vehicles in a household and households with higher income\nlevels have lower probabilities of making a trip using public transit. Longer\ntrip distances reduce the likelihood of a trip using active commuting modes\nsuch as walking and biking. These findings provide insights into understanding\nthe transportation behaviors in rural areas and provide knowledge to be used in\nthe planning and developing transportation projects that promote equitable and\naccessible transportation in rural areas",

PINNs have\ndemonstrated promising performance in sound field interpolation by combining\nthe powerful modeling capability of neural networks and the physical principles\nof sound propagation. In room acoustics, PINNs have typically been trained to\nrepresent the sound pressure measured by omnidirectional microphones where the\nwave equation or its frequency-domain counterpart, i.e., the Helmholtz\nequation, is leveraged. Meanwhile, FOA RIRs additionally provide spatial\ncharacteristics and are useful for immersive audio generation with a wide range\nof applications. In this paper, we extend the PINN framework to model FOA RIRs.\nWe derive two physics-informed priors for FOA RIRs based on the correspondence\nbetween the particle velocity and the (X, Y, Z)-channels of FOA. These priors\nassociate the predicted W-channel and other channels through their partial\nderivatives and impose the physically feasible relationship on the four\nchannels. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method\ncompared with a neural network without the physics-informed prior.",

Since\ndifferent discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with\nsingle-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that\nidentifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.\nHowever, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among\nmultiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic\nemotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal\nemotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring\nthe heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data\nand label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt\ncross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data. Then, an optimal\ntransport (OT)-based heterogeneity mining module is devised to mine the\ninteraction and heterogeneity between the physiological and behavioral\nrepresentations. To facilitate label correlation learning, we introduce a\nlearnable label embedding optimized by correlation matrix alignment. Finally,\nthe learnable label embeddings and label correlation matrices are integrated\nwith the multi-modal representations through a novel label correlation-driven\ncross-attention mechanism for accurate emotion distribution learning.\nExperimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method in emotion distribution learning.",

The HV color map enforces small distances\nfor the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable\nintensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+\n(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and\nmitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+\nleverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light\nimages using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel\nPrior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can\npromote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color\ncorrection, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the\nmeticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we\nconstruct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for\ninformation-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,\nensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.",

    "abstract": "Chaotic dynamical systems are often characterised by a positive Lyapunov\nexponent, which signifies an exponential rate of separation of nearby\ntrajectories. However, in a wide range of so-called weakly chaotic systems, the\nseparation of nearby trajectories is sub-exponential in time, and the Lyapunov\nexponent vanishes. When a hole is introduced in chaotic systems, the positive\nLyapunov exponents on the system's fractal repeller can be related to the\ngeneration of metric entropy and the escape rate from the system. The escape\nrate, in turn, cross-links these two chaos properties to important\nstatistical-physical quantities like the diffusion coefficient. However, no\nsuitable generalisation of this escape rate formalism exists for weakly chaotic\nsystems. In our paper we show that in a paradigmatic one-dimensional weakly\nchaotic iterated map, the Pomeau-Manneville map, a generalisation of its\nLyapunov exponent (which we call `stretching') is completely suppressed in the\npresence of a hole. This result is based on numerical evidence and a\ncorresponding stochastic model. The correspondence between map and model is\ntested via a related partially absorbing map. We examine the structure of the\nmap's fractal repeller, which we reconstruct via a simple algorithm. Our\nfindings are in line with rigorous mathematical results concerning the collapse\nof the system's density as it evolves in time. We also examine the generation\nof entropy in the open map, which is shown to be consistent with the collapsed\nstretching. As a result, we conclude that no suitable generalisation of the\nescape rate formalism to weakly chaotic systems can exist.",

Motivated by these advantages, this work aims to\nminimize the power consumption of a PB equipped with a passive intelligent\ntransmitting surface (ITS) and a collocated digital beamforming-based feeder to\ncharge multiple single-antenna devices. To model the PB's power consumption\naccurately, we consider power amplifiers nonlinearities, ITS control power, and\nfeeder-to-ITS air interface losses. The resulting optimization problem is\nhighly nonlinear and nonconvex due to the high-power amplifier (HPA), the\nreceived power constraints at the devices, and the unit-modulus constraint\nimposed by the phase shifter configuration of the ITS. To tackle this issue, we\napply successive convex approximation (SCA) to iteratively solve convex\nsubproblems that jointly optimize the digital precoder and phase configuration.\nGiven SCA's sensitivity to initialization, we propose an algorithm that ensures\ninitialization feasibility while balancing convergence speed and solution\nquality.

    "abstract": "Dialectical systems are a mathematical formalism for modeling an agent\nupdating a knowledge base seeking consistency. Introduced in the 1970s by\nRoberto Magari, they were originally conceived to capture how a working\nmathematician or a research community refines beliefs in the pursuit of truth.\nDialectical systems also serve as natural models for the belief change of an\nautomated agent, offering a unifying, computable framework for dynamic belief\nmanagement.\n  The literature distinguishes three main models of dialectical systems:\n(d-)dialectical systems based on revising beliefs when they are seen to be\ninconsistent, p-dialectical systems based on revising beliefs based on finding\na counterexample, and q-dialectical systems which can do both. We answer an\nopen problem in the literature by proving that q-dialectical systems are\nstrictly more powerful than p-dialectical systems, which are themselves known\nto be strictly stronger than (d-)dialectical systems. This result highlights\nthe complementary roles of counterexample and contradiction in automated belief\nrevision, and thus also in the reasoning processes of mathematicians and\nresearch communities.",

This study\ninvestigates the extent to which boundary-sensitive embeddings from HubertSoft,\na soft-clustering variant of HuBERT, encode phoneme transitions. Using the\nCORPRES Russian speech corpus, we labelled 20 ms embedding windows with\ntriplets of phonemes corresponding to their start, centre, and end segments. A\nneural network was trained to predict these positions separately, and multiple\nevaluation metrics, such as ordered, unordered accuracy and a flexible centre\naccuracy, were used to assess temporal sensitivity. Results show that\nembeddings extracted at phoneme boundaries capture both phoneme identity and\ntemporal order, with especially high accuracy at segment boundaries.

The ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range\nmeasured in galaxies at similar redshifts. The high values derived for the\nH$\\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW) and the distinct locations of the E and W\ngalaxies in the $\\log(\\zeta_\\mathrm{ion}$) $-$ EW (H$\\alpha$) plane, indicate\nthat the system is dominated by a young (less than 10 Myr) stellar population.\nThe overall spectral energy distribution suggests that in addition to a young\nstellar population, the two galaxies may have mature stellar population and\nvery different dust attenuation. The derived SFR and stellar masses identify\nthe two galaxies as going through a starburst phase. The kinematics of the\nionized gas traced by the H$\\alpha$ line show a velocity difference of 175\n$\\pm$ 28 km s$^{-1}$ between the two components of B14-65666.

To overcome this limitation,\nmodels based on the Gaussian copula framework have been introduced.

In this work, we\ntherefore extended the study of yellow emitters to cryogenic temperatures.\nInitially, multiple spectral features were observed, prompting a systematic\ninvestigation that led to the identification of a defect emission centered\naround 547.5 nm with high brightness and excellent photostability. By tuning\nthe excitation wavelength, we are able to distinguish Raman scattering peaks\nfrom the emitter emission. Further analysis of the vibronic emissions allowed\nus to identify an optical phonon mode, whose contribution becomes increasingly\ndominant at elevated temperatures. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy\n(PLE) reveals excitation through this phonon mode enhances the emission by\nalmost 5-fold in cryogenic temperature. Temperature-dependent studies further\nelucidate the role of phonons in the emission process.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of digital information and knowledge across structured\nand unstructured sources has heightened the importance of Information Retrieval\n(IR). While dense retrieval methods have substantially improved semantic\nmatching for general queries, they consistently underperform on queries with\nexplicit temporal constraints--often those containing numerical expressions and\ntime specifiers such as ``in 2015.'' Existing approaches to Temporal\nInformation Retrieval (TIR) improve temporal reasoning but often suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced performance on non-temporal\nqueries. To address this, we propose Time-Specifier Model Merging (TSM), a\nnovel method that enhances temporal retrieval while preserving accuracy on\nnon-temporal queries. TSM trains specialized retrievers for individual time\nspecifiers and merges them in to a unified model, enabling precise handling of\ntemporal constraints without compromising non-temporal retrieval. Extensive\nexperiments on both temporal and non-temporal datasets demonstrate that TSM\nsignificantly improves performance on temporally constrained queries while\nmaintaining strong results on non-temporal queries, consistently outperforming\nother baseline methods.

Third, DL models typically require large amounts of training data,\nwhich are often scarce in BCI applications. To address these challenges and\nenable real-time, cross-subject decoding without subject-specific calibration,\nwe introduce realtime adaptive pooling (RAP), a novel parameter-free method.\nRAP seamlessly modifies the pooling layers of existing offline DL models to\nmeet online decoding requirements.

Recently, several studies\nhighlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the\ngeneralization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a\nseries of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the\ngeneralization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from\ntopological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds\nrely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in\nspecific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),\npotentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we\nseek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization\nbounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce\na novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies\nvia proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing\nnotion of \\textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \\textit{trajectory stability},\nwe prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be\nupper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the\ntrajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory\nstability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental\nevaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great\nimportance, especially as the number of training samples grows.

More precisely, the presence of\nessentially generic partial directional derivatives in the regularization terms\nsuffices to produce the same scaling behaviour as in the isotropic setting. The\nonly sensitive directional dependences are directly linked to the lamination\ndirections of the well structure -- and even for these only the ``inner-most''\nlamination direction is of significance in determining the scaling law.

The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which\nincorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with\napproximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9\nMB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for\nefficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable\ntraining, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was\nevaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as\naxial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical\nimaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different\ndata to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The\nresults show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the\nchallenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of\n92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of\nstudy method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,\nFOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing\na more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized\nenvironments.

We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on\nCRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using\nfew-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought\nreasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning\non one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the\ngeneralizability of learned planning capabilities.",

While SMAT is effective\nat detecting conflicts, it suffers from a high rate of false negatives, partly\ndue to the limitations of unit test generation tools such as Randoop and\nEvosuite.

This\nmakes it unclear which approach is best suited for a given problem. Accurately\npredicting behaviour of quantum-classical algorithms opens possibilities for\nsoftware abstraction layers, which can automate decision-making for algorithm\nselection and parametrisation. While such techniques find frequent use in\nclassical high-performance computing, they are still mostly absent from quantum\ntoolchains. We present a methodology to perform algorithm selection based on\ndesirable non-functional requirements. This simplifies decision-making\nprocesses for users. Based on annotations at the source code level, our\nframework traces key characteristics of quantum-classical algorithms, and uses\nthis information to predict the most suitable approach and its parameters for\ngiven computational challenges and their non-functional requirements. As\ncombinatorial optimisation is a very extensively studied aspect of\nquantum-classical systems, we perform a comprehensive case study based on\nnumerical simulations of algorithmic approaches to implement and validate our\nideas. We develop statistical models to quantify the influence of various\nfactors on non-functional properties, and establish predictions for optimal\nalgorithmic choices without manual effort.

Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium\nlead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, we show that convergence is in practice\nachievable only when the update strengths for both the object and probe are\nrelatively small compared to what is found in literature. Additionally we\ndemonstrate that under low electron doses, the reconstructions initial error\nincreases when the update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain\nthreshold emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which the\nalgorithms are trapped in local minima. These findings highlight the need for\ncarefully optimized reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography,\nespecially when working with low electron doses, ensuring both effective\nconvergence and correctness of the result.",

Traditional numerical methods, including finite\ndifference, finite element, and spectral techniques, often become\ncomputationally prohibitive when dealing with high-dimensional problems or\nsystems with multiple scales. Neural operators (NOs), a class of deep learning\nmodels, have emerged as a promising alternative by learning mappings between\nfunction spaces and efficiently approximating solution operators. In this work,\nwe introduce the Multi-Head Neural Operator (MHNO), an extended neural operator\nframework specifically designed to address the temporal challenges associated\nwith solving time-dependent PDEs. Unlike existing neural operators, which\neither struggle with error accumulation or require substantial computational\nresources for high-dimensional tensor representations, MHNO employs a novel\narchitecture with time-step-specific projection operators and explicit temporal\nconnections inspired by message-passing mechanisms. This design allows MHNO to\npredict all time steps after a single forward pass, while effectively capturing\nlong-term dependencies and avoiding parameter overgrowth. We apply MHNO to\nsolve various phase field equations, including antiphase boundary motion,\nspinodal decomposition, pattern formation, atomic scale modeling, and molecular\nbeam epitaxy growth model, and compare its performance with existing NO-based\nmethods. Our results show that MHNO achieves superior accuracy, scalability,\nand efficiency, demonstrating its potential as a next-generation computational\ntool for phase field modeling.

    "abstract": "Ethical hacking today relies on highly skilled practitioners executing\ncomplex sequences of commands, which is inherently time-consuming, difficult to\nscale, and prone to human error. To help mitigate these limitations, we\npreviously introduced 'PenTest++', an AI-augmented system combining automation\nwith generative AI supporting ethical hacking workflows. However, a key\nlimitation of PenTest++ was its lack of support for privilege escalation, a\ncrucial element of ethical hacking. In this paper we present 'PenTest2.0', a\nsubstantial evolution of PenTest++ supporting automated privilege escalation\ndriven entirely by Large Language Model reasoning. It also incorporates several\nsignificant enhancements: 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation', including both\none-line and offline modes; 'Chain-of-Thought' prompting for intermediate\nreasoning; persistent 'PenTest Task Trees' to track goal progression across\nturns; and the optional integration of human-authored hints. We describe how it\noperates, present a proof-of-concept prototype, and discuss its benefits and\nlimitations. We also describe application of the system to a controlled Linux\ntarget, showing it can carry out multi-turn, adaptive privilege escalation. We\nexplain the rationale behind its core design choices, and provide comprehensive\ntesting results and cost analysis. Our findings indicate that 'PenTest2.0'\nrepresents a meaningful step toward practical, scalable, AI-automated\npenetration testing, whilst highlighting the shortcomings of generative AI\nsystems, particularly their sensitivity to prompt structure, execution context,\nand semantic drift, reinforcing the need for further research and refinement in\nthis emerging space.\n  Keywords: AI, Ethical Hacking, Privilege Escalation, GenAI, ChatGPT, LLM\n(Large Language Model), HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)",

    "abstract": "Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major\nbottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via\ncaching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such\nfixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while\nmanually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To\naddress this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that\nautomatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated\ndirectly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,\nPCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional\ncaching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a\nkey limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to\nan oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance\nthe contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's\npredictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To\nfurther reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with\nDynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for\nmore flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,\n2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across\na range of scenes.",

Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL\nprovides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process\nmodeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose\nDIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed\nfor such fine-grained dynamics.

While global spatial modeling mechanisms show\npromising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial\ndomain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of\nground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features\neffectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven\nFrequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a\ndual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)\nextracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby\nproviding complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module\n(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through\nfrequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)\nenhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures\nthrough bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an\nauxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's\nsensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of\nadaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively\nconstrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details\nand global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.\nExtensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which\neffectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and\nsalient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the\nhigh-level vision task.",

Therefore, they reverse engineer a benign binary and inject\nmalicious code into it. This obfuscation technique circumvents the malware\ndetection models and deceives the ML classifiers due to the prevalence of\nbenign features compared to malicious features. However, extracting the\nfeatures from the potential malicious regions enhances the accuracy and\ndecreases false positives. Hence, we propose a novel model named\nPotentRegion4MalDetect that extracts features from the potential malicious\nregions. PotentRegion4MalDetect determines the nodes with potential\nmaliciousness in the partially preprocessed Control Flow Graph (CFG) using the\nmalicious strings given by StringSifter. Then, it extracts advanced features of\nthe identified potential malicious regions alongside the features from the\ncompletely preprocessed CFG. The features extracted from the completely\npreprocessed CFG mitigate obfuscation techniques that attempt to disguise\nmalicious content, such as suspicious strings. The experiments reveal that the\nPotentRegion4MalDetect requires fewer entries to save the features for all\nbinaries than the model focusing on the entire binary, reducing memory\noverhead, faster computation, and lower storage requirements. These advanced\nfeatures give an 8.13% increase in SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)\nAbsolute Mean and a 1.44% increase in SHAP Beeswarm value compared to those\nextracted from the entire binary.

Learning 3D language\nfields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D\nscenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target\nobjects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods\nstruggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language\nqueries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from\ninadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D\nscenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural\nrepresentation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial\nreasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature\nfield for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in\nlanguage queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial\nrelations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial\nrelation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner\nincorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical\nfeature field. This field represents language and instance features using\ndistilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a\nhierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial\nrelation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework\ncan be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,\noutperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their\nspatial reasoning capability.",

We further utilized the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy\nEvolution (iEDGE), which combined homogenized optical integral field unit and\nCO observations. This allowed us to examine how AGNs influence the molecular\ngas reservoirs of active galaxies compared to their non-active counterparts at\nsimilar evolutionary stages. Our Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-squared tests\nindicate that the star formation property distributions and scaling relations\nof AGN hosts are largely consistent with those of non-active galaxies. However,\nAGN hosts exhibit systematically higher molecular gas masses across all\nquenching stages except for the quiescent nuclear ring stage. We find that AGN\nhosts follow the expected trends of non-active quenching galaxies,\ncharacterized by a lower star formation efficiency and molecular gas fraction\ncompared to star-forming galaxies.

In this paper, we introduce and analyze a parameterized\ngeneral safety model that bridges the gap between physical and perceived safety\nby incorporating a personalization parameter, $\\rho$, into the safety\nmeasurement framework to account for individual differences in safety\nperception. Through a series of hypothesis-driven human-subject studies in a\nsimulated rescue scenario, we investigate how emotional state, trust, and robot\nbehavior influence perceived safety.

Moreover, responses cluster into a small number of\nuser types, supporting adaptive personalization based on shared safety models.\nNotably, participant role significantly shapes safety perception, and repeated\nexposure reduces perceived safety for participants in the casualty role,\nemphasizing the impact of physical interaction and experiential change.

While unintended phase\nmixing can degrade optoelectronic performances, deliberate control of\npolytypism enables novel heterostructures with unique quantum properties,\ncrystal phase quantum dots (CPQDs). However, since tailoring the formation of\nCPQDs is difficult, applications remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate\nelectric-field-driven crystal phase switching in GaAs nanowires during\nvapor-liquid-solid growth, enabling precise control of crystal phases and\ncreations of CPQDs with monolayer precision. Nanowires are epitaxially grown on\ncustom-made silicon micro-substrates using chemical vapor deposition within an\nin-situ TEM. Real-time imaging reveals that the electric field switches\ninstantaneously the crystal phase between zinc blende and wurtzite, creating\natomically sharp interfaces. Numerical simulations are developed to investigate\nthe impact of the electric field on the catalyst droplet geometry, which\nlargely governs the crystal phase. This constitutes a key progress towards\nunlocking the potential of CPQDs.",

    "abstract": "Accurate short-term state forecasting is essential for efficient and stable\noperation of modern power systems, especially in the context of increasing\nvariability introduced by renewable and distributed energy resources. As these\nsystems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict\ntheir states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control\ndecisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.\nModern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including\nelectrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges\nfor modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a\npromising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state\nforecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor\nnetworks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate\ninformation across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are\ndesigned under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are\ntypically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts\ntheir ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly\nencountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy\nconversion infrastructure. In this work, we propose the use of Heterogeneous\nGraph Attention Networks to address these limitations. Our approach models both\nhomogeneous intra-domain and heterogeneous inter-domain relationships among\nsensor data from two distinct physical domains - hydraulic and electrical -\nwhich exhibit fundamentally different temporal dynamics. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional baselines on\naverage by 35.5% in terms of normalized root mean square error, confirming its\neffectiveness in multi-domain, multi-rate power system state forecasting.",

A close stellar flyby can account for the TNOs' dynamics, but it\nis unclear if this can also explain the correlation between their colours and\norbital characteristics. Assuming an initial red-to-grey colour gradient in the\ndisc, our numerical study finds that the spiral arms induced by the stellar\nflyby simultaneously lead to the observed TNOs' colour patterns and orbital\ndynamics. The combined explanation of these TNO properties strengthens the\nevidence for a close flyby of another star to the young Solar System. Our study\npredicts that (1) small TNOs beyond 60 au will mostly be grey, and (2)\nretrograde TNOs will lack the colour most common to high-inclination TNOs. The\nanticipated TNO discoveries by the Vera Rubin telescope will be able to test\nthese predictions.

Recent numerical and experimental work\nhas suggested that internally heated and cooled convection can exhibit\ndiffusion-free scalings in more numerically accessible regimes. Here, we\npresent direct numerical simulations of 2.5D Cartesian rotating thermal\nconvection driven by an internal heating and cooling function.

To address this fundamental challenge, we present\nSTARS, which is, to our knowledge, the first unified framework that\nsimultaneously addresses singing transcription, alignment, and refined style\nannotation. Our framework delivers comprehensive multi-level annotations\nencompassing: (1) precise phoneme-audio alignment, (2) robust note\ntranscription and temporal localization, (3) expressive vocal technique\nidentification, and (4) global stylistic characterization including emotion and\npace. The proposed architecture employs hierarchical acoustic feature\nprocessing across frame, word, phoneme, note, and sentence levels.

Experimental validation confirms the framework's\nsuperior performance across multiple evaluation dimensions compared to existing\nannotation approaches.

While existing methods for dynamic activation quantization promise\ntheoretical memory savings, their practical deployment is impeded by\nsystem-level challenges such as computational overhead and memory\nfragmentation.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce DAF, a Dynamic Activation Framework\nthat enables scalable and efficient on-device training through system-level\noptimizations. DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic\nquantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid\nreduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge\nSoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic\nquantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management\nscheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.\n  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory\nsavings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy. Evaluations\non various deep learning models across embedded and mobile platforms\ndemonstrate up to a $22.9\\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $3.2\\times$\nspeedup, making DAF a scalable and practical solution for resource-constrained\nenvironments.",

The concept of a deforestation system is developed\nby examining the interplay of infrastructure, technologies, narratives, and\ninstitutions. Drawing on a literature review and an in-depth case study of\nPuerto Maldonado in Madre de Dios, Peru, the paper identifies three pathways\nfor addressing deforestation: optimisation, natural capital, and regenerative\nchange.

Prominent methods typically frame the restoration\nproblem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a\ndenoising step with a likelihood guidance step.

In\nthis paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and\nidentify significant instabilities.

We show that these\ninstabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive\nGradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD\nintegrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up\nstrategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum\n(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient.

    "abstract": "Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval\nfor enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods\nfocus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,\nthe diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,\nwhich limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called\nCDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims\nto refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the\napplication's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a\nsimple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)\nto multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified\nsimilarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent\nNormalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/NEC-N-SOGI/msdpp.",

    "abstract": "Similarity-based vector search facilitates many important applications such\nas search and recommendation but is limited by the memory capacity and\nbandwidth of a single machine due to large datasets and intensive data read. In\nthis paper, we present CoTra, a system that scales up vector search for\ndistributed execution. We observe a tension between computation and\ncommunication efficiency, which is the main challenge for good scalability,\ni.e., handling the local vectors on each machine independently blows up\ncomputation as the pruning power of vector index is not fully utilized, while\nrunning a global index over all machines introduces rich data dependencies and\nthus extensive communication. To resolve such tension, we leverage the fact\nthat vector search is approximate in nature and robust to asynchronous\nexecution. In particular, we run collaborative vector search over the machines\nwith algorithm-system co-designs including clustering-based data partitioning\nto reduce communication, asynchronous execution to avoid communication stall,\nand task push to reduce network traffic. To make collaborative search\nefficient, we introduce a suite of system optimizations including task\nscheduling, communication batching, and storage format. We evaluate CoTra on\nreal datasets and compare with four baselines. The results show that when using\n16 machines, the query throughput of CoTra scales to 9.8-13.4x over a single\nmachine and is 2.12-3.58x of the best-performing baseline at 0.95 recall@10.",

Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric\nlearning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the\ninherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm\nstruggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired\nby the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we\npropose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,\nleveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.\nSpecifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to\ndistill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize\nthe predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail\nto backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability\nof correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a\nDeformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences\nin a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a\ndifferentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves\nas a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point\ncloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the\nregistration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P\nconsistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%\nimprovement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.",

A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment\nbetween ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for\nmore fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as e.g.\naccuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank\ndifferent DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC\nvalues have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically\nmeasured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals,\nvalid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC\nin two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a\nbootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC.\nSecond, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two\nclassifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from\nthe other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists\nregarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive\nexperiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular\nNeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences\nbetween humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences\nbetween deep vision models are statistically insignificant.

We found\nthat Crisis Pregnancy Centers (CPCs) -- organizations that target women with\nunexpected or \"crisis\" pregnancies, but do not provide abortions -- accounted\nfor 47% of advertisements, whereas abortion clinics -- for 30%. Advertisements\nfrom CPCs were often returned for queries concerning information and safety.\nThe type of advertisements returned, however, varied widely within each state,\nwith Arizona returning the most advertisements from abortion clinics and other\npro-choice organizations, and Minnesota the least. The proportion of pro-choice\nvs. anti-choice advertisements returned also varied over time, but estimates\nfrom Staggered Augmented Synthetic Control Methods did not indicate that\nchanges in advertisement results were attributable to changes in state abortion\nlaws. Our findings raise questions about the access to accurate medical\ninformation across the U.S. and point to a need for further examination of\nsearch engine advertisement policies and geographical bias.",

    "abstract": "In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle\ndue to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via\nself-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings\nvia multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.\nHowever, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are\nessential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular\ncharacteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for\nnatural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain\nless data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive\ncomputational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To\naddress these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation\nmodel that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level\nsupervision.

In this work, first-principles calculations, symmetry analysis,\nand kp modeling are employed to demonstrate how interlayer sliding in AFM\nmultiferroic bilayers enables engineering of the electronic, magnetic, and\nmagneto-optical properties. This study reveals an unprecedented\ndimension-driven AM crossover, where the 2D paraelectric (PE) bilayer exhibits\nspin-degenerate bands protected by the [C2||Mc] spin-space symmetry, while the\n3D counterpart manifests AM spin-splitting along kz not equal to 0 paths.\nFurthermore, interlayer sliding breaks the Mc symmetry and stabilizes a\nferroelectric (FE) state characterized by compensated ferrimagnetism and a\nZeeman effect, which produces non-relativistic spin-split bands. In the FE\nphase, the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) lifts accidental\ndegeneracies, creating `alternating' spin-polarized bands due to the interplay\nof Zeeman and Rashba effects. Crucially, the spin polarization, ferro-valley\npolarization, and Kerr angle are simultaneously reversible by switching either\ninterlayer sliding or the Neel vector. These findings highlight the rich\ncoupling between electronic, magnetic, and optical orders in sliding\nmultiferroics, thereby paving the way for ultra-low-power spintronics and\noptoelectronic devices.",

However, the underlying mechanism of the QME in the\npresence of long-range interactions remains unclear. Using the time-dependent\nspin-wave theory, we investigate the dynamical restoration of the\nspin-rotational symmetry and the QME in generic long-range spin systems. We\nshow that quantum fluctuations of the magnetization drive the restoration of\nsymmetry by melting the initial ferromagnetic order and are responsible for the\nQME.

To tackle this\nchallenge, the concept of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) has emerged, aiming to\nutilize low-altitude airspace to establish a three-dimensional transportation\nsystem. Among various components of the AAM system, electric vertical take-off\nand landing (eVTOL) aircraft plays a pivotal role due to their flexibility and\nefficiency. However, the immaturity of Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication\n(URLLC) technologies poses significant challenges to safety-critical AAM\noperations. Specifically, existing Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM)-based\neVTOL systems lack rigorous mathematical frameworks to quantify probabilistic\ndelay bounds under dynamic air traffic patterns, a prerequisite for collision\navoidance and airspace management. To bridge this gap, we employ network\ncalculus tools to derive the probabilistic upper bound on communication delay\nin the AAM system for the first time. Furthermore, we formulate a complex\nnon-convex optimization problem that jointly minimizes the probabilistic delay\nbound and the propagation delay. To solve this problem efficiently, we propose\na solution based on the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithm and\nSemidefinite Relaxation (SDR) method.

If particles remain confined in the nebula,\n1-100TeV emission is only partially consistent with the properties of observed\nsources in terms of surface brightness, angular extent, and photon index. In\nparticular, the systems spend a long time in a bright and soft state that has\nno equivalent in observations. Conversely, including the possibility of\nenergy-dependent particle escape across the object results in a much better\nagreement, both in the 1-10TeV range explored with H.E.S.S. or LHAASO-WCDA, and\nin the 20-100TeV range explored by LHAASO-KM2A. Emission components with\nintermediate to low brightnesses and large to very large sizes result from\nparticles trapped in the remnant or escaped in the surrounding medium. Particle\nescape, clearly seen in the form of misaligned jets or halos around middle-aged\npulsars, is a very important process in much younger systems with 1-100kyr\nages, and shapes their appearance as TeV/PeV sources.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in continuous\ncontrol tasks, yet often requires extensive training data, struggles with\ncomplex, long-horizon planning, and fails to maintain safety constraints during\noperation. Meanwhile, Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers explainability and\nconstraint satisfaction, but typically yields only locally optimal solutions\nand demands careful cost function design. This paper introduces the Q-guided\nSTein variational model predictive Actor-Critic (Q-STAC), a novel framework\nthat bridges these approaches by integrating Bayesian MPC with actor-critic\nreinforcement learning through constrained Stein Variational Gradient Descent\n(SVGD). Our method optimizes control sequences directly using learned Q-values\nas objectives, eliminating the need for explicit cost function design while\nleveraging known system dynamics to enhance sample efficiency and ensure\ncontrol signals remain within safe boundaries. Extensive experiments on 2D\nnavigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Q-STAC achieves\nsuperior sample efficiency, robustness, and optimality compared to\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining the high expressiveness of\npolicy distributions.

Their plus-ends, facing\nthe chromosomes, exhibit dynamic instability, which is critical for proper\nattachment. The poleward flux implicates the displacement of Mts towards the\nspindle poles, while plus-ends polymerise. It may result from minus-end\ndepolymerisation (treadmilling), sliding by kinesins (e.g., Kinesin-5), or\npushing by chromokinesins. Intriguingly, such flux had not been reported in the\nC. elegans zygote, despite homologs of flux-associated proteins being present.\n  To investigate this, we fluorescently labelled Mts and used photobleaching.\nWe observed no global flux; instead, the bleached zone's edges moved inward.\nThe centrosome-facing front reflected MT dynamic instability, but the\nchromosome-facing front showed faster recovery, suggesting an additional\nmechanism. This extra velocity was spatially restricted to the vicinity of\nchromosomes, suggesting that only the kinetochore Mts may undergo flux.\nSupporting this, flux required key kinetochore regulators: NDC-80,\n$\\text{CLS-2}^\\text{CLASP}$, and $\\text{ZYG-9}^\\text{XMAP215}$. Flux declined\nas metaphase progressed, correlating with the attachment maturation from\nlateral to end-on, and was suppressed by SKA-1 recruitment. Classic\ntreadmilling was unlikely, as most kinetochore MTs in C. $elegans$ do not reach\nspindle poles. Instead, depleting $\\text{KLP-18}^\\text{KIF15}$, a kinesin that\ncross-links and organises Mts during meiosis, reduced front movement. We\npropose that only kinetochore Mts undergo flux, sliding along the spindle Mts,\nlikely powered by KLP-18. This localised sliding contrasts with global flux\nseen in other systems, and aligns with observations in human cells showing flux\nreduction as chromosome-to-pole distance increases.",

To address these\nlimitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections\nfrom 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs\nby predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks.

    "abstract": "Cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as\na promising paradigm for sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous\nhigh-rate data transmission and high-precision radar sensing through\ncooperative distributed access points (APs). Fully exploiting these\ncapabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization\nwith multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph\nlearning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network\nas a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user\nassociation, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position\nand velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous\ngraph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight\nmirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework. The dynamic graph\nlearning framework employs structural and temporal attention mechanisms\nintegrated with a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN),\nenabling superior performance and robustness in cell-free ISAC environments.\nConversely, the mirror-GAT framework significantly reduces computational\ncomplexity and signaling overhead through a bi-level iterative structure with\nshare adjacency. Simulation results validate that both proposed\ngraph-learning-based frameworks achieve significant improvements in\nmulti-target position and velocity estimation accuracy compared to conventional\nheuristic and optimization-based designs. Particularly, the mirror-GAT\nframework demonstrates substantial reductions in computational time and\nsignaling overhead, underscoring its suitability for practical deployments.",

The $\\beta$-VAE framework\nintroduces a hyperparameter $\\beta$ to balance disentanglement and\nreconstruction quality, where setting $\\beta > 1$ introduces an information\nbottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To\naddress this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that\nleverages a range of $\\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent\nrepresentations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a\nsingle variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls\nthe information retained in each latent representation such that the higher\n$\\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,\nintroduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent\nrepresentations corresponding to different $\\beta$ values. This model denoises\ntowards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately\nleading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.\nFurthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,\nfunctioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in\nterms of both disentanglement and generation quality.

    "abstract": "Majority bootstrap percolation is a model of infection spreading in networks.\nStarting with a set of initially infected vertices, new vertices become\ninfected once half of their neighbours are infected. Balogh, Bollob\\'{a}s and\nMorris studied this process on the hypercube and showed that there is a phase\ntransition as the density of the initially infected set increases. Generalising\ntheir results to a broad class of high-dimensional graphs, the authors of this\nwork established similar bounds on the critical window, establishing a\nuniversal behaviour for these graphs. These methods necessitated an exponential\nbound on the order of the graphs in terms of their degrees. In this paper, we\nconsider a slightly more restrictive class of high-dimensional graphs, which\nnevertheless covers most examples considered previously. Under these stronger\nassumptions, we are able to show that this universal behaviour holds in graphs\nof superexponential order. As a concrete and motivating example, we apply this\nresult to the permutahedron, a symmetric high-dimensional graph of\nsuperexponential order which arises naturally in many areas of mathematics. Our\nmethods also allow us to slightly improve the bounds on the critical window\ngiven in previous work, in particular in the case of the hypercube. Finally,\nthe upper and lower bounds on the critical window depend on the maximum and\nminimum degree of the graph, respectively, leading to much worse bounds for\nirregular graphs. We also analyse an explicit example of a high-dimensional\nirregular graph, namely the Cartesian product of stars and determine the first\ntwo terms in the expansion of the critical probability, which in this case is\ndetermined by the minimum degree.",

Quadrupling the sample size, we detect 13 of 14\nnew hosts in HI, with the only non-detection arising in a galaxy known to be\ntransitioning towards quiescence. With respect to typical local Universe\ngalaxies, FRB hosts are generally massive in HI ($M_{HI}>10^9 M_\\odot$), which\naligns with previous studies showing that FRB hosts also tend to have high\nstellar masses and are star-forming. However, they span a broad range of other\nHI derived properties. In our independent sample of repeater hosts, we observe\na statistically insignificant preference towards lower HI masses compared to\nnon-repeater hosts, similar to the low-significance trend toward lower stellar\nmasses previously reported. Using visual inspection alongside various asymmetry\nmetrics, we identify four unambiguously settled host galaxies, demonstrating\nfor the first time that a disturbed HI morphology is not a universal feature of\nFRB host galaxies. However, we find another six that show clear signs of\ndisturbance, and three which require deeper, more targeted observations to\nreach a conclusion; this brings the confirmed ratio of disturbed-to-settled FRB\nhosts to 11:4. Given that roughly a 1:1 ratio is expected for random background\ngalaxies of similar type, our observed ratio yields a p-value of 0.065. Unlike\nearlier indications based on smaller samples, this no longer crosses the\nconventional threshold for statistical significance, though is still near\nenough to hint at a legitimate excess of disturbance among FRB hosts. Thus, an\neven larger sample size of FRB hosts observed in HI is required to fully\nclarify whether the trend is genuine or still a consequence of low-number\nstatistics - a sample that upcoming data releases are well positioned to\nprovide.",

However, despite progress driven by deep neural\nnetworks, these methods remain prone to temporal flicker in real-world\napplications due to inter-frame exposure inconsistencies. To address this\nchallenge while maintaining the cost-effectiveness of the AE paradigm, we\npropose a novel learning-based HDR video generation solution. Specifically, we\npropose a dual-stream HDR video generation paradigm that decouples temporal\nluminance anchoring from exposure-variant detail reconstruction, overcoming the\ninherent limitations of the AE paradigm. To support this, we design an\nasynchronous dual-camera system (DCS), which enables independent exposure\ncontrol across two cameras, eliminating the need for synchronization typically\nrequired in traditional multi-camera setups. Furthermore, an exposure-adaptive\nfusion network (EAFNet) is formulated for the DCS system. EAFNet integrates a\npre-alignment subnetwork that aligns features across varying exposures,\nensuring robust feature extraction for subsequent fusion, an asymmetric\ncross-feature fusion subnetwork that emphasizes reference-based attention to\neffectively merge these features across exposures, and a reconstruction\nsubnetwork to mitigate ghosting artifacts and preserve fine details.

Most existing methods use equally\npenalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less\ndiscriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly\nambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually\nannotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points\nwould lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design\nAMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity\nestimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points\nbased on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,\nwhich ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes\nfor high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position\ndiscrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by\nthe assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking\nambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further\npropose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where\na novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from\ngenerated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that\nleverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more\nreliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.\nExperimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "A sophisticated hybrid quantum convolutional neural network (HQCNN) is\nconceived for handling the pilot assignment task in cell-free massive MIMO\nsystems, while maximizing the total ergodic sum throughput. The existing\nmodel-based solutions found in the literature are inefficient and/or\ncomputationally demanding. Similarly, conventional deep neural networks may\nstruggle in the face of high-dimensional inputs, require complex architectures,\nand their convergence is slow due to training numerous hyperparameters. The\nproposed HQCNN leverages parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) relying on\nsuperposition for enhanced feature extraction. Specifically, we exploit the\nsame PQC across all the convolutional layers for customizing the neural network\nand for accelerating the convergence. Our numerical results demonstrate that\nthe proposed HQCNN offers a total network throughput close to that of the\nexcessive-complexity exhaustive search and outperforms the state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks.",

While extensive research has focused on verifying the correctness\nof compilers for single-language compilation, the correctness of cross-language\ncompilation - which involves the interaction between two languages and their\nrespective compilers - remains largely unexplored. To fill this research gap,\nwe propose CrossLangFuzzer, a novel framework that introduces a universal\nintermediate representation (IR) for JVM-based languages and automatically\ngenerates cross-language test programs with diverse type parameters and complex\ninheritance structures. After generating the initial IR, CrossLangFuzzer\napplies three mutation techniques - LangShuffler, FunctionRemoval, and\nTypeChanger - to enhance program diversity. By evaluating both the original and\nmutated programs across multiple compiler versions, CrossLangFuzzer\nsuccessfully uncovered 10 confirmed bugs in the Kotlin compiler, 4 confirmed\nbugs in the Groovy compiler, 7 confirmed bugs in the Scala 3 compiler, 2\nconfirmed bugs in the Scala 2 compiler, and 1 confirmed bug in the Java\ncompiler. Among all mutators, TypeChanger is the most effective, detecting 11\nof the 24 compiler bugs. Furthermore, we analyze the symptoms and root causes\nof cross-compilation bugs, examining the respective responsibilities of\nlanguage compilers when incorrect behavior occurs during cross-language\ncompilation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork specifically\nfocused on identifying and diagnosing compiler bugs in cross-language\ncompilation scenarios. Our research helps to understand these challenges and\ncontributes to improving compiler correctness in multi-language environments.",

    "abstract": "Manual annotation of airway regions in computed tomography images is a\ntime-consuming and expertise-dependent task. Automatic airway segmentation is\ntherefore a prerequisite for enabling rapid bronchoscopic navigation and the\nclinical deployment of bronchoscopic robotic systems. Although convolutional\nneural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway\nsegmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for\nconventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine\nairway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address\nthis issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network,\nnamed TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation\nthat first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling\npositions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then\nrepresented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular\nfeature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and\nresidual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway\nstructures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two\ndatasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed\nTfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions\ncompared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest\noverall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset,\nAirway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung\nfibrosis dataset(AIIB23).

After including neutron\ninteractions with spin-dependent terms, we find that quarkyonic matter can\ndevelop ferromagnetic instabilities at low densities, characterized by negative\nmagnetic susceptibility. This ferromagnetic behavior occurs in pure neutron\nmatter, independent of proton contributions, and results from the competition\nbetween attractive spin-dependent interactions and kinetic energy costs.

    "abstract": "Given a set of source-sink pairs, the maximum multiflow problem asks for the\nmaximum total amount of flow that can be feasibly routed between them. The\nminimum multicut, a dual problem to multiflow, seeks the minimum-cost set of\nedges whose removal disconnects all the source-sink pairs. It is easy to see\nthat the value of the minimum multicut is at least that of the maximum\nmultiflow, and their ratio is called the multiflow-multicut gap. The classical\nmax-flow min-cut theorem states that when there is only one source-sink pair,\nthe gap is exactly one. However, in general, it is well known that this gap can\nbe arbitrarily large. In this paper, we study this gap for classes of planar\ngraphs and establish improved lower bound results. In particular, we show that\nthis gap is at least $\\frac{20}{9}$ for the class of planar graphs, improving\nupon the decades-old lower bound of 2.

However, it just has 12 spectral bands, making\nsubstances/objects identification less effective, not mentioning the varying\nspatial resolutions (10/20/60 m) across the 12 bands. If such a\nmulti-resolution 12-band image can be computationally converted into a\nhyperspectral image with uniformly high resolution (i.e., 10 m), it\nsignificantly facilitates remote identification tasks. Though there are some\nspectral super-resolution methods, they did not address the multi-resolution\nissue on one hand, and, more seriously, they mostly focused on the CAVE-level\nhyperspectral image reconstruction (involving only 31 visible bands) on the\nother hand, greatly limiting their applicability in real-world remote sensing\nscenarios. We ambitiously aim to convert Sentinel-2 data directly into NASA's\nAVIRIS-level hyperspectral image (encompassing up to 172 visible and\nnear-infrared (NIR) bands, after ignoring those absorption/corruption ones).\nFor the first time, this paper solves this specific super-resolution problem\n(highly ill-posed), allowing all historical Sentinel-2 data to have their\ncorresponding high-standard AVIRIS counterparts.

    "abstract": "Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its\nperformance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near\nobject boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss\ntreats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around\nedges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the\nEdge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides\npixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a\ndistinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured\nlearning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual\nboundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the\nWBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both\nquantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified\nhyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their\nmoderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning\nand is easily deployable in practice.",

Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy,\nwe formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on\nedge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a\nmonotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which\nwe design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee.\nFor the general case where $K\\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE\nlayer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective.\nTo tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to\ndecompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being\nsolved by a dynamic programming approach.

MTSE systems are expected to perform well even when one of the\nmodalities is unavailable. In practice, the systems often suffer from modality\ndominance, where one of the modalities outweighs the others, thereby limiting\nrobustness. Our study investigates training strategies and the effect of\narchitectural choices, particularly the normalization layers, in yielding a\nrobust MTSE system in both non-causal and causal configurations. In particular,\nwe propose the use of modality dropout training (MDT) as a superior strategy to\nstandard and multi-task training (MTT) strategies. Experiments conducted on\ntwo-speaker mixtures from the LRS3 dataset show the MDT strategy to be\neffective irrespective of the employed normalization layer. In contrast, the\nmodels trained with the standard and MTT strategies are susceptible to modality\ndominance, and their performance depends on the chosen normalization layer.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that the system trained with MDT strategy is\nrobust to using extracted speech as the enrollment signal, highlighting its\npotential applicability in scenarios where the target speaker is not enrolled.",

However, the origin of the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) observed\nin surface-conducting HD remains unclear, an understanding that is crucial for\nadvancing HD-based optoelectronic technologies. In this study, we investigate\nthe underlying mechanism of PPC in surface-conducting HD films. A systematic\nanalysis was performed by tuning the carrier density via partial oxygen\ntermination using an ozonation process. With increasing O-termination, both the\ndecay time and the recombination barrier of photoexcited electron-hole pairs\nwere found to decrease significantly, from 232 to 5 seconds, and from ~ 150 to\n54 meV, respectively. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal that PPC in HD\nis influenced by random local potential fluctuations, which delay the\nrecombination of photoexcited carriers. Furthermore, the observed PPC behavior\nis closely associated with percolative transport processes within the HD film.\nImportantly, the dependence of PPC on sheet carrier density is correlated with\nCoulomb interactions between the two-dimensional hole gas and the surface\nadsorbate layer. This study offers new insights into the PPC mechanism in\nsurface-conducting HD films, contributing to the broader understanding\nnecessary for the design of advanced diamond-based optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "A multi-product formula (MPF) is a promising approach for Hamiltonian\nsimulation efficiently both in the system size $N$ and the inverse allowable\nerror $1/\\varepsilon$ by combining Trotterization and the linear combination of\nunitaries (LCU). It achieves poly-logarithmic cost in $1/\\varepsilon$ like LCU\n[G. H. Low, V. Kliuchnikov, N. Wiebe, arXiv:1907.11679 (2019)]. The efficiency\nin $N$ is expected to come from the commutator scaling in Trotterization, and\nthis appears to be confirmed by the error bound of MPF expressed by nested\ncommutators [J. Aftab, D. An, K. Trivisa, arXiv:2403.08922 (2024)]. However, we\npoint out that the efficiency of MPF in the system size $N$ is not exactly\nresolved yet in that the present error bound expressed by nested commutators is\nincompatible with the size-efficient complexity reflecting the commutator\nscaling. The problem is that $q$-fold nested commutators with arbitrarily large\n$q$ are involved in their requirement and error bound. The benefit of\ncommutator scaling by locality is absent, and the cost efficient in $N$ becomes\nprohibited in general. In this paper, we show an alternative commutator-scaling\nerror of MPF and derive its size-efficient cost properly inheriting the\nadvantage in Trotterization. The requirement and the error bound in our\nanalysis, derived by techniques from the Floquet-Magnus expansion, have a\ncertain truncation order in the nested commutators and can fully exploit the\nlocality. We prove that Hamiltonian simulation by MPF certainly achieves the\ncost whose system-size dependence is as large as Trotterization while keeping\nthe $\\mathrm{polylog}(1/\\varepsilon)$-scaling like the LCU. Our results will\nprovide improved or accurate error and cost also for various algorithms using\ninterpolation or extrapolation of Trotterization.",

We model the uncertainty that the learner faces by a\ndistribution $\\pi$ in the ground-truth triples $(p, q, f)$ -- which we call a\nUDA class -- where $(p, q)$ is the source -- target distribution pair and $f$\nis the classifier. We define the performance of a learner as the overall target\ndomain risk, averaged over the randomness of the ground-truth triple. This\nformulation couples the source distribution, the target distribution and the\nclassifier in the ground truth, and deviates from the classical worst-case\nanalyses, which pessimistically emphasize the impact of hard but rare UDA\ninstances. In this formulation, we precisely characterize the optimal learner.\nThe performance of the optimal learner then allows us to define the learning\ndifficulty for the UDA class and for the observed sample. To quantify this\ndifficulty, we introduce an information-theoretic quantity -- Posterior Target\nLabel Uncertainty (PTLU) -- along with its empirical estimate (EPTLU) from the\nsample , which capture the uncertainty in the prediction for the target domain.\nBriefly, PTLU is the entropy of the predicted label in the target domain under\nthe posterior distribution of ground-truth classifier given the observed source\nand target samples. By proving that such a quantity serves to lower-bound the\nrisk of any learner, we suggest that these quantities can be used as proxies\nfor evaluating the hardness of UDA learning.

    "abstract": "We investigate Power-Law Plateau (PLP) inflation in standard gravity and its\nconsistency with ACT DR6 data. While many inflationary models, including the\nStarobinsky inflation, are disfavored by ACT observations, the PLP potential\nremains viable across a broad range of its parameters. Then, the dynamics of\nthe reheating phase are investigated, where we mainly focus on the reheating\ntemperature and its relationship with the inflationary phase and primordial\ngravitational waves. Incorporating the overproduction of the primordial\ngravitational waves can affect the effective number of relativistic species\nduring the bounce. The constraint data on $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ can impose a\nlower bound on the reheating temperature. This constraint will be more\nefficient for a stiff equation of state. It is determined that for $\\omega_{re}\n> 0.58$, this constraint would be efficient. Combining the result of the\nreheating temperature and the inflationary phase, it is concluded that to have\nboth a viable result standing in $1\\sigma$ of ACT DR6 and also to satisfy the\nreheating lower bound, the total number of e-folds during the inflationary\nphase should be $N_k \\lesssim 62$. Higher e-folds of expansion result in a\nreheating temperature below the bound, which is disfavored. Finally, for the\nconstraint values of the reheating temperature, the energy spectrum of the\ngravitational waves has been explored. The results indicate that there is a\nhigher chance of detection for lower reheating temperatures and higher\nreheating equation of state.",

IL Attention employs an\ninverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,\nintroducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal\ncoordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture\ncomplex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to\nextract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost\nno increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion\nforecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet\nachieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over\nfewer parameters.

    "abstract": "Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main\ngoal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has\nfocused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken\nEnglish into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's\nbecause it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating\nit into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this\nwork, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into\nsmooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper\nto translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine\ntranslation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)\ngloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without\ngrammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.\nTo make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such\nas Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the\ntranslated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on\nSign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key\npoints from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss\ntranslation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which\nturns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss\nusing grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly\ninterpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike\nprevious works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use\nonly one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in\na single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D\nsign language animation.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is\nwell-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor\nquality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed\nintegrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to\nimprove accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external\ntools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational\nsettings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs\nto request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide\ncomputational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed\nframework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language\nUnderstanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical\nand scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models\nshow that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena\nframework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific\nreasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,\nLLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline\nmodel (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively.

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive\nblack-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate\nhand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying\nfunction, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model\nand non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and\nacquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our\nframework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying\nhyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an\nacquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a\nBayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing\nmulti-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision\ntransformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving\nthe ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning\nparadigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated\ndata sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real\nevaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and\nreal-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO\nbaselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust\nexploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.",

At fine scales, the forced\n(predictable) component of precipitation and temperature extremes for future\nperiods (2080--2099) is spatially smoother than changes in individual\nsimulations, and locally smaller. Future changes in rarer (10-year and 20-year)\nprecipitation extremes are more severe and have larger internal variability\nspread than annual extremes. Internal variability spread is larger at fine\nscales that at the coarser scales simulated in climate models. Unpredictability\nfrom internal variability dominates model uncertainty and, for precipitation,\nits variance increases with warming, exceeding the variance across emission\nscenarios by fourfold for annual and tenfold for decadal extremes.

This targeted approach reduces the\nnumber of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing\nthe retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive\nbenchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs\nfrom generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's\ngenerative capabilities.

Little has been discussed, however, regarding\nthree-dimensional rigid-body impact mechanics in this regard. Two commercially\navailable accident simulation programs, PC-Crash and Virtual CRASH, offer\nthree-dimensional rigid-body impact mechanics as one of their collision models\nbut documentation of the complete development of their three-dimensional\nequations, particularly with respect to necessary constraint strategies at the\nimpulse center, are not readily available. In this paper, a three-dimensional\nrigid-body impact mechanics derivation is presented. In order to solve the set\nof impact mechanics equations of motion it is necessary to develop constraint\nrelationships. The constraint strategy described in the literature pertaining\nto the PC-Crash Full-Impact/Sliding-Impact scenarios for two dimensions is\nextended to the three-dimensional case and the ramifications regarding\npost-impact relative velocity at the impulse center is discussed. A second\nstrategy in which an impulse component is aligned with the contact plane\ncomponent of the initial relative velocity at the impulse center is presented\nand compared to the PC-Crash scenarios. Lastly, while these two strategies\nincorporate a single impulse ratio/friction parameter for the contact plane, a\nstrategy involving two independent impulse ratio/friction parameters is briefly\ndiscussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of Rhythmic Insertion Tasks (RIT), where\na robot must repeatedly perform high-precision insertions, such as screwing a\nnut into a bolt with a wrench. The inherent difficulty of RIT lies in achieving\nmillimeter-level accuracy and maintaining consistent performance over multiple\nrepetitions, particularly when factors like nut rotation and friction introduce\nadditional complexity. We propose a sim-to-real framework that integrates a\nreinforcement learning-based insertion policy with a failure forecasting\nmodule. By representing the wrench's pose in the nut's coordinate frame rather\nthan the robot's frame, our approach significantly enhances sim-to-real\ntransferability. The insertion policy, trained in simulation, leverages\nreal-time 6D pose tracking to execute precise alignment, insertion, and\nrotation maneuvers. Simultaneously, a neural network predicts potential\nexecution failures, triggering a simple recovery mechanism that lifts the\nwrench and retries the insertion. Extensive experiments in both simulated and\nreal-world environments demonstrate that our method not only achieves a high\none-time success rate but also robustly maintains performance over long-horizon\nrepetitive tasks.",

In such systems, LLM-based extraction operations\nconstitute the performance bottleneck of query execution due to the high\nmonetary cost and slow LLM inference. Existing systems typically borrow the\nquery optimization principles popular in relational databases to produce query\nexecution plans, which unfortunately are ineffective in minimizing LLM cost. To\nfill this gap, we propose QUEST, which features a bunch of novel optimization\nstrategies for unstructured document analysis. First, we introduce an\nindex-based strategy to minimize the cost of each extraction operation. With\nthis index, QUEST quickly retrieves the text segments relevant to the target\nattributes and only feeds them to LLMs. Furthermore, we design an\nevidence-augmented retrieval strategy to reduce the possibility of missing\nrelevant segments. Moreover, we develop an instance-optimized query execution\nstrategy: because the attribute extraction cost could vary significantly\ndocument by document, QUEST produces different plans for different documents.\nFor each document, QUEST produces a plan to minimize the frequency of attribute\nextraction. The innovations include LLM cost-aware operator ordering strategies\nand an optimized join execution approach that transforms joins into filters.\nExtensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nQUEST, achieving 30%-6x cost savings while improving the F1 score by 10% -27%\ncompared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that in triangle\ncounting, TriOR maximizes accuracy with reduced time complexity among one-round\nalgorithms, TriTR achieves optimal accuracy, TriMTR achieves the highest\naccuracy under low download costs, and QuaTR stands as the first quadrangle\ncounting algorithm under pure edge-LDP. We implement edge-LDP for noisy data\nvia a confidence interval-inspired method, providing DP guarantees on\nrandomized data.

This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from\nEnglish to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with\nspecialized techniques for wordplay generation.\n  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a\nbaseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a\nnew contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided\nchain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we\nimplement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and\nregenerating puns with feedback.\n  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's\nprimary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the\nsource text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best\nruns earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition\nwhere they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.\n  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational\nlinguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay\ntranslation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be\nleveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic\nsimilarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for\nsuccessful humor.",

With the remarkable advancements in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), the adoption of LLMs as the foundational architecture\nfor time series modeling has gained significant attention. Although existing\nmodels achieve some success, they rarely both model time and frequency\ncharacteristics in a pretraining-finetuning paradigm leading to suboptimal\nperformance in predictions of complex time series, which requires both modeling\nperiodicity and prior pattern knowledge of signals. We propose MoFE-Time, an\ninnovative time series forecasting model that integrates time and frequency\ndomain features within a Mixture of Experts (MoE) network. Moreover, we use the\npretraining-finetuning paradigm as our training framework to effectively\ntransfer prior pattern knowledge across pretraining and finetuning datasets\nwith different periodicity distributions. Our method introduces both frequency\nand time cells as experts after attention modules and leverages the MoE routing\nmechanism to construct multidimensional sparse representations of input\nsignals. In experiments on six public benchmarks, MoFE-Time has achieved new\nstate-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE and MAE by 6.95% and 6.02% compared\nto the representative methods Time-MoE.

To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning\n(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable\nconcepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness\nof existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in\nthe presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework\nexplicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike\nexisting approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall\nexploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion\nmodels by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a\nsingle semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten\nstate-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial\neffectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the\noriginal textual prompt.

We address\nchallenge of an agent learning a policy that allows it to decide whether or not\nto communicate with its cloud node, using limited feedback it obtains from its\nown attempts to communicate, to optimize its utility.

Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\\% of\nLLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot\nsettings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer\nparameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class\nseverity tasks (a drop of over 30\\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical\nunderstanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides\nsubstantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\\%), while LLM gains are more\nvariable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health\nunderstanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for\nanalyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly\nadapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them\nas promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.",

    "abstract": "Classical Cepheids (CCs) are important probes for the large-scale warp\nstructure of the Milky Way. Using Gaia DR3 CCs, we establish an optimal\ntime-dependent warp model, where the warp height increases with radius\nfollowing a power-law, the line of nodes (LONs) exhibit linear twisting with\nradius, following a leading spiral pattern, and the LONs undergo prograde\nevolution over time. Structurally, we identify significant warp features in the\n$5-9$ kpc region of the Galactic disk, where the warp model performs better\nthan the flat model. Beyond 15 kpc, the model with the second Fourier term does\nnot fit the observations well, whereas the model with twisted LONs better\nmatches the data. Kinematically, we derived expressions for the vertical\nvelocities using direct differentiation and then calculated the precession\nrates for each CC. Our results intuitively indicate a nearly uniform and low\nwarp precession rate of $\\omega = 4.86 \\pm (0.88)_{stat} \\pm (2.14)_{sys}$ km\ns$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ beyond 12.5 kpc, in agreement with classical kinematic\nestimates. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet comprehensive\ntime-dependent warp model, $Z_{w}(t) = 0.00019R^{3.08}\\sin(\\phi - (3.87R-41.79\n+ 4.86t))$, which provides a unified framework for describing both the\ngeometric and kinematic evolution of the Galactic warp. We analyzed the impact\nof the adopted solar vertical velocity on the inferred warp precession rate and\nconfirmed the reliability of the measured precession rate. In addition, we\nfound that extinction treatment affects the warp amplitude in the inner disk,\nwhile its influence on the outer disk warp structure and the precession rate is\nnegligible.",

This study revealed the proton transport\nbehavior of HxWO3, focusing on its potential as a proton-conducting mixed\nionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) for intermediate-temperature electrochemical\napplications. By employing a proton-conducting phosphate glass as an\nelectron-blocking electrode, we selectively measured the partial proton\nconductivity of sintered HxWO3. Hydrogen incorporation into the sintered WO3\npellet was found to occur preferentially near the surface, forming an\napproximately 500-micrometer-thick hydrogen-rich region. This region reached a\ncomposition of x = 0.24 and exhibited proton conductivity exceeding 10^-1 S/cm\nat 275 {\\deg}C, well above those of state-of-the-art perovskite proton\nconductors.

The key idea is to construct text-driven\ndiffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to\nprovide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence\nsignals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the\ndiffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive\nlearning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency\nregularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising\nrepresentations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In\naddition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying\non any labeled data. We also provide a theoretical analysis for FedDifRC to\nensure convergence under non-convex objectives. The experiments on different\nscenarios validate the effectiveness of FedDifRC and the efficiency of crucial\ncomponents.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic signals from industrial machines offer valuable insights for anomaly\ndetection, predictive maintenance, and operational efficiency enhancement.\nHowever, existing task-specific, supervised learning methods often scale poorly\nand fail to generalize across diverse industrial scenarios, whose acoustic\ncharacteristics are distinct from general audio. Furthermore, the scarcity of\naccessible, large-scale datasets and pretrained models tailored for industrial\naudio impedes community-driven research and benchmarking. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce DINOS (Diverse INdustrial Operation Sounds), a\nlarge-scale open-access dataset. DINOS comprises over 74,149 audio samples\n(exceeding 1,093 hours) collected from various industrial acoustic scenarios.\nWe also present IMPACT (Industrial Machine Perception via Acoustic Cognitive\nTransformer), a novel foundation model for industrial machine sound analysis.\nIMPACT is pretrained on DINOS in a self-supervised manner. By jointly\noptimizing utterance and frame-level losses, it captures both global semantics\nand fine-grained temporal structures. This makes its representations suitable\nfor efficient fine-tuning on various industrial downstream tasks with minimal\nlabeled data. Comprehensive benchmarking across 30 distinct downstream tasks\n(spanning four machine types) demonstrates that IMPACT outperforms existing\nmodels on 24 tasks, establishing its superior effectiveness and robustness,\nwhile providing a new performance benchmark for future research.",

    "abstract": "We show that the resistance distance between a pair of adjacent vertices in a\nphantom network generated randomly by a Monte-Carlo method depends on the\nexistence of short cycles around it. Here we assume that phantom networks have\nno fixed points but their centers of mass are located at a point. The\nresistance distance corresponds to the mean-square deviation of the end-to-end\nvector along the strand connecting the adjacent vertices. We generate random\nnetworks with fixed valency $f$ but different densities of short cycles via a\nMetropolis method that rewires edges among four vertices chosen randomly. In\nthe process the cycle rank is conserved. However, the densities of short cycles\nare determined by the rate of randomization $kT$ which appears in the\nacceptance ratio $\\exp(-\\Delta U/kT)$ of rewiring. If a strand has few short\ncycles around itself, the mean squared deviation of the strand is equal to\n$2/f$. If it is part of a short cycle, i.e., the network has a short loop which\nconsists of a sequence of strands including the given strand itself, its\nresistance distance is smaller than $2/f$, while if it is not included in a\ncycle but adjacent to cycles, its resistance distance is larger than $2/f$. We\nshow it via an electrical circuit analogy of the network. Moreover, we\nnumerically show that the effect of multiple cycles on the resistance distance\nis expressed as a linear combination of the effects of isolated single cycles.\nIt follows that cycles independently have an effect on the fluctuation\nproperties of a strand in a polymer network.",

We introduce SP4LP (Shortest\nPath for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node\nencodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first\napplies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the\nshortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting\nsequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP\nto capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational\nefficiency.

The performance of these computational measurement\napproaches is critically influenced by the choice of random media, yet a\ngeneral framework for evaluating different implementations remains absent.\nHere, we propose a universal analytical model for computational measurement\nsystems and reveal that the system resolution is fundamentally determined by\nthe maximum optical path difference (OPD) permitted within the random medium.\nBuilding on this theoretical foundation, we present a resonant leaky-mode (RLM)\nspectropolarimeter that achieves a record high resolution-footprint-product\nmetric. The RLM spectropolarimeter leverages the complex coupling between leaky\nmodes in a tapered coreless optical fiber and whispering-gallery modes (WGM) of\nmicrosphere to significantly enhance the maximum OPD within a compact\nfootprint. We simultaneously achieve an ultrahigh spectral resolution of 0.02\npm, a spectral measurement bandwidth of 150 nm, and full-Stokes polarization\nmeasurement with an accuracy of $4.732 \\times 10^{-6}$, all within a\nsub-square-millimeter footprint. The proposed theoretical model clarifies the\nkey factors governing the performance of computational measurement systems\nbased on random media and may inspires novel design of advanced computational\nmeasurement systems for optical field.

    "abstract": "Relational databases are foundational to numerous domains, including business\nintelligence, scientific research, and enterprise systems. However, accessing\nand analyzing structured data often requires proficiency in SQL, which is a\nskill that many end users lack. With the development of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) technology, the Text-to-SQL systems attempt to bridge this gap\nby translating natural language questions into executable SQL queries via an\nautomated algorithm. Yet, when operating on complex real-world databases, the\nText-to-SQL systems often suffer from ambiguity due to natural ambiguity in\nnatural language queries. These ambiguities pose a significant challenge for\nexisting Text-to-SQL translation systems, which tend to commit early to a\npotentially incorrect interpretation. To address this, we propose an\ninteractive Text-to-SQL framework that models SQL generation as a probabilistic\nreasoning process over multiple candidate queries. Rather than producing a\nsingle deterministic output, our system maintains a distribution over possible\nSQL outputs and seeks to resolve uncertainty through user interaction. At each\ninteraction step, the system selects a branching decision and formulates a\nclarification question aimed at disambiguating that aspect of the query.\nCrucially, we adopt a principled decision criterion based on Expected\nInformation Gain to identify the clarification that will, in expectation, most\nreduce the uncertainty in the SQL distribution.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural\npredator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to\nharness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,\nthereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.\nHowever, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in\nlocally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a\nnew direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast\nknowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping\nacross local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1)\n\\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent\npolicies via competitive self-play; (2) \\textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play\n(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and\n(3) the most promising variant, \\textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},\ncreates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of\nNSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a\ncontinuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety\nsimulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car\nTag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and\nheuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy\nquality, \\ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In\nGandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through\nand jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.\nFurthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered\nvulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of\nimproving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more\ncreative and open-ended strategy discovery",

In this study, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of Adam\nstems largely from its similarity to SignSGD in robustly handling large\ngradient fluctuations, yet it is also vulnerable to destabilizing loss spikes\ndue to its uncontrolled update scaling. To enhance the advantage of Adam and\nmitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with\nthree key innovations. \\emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by\nemploying a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \\geq 1$) in the denominator,\ndeparting from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)\npreconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving\nstable training even with aggressive learning rates. \\emph{Second}, S3\nminimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving\naverage coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently\nbound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \\emph{Third}, S3\nincorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,\naccelerating convergence without memory overhead. Theoretically, we prove that\nS3 achieves the optimal convergence rate of\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{T^{\\sfrac{1}{4}}}\\right)$ for general nonconvex stochastic\noptimization under weak assumptions.
