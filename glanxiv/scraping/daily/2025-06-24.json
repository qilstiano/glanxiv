    "abstract": "Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a\nsignificant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical\napplications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident\nmanagement scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily\ntarget urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a\nsubstantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road\nscenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal\nDataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such\nenvironments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including\n128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --\ncollected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose\na dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway\nprediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed\nfusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation\nperformance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to\nsupport future research in trail-based off-road navigation.",

    "abstract": "Token merging has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate Vision\nTransformers (ViT) by reducing computational costs. However, existing methods\nprimarily rely on the visual token's feature similarity for token merging,\noverlooking the potential of integrating spatial information, which can serve\nas a reliable criterion for token merging in the early layers of ViT, where the\nvisual tokens only possess weak visual information. In this paper, we propose\nToSA, a novel token merging method that combines both semantic and spatial\nawareness to guide the token merging process. ToSA leverages the depth image as\ninput to generate pseudo spatial tokens, which serve as auxiliary spatial\ninformation for the visual token merging process. With the introduced spatial\nawareness, ToSA achieves a more informed merging strategy that better preserves\ncritical scene structure. Experimental results demonstrate that ToSA\noutperforms previous token merging methods across multiple benchmarks on visual\nand embodied question answering while largely reducing the runtime of the ViT,\nmaking it an efficient solution for ViT acceleration.

    "abstract": "Phenotyping is the process of distinguishing groups of patients to identify\ndifferent types of disease progression. A recent trend employs low-rank matrix\nand tensor factorization methods for their capability of dealing with\nmulti-modal, heterogeneous, and missing data. Symptom quantification is crucial\nfor understanding patient experiences in inflammatory bowel disease, especially\nin conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). However, patient-reported\nsymptoms are typically noisy, subjective, and significantly more sparse than\nother data types. For this reason, they are usually not included in phenotyping\nand other machine learning methods. This paper explores the application of\ncomputational phenotyping to leverage Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) using a\nnovel supervised coupled matrix-tensor factorization (SCMTF) method, which\nintegrates temporal PROs and temporal labs with static features to predict\nmedication persistence in ulcerative colitis. This is the first tensor-based\nmethod that is both supervised and coupled, it is the first application to the\nUC domain, and the first application to PROs. We use a deep learning framework\nthat makes the model flexible and easy to train. The proposed method allows us\nto handle the large amount of missing data in the PROs. The best model predicts\nchanges in medication 8 and 20 months in the future with AUCs of 0.853 and\n0.803 on the test set respectively. We derive interpretable phenotypes\nconsisting of static features and temporal features (including their temporal\npatterns). We show that low-rank matrix and tensor based phenotyping can be\nsuccessfully applied to the UC domain and to highly missing PRO data. We\nidentify phenotypes useful to predict medication persistence - these phenotypes\ninclude several symptom variables, showing that PROs contain relevant\ninfromation that is usually discarded.",

Neutrinos are unambiguous\ntracers of hadronic interactions and cosmic rays. On June 15, 2020, IceCube\ndetected a neutrino event with an 82.8% probability of being astrophysical in\norigin. To identify the astrophysical source of the neutrino, we used X-ray\ntiling observations to identify potential counterpart sources. We performed\nadditional multiwavelength follow-up with NuSTAR and the VLA in order to\nconstruct a broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the most likely\ncounterpart. From the SED, we calculate an estimate for the neutrinos we expect\nto detect from the source. While the source does not have a high predicted\nneutrino flux, it is still a plausible neutrino emitter. It is important to\nnote that the other bright X-ray candidate sources consistent with the neutrino\nevent are also radio-quiet AGN. A statistical analysis shows that 1RXS\nJ093117.6+033146 is the most likely counterpart (87.5%) if the neutrino is\ncosmic in origin and if it is among X-ray detectable sources.

Classically, all these steps involve Bayesian optimization,\nmaterial science, control theory, and direct physics-driven numerical methods.\nHowever, many of these techniques are computationally intractable, monetarily\ncostly, or difficult to implement at scale.

    "abstract": "The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets\nchallenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning\noffers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing\nmethods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while\nmodel-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally\nprohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid\nframework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with\nmodel-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions\ndata and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy\nmodel to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by\ncomparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal\nadaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more\naggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in\ninformative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection\nbenchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster\nR-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms\nprominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over\n54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model\nperformance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing\ndata efficiency for large-scale model training.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a test that is consistent against every detectable form\nof selective reporting and remains interpretable even when the t-scores are not\nexactly normal. The test statistic is the distance between the smoothed\nempirical t-curve and the set of all t-curves that would be possible in the\nabsence of any selective reporting. This novel projection test can only be\nevaded in large meta-samples by selective reporting that also evades all other\nvalid tests of restrictions on the t-curve. A second benefit of the projection\ntest is that under the null we can interpret the projection residual as noise\nplus bias incurred from approximating the t-score's exact distribution with the\nnormal. Applying the test to the Brodeur et al. (2020) meta-data, we find that\nthe t-curves for RCTs, IVs, and DIDs are more distorted than could arise by\nchance. But an Edgeworth Expansion reveals that these distortions are small\nenough to be plausibly explained by the only approximate normality of the\nindividual t-scores. The detection of selective reporting in this meta-sample\nis therefore more fragile than previously known.",

    "abstract": "We present a volume penalization technique for simulating\nacoustically-actuated flows in geometrically complex microchannels. Using a\nperturbation approach, the nonlinear response of an acoustically-actuated\ncompressible Newtonian fluid moving over obstacles or flowing in a\ngeometrically complex domain is segregated into two sub-problems: a harmonic\nfirst-order problem and a time-averaged second-order problem, where the latter\nutilizes forcing terms and boundary conditions arising from the first-order\nsolution. This segregation results in two distinct volume penalized systems of\nequations. The no-slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface is\nenforced by prescribing a zero structure velocity for the first-order problem,\nwhile spatially varying Stokes drift -- which depends on the gradient of the\nfirst-order solution -- is prescribed as the structure velocity for the\nsecond-order problem. The harmonic first-order system is solved via MUMPS\ndirect solver, whereas the steady state second-order system is solved\niteratively using a novel projection method-based preconditioner. The\npreconditioned iterative solver for the second-order system is demonstrated to\nbe highly effective and scalable with respect to increasing penalty force and\ngrid resolution, respectively. A novel contour integration technique to\nevaluate the acoustic radiation force on an immersed object is also proposed.\nThrough test cases featuring representative microfluidic geometries, we\ndemonstrate excellent agreement between the volume penalized and body-fitted\ngrid. We also identify suitable penalty factors and interfacial smearing widths\nto accurately capture the first- and second-order solutions. These results\nprovide first-of-its-kind empirical evidence of the efficacy of the volume\npenalization method for simulating acoustic streaming problems that have so far\nbeen analyzed using body-fitted methods in literature.",

A universal\nenergetic scaling relation $E_c(n) = -a/n^b + E_c^{\\mathrm{sheet}}$, with $b =\n0.4$ or $b = 0.9$ depending on the coordination family, captures the\nconvergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron phases.\nNotably, we establish one-to-one structural correspondences between select\ncages and experimentally accessible borophenes: B$_{40}$ mirrors the\n$\\chi^3$-sheet, B$_{65}$ the $\\beta_{12}$-sheet, B$_{80}$ the $\\alpha$-sheet,\nand B$_{92}$ the $bt$-sheet. Our analysis reveals two distinct families of\nboron nanostructures based on the scaling exponent: one with $b = 0.9$,\ncomprising structures with significant 6-fold coordination, and another with $b\n= 0.4$, which includes B$_{40}$, B$_{38}$, and two experimentally observed\nborophenes. These clusters also exhibit large HOMO--LUMO gaps (e.g., $E_g =\n1.78$~eV for B$_{40}$, 1.14~eV for B$_{92}$), contrasting with the metallicity\nof their 2D counterparts and, in the case of B$_{65}$, spontaneous spin\npolarization ($M = 3\\mu_B$). Our findings provide a predictive strategy for\ndesigning boron nanostructures by leveraging coordination fingerprints, and are\nfurther validated by the recent experimental synthesis of the B$_{80}$ cage.\nThis work bridges zero- and two-dimensional boron chemistry, offering a roadmap\nfor the future synthesis and application of boron-based materials.",

Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the\nenvironment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance\nof a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task\ndistributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which\ncould be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities\nand computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new\ntheoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse\npools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility.\nKey to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the\npool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a\ncentralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used\nfor (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize\ndiversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task\nmappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to\nthen perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes\ncompletion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation\nprocess in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain\nover a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and\nexecution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task\noperations.",

Our results advance the state of the art for each\nof these problems. For unit-demand pricing with discrete distributions, our\nmultiplicative PTAS improves on the additive PTAS of Cai and Daskalakis, and we\nadditionally give a PTAS for the unbounded regular case, improving on the\nlatter paper's QPTAS. For assortment optimization, no constant approximation\nwas previously known. For delegated choice, we improve on both the\n$3$-approximation for the case with no outside option and the\nsuper-constant-approximation with an outside option.\n  A key technical insight driving our results is an economically meaningful\nproperty we term utility alignment. Informally, a problem is utility aligned\nif, at optimality, the principal derives most of their utility from\nrealizations where the agent's utility is also high. Utility alignment allows\nthe algorithm designer to focus on maximizing performance on realizations with\nhigh agent utility, which is often an algorithmically simpler task.

Addressing mediation questions in these\nsettings is challenging due to numerous potential exposures, complex mediation\npathways, and intermediate confounding. Existing methods, such as\ninterventional and path-specific effects, become impractical in intensive\nlongitudinal data.

Here, we present a proof-of-concept experiment at\nthe DRACO~PW laser in a pitcher-catcher configuration, stably producing 6-7e7\nneutrons/shot with energies above 1 MeV, over more than 200 shots delivered at\na shot-per-minute rate. Neutron time-of-flight measurements were performed\nusing a single-crystal diamond detector, which is located only 1.5 m away from\nthe source and capable of resolving individual neutron-induced reactions.\nObserved reaction rates are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations inferred by\nreal-time diagnostics of accompanying gamma, ion, and electron fluxes. With the\nrecent advances in repetition rate, targetry, and ion acceleration efficiency,\nthis work establishes LDNSs as a promising, scalable platform for future fast\nneutron-induced reaction studies, particularly for measurements involving\nshort-lived isotopes or requiring high instantaneous neutron flux.",

    "abstract": "While machine learning models become more capable in discriminative tasks at\nscale, their ability to overcome biases introduced by training data has come\nunder increasing scrutiny. Previous results suggest that there are two extremes\nof parameterization with very different behaviors: the population\n(underparameterized) setting where loss weighting is optimal and the separable\noverparameterized setting where loss weighting is ineffective at ensuring equal\nperformance across classes. This work explores the regime of last layer\nretraining (LLR) in which the unseen limited (retraining) data is frequently\ninseparable and the model proportionately sized, falling between the two\naforementioned extremes.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are a powerful tool for probabilistic forecasting, yet most\napplications in high-dimensional chaotic systems predict future snapshots\none-by-one. This common approach struggles to model complex temporal\ndependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of\nuncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which\napply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to\naddress this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion\ntechniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by\nintroducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to\nsuccessfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant\ndesign of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM\ncomponents-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the\nrolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three\nkey contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model\ncapacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to\nstochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained\nEDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture\nfor robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D\nNavier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\\circ\nresolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines,\nincluding conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful\ngeneral framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems\nwhere modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount.

Prior studies have reported\nthat large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive\nbiases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward\nidentity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate\nwhether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic\nattributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and\nproprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity\ndiscernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific\nevidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity\ndiscernment relative to models without personas. Political personas\nspecifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific\nevidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced\npolitical identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at\nmitigating these effects.

This promotes our\nunderstanding of the APSP hypothesis showing that the hardest instances must\nexhaust a linear number of weights per node.

    "abstract": "In recent years, neural rendering methods such as NeRFs and 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in scene reconstruction and\nnovel view synthesis. However, they heavily rely on preprocessed camera poses\nand 3D structural priors from structure-from-motion (SfM), which are\nchallenging to obtain in outdoor scenarios. To address this challenge, we\npropose to incorporate Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with optimization-based\nrefinement to achieve accurate camera pose estimation under large camera\nmovements. Additionally, we introduce a voxel-based scene densification\napproach to guide the reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach ICP-3DGS outperforms existing methods in both\ncamera pose estimation and novel view synthesis across indoor and outdoor\nscenes of various scales.

We start from the\n$N$ interacting conservative diffusions, associated with the $N$ Bose\nparticles, and take an infinite particle limit. We address several aspects of\nthis formulation. First, we consider the problem of extending to a system with\nself-interaction the variational formulation of Nelson stochastic mechanics due\nto Guerra and Morato. In this regard we discuss two possible extensions, one\nbased on a doubling procedure and another based on a constraint Eulerian type\nvariational principle. Then we consider the infinite particle limit from the\npoint of view of the $N$-particles Madelung equations. Since conservative\ndiffusions can be identified with proper infinitesimal characteristics pairs\n$(\\rho_N(t), v_N(t))$, a time marginal probability density and a current\nvelocity field, respectively, we consider a finite Madelung hierarchy for the\nmarginals pairs $(\\rho_{N,n}(t), v_{N,n}(t))$, obtained by properly\nconditioning the processes. The infinite Madelung hierarchy arises from the\nfinite one by performing, for each fixed $n$, a mean-field scaling limit in\n$N$. Finally, we introduce a $n$-particle conditioned diffusions which\nnaturally parallels the quantum mechanical approach and is a new approach\nwithin the context of Nelson stochastic mechanics. We then prove the\nconvergence, in the infinite particle limit, of the law of such a conditioned\nprocess to the law of a self-interacting diffusion which describes the\ncondensate.",

Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x\ntimes more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while\nmaintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs\ncan be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in\nmedical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular\nframework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and\naligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.",

    "abstract": "We present a preliminary study exploring whether the stellar orbital\ncircularity of simulated galaxies, available from precomputed catalogs in the\nIllustrisTNG project, can be used as a proxy for broad morphological\nclassification. We focus on the publicly available \"Stellar Circularities,\nAngular Momenta, Axis Ratios\" catalog, which enables a simple kinematic\ndecomposition of the stellar component into disk and spheroid subsystems. By\nvalidating this approach against the more detailed five-component kinematic\ndecomposition in TNG50, we confirm that the circularity-based disk fraction\ncorrelates most strongly with the thin disk, while the bulge fraction broadly\nrepresents the combined contribution of classical bulges and stellar halos. We\nthen apply this decomposition to galaxies in the TNG100 simulation at redshift\n$z=0$ and identify a data-motivated threshold of $\\mathrm{F_{disk}} = 0.25$ to\ndistinguish early- and late-type galaxies. This threshold, lower than the\ncommonly adopted value of $0.4$, better captures the diversity of\ndisk-dominated systems and avoids excluding galaxies with moderately prominent\ndisks. Additionally, we identify irregular or morphologically complex systems\nbased on galaxies with low total disk and spheroid mass fractions. Using this\nclassification, we recover a morphology-density relation that is broadly\nconsistent with observations: late-type galaxies dominate in the field, while\nearly-type galaxies are the most prevalent morphological type in clusters. Our\nresults demonstrate that stellar circularity alone can serve as an accessible\nand computationally efficient morphological proxy.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of topology-independent (TI) distributed\nadaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) in wireless acoustic sensor\nnetworks (WASNs) where sensor nodes exchange only fused versions of their local\nsignals. An algorithm named TI-DANSE has previously been presented to handle\nnon-fully connected WASNs. However, its slow iterative convergence towards the\noptimal solution limits its applicability. To address this, we propose in this\npaper the TI-DANSE+ algorithm. At each iteration in TI-DANSE+, the node set to\nupdate its local parameters is allowed to exploit each individual partial\nin-network sums transmitted by its neighbors in its local estimation problem,\nincreasing the available degrees of freedom and accelerating convergence with\nrespect to TI-DANSE. Additionally, a tree-pruning strategy is proposed to\nfurther increase convergence speed. TI-DANSE+ converges as fast as the DANSE\nalgorithm in fully connected WASNs while reducing transmit power usage. The\nconvergence properties of TI-DANSE+ are demonstrated in numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time, alternating between\nfixations where a reader focuses on a specific point in space, and saccades\nwhere a reader rapidly shifts their focus to a new point. An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to\nfixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a\npredictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive\naccuracy.

One promising solution is Unsupervised\nEnvironment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher\nadaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns\na robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically\nmeasure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current\nperformance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these\napproaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term\nin our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects\nperformance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called\nco-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware\nRegret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED).\nEmpirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot\ngeneralization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer\nenvironment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that\nthe transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that\nco-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition\nprediction error.

Here, we introduce a quenched\nmean-field based framework for analyzing both pairwise and group dilemmas on\nany weighted network, providing interpretable conditions required for favoring\ncooperation. Our theoretical advances further motivate us to find that the\ndegree-inverse weighted social ties -- reinforcing tie strengths between\nperipheral nodes while weakening those between hubs -- robustly promote\ncooperation in both pairwise and group dilemmas. Importantly, this\nconfiguration enables heterogeneous networks to outperform homogeneous ones in\nfixation of cooperation, thereby adding to the conventional view that degree\nheterogeneity inhibits cooperative behavior under the local stochastic strategy\nupdate. We further test the generality of degree-inverse weighted social ties\nin promoting cooperation on 30,000 random networks and 13 empirical networks\ndrawn from real-world systems. Finally, we unveil the underlying mechanism by\nexamining the formation and evolution of cooperative ties under social ties\nwith degree-inverse weights.

We investigate the gas reservoirs, star formation (SF) properties, and\nenvironment of the ultra-diffuse galaxy GAMA526784 to understand its formation\nhistory, the efficiency of molecular gas conversion into stars, and the\npossible role of an interacting companion in shaping its morphology. Methods.\nWe analyse low and high-resolution CO observations to constrain the molecular\ngas content, compare with HI data, and examine the SF efficiency of GAMA526784.\nThe potential influence of a newly identified nearby dwarf galaxy is assessed\nusing photometric and spatial information. Results. GAMA526784 exhibits a\nregular HI reservoir (M_HI/M* = 2.88) but only upper limits on its molecular\ngas mass (M_H2(5sigma)/M* < 0.23). The HI reservoir and CO non-detection can be\nexplained by several mechanisms: (1) predominance of CO-dark H2, invisible to\nCO observations but contributing to SF; (2) a time delay in HI-to-H2 conversion\nfollowing a recent interaction; or (3) elevated turbulence inhibiting gas\ncollapse. An identified companion, found at a projected distance of 48 kpc,\nshows similar colours and lies in the direction of young star clusters in\nGAMA526784, indicating a possible association. We hypothesise this companion\nmay have triggered the formation of star clusters in GAMA526784 through a\nhigh-velocity encounter. Conclusions. Our findings suggest GAMA526784 may have\nundergone an interaction that influenced its gas reservoirs and SF activity.\nThe presence of a nearby companion agrees with predictions of a high-speed\nencounter, potentially offering a rare example of such an interaction in\nprogress.

    "abstract": "Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement\nlearning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on\nintermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote\nexploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent\napproach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),\nthe method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic\nassumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep\nReinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM\ndifferences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal\ncaptures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured\nby reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms\nexisting curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster\nconvergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with\ncomparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves\nthe highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results\nindicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the\nstructure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.\nWe provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of\nour main results at https://github.com/Cho-Geonwoo/CP-DRL.",

    "abstract": "Missing data frequently occurs in clinical trials with time-to-event\nendpoints, often due to administrative censoring.

Numerous methods have been proposed to\nconduct sensitivity analyses in these situations, one of which is the tipping\npoint analysis. It aims to evaluate the robustness of trial conclusions by\nvarying certain data and/or model aspects while imputing missing data. We\nprovide an overview of the missing data considerations. The main contribution\nof this paper lies in categorizing and contrasting tipping point methods as two\ngroups, namely model-based and model-free approaches, where the latter is\nunder-emphasized in the literature. We highlight their important differences in\nterms of assumptions, behaviors and interpretations. Through two case studies\nand simulations under various scenarios, we provide insight on how different\ntipping point methods impact the interpretation of trial outcomes. Through\nthese comparisons, we aim to provide a practical guide to conduct tipping point\nanalyses from the choice of methods to ways of conducting clinical plausibility\nassessment, and ultimately contributing to more robust and reliable\ninterpretation of clinical trial results in the presence of missing data for\ntime-to-event endpoints.",

The phases\nare assumed to be isotropic, and perfect contact conditions at the interfaces\nare considered. The effective behavior is determined by combining the\nasymptotic homogenization method with elements of the analytic function theory.\nThe solution to local problems is sought as a series of Weierstrass elliptic\nfunctions and their derivatives with complex undetermined coefficients. The\neffective coefficients depend on the residue of such a solution, which in turn\ndepends on products of vectors and matrices of infinite order. Systematic\ntruncation of these vectors and matrices provides unified analytical formulas\nfor the effective coefficients for any parallelogram periodic cell. The\ncorresponding formulas for the particular cases of two-phase fibrous composites\nwith perfect and imperfect contact at the interface are also explicitly\nprovided. The results were applied to derive the critical normalized\ninterfacial layer thickness and to analyze the enhancement of thermal\nconductivity in fibrous composites with annular cross sections. Furthermore,\nusing a reiterated homogenization method, the analytical approach allows us to\nstudy the gains in the effective thermal conductivity tensor with thermal\nbarriers and parallelogram cells. Numerical examples and comparisons validate\nthe model. A simple and validated algorithm is provided that allows the\ncalculation of effective coefficients for any parallelogram, any truncation\norder, and high fiber volume fractions very close to percolation.

Precise radius measurements are typically derived from the\nfraction of starlight blocked when a planet transits its host star.

As the number\nof rocky exoplanets grows, parallel discussions have emerged on system\narchitectures and Galactic environments that may support life, drawing\ncomparisons to our own Earth. This has brought renewed attention to the concept\nof the Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) as a broader context for interpreting the\ndiversity of planetary environments. This study is the first to use detailed\nchemical evolution models to investigate the impact of stellar migration,\nmodeled through a parametric approach, on the GHZ. Our findings reveal that\nstellar migration significantly enhances the number of stars capable of hosting\nhabitable planets in the outer Galactic regions, with an increase of up to a\nfactor of five at 18 kpc relative to a baseline value of unity at 6 kpc.\nFurthermore, we explore a novel scenario where the presence of gas giant\nplanets increases the probability for the formation of terrestrial ones. We\nfind that this increased probability is higher in the inner Galactic disc, but\nis also mitigated by stellar migration. In particular, at the present time, the\nnumber of FGK stars hosting terrestrial planets with minimum habitability\nconditions in the ring centered at 4 kpc is approximately 1.4 times higher than\nin scenarios where gas giants are assumed to hinder the formation and evolution\nof Earth-like planets. Without stellar migration, this factor increases to 1.5.\nEven larger ratios are predicted for terrestrial planets orbiting retired A\nstars, reaching 2.8 in models with stellar migration and 3.3 in models without\nit.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in neural networks have improved deformable image\nregistration (DIR) by amortizing iterative optimization, enabling fast and\naccurate DIR results. However, learning-based methods often face challenges\nwith limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform\ncompared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While\niterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are\nconsiderably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,\nwe propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines\nthe strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better\nbalance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement\nentropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each\nvoxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it\nintroduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy\nreceives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level\nimage pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential\ncomplexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive\nlearning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature\nextraction.

QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise,\noutperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in\nsmall samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing\npredictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via\ngenetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with\nstandardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively.

    "abstract": "Multiple Operator Integrals (MOIs) have played a foundational role in\noperator theory and functional calculus, particularly for analyzing Hermitian\nmatrices via spectral decomposition. Conventional MOIs rely on the assumption\nof self-adjointness, making them analytically tractable for computing Frechet\nderivatives, establishing trace formulas, and deriving commutator estimates.\nHowever, many problems in mathematics, science, and engineering involve\nmatrices that are fundamentally non-Hermitian, arising in contexts such as\nnumerical discretization of differential operators, signal processing, control\nsystems, and non-Hermitian physics. These cases necessitate a more general\nframework for operator integration. In this paper, we propose and develop the\ntheory of Generalized Multiple Operator Integrals (GMOIs), which extends MOI\ntechniques to arbitrary matrices, including non-Hermitian and non-normal cases.\nWe unify conventional MOIs under the perspective of the Spectral Mapping\nTheorem and present a rigorous construction of Generalized Double Operator\nIntegrals (GDOIs) in finite-dimensional setting via Jordan decomposition of any\nmatrix. We establish key algebraic properties, derive norm estimates, and prove\ncontinuity and Lipschitz-type perturbation formulas.

    "abstract": "Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by\neliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while\nmaintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach\nconflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along\nwith discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant\noperations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP\ndetermines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP\niteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance\ndrop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets\ncan be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according\nto this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency\nthrough: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant\nevaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune\" and ``danger-to-prune\"\noperations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance\ntradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while\nmaintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when\ntransferred across diverse VLMs and tasks.

The classical\nRayleigh-Plateau instability concerns liquid jets governed by inertia and\nsurface tension, whereas biological tubes are membrane-bounded and\ninertia-free. We therefore refer to the process observed here as a pearling\ninstability, formally analogous to Rayleigh-Plateau but dominated by membrane\nmechanics. Although pearling-type instabilities have long been recognised in\nlipid tubes and some biological systems, a clear physiological example remained\nelusive. Here, we present results showing that pearling instability occurs\nduring the physiological process of platelet formation. Platelets are formed\nfrom megakaryocytes in the bone marrow by the extension of long protrusions,\ncalled proplatelets, that traverse the blood vessels. As they extend in the\nbloodstream, proplatelets become pearled and detach. Long and pearled\nproplatelets then circulate in the peripheral blood before their fragmentation\ninto calibrated platelets. We propose that this pearling, by creating regular\nconstrictions along the proplatelet, is key to the process of proplatelet\nfragmentation into individual platelets of calibrated size. Pearling\ninstability thus acts as a mechanobiological regulator allowing local delivery\nof the right size platelets to the right place at the right time.

The established method of\nAdaptive Importance Sampling, as implemented in tools like VEGAS, uses a\ngrid-based approach that is iteratively refined in a separable way, per\ndimension. This separable approach efficiently suppresses the exponentially\ngrowing grid-handling computational cost, but also introduces performance\ndrawbacks whenever strong inter-variable correlations are present. To utilize\nsampling resources more efficiently, QAIS exploits the exponentially large\nHilbert space of a Parameterised Quantum Circuit (PQC) to manipulate a\nnon-separable Probability Density Function (PDF) defined on a multidimensional\ngrid. In this setting, entanglement within the PQC captures the correlations\nand intricacies of the target integrand's structure.

We update the forward asteroseismic modelling\nof HD 192575 based on new TESS observations. We invert for the rotation profile\nfrom the symmetric part of the splittings, and compute the multiplet\nasymmetries due to the Coriolis force and stellar deformation treated\nperturbatively. We compare the computed asymmetries with the observed\nasymmetries. Our new forward asteroseismic modelling is in agreement with\nprevious results, but with increased uncertainties, partially due to increased\nfrequency precision, requiring us to relax certain constraints. Ambiguity in\nthe mode identification is the main source of the uncertainty, which also\naffects the inferred rotation profiles. Almost all acceptable rotation profiles\noccur in the regime below 0.4/d and favour weak radial differential rotation,\nwith a ratio of core and envelope rotation below two. We find that the quality\nof the match between the observed and theoretically predicted mode asymmetries\nis strongly dependent on the mode identification and the internal structure of\nthe star. Our results offer the first detailed rotation inversion for a $\\beta$\nCep pulsator. They show that the rotation profile and the mode asymmetries\nprovide a valuable tool to further constrain the evolutionary properties of HD\n192575, and in particular the details of angular momentum transport in massive\nstars.",

    "abstract": "Channel hopping (CS) communication systems must adapt to interference changes\nin the wireless network and to node mobility for maintaining throughput\nefficiency. Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information\n(i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in\ninterference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant\ncommunication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale,\nthereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks.\nIn this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on\na learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP\nattention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral,\nspatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a\nself-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS\npattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel\noccupancy state within that region. Notably, the prediction relies only on\nlocally and passively observed channel activities, and thus introduces no\ncommunication overhead. To deal with node mobility, MiLAAP also uses a\nmulti-head self-attention mechanism that lets each node locally capture the\nspatiotemporal dependencies on other network nodes that can interfere with it\nand accordingly predict the motion trajectory of those nodes. Detecting nodes\nthat enter or move outside the interference region is used to further improve\nthe prediction accuracy of channel occupancy. We show that for dynamic networks\nthat use local CS sequences to support relatively long-lived flow traffics, the\nchannel state prediction accuracy of MiLAAP is remarkably ~100% across\ndifferent node mobility patterns and it achieves zero-shot generalizability\nacross different periods of CS sequences.",

A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their\ntypical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs\nhave largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling\nparadigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as\nit's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm\nitself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a\ndecoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or\nAO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard\nAO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from\nrefinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the\nlanguage's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural\ninfluences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that\nwhile encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,\ndecoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\\sim25\\times$) and\ncomparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly\nlarger space, highlighting key trade-offs.

These systems manage issues related to complexity,\ndimensionality, and performance. This research aims to propose a Hybrid\nIntrusion Detection System (HyIDS) that identifies and mitigates initial\nthreats. The main innovation of this research is the introduction of a new\nmethod for hybrid intrusion detection systems (HyIDS). For this purpose, an\nEnergy-Valley Optimizer (EVO) is used to select an optimal feature set, which\nis then classified using supervised machine learning models. The proposed\napproach is evaluated using the CIC_DDoS2019, CSE_CIC_DDoS2018, and NSL-KDD\ndatasets. For evaluation and testing, the proposed system has been run for a\ntotal of 32 times. The results of the proposed approach are compared with the\nGrey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). With the CIC_DDoS2019 dataset, the D_TreeEVO model\nachieves an accuracy of 99.13% and a detection rate of 98.941%. Furthermore,\nthis result reaches 99.78% for the CSE_CIC_DDoS2018 dataset. In comparison to\nNSL-KDD, it has an accuracy of 99.50% and a detection rate (DT) of 99.48%. For\nfeature selection, EVO outperforms GWO. The results of this research indicate\nthat EVO yields better results as an optimizer for HyIDS performance.",

    "abstract": "We present the first high-precision proper motion catalog, tied to the\nInternational Celestial Reference System (ICRS), of infrared astrometric\nreference stars within R $\\leq$ 25\" (1 pc) of the central supermassive black\nhole at the Galactic center (GC). This catalog contains $\\sim$2,900 sources in\na highly extinguished region that is inaccessible via Gaia. New astrometric\nmeasurements are extracted from HST observations (14 epochs, 2010 - 2023) and\ntransformed into the ICRS using 40 stars in common with Gaia-DR3. We implement\na new method for modeling proper motions via Gaussian Processes that accounts\nfor systematic errors, greatly improving measurement accuracy. Proper motion\nand position measurements reach precisions of $\\sim$0.03 mas/yr and $\\sim$0.11\nmas, respectively, representing a factor of $\\sim$20x improvement over previous\nICRS proper motion catalogs in the region. These measurements define a novel\nHST-Gaia reference frame that is consistent with Gaia-CRF3 to within 0.025\nmas/yr in proper motion and 0.044 mas in position, making it the first\nICRS-based reference frame precise enough to probe the distribution of extended\nmass within the orbits of stars near SgrA*. In addition, HST-Gaia provides an\nindependent test of the radio measurements of stellar masers that form the\nbasis of current GC reference frames. We find that the HST-Gaia and radio\nmeasurements are consistent to within 0.041 mas/yr in proper motion and 0.54\nmas in position at 99.7% confidence. Gaia-DR4 is expected to reduce the\nHST-Gaia reference frame uncertainties by another factor of $\\sim$2x, further\nimproving the reference frame for dynamical studies.",

    "abstract": "The young M-star TWA 7 hosts a bright and near face-on debris disk, which has\nbeen imaged from the optical to the submillimeter. The disk displays multiple\ncomplex substructures such as three disk components, a large dust clump, and\nspiral arms, suggesting the presence of planets to actively sculpt these\nfeatures. The evidence for planets in this disk was further strengthened with\nthe recent detection of a point-source compatible with a Saturn-mass planet\ncompanion using JWST/MIRI at 11 $\\mu$m, at the location a planet was predicted\nto reside based on the disk morphology. In this paper, we present new\nobservations of the TWA 7 system with JWST/NIRCam in the F200W and F444W\nfilters. The disk is detected at both wavelengths and presents many of the same\nsubstructures as previously imaged, although we do not robustly detect the\nsouthern spiral arm. Furthermore, we detect two faint potential companions in\nthe F444W filter at the 2-3$\\sigma$ level. While one of these companions needs\nfurther followup to determine its nature, the other one coincides with the\nlocation of the planet candidate imaged with MIRI, providing further evidence\nthat this source is a sub-Jupiter mass planet companion rather than a\nbackground galaxy.

Using far-ultraviolet and optical\nspectroscopy, we have analysed the composition of planetesimals accreted by\nthree metal enriched H-dominated white dwarfs with effective temperatures of\nT_eff = 20 000 K. WD 0059+257 is accreting an object composed of 71.8 +/- 7.9\nper cent Fe and Ni by mass, indicating a large core mass fraction of 69 per\ncent, similar to that of Mercury. We model this planetesimal as having a\ndifferentiated Earth-like composition with 65 per cent of its mantle stripped,\nand we find this mass loss can be caused by vaporisation of the planetesimal's\nmantle during post-main sequence evolution. The tentative S detection in WD\n0059+257 is a possible clue to the nature of the light element in planetary\ncores, including that of the Earth. The volatile-rich composition of WD\n1943+163 is consistent with accretion of a carbonaceous chondrite-like object,\nbut with an extreme Si depletion. WD 1953-715 accretes a planetesimal which\ncontains 64 +/- 21 per cent of O in the form of ices, likely H2O. This body\ntherefore requires an initial orbit at formation beyond a radial distance of >\n100 au for ice survival into the white dwarf phase. These three planetary\nenriched white dwarfs provide evidence of differing core fractions, volatile\nbudgets, and initial orbital separations of the accreted planetesimals, all of\nwhich help us understand their formation and evolutionary history.",

We conclude that Polymele and the other high albedo\nJupiter Trojans represent a third class of Jupiter Trojans not represented in\nthe more heavily-studied larger objects and are perhaps the products of recent\ndisruptions. The Lucy flyby of Polymele in September 2027 will give a direct\nview of one of this new class of Jupiter Trojans.",

Based on the wavelength shifts of\nthese bands, we find four separate types of trapped CO$_2$ on the satellites.\nOn the inner satellites, CO$_2$ appears trapped in amorphous ice sourced from\nSaturn's E-ring, and a second component of CO$_2$ is associated with the dark\nmaterial most prominent on the trailing hemispheres of Dione and Rhea. On the\nouter satellites, CO$_2$ appears to be produced by irradiation of organics on\nPhoebe, which are then transported to the dark leading hemisphere of Iapetus\nand onto the dark regions of Hyperion. CO$_2$ is also trapped by water ice on\nthe trailing hemisphere of Iapetus and on Hyperion. These observations point to\nthe continued need for laboratory studies to better understand the sources and\ntrapping mechanisms of CO$_2$ throughout the outer solar system.",

Recent work has advanced a\nglobal, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the\nresulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we\nperform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this\nlinear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In\nparticular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for\nwhich the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We\nfind remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology\nacross a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake\nmorphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal\nphenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local aspect ratio. In\ncontrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable\ndiscrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which\nexplore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures.\nOur simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced\nangular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear\nvariations with eccentricity.

The most familiar\nexamples of such structures associated to an ordinary symmetry are the\nBagger-Witten line bundles, which arise over the moduli spaces of\ntwo-dimensional N=(2,2) SCFTs from a non-anomalous worldsheet U(1)_R symmetry\nand its associated spectral flow operators. Generalizing this setting, we\nconsider examples involving anomalous worldsheet symmetries, which, despite not\nbeing gaugeable, can still give rise to global structures over moduli space --\nas illustrated by the momentum/winding symmetries in toroidal compactifications\nand higher group gauge symmetry structure in spacetime. Motivated by this\nanalogy, we conjecture the existence of a stack of fusion categories over\nmoduli spaces of G_2 and Spin(7) holonomy manifolds which acts as a\nnoninvertible analogue of the Hodge or Bagger-Witten line bundles over\nCalabi-Yau moduli spaces. This proposal is based on the observation that SCFTs\nassociated with such exceptional holonomy manifolds contain (tricritical) Ising\nsectors that play a role analogous to the U(1)_R symmetry in N=2 theories.\nAlthough these symmetries are not gaugeable, they behave similarly to anomalous\ninvertible symmetries, providing the conceptual foundation for the proposed\nmoduli space structure.",

These sources, with extremely faint\nsurface brightness ($\\mu$Jy/arcsec$^2$ level), are not tied to individual\ngalaxies but trace synchrotron emission from large-scale magnetic fields and\nrelativistic particles within the intracluster environment. Here, we report the\ndiscovery of a candidate radio mini-halo in SpARCS104922.6+564032.5, the most\ndistant cool-core galaxy cluster identified to date at $z=1.709$, using deep\nLOFAR 120-168 MHz observations. We show that this emission originates from\ndiffuse cluster-associated processes rather than unresolved AGN or star-forming\ngalaxies. The diffuse radio emission coincides spatially with the X-ray\nemission of the hot intracluster medium and has a radio power of $P_{\\rm\n150~MHz}=49.8^{+14.7}_{-11.7} \\times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, exhibiting striking\nsimilarities to low-redshift radio mini-halos. This discovery doubles the\nredshift of previously known mini-halos, challenging models of inverse Compton\nlosses and indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields, enhanced\nturbulence in high-redshift clusters, or active hadronic processes that require\na cosmic ray-to-thermal energy ratio of 0.07 within 200 kpc, assuming a clumped\ndistribution with spatial correlations among the gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic\nfield that partially compensate for cosmological redshift dimming. It further\nimplies that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified to $\\sim$$10~\\mu$G\nlevels within a Mpc$^3$ volume during the epoch of cluster formation before\n$z\\sim2$.

    "abstract": "This paper presents ScaleCap, an inference-time scalable image captioning\nstrategy that generates comprehensive and detailed image captions. The key\nchallenges of high-quality image captioning lie in the inherent biases of\nLVLMs: multimodal bias resulting in imbalanced descriptive granularity,\noffering detailed accounts of some elements while merely skimming over others;\nlinguistic bias leading to hallucinated descriptions of non-existent objects.\nTo address these issues, we propose a scalable debiased captioning strategy,\nwhich continuously enriches and calibrates the caption with increased inference\nbudget. Specifically, we propose two novel components: heuristic question\nanswering and contrastive sentence rating. The former generates\ncontent-specific questions based on the image and answers them to progressively\ninject relevant information into the caption. The latter employs sentence-level\noffline contrastive decoding to effectively identify and eliminate\nhallucinations caused by linguistic biases. With increased inference cost, more\nheuristic questions are raised by ScaleCap to progressively capture additional\nvisual details, generating captions that are more accurate, balanced, and\ninformative. Extensive modality alignment experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of ScaleCap. Annotating 450K images with ScaleCap and using them\nfor LVLM pretraining leads to consistent performance gains across 11 widely\nused benchmarks. Furthermore, ScaleCap showcases superb richness and fidelity\nof generated captions with two additional tasks: replacing images with captions\nin VQA task, and reconstructing images from captions to assess semantic\ncoverage.

In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL\ncalled JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively\nrefining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves\nholistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.\nSpecifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on\nthe behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO\nsampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal\nbenefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with\nmaximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve\ntraining stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter\nadjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution\nmechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to\neliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence.

The leader predicts Gaussian\nSplatting deformation caused by motions of the stabilizing arm, through which\nthe follower generates the physical consequences resulted from the movement of\nthe acting arm.

However, existing solutions face\nseveral challenges in using these models to generate long movie-like videos\nwith rich human-object interactions that include unrealistic human-scene\ninteraction, lack of subject identity preservation, and require expensive\ntraining. We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation\nof long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie\nanimation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by\nsubdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script\nwriting, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a\nuser description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to\ngenerate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene\ninteractions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic\ntasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes\n(storyboards). These 3D keyframes are rendered and animated by off-the-shelf\nvideo diffusion models for consistent long video generation with rich contacts\nin a 3D-aware manner. A key advantage of our work is that we alleviate the need\nfor scanned, accurate scenes and create 3D keyframes from single-view images.\nWe are the first to generate a long video sequence with a consistent camera\npose that contains arbitrary numbers of character actions without training.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method can generate long videos that\neffectively preserve scene content and character identity with plausible\nhuman-scene interaction from a single image scene.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased\ntheir powerful reasoning and diagnostic capabilities. Despite their success,\ncurrent unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update\ncosts, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis\n(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role\nassignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical\ndiagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist\nTeam, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an\nLLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient\nknowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.\nExtensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly\naccessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and\nvideo modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance\nof modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance\nimprovements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

    "abstract": "Sampling low-energy molecular conformations, spatial arrangements of atoms in\na molecule, is a critical task for many different calculations performed in the\ndrug discovery and optimization process. Numerous specialized equivariant\nnetworks have been designed to generate molecular conformations from 2D\nmolecular graphs. Recently, non-equivariant transformer models have emerged as\na viable alternative due to their capability to scale to improve\ngeneralization. However, the concern has been that non-equivariant models\nrequire a large model size to compensate the lack of equivariant bias. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that a well-chosen positional encoding effectively\naddresses these size limitations. A standard transformer model incorporating\nrelative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million\nparameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model\nwith 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative\npositional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with\nthe shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different\nattention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional\nencoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to\nserve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular\nconformations.",

Despite its critical importance, the\nclassification of communal violent text remains an underexplored area in\nexisting research. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of detecting text\nthat incites communal violence, focusing specifically on Bengali textual data\nsourced from social media platforms. We introduce a fine-tuned BanglaBERT model\ntailored for this task, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.60. To address the\nissue of data imbalance, our dataset was expanded by adding 1,794 instances,\nwhich facilitated the development and evaluation of a fine-tuned ensemble\nmodel. This ensemble model demonstrated an improved performance, achieving a\nmacro F1 score of 0.63, thus highlighting its effectiveness in this domain. In\naddition to quantitative performance metrics, qualitative analysis revealed\ninstances where the models struggled with context understanding, leading to\noccasional misclassifications, even when predictions were made with high\nconfidence. Through analyzing the cosine similarity between words, we\nidentified certain limitations in the pre-trained BanglaBERT models,\nparticularly in their ability to distinguish between closely related communal\nand non-communal terms. To further interpret the model's decisions, we applied\nLIME, which helped to uncover specific areas where the model struggled in\nunderstanding context, contributing to errors in classification.

    "abstract": "Reasoning models excel by generating long chain-of-thoughts, but decoding the\nresulting thousands of tokens is slow. Token-level speculative decoding (SD)\nhelps, but its benefit is capped, because the chance that an entire\n$\\gamma$-token guess is correct falls exponentially as $\\gamma$ grows. This\nmeans allocating more compute for longer token drafts faces an algorithmic\nceiling -- making the speedup modest and hardware-agnostic. We raise this\nceiling with Lookahead Reasoning, which exploits a second, step-level layer of\nparallelism. Our key insight is that reasoning models generate step-by-step,\nand each step needs only to be semantically correct, not exact token matching.\nIn Lookahead Reasoning, a lightweight draft model proposes several future\nsteps; the target model expands each proposal in one batched pass, and a\nverifier keeps semantically correct steps while letting the target regenerate\nany that fail. Token-level SD still operates within each reasoning step, so the\ntwo layers of parallelism multiply. We show Lookahead Reasoning lifts the peak\nspeedup of SD both theoretically and empirically. Across GSM8K, AIME, and other\nbenchmarks, Lookahead Reasoning improves the speedup of SD from 1.4x to 2.1x\nwhile preserving answer quality, and its speedup scales better with additional\nGPU throughput.

Semiconductor quantum dot\n(QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable\nenergy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single\nphotons.

We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to\nmaximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon\ncoupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons\ncoherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable\nelectrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion.\nMoreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition\nenergy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system\nefficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz.

In this work, we present a\nunified framework grounded in mathematical optimization to address matrix\nseriation from a rigorous, model-based perspective. Our approach leverages\ncombinatorial and mixed-integer optimization to represent seriation objectives\nand constraints with high fidelity, bridging the gap between traditional\nheuristic methods and exact solution techniques.\n  We introduce new mathematical programming models for neighborhood-based\nstress criteria, including nonlinear formulations and their linearized\ncounterparts. For structured settings such as Moore and von Neumann\nneighborhoods, we develop a novel Hamiltonian path-based reformulation that\nenables effective control over spatial arrangement and interpretability in the\nreordered matrix.\n  To assess the practical impact of our models, we carry out an extensive set\nof experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, as well as on a newly\ncurated benchmark based on a coauthorship network from the matrix seriation\nliterature. Our results show that these optimization-based formulations not\nonly enhance solution quality and interpretability but also provide a versatile\nfoundation for extending matrix seriation to new domains in data science.",

To do so, we\nexploited Kepler/K2 and TESS data in combination with ground-based\nobservations, serving as a preparation for the PLATO mission. This endeavour\nled to the discovery and statistical validation of four planets, the\nconfirmation and characterisation of two other planets, the detection of 14 new\nplanet candidates, and the revision of the properties of 25 previously reported\nplanets. Among them, we find TOI-244 b to be a super-Earth with a density below\nwhat would be expected for an Earth-like composition, and we thus refer to\nTOI-244 b as a low-density super-Earth (LDSE). We also confirm the transiting\nsuper-Neptune TOI-5005 b. In this system, we find photometric variability that\nmatches the planetary orbital period, suggesting the existence of magnetic\nstar-planet interactions (MSPIs). We also detect similar synchronised signals\nin the eccentric HD 118203 system, which appear and disappear across different\norbits, in agreement with the well-known 'on/off' nature of MSPIs. At a\npopulation level, we find that LDSEs tend to be hosted by stars with subsolar\nmetallicities and that the lowest dense LDSEs tend to receive low insolation\nfluxes. We also identify an over-density of Neptunian planets in orbits\ncorresponding to periods between ~3.2 and 5.7 days, which we refer to as the\nNeptunian 'ridge'. The 'ridge', coinciding with the orbital range of the hot\nJupiter pileup, suggests a common path in the evolution of the closest giant\nplanets. The low-insolation trend of LDSEs suggests that the largest fraction\nof volatile elements in these planets is directly exposed to the received\nirradiation from their host stars. Solving these two problems will greatly\ncontribute to completing the full picture of the evolution of planetary\nsystems.",

However, they remain constrained by a single-frame\nobservation paradigm and cannot fully benefit from the motion information\noffered by aggregated multi-frame historical observations, as the large\nvision-language backbone introduces substantial computational cost and\ninference latency. We propose CronusVLA, a unified framework that extends\nsingle-frame VLA models to the multi-frame paradigm through an efficient\npost-training stage. CronusVLA comprises three key components: (1) single-frame\npretraining on large-scale embodied datasets with autoregressive action tokens\nprediction, which establishes an embodied vision-language foundation; (2)\nmulti-frame encoding, adapting the prediction of vision-language backbones from\ndiscrete action tokens to motion features during post-training, and aggregating\nmotion features from historical frames into a feature chunking; (3) cross-frame\ndecoding, which maps the feature chunking to accurate actions via a shared\ndecoder with cross-attention. By reducing redundant token computation and\ncaching past motion features, CronusVLA achieves efficient inference. As an\napplication of motion features, we further propose an action adaptation\nmechanism based on feature-action retrieval to improve model performance during\nfinetuning.

There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these\nartworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or\nconstructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a\ntotal of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset\nof artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions\nwhich have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar\ncuratorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions\nat the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data\navailable and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four\nartificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these\nvarious curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of\nprecision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key\ninsights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to\nconstruct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions\nwith an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature\nengineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can\nmake them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as\nGPT in a brute force approach.

We perform a forecast to\ndetermine the number of harmonic multipoles required to capture the full\ninformation content of the 3PCF in the context of galaxy weak lensing, finding\nthat only the first few multipoles are sufficient to capture the additional\ncosmological information provided by the 3PCF. This study addresses a critical\npractical question: to what extent can the high-dimensional 3PCF signal be\ncompressed without significant loss of cosmological information? Since the\ndifferent multipoles contain highly redundant information, we apply a principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) which further reduces its dimensionality and\npreserving information. We also account for non-linear parameter degeneracies\nusing the DALI method, an extension of Fisher forecasting that includes\nhigher-order likelihood information. Under optimistic settings, we find that\nthe 3PCF considerably improves the constraining power of the 2PCF for\n$\\Omega_m$, reaching a 20% improvement. Other parameters also benefit, mainly\ndue to their degeneracy with the matter abundance. For example, with our chosen\nscale cuts for galaxy sources at $z = 0.5$, we find that $\\sigma_8$ is more\ntightly constrained, whereas $S_8$ and $w_0$ are not.

However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL\nachieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving\npatients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac\nfunction parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.

KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by\nintegrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL\ntraining process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL\nguides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality\nreward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping\nthem recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during\nRL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning\nstrategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning\nsteps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on\nthree hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets\ndemonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking\nmodels while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities.

    "abstract": "This position paper argues that large language model (LLM)-based social\nsimulations should establish clear boundaries to meaningfully contribute to\nsocial science research. While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling\nhuman-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face\nfundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern\ndiscovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''\nthat lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for\nsimulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:\nalignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency\n(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness\n(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for\ndetermining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science\nunderstanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when\nfocusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)\nagent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited\nvariance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation\nrobustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in\ndetermining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.",

Prior studies have largely relied on homogeneous datasets,\nwhich artificially inflate performance scores and offer a false sense of\nsecurity. Designing systems that can effectively detect a wide range of attack\nvariants remains a significant challenge. The progress of ML-NIDS continues to\ndepend heavily on human expertise, which can embed subjective judgments of\nsystem designers into the model, potentially hindering its ability to\ngeneralize across diverse attack types.\n  To address this gap, we propose KnowML, a framework for knowledge-guided\nmachine learning that integrates attack knowledge into ML-NIDS. KnowML\nsystematically explores the threat landscape by leveraging Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to perform automated analysis of attack implementations. It\nconstructs a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) of attack strategies, on which it\napplies symbolic reasoning to generate KG-Augmented Input, embedding domain\nknowledge directly into the design process of ML-NIDS.\n  We evaluate KnowML on 28 realistic attack variants, of which 10 are newly\ncollected for this study. Our findings reveal that baseline ML-NIDS models fail\nto detect several variants entirely, achieving F1 scores as low as 0 %.

    "abstract": "Random disturbances such as air pollution may affect cognitive performance,\nwhich, particularly in high-stakes settings, may have severe consequences for\nan individual's productivity and well-being. This paper examines the short-term\neffects of air pollution on school leaving exam results in Poland. I exploit\nrandom variation in air pollution between the days on which exams are held\nacross three consecutive school years. I aim to capture this random variation\nby including school and time fixed effects. The school-level panel data is\ndrawn from a governmental program where air pollution is continuously measured\nin the schoolyard. This localized hourly air pollution measure is a unique\nfeature of my study, which increases the precision of the estimated effects. In\naddition, using distant and aggregated air pollution measures allows me for the\ncomparison of the estimates in space and time. The findings suggest that a one\nstandard deviation increase in the concentration of particulate matter PM2.5\nand PM10 decreases students' exam scores by around 0.07-0.08 standard\ndeviations. The magnitude and significance of these results depend on the\nlocation and timing of the air pollution readings, indicating the importance of\nthe localized air pollution measure and the distinction between contemporaneous\nand lingering effects. Further, air pollution effects gradually increase in\nline with the quantiles of the exam score distribution, suggesting that\nhigh-ability students are more affected by the random disturbances caused by\nair pollution.",

    "abstract": "The function and dynamics of the cortex are fundamentally shaped by the\nspecific wiring configurations of its constituent axonal fibers, also known as\nthe connectome. However, many dynamical properties of macroscale cortical\nactivity are well captured by instead describing the activity as propagating\nwaves across the cortical surface, constrained only by the surface's\ntwo-dimensional geometry. It thus remains an open question why the local\ngeometry of the cortex can successfully capture macroscale cortical dynamics,\ndespite neglecting the specificity of Fast-conducting, Non-local Projections\n(FNPs) which are known to mediate the rapid and non-local propagation of\nactivity between remote neural populations. Here we address this question by\ndeveloping a novel mathematical model of macroscale cortical activity in which\ncortical populations interact both by a continuous sheet and by an additional\nset of FNPs wired independently of the sheet's geometry. By simulating the\nmodel across a range of connectome topologies, external inputs, and timescales,\nwe demonstrate that the addition of FNPs strongly shape the model dynamics of\nrapid, stimulus-evoked responses on fine millisecond timescales ($\\lessapprox\n30~\\text{ms}$), but contribute relatively little to slower, spontaneous\nfluctuations over longer timescales ($> 30~\\text{ms}$), which increasingly\nresemble geometrically constrained dynamics without FNPs. Our results suggest\nthat the discrepant views regarding the relative contributions of local\n(geometric) and non-local (connectomic) cortico-cortical interactions are\ncontext-dependent: While FNPs specified by the connectome are needed to capture\nrapid communication between specific distant populations (as per the rapid\nprocessing of sensory inputs), they play a relatively minor role in shaping\nslower spontaneous fluctuations (as per resting-state functional magnetic\nresonance imaging).",

To address\nthese constraints, we propose a framework (dubbed as CoCo4D) for generating\ndetailed dynamic 4D scenes from text prompts, with the option to include\nimages. Our method leverages the crucial observation that articulated motion\ntypically characterizes foreground objects, whereas background alterations are\nless pronounced. Consequently, CoCo4D divides 4D scene synthesis into two\nresponsibilities: modeling the dynamic foreground and creating the evolving\nbackground, both directed by a reference motion sequence. Given a text prompt\nand an optional reference image, CoCo4D first generates an initial motion\nsequence utilizing video diffusion models. This motion sequence then guides the\nsynthesis of both the dynamic foreground object and the background using a\nnovel progressive outpainting scheme. To ensure seamless integration of the\nmoving foreground object within the dynamic background, CoCo4D optimizes a\nparametric trajectory for the foreground, resulting in realistic and coherent\nblending. Extensive experiments show that CoCo4D achieves comparable or\nsuperior performance in 4D scene generation compared to existing methods,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.

By\nextending classical theorems such as the Karp-Lipton theorem to quantum\nsettings and analyzing uniqueness in quantum-classical PCPs, we clarify how\nvarious constraints influence computational power.\n  Our main contributions are:\n  (1) We show that restricting quantum-classical PCPs to unique proofs does not\nreduce their power: $\\mathsf{UniqueQCPCP} = \\mathsf{QCPCP}$ under\n$\\mathsf{BQ}$-operator and randomized reductions. This parallels the known\n$\\mathsf{UniqueQCMA} = \\mathsf{QCMA}$ result, indicating robustness of\nuniqueness even in quantum PCP-type systems.\n  (2) We prove a non-uniform quantum analogue of the Karp-Lipton theorem: if\n$\\mathsf{QMA} \\subseteq \\mathsf{BQP}/\\mathsf{qpoly}$, then $\\mathsf{QPH}\n\\subseteq \\mathsf{Q\\Sigma}_2/\\mathsf{qpoly}$. This conditional collapse\nsuggests limits on quantum advice for $\\mathsf{QMA}$-complete problems.\n  (3) We define a bounded-entanglement version of the quantum polynomial\nhierarchy, $\\mathsf{BEQPH}$, and prove that it collapses above the fourth\nlevel. We also introduce the separable hierarchy $\\mathsf{SepQPH}$ (zero\nentanglement), for which the same collapse result holds. These collapses stem\nnot from entanglement, as in prior work, but from the convex structure of the\nprotocols, which renders higher levels tractable.\n  Collectively, these results offer new insights into the structure of quantum\nproof systems and the role of entanglement, uniqueness, and advice in defining\ntheir complexity.",

It has been shown to result in significant mass loss and disc truncation,\nultimately reducing the lifetime of the discs, and possibly affecting potential\nplanet populations. It is a well-studied process in the Orion Nebula Cluster\n(ONC) where the cometary morphology of proplyds is spatially resolvable due to\nits proximity to Earth. However, we need to study external photoevaporation in\nadditional stellar clusters to better understand its prevalence and\nsignificance more globally. Unfortunately, more massive stellar clusters where\nthe majority of stars form are much farther away than the ONC. In these more\ndistant clusters the proplyds are spatially unresolvable with current\nfacilities, hence the cometary morphology is not a useful identification of\nexternal photoevaporation. Therefore, in order to identify and interpret\nexternal photoevaporation, the only observations we have are of spatially\nunresolved emission lines. To resolve this issue we have used the CLOUDY code\nto develop an approximate general model of the emission lines emanating from\nthe hot ionized wind of a proplyd. We have used the model to determine which\nline ratios are most sensitive to the distance from an OB star, and found that\nthe most sensitive line ratios vary by multiple orders of magnitude over an FUV\nfield of between 10$^3$ G$_0$ to 10$^6$ G$_0$.

Beginning with\nVoevodsky's crisis of confidence, where a major result remained in limbo for 24\nyears, neither proven nor refuted, we argue that mathematics is not the\ndiscovery of eternal truths but theory-building in response to computational\nexperiments. Just as physicists build theories to explain patterns in physical\nmeasurements, mathematicians build axiomatic frameworks to explain patterns\nobserved through calculation and proof. In this view, mathematical truth is not\nabout correspondence to platonic reality but about successful prediction of\ncomputational outcomes; contradictions indicate failed theories rather than\nlogical impossibilities. This framework dissolves longstanding puzzles: it\nexplains why intuition often outpaces rigor, why multiple frameworks are often\nnecessary to capture the same phenomena (pluralism), and why mathematics is\n\"unreasonably effective\" in physics. Understanding mathematics as an\nexperimental science illuminates both its power and its limits, suggesting that\nconsistency in use, rather than deduction from axioms, is the true marker of\nmathematical understanding.",

We developed a new method to indirectly measure the size of\nsmall droplets using off-the-shelf <\\$1 electret microphones. In this method we\nexploit the natural oscillations that small droplets undergo after impacting a\nflat surface: by allowing droplets to land directly on a microphone diaphragm,\nwe record the impact force they exert onto it and calculate the complex\nresonant frequencies of oscillations, from which their size can be inferred. To\ntest this method, we recorded the impact signals of droplets of varying sizes\nand extracted the resonant frequencies that characterize each signal. Various\nsources of uncertainty in the experiments led to a range of frequencies that\ncan characterize each droplet size, and hence a data-driven approach was taken\nto estimate the size from each set of measured frequencies. We employed a\nsimple setting of neural network and trained it on the frequencies we measured\nfrom impact of droplets of prescribed radius.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\nsimplifies the process by treating alignment as a classification task over\nbinary preference pairs, reducing training overhead while achieving competitive\nperformance.

During inference, lambda\ncan be adjusted without retraining, providing controllable alignment behavior\nfor downstream use.

In the real\nworld, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with\nthe same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same\npatterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation\npreference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.\nDiffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great\nsuccess in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and\nrepresent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of\nadaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,\nwe use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the\ndiversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model\nbased on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the\noriginal distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition\nmodel, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse\nreconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is\ncompleted by injecting multi-interests representational information that\neliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In\nthe inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition\nby using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to\nreconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments\non three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on\naccuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes\nthe degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.",

Recent work in NLP tasks (e.g. autonomy\ngeneration) uses automatic prompt optimization/engineering to address this\nchallenge by generating optimal or near-optimal task-specific prompts given\ninput-output examples.\n  This empirical study explores the application of automatic prompt\noptimization for the triple extraction task using experimental benchmarking.

    "abstract": "We make a methodological contribution by introducing a new dimension of\ntraffic conflict severity: the probability that a driver is in a defensive\nstate. This behavioural probability reflects an internal response to perceived\nrisk and is estimated using a latent class Discrete Choice Model (DCM) that\ncaptures driver behaviour as a probabilistic mixture of two latent driving\nstates: a defensive state, representing heightened caution and\ncollision-avoidance intentions under perceived risk, and a neutral state,\nreflecting routine driving behaviour under low-threat conditions. The framework\nis grounded in psychological theory, particularly the triad of affect,\nbehaviour, and cognition. It is also informed by two key concepts. First, that\nevent severity exists on a continuum, rather than being confined to binary\ncategories of safe or unsafe. Second, that drivers perceive risk through a\ndynamic spatial safety field, one that varies with direction, proximity, and\nthe motion of surrounding road users. Applied to the publicly available rounD\ndataset, the framework yields interpretable estimates of state membership\nprobabilities. The defensive state consistently reflects stronger sensitivity\nto spatial and temporal risk, while the neutral state captures\ncontext-appropriate yet less reactive driving patterns. Importantly, the paper\nalso proposes a method to assess the quality of the estimated probability of\nbeing in a defensive state. Because of the duality between the defensive and\nneutral states, evaluating the consistency of one offers insights into the\nreliability of the other. To explore this, a multi-step validation procedure is\napplied across five data subsets representing different driving contexts,\nincluding free-flow and diverging scenarios, to examine how well the neutral\nstate generalises beyond the estimation sample.",

This addresses a\nBoussinesq version of a question by Agrachev and provides a first example of\nfluid PDEs controllable in that sense. In particular, we add in this context to\nresults obtained for the Navier-Stokes system by Agrachev-Sarychev (Comm.

The temperature is then\ncontrolled by using Coron's return method, while the velocity is mainly driven\nby the buoyant force.\n  When $\\omega$ contains two cuts of the torus and a closed square of\nside-length $L$, our approach yields explicit control spaces for the velocity\nand temperature of dimensions $2 + 18\\lceil2\\pi/L\\rceil^2 +\n8\\lceil2\\pi/L\\rceil^4$ and $2 + 8\\lceil2\\pi/L\\rceil^2$, respectively.",

In dense areas with many active RAN\nnodes, compute resources are engineered to support potentially hundreds of\nxApps monitoring and controlling the RAN to achieve operator's intents.\nHowever, such resources might become underutilized during low-traffic periods,\nwhere most cells are sleeping and, given the reduced RAN complexity, only a few\nxApps are needed for its control. In this paper, we propose CORMO-RAN, a\ndata-driven orchestrator that dynamically activates compute nodes based on xApp\nload to save energy, and performs lossless migration of xApps from nodes to be\nturned off to active ones while ensuring xApp availability during migration.\nCORMO-RAN tackles the trade-off among service availability, scalability, and\nenergy consumption while (i) preserving xApps' internal state to prevent RAN\nperformance degradation during migration; (ii) accounting for xApp diversity in\nstate size and timing constraints; and (iii) implementing several migration\nstrategies and providing guidelines on best strategies to use based on resource\navailability and requirements. We prototype CORMO-RAN as an rApp, and\nexperimentally evaluate it on an O-RAN private 5G testbed hosted on a Red Hat\nOpenShift cluster with commercial radio units.

    "abstract": "To understand and engineer biological and artificial nucleic acid systems,\nalgorithms are employed for prediction of secondary structures at thermodynamic\nequilibrium. Dynamic programming algorithms are used to compute the most\nfavoured, or Minimum Free Energy (MFE), structure, and the Partition Function\n(PF), a tool for assigning a probability to any structure. However, in some\nsituations, such as when there are large numbers of strands, or pseudoknoted\nsystems, NP-hardness results show that such algorithms are unlikely, but only\nfor MFE. Curiously, algorithmic hardness results were not shown for PF, leaving\ntwo open questions on the complexity of PF for multiple strands and single\nstrands with pseudoknots. The challenge is that while the MFE problem cares\nonly about one, or a few structures, PF is a summation over the entire\nsecondary structure space, giving theorists the vibe that computing PF should\nnot only be as hard as MFE, but should be even harder.\n  We answer both questions. First, we show that computing PF is #P-hard for\nsystems with an unbounded number of strands, answering a question of Condon\nHajiaghayi, and Thachuk [DNA27]. Second, for even a single strand, but allowing\npseudoknots, we find that PF is #P-hard. Our proof relies on a novel\nmagnification trick that leads to a tightly-woven set of reductions between\nfive key thermodynamic problems: MFE, PF, their decision versions, and #SSEL\nthat counts structures of a given energy. Our reductions show these five\nproblems are fundamentally related for any energy model amenable to\nmagnification. That general classification clarifies the mathematical landscape\nof nucleic acid energy models and yields several open questions.",

Our goal is to find different O'Connell\neffect properties using a multiband approach, compare them with each other, and\nfind correlations between these properties and the physical parameters of the\nsystems. We present the analysis of 14 new EBs that show the O'Connell effect\nusing multiband data extracted from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert\nSystem (ATLAS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) all-sky surveys. We measured\nthe difference in maximum amplitudes (delta m) alongside different light curve\nfeatures in different passbands via a new modeling process that uses Gaussian\nfits. We created a brand-new phenomenological model for O'Connell effect\nsystems whose analysis had previously been hampered by overfitting. Although\nthe magnitude of the O'Connell effect seems to be more pronounced at shorter\neffective wavelengths, supporting the idea that cool starspots cause the\neffect, a conclusive correlation is not found. On the other hand, we do find\nstrong correlations between the magnitude of the effect and both the\ntemperature and the period, both of which are inconsistent with a previous\nstudy. We also find that in systems that show both positive and negative\nO'Connell effects, there are different correlations with the aforementioned\nparameters. We conclude that, even though starspots may be one cause of the\nO'Connell effect, it is likely a multipronged phenomenon; for instance, the\nphysical interaction between the components of close binary stars may be\nanother important factor.",

    "abstract": "Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide medical information tailored to user symptoms.\nA critical challenge in SC development is preventing unexpected performance\ndegradation for individual diseases, especially rare diseases, when updating\nalgorithms. This risk stems from the lack of practical pre-deployment\nevaluation methods. For rare diseases, obtaining sufficient evaluation data\nfrom user feedback is difficult. To evaluate the impact of algorithm updates on\nthe diagnostic performance for individual rare diseases before deployment, this\nstudy proposes and validates a novel Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach.\nThis approach aims to enable this essential evaluation efficiently and at a low\ncost. To estimate the impact of algorithm updates, we generated synthetic\nvignettes from disease-phenotype annotations in the Human Phenotype Ontology\n(HPO), a publicly available knowledge base for rare diseases curated by\nexperts. Using these vignettes, we simulated SC interviews to predict changes\nin diagnostic performance. The effectiveness of this approach was validated\nretrospectively by comparing the predicted changes with actual performance\nmetrics using the R-squared ($R^2$) coefficient. Our experiment, covering eight\npast algorithm updates for rare diseases, showed that the proposed method\naccurately predicted performance changes for diseases with phenotype frequency\ninformation in HPO (n=5). For these updates, we found a strong correlation for\nboth Recall@8 change ($R^2$ = 0.83,$p$ = 0.031) and Precision@8 change ($R^2$ =\n0.78,$p$ = 0.047). Our proposed method enables the pre-deployment evaluation of\nSC algorithm changes for individual rare diseases. This evaluation is based on\na publicly available medical knowledge database created by experts, ensuring\ntransparency and explainability for stakeholders. Additionally, SC developers\ncan efficiently improve diagnostic performance at a low cost.",

However, accurately detecting human poses in fisheye images is\nchallenging due to the curved distortions inherent to fisheye optics. While\nvarious methods for undistorting fisheye images have been proposed, their\neffectiveness and limitations for poses that cover a wide FOV has not been\nsystematically evaluated in the context of absolute human pose estimation from\nmonocular fisheye images. To address this gap, we evaluate the impact of\npinhole, equidistant and double sphere camera models, as well as cylindrical\nprojection methods, on 3D human pose estimation accuracy. We find that in\nclose-up scenarios, pinhole projection is inadequate, and the optimal\nprojection method varies with the FOV covered by the human pose. The usage of\nadvanced fisheye models like the double sphere model significantly enhances 3D\nhuman pose estimation accuracy. We propose a heuristic for selecting the\nappropriate projection model based on the detection bounding box to enhance\nprediction quality.

In this\nwork, we extend this perspective to logics with restricted requantification,\nrefining the stratification of logical resources in finite-variable counting\nlogics.

NeRF-based methods\nhave achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a\nlocal-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash\nencoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a\nsubset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all\nparameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash\nfeatures generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from\ndifferent subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different\ntraining steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated\ninconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training,\nslower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate\nthe impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a\nNormalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the\nmismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)\nstrategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the\nglobal mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural\nnetwork exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster\nconvergence and enhanced reconstruction performance.

While one-step generators, enabled by diffusion distillation\ntechniques, offer excellent generation quality and computational efficiency,\nadapting them to new control conditions--such as structural constraints,\nsemantic guidelines, or external inputs--poses a significant challenge.\nConventional approaches often necessitate computationally expensive\nmodifications to the base model and subsequent diffusion distillation. This\npaper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight\napproach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step\ngenerators without requiring access to original training images or retraining\nthe base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and\nemploys a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator. This loss\naligns the adapted model's generation behavior across noises that are\nconditionally dependent to varying degrees, implicitly guiding it to adhere to\nthe new control. Theoretically, this training objective can be understood as\nminimizing the distributional distance between the adapted generator and the\nconditional distribution induced by the new conditions. NCT is modular,\ndata-efficient, and easily deployable, relying only on the pre-trained one-step\ngenerator and a control signal model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nNCT achieves state-of-the-art controllable generation in a single forward pass,\nsurpassing existing multi-step and distillation-based methods in both\ngeneration quality and computational efficiency.

A clinical synchrotron-based proton therapy facility with a\nmaximum clinical energy of 250 megaeV (MeV) and an experimental energy\ncapability of 330 MeV was used for the study. The synchrotron's internal\ndiagnostic equipment, including beam orbit monitors, dipole magnetic field\nsensors, acceleration frequency monitors, and energy measurement devices, was\nused to characterize the properties of the beams within the synchrotron and\nduring extraction. External dosimetric equipment included a PTW water tank\nfitted with two ionization chambers and an ionization chamber array. These were\nused to validate dual-energy extraction at the irradiation isocenter\nindependently. Dual-energy extraction was demonstrated across three defined\nenergy ranges: low (75-110 MeV), intermediate (120-155 MeV), and high (195-230\nMeV). Both re-acceleration and de-acceleration modes were tested and validated.\nThis preliminary study achieved an energy difference of 35 MeV between\nextracted beams across the three evaluated energy ranges.

We further illustrate a geometric interpretation of our ACE\nmeasure and establish its equivalence to a previously proposed probe of ACE,\nextending the known equivalence between the geometric interpretation and\noperational significance of bipartite correlations. Our work broadens the\nunderstanding of entanglement.",

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning architectures excel at optimization, but only after the\ndata has entered the network. The true bottleneck lies in preparing the right\ninput: minimal, salient, and structured in a way that reflects the essential\npatterns of the data. We propose DRIFT (Data Reduction via Informative Feature\nTransformation), a novel preprocessing technique inspired by vibrational\nanalysis in physical systems, to identify and extract the most resonant modes\nof input data prior to training. Unlike traditional models that attempt to\nlearn amidst both signal and noise, DRIFT mimics physics perception by\nemphasizing informative features while discarding irrelevant elements. The\nresult is a more compact and interpretable representation that enhances\ntraining stability and generalization performance. In DRIFT, images are\nprojected onto a low-dimensional basis formed by spatial vibration mode shapes\nof plates, offering a physically grounded feature set. This enables neural\nnetworks to operate with drastically fewer input dimensions (~ 50 features on\nMNIST and less than 100 on CIFAR100) while achieving competitive classification\naccuracy. Extensive experiments across MNIST and CIFAR100 demonstrate DRIFT's\nsuperiority over standard pixel-based models and PCA in terms of training\nstability, resistance to overfitting, and generalization robustness. Notably,\nDRIFT displays minimal sensitivity to changes in batch size, network\narchitecture, and image resolution, further establishing it as a resilient and\nefficient data representation strategy. This work shifts the focus from\narchitecture engineering to input curation and underscores the power of\nphysics-driven data transformations in advancing deep learning performance.",

We study in detail two\nsuch clouds, MBM 3 and MBM 16, trying to recover the geometric structure and\ntopology of the gas distribution. In particular, we address the evidence of\nsuperthermal asymmetric atomic and molecular line profiles as a result of\nfilament superposition combined with turbulent motions.

We also use archival infrared images to study the dust distribution\nand temperature. To understand the topology of MBM 3 and MBM 16 we compare\nmolecular and atomic spectra, along with profile decomposition of the HI 21 cm\nline. Standard tools such as Structure Functions of velocity centroids are used\nto characterise the turbulence in MBM 3, and channel maps and position-velocity\ndiagrams are employed for elucidating the filament topology of both clouds. The\nunusually large linewidths previously reported for MBM 3 are due to\nsuperposition of individual filaments whose superthermal linewidths are about 1\nkm/s. In MBM 16, the cloud appears to decompose into two adjacent structures\nwith similar properties. The filaments have a high aspect ratio, with lengths\nof about 1 pc and widths of about 0.1 pc.

We represent the dataset-specific features of the\nvictim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models.\nAfter that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by\ndetermining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of\nthe victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by\nhypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness.

We formulate the problem as an optimization model and show\nthat our congestion model yields an unbiased estimate of travel times derived\nfrom a discretized version of Vickrey's bottleneck model. To solve large-scale\ninstances, we develop a custom metaheuristic based on a large neighborhood\nsearch framework. We assess our method through a case study on the Manhattan\nstreet network using real-world taxi data. In a setting with exclusively\ncentrally controlled AMoD vehicles, our approach reduces total traffic delay by\nup to 25 percent and mitigates network congestion by up to 35 percent compared\nto selfish routing. We also consider mixed-traffic settings with both AMoD and\nconventional vehicles, comparing a welfare-oriented operator that minimizes\ntotal system travel time with a profit-oriented one that optimizes only the\nfleet's travel time. Independent of the operator's objective, the analysis\nreveals a win-win outcome: across all control levels, both autonomous and\nnon-autonomous traffic benefit from the implementation of balancing and\nstaggering strategies.",

We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the\nmorpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation\ncurves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo\ndecomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM\ncomponents, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on\nmock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the\nbest-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the\nNavarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio\net al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as\nor better than the other profiles in >65% of the sample. We find that the\nkinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We\nfind that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions >50%. For 70% of SFGs, we infer a\nDM inner slope, gamma < 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation\nis found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and\nconcentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with\nlarger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM\ndensity. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar,\nwhile DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of\nthe DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z\nsystems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale\nradii are z-invariant.",

We also\nidentify known galaxies, groups, or clusters in the field. The observations\nreveal that all three systems are composed of multiple groups each, either at\nthe same or at different redshifts. In total, we characterize nine groups. We\nmeasure flat surface brightness profiles with slope parameter $\\beta < 0.6$;\ni.e, less than the canonical $\\beta = 2/3$. For the two main central groups, we\neven measure $\\beta < 0.4$.

Additionally, we improve the temporal accuracy using a\n2nd-order accurate ESDIRK2 method, with the intermediate stage solutions\ncomputed by the 2nd-order accurate BDF2 pseudo-time marching method. To enhance\nthe numerical stability of ESDIRK2, we apply approximate linearisation in the\nimplicitly solved intermediate stages. Furthermore, we adjust the time-evolving\nmagnetic field B1 to zero at the end of each physical time step to further\nvalidate the extended magnetic field decomposition approach proposed by (Wang\net al. 2025a). It is noticed that the model successfully reproduces the CME\nevolution consistent with white-light coronagraph observations, enables\nfaster-than-real-time CME propagation simulations from solar surface to 0.1 AU\nusing only a few dozen CPU cores on approximately 1 million grid cells, and\nremains numerically stable in CME simulations involving low-\\b{eta} regions.\nThe simulation results show that this novel MHD coronal model, combined with an\nobservation-based magnetic flux rope, is sufficiently numerically stable and\ncomputationally efficient to reproduce real CME events propagating through the\nsub-Alfv{\\'e}nic coronal region.

    "abstract": "Despite their impressive performance, generative image models trained on\nlarge-scale datasets frequently fail to produce images with seemingly simple\nconcepts -- e.g., human hands or objects appearing in groups of four -- that\nare reasonably expected to appear in the training data. These failure modes\nhave largely been documented anecdotally, leaving open the question of whether\nthey reflect idiosyncratic anomalies or more structural limitations of these\nmodels. To address this, we introduce a systematic approach for identifying and\ncharacterizing \"conceptual blindspots\" -- concepts present in the training data\nbut absent or misrepresented in a model's generations. Our method leverages\nsparse autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept embeddings,\nenabling a quantitative comparison of concept prevalence between real and\ngenerated images. We train an archetypal SAE (RA-SAE) on DINOv2 features with\n32,000 concepts -- the largest such SAE to date -- enabling fine-grained\nanalysis of conceptual disparities. Applied to four popular generative models\n(Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.1, PixArt, and Kandinsky), our approach reveals\nspecific suppressed blindspots (e.g., bird feeders, DVD discs, and whitespaces\non documents) and exaggerated blindspots (e.g., wood background texture and\npalm trees). At the individual datapoint level, we further isolate memorization\nartifacts -- instances where models reproduce highly specific visual templates\nseen during training. Overall, we propose a theoretically grounded framework\nfor systematically identifying conceptual blindspots in generative models by\nassessing their conceptual fidelity with respect to the underlying\ndata-generating process.",

Existing studies have gradually advocated collaborative governance but\nrely on macro-level theoretical analyses. This study integrates micro- and\nmacro-level perspectives to propose a two-stage, multi-scenario governance\nmechanism for cyber violence. In the first phase, a multi-scenario evolutionary\ngame model with four parties involved in cyber violence was developed based on\nevolutionary game theory. Matlab simulations show that under strong government\nregulation, moderate levels of punishment implemented by the government against\nthe online media that adopt misguidance strategies can achieve the most\ndesirable stable state. In the second phase, the role of bystanders was\nintroduced by integrating communication dynamics theory, and emotional factors\nwere considered alongside game strategies. This led to the development of a new\nSBI1I2R model for public opinion dissemination in cyber violence. Netlogo\nsimulations found that increasing the \"correct guidance\" strategy by the online\nmedia reduces the influence of cyber violence supporters and the time it takes\nfor their nodes to drop to zero, but does not significantly shorten the time\nfor the peak to occur. Comparatively, collaborative intervention between the\nonline media and the government was most effective in curbing public opinion,\nfollowed by the government's independent \"strong regulation.\" Relying solely on\nthe online media's \"correct guidance\" produced the weakest effect.

This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation\nthat merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation\nnodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable\nefficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with\nbigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for\nassigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the\nenvironment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning\ntechniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy\nOptimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive\nfunctions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling\nweighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation\nenvironment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train\nthe proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution\ntest network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the\ncase study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes,\ndepots, and crews.

    "abstract": "Recent research increasingly integrates machine learning (ML) into predictive\nmaintenance (PdM) to reduce operational and maintenance costs in data-rich\noperational settings. However, uncertainty due to model misspecification\ncontinues to limit widespread industrial adoption. This paper proposes a PdM\nframework in which sensor-driven prognostics inform decision-making under\neconomic trade-offs within a finite decision space. We investigate two key\nquestions: (1) Does higher predictive accuracy necessarily lead to better\nmaintenance decisions? (2) If not, how can the impact of prediction errors on\ndownstream maintenance decisions be mitigated? We first demonstrate that in the\ntraditional estimate-then-optimize (ETO) framework, errors in probabilistic\nprediction can result in inconsistent and suboptimal maintenance decisions. To\naddress this, we propose an integrated estimate-optimize (IEO) framework that\njointly tunes predictive models while directly optimizing for maintenance\noutcomes. We establish theoretical finite-sample guarantees on decision\nconsistency under standard assumptions. Specifically, we develop a stochastic\nperturbation gradient descent algorithm suitable for small run-to-failure\ndatasets. Empirical evaluations on a turbofan maintenance case study show that\nthe IEO framework reduces average maintenance regret up to 22% compared to ETO.\nThis study provides a principled approach to managing prediction errors in\ndata-driven PdM. By aligning prognostic model training with maintenance\nobjectives, the IEO framework improves robustness under model misspecification\nand improves decision quality. The improvement is particularly pronounced when\nthe decision-making policy is misaligned with the decision-maker's target.\nThese findings support more reliable maintenance planning in uncertain\noperational environments.",

OSP combines three key\ninnovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while\nmaintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing\nchannel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,\nredistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices.

While recent unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection\nmethods trained on large-scale normal data show promising results, they lack\nfine-grained differentiation, such as benign vs. malignant tumors.\nAdditionally, ultrasound (US) imaging is highly sensitive to devices and\nacquisition parameter variations, creating significant domain gaps in the\nresulting US images. To address these challenges, we propose UltraAD, a\nvision-language model (VLM)-based approach that leverages few-shot US examples\nfor generalized anomaly localization and fine-grained classification. To\nenhance localization performance, the image-level token of query visual\nprototypes is first fused with learnable text embeddings. This image-informed\nprompt feature is then further integrated with patch-level tokens, refining\nlocal representations for improved accuracy. For fine-grained classification, a\nmemory bank is constructed from few-shot image samples and corresponding text\ndescriptions that capture anatomical and abnormality-specific features. During\ntraining, the stored text embeddings remain frozen, while image features are\nadapted to better align with medical data.

    "abstract": "Growing concerns over data privacy underscore the need for deep learning\nmethods capable of processing sensitive information without compromising\nconfidentiality. Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption\n(HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end\ndata protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely\nbeen restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training\nhas primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party\ncomputation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial\ncomputational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training\nunder HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully\nencrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme,\nReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on\nlocal error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and\nreduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that\nleverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering\nboth computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate\nbootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of\narbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine\nlearning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and\ntabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point\nplaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test\naccuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83%\nover existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up\nto 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public\nrepository.",

    "abstract": "Humans and animals show remarkable learning efficiency, adapting to new\nenvironments with minimal experience. This capability is not well captured by\nstandard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value\nupdates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to\nretrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.\nTransformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of\ntheir ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value\narchitecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a\ntransformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning\ntasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms\nthat emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is\nsupported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where\nrepresentations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.\nWe next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the\nmodel are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.\nInstead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching\nintermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then\naccessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a\ncomputational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to\nsupport flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the\nmodel resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system\nin the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural\ncognition.

Such reliance on irrelevant features,\noften called shortcut features, has been observed across domains, including\nmedical imaging and natural language processing, where it may lead to\nreal-world harms. A common mitigation strategy leverages annotations (provided\nby humans or machines) indicating which features are relevant or irrelevant.\nThese annotations are compared to model explanations, typically in the form of\nfeature salience, and used to guide the loss function during training.\nUnfortunately, recent works have demonstrated that feature salience methods are\nunreliable and therefore offer a poor signal to optimize.

In recent years, these\nstates have found important applications in interdisciplinary systems as a\nnon-radiating mode with ultra-long lifetime. In these applications, a key\nquestion is how to convert a quasi-BIC into an exact BIC, and what the general\ncriterion is for this transition. In this work, we uncover its origin using two\nsteps in a two-band model with an arbitrary confining potential. Firstly, we\ndemonstrate that a bound state coupled to a continuum band can yield quasi-BIC.\nThen, we show that tuning the coupling between the bands can convert the\nquasi-BIC into an exact BIC. In our theory, the real and complex poles of the\nspectra have a clear physical meaning for the quasi- and exact BICs, and we\ngive the general criterion for exact BICs.

More recently, these databases have made it possible to train\nuniversal models that aim at making accurate predictions for arbitrary atomic\ngeometries and compositions. The construction of many of these databases was\nhowever in itself aimed at materials discovery, and therefore targeted\nprimarily to sample stable, or at least plausible, structures and to make the\nmost accurate predictions for each compound - e.g. adjusting the calculation\ndetails to the material at hand. Here we introduce a dataset designed\nspecifically to train machine learning models that can provide reasonable\npredictions for arbitrary structures, and that therefore follows a different\nphilosophy. Starting from relatively small sets of stable structures, the\ndataset is built to contain massive atomic diversity (MAD) by aggressively\ndistorting these configurations, with near-complete disregard for the stability\nof the resulting configurations. The electronic structure details, on the other\nhand, are chosen to maximize consistency rather than to obtain the most\naccurate prediction for a given structure, or to minimize computational effort.\nThe MAD dataset we present here, despite containing fewer than 100k structures,\nhas already been shown to enable training universal interatomic potentials that\nare competitive with models trained on traditional datasets with two to three\norders of magnitude more structures. We describe in detail the philosophy and\ndetails of the construction of the MAD dataset.

We derived the perturbed magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) equations and obtained an analytic dispersion relation for an oblique\nmagnetic field. The growth rate was then evaluated using a numerical\nintegration of the dispersion relation. In particular, we focussed on the\nanisotropy in the mode growth induced ambipolar diffusion. Results. In contrast\nto the case of a magnetic field within the interface, an oblique magnetic field\nis much less restrictive with respect to the wavenumbers that can develop;\nrather than a sharp cut-off, it results in a selection of preferred scales for\nmode growth. The presence of a second neutral fluid that is insensitive to\ngravity tends to amplify the anisotropy in the possible direction of the\ninstability development.

In these systems, the interlayer coupling and\natomic rearrangement strongly depend on the twist angle, leading to the\nformation of periodic Moire superlattices. At small twist angles, significant\nlattice relaxation results in the emergence of domain structures separated by\none dimensional soliton networks, influencing electronic band structures and\nphonon modes. Here we systematically investigate the impact of lattice\nreconstruction on phonon renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene\n(TBLG,homo) and graphene-hBN Moire superlattices(hetero). Using Raman\nspectroscopy, we identify distinct phonon behaviours across different twist\nangle regimes. In TBLG, we observe the evolution of the G peak, including\nbroadening, splitting, and the emergence of additional peaks in the small angle\nrange 0.3 to 1 degree, attributed to Moire modified phonon interactions. At\nlarge twist angles, the peaks gradually merge back into a single feature,\nreflecting the reduced impact of lattice reconstruction. Similarly, in hBN\ngraphene Moire superlattices, we detect Moire induced Raman peaks above and\nbelow the G peak, while the central G peak remains largely invariant to twist\nangle variation. The theoretical calculations uncover Moire phonon modes\noriginating from different stacking regions providing insights into phonon\nrenormalization. Our results establish a direct link between twist angle,\nlattice reconstruction, Moire phonons, and interlayer coupling, offering a\nfundamental framework for understanding phonon engineering in twisted bilayer\nsystems.

    "abstract": "Inspired by a question of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson, we prove two\nnew results about infinite polynomial configurations in large subsets of the\nrational numbers. First, given a finite coloring of $\\mathbb{Q}$, we show that\nthere exists an infinite set $B = \\{b_n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\subseteq\n\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $$\\{b_i, b_i^2 + b_j : i < j\\}$$ is monochromatic.\nSecond, we prove that every subset of positive density in the rational numbers\ncontains a translate of such an infinite configuration. The corresponding\nresults in the integers are both known to be false, so our results provide\nnatural and relatively simple examples of combinatorial structures that\ndistinguish between the Ramsey-theoretic properties of the rational numbers and\nthe integers.\n  The proofs of our main results build upon methods developed in a series of\npapers by Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson to translate from combinatorics\ninto dynamics, where the core of the argument reduces to understanding the\nbehavior of certain polynomial ergodic averages. The new dynamical tools\nrequired for this analysis are a Wiener--Wintner theorem for\npolynomially-twisted ergodic averages in $\\mathbb{Q}$-systems and a structure\ntheorem for Abramov $\\mathbb{Q}$-systems.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of applications necessitates solving large-scale ill-posed\nproblems contaminated by noise. Krylov subspace regularization methods are\nparticularly advantageous in this context, as they rely solely on matrix-vector\nmultiplication. Among the most widely used techniques are LSQR and CGLS, both\nof which can be extended with flexible preconditioning to enforce solution\nproperties such as nonnegativity or sparsity. Flexible LSQR (FLSQR) can also be\nfurther combined with direct methods to create efficient hybrid approaches. The\nFlexible Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization underlying FLSQR requires two long-term\nrecurrences. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fast Flexible Golub-Kahan\nbidiagonalization method that employs one long-term and one short-term\nrecurrence. Using this, we develop the Fast Flexible LSQR (FaFLSQR) algorithm,\nwhich offers comparable computational cost to FCGLS while also supporting\nhybrid regularization like FLSQR. We analyze the properties of FaFLSQR and\nprove its mathematical equivalence to FCGLS. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat in floating point arithmetic FaFLSQR outperforms both FCGLS and FLSQR in\nterms of computational efficiency.",

These approaches do not explicitly\naccount for the transformations among CT slices, nor do they effectively\nintegrate multi-level image features, particularly those containing specific\norgan lesions, to instruct CT report generation (CTRG).

    "abstract": "As flash-based Solid State Drive (SSD) arrays become essential to modern data\ncenters, scaling these arrays to meet explosive data growth is a frequent and\ncritical operation. However, the conventional wear-leveling (WL) paradigm\napplied during scaling suffers from a fundamental flaw: it ignores the\nnon-linear relationship between wear and failure probability, potentially\npushing the most vulnerable, aged disks towards premature failure. To address\nthis critical issue at its root, we propose the Probability-Sensitive Wear\nLeveling (PS-WL) scheme, which shifts the optimization goal from balancing wear\nto directly balancing failure risk. At its core, PS-WL introduces an \"effective\nlifetime\" model derived from a realistic failure probability to more accurately\nassess disk lifetime. This model guides a PID controller for wear leveling\noperation, with a conservative zone minimizes performance overhead by\nrestricting warm data migration. Comprehensive simulations validate the\nsuperiority of PS-WL over state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate\nthat our approach significantly reduces performance overhead while, most\ncritically, consistently and effectively lowering the aggregated array failure\nrisk across diverse system configurations and workloads. This proves that by\ndirectly optimizing for reliability, PS-WL builds a scalable storage system\nthat is, by design, fundamentally safer, more efficient, and more stable.",

A probabilistic\nopinion dynamics model is constructed, in which every student's perceptions are\ndescribed by a probability density function (PDF), which is updated at every\ntime step through independent, personal observations and peer pressure shaped\nby trust relationships. It is found that students infer correctly the AI tool's\nproficiency $\\theta_{\\rm AI}$ in allies-only networks (i.e.\\ high trust\nnetworks).

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in\nmultimodal understanding and generation tasks. However, their application to\nlong video understanding remains hindered by the quadratic complexity of\nstandard attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{PEVLM}, a\nfine-tuning-free parallel encoding method designed to enhance the prefilling\nefficiency of VLMs in long video scenarios. PEVLM partitions the input video\ninto context blocks with a shared sink block, while preserving sequential\nposition embeddings to align the attention weight distribution with that of\nFull-Attention. This design reduces attention complexity from $O((T \\times\nN)^2)$ to $O(T \\times N)$ where $T$ is the number of frames and $N$ the number\nof tokens per frame, without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple state-of-the-art models and benchmarks demonstrate that PEVLM\nconsistently outperforms existing parallel encoding approaches, achieving up to\n\\textbf{7.47x} speedup in attention computation and reducing end-to-end latency\nby \\textbf{40\\%}. Remarkably, PEVLM not only maintains high accuracy, but in\nsome settings even surpasses Full-Attention performance. Under strict latency\nconstraints, it achieves substantial gains, improving accuracy from\n\\textbf{23.26\\%} to \\textbf{61.03\\%}.

    "abstract": "The do-calculus is a sound and complete tool for identifying causal effects\nin acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) induced by structural causal models\n(SCMs). However, in many real-world applications, especially in\nhigh-dimensional setting, constructing a fully specified ADMG is often\ninfeasible. This limitation has led to growing interest in partially specified\ncausal representations, particularly through cluster-directed mixed graphs\n(C-DMGs), which group variables into clusters and offer a more abstract yet\npractical view of causal dependencies. While these representations can include\ncycles, recent work has shown that the do-calculus remains sound and complete\nfor identifying macro-level causal effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs under the\nassumption that all clusters size are greater than 1. Nevertheless, real-world\nsystems often exhibit cyclic causal dynamics at the structural level. To\naccount for this, input-output structural causal models (ioSCMs) have been\nintroduced as a generalization of SCMs that allow for cycles. ioSCMs induce\nanother type of graph structure known as a directed mixed graph (DMG).\nAnalogous to the ADMG setting, one can define C-DMGs over DMGs as high-level\nrepresentations of causal relations among clusters of variables. In this paper,\nwe prove that, unlike in the ADMG setting, the do-calculus is unconditionally\nsound and complete for identifying macro causal effects in C-DMGs over DMGs.\nFurthermore, we show that the graphical criteria for non-identifiability of\nmacro causal effects previously established C-DMGs over ADMGs naturally extends\nto a subset of C-DMGs over DMGs.",

In this paper, the AoI is investigated when packets have a non-zero\ninitial age.

It is widely recognized that achieving\nhuman-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to\nintegrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy\ngeneration, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving\nhigh-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),\npretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,\nexhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities.

Our\nframework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions\nfrom frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional\ncompleteness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy\ngeneration, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,\ncerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and\ndesign efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules.

We perform large-scale Monte Carlo\nsimulations to establish the full phase diagram of the Q2D XY model, aided by\nfinite-size scaling. A long-range (LR) ordered phase emerges in the Q2D model\nwhen the spins on the parallel planes develop a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ncritical phase. In the LR ordered phase, ordering is anisotropic: LR\ncorrelations develop along the direction of the intersection lines, while\ncritical correlations emerge perpendicular to them. Furthermore, the LR ordered\nphase exhibits Goldstone-mode physics. Our study hence reveals the existence of\nLR order in a Q2D XY model with finite SR couplings and opens up a new avenue\nto explore superfluid orders in low dimensions.",

Meanwhile, the deep integration of cyber and physical systems\nmakes CPDS vulnerable to coordinated cyber-physical attacks. In this paper, a\nresilience assessment framework for the CPDS under coordinated cyber-physical\nattacks is proposed to investigate the impact of the coordinated attacks on\nload loss and service restoration in CPDS. First, a three-stage\ndefender-attacker-defender dynamic game model considering fake base station\n(FBS) and physical attacks for CPDS is established, aiming at seeking the\noptimal defense resource deployment strategy to enhance the resilience of the\nCPDS. The physical attack is launched to cause faults on the power lines, and\nthe FBS attack is employed to interrupt the service of wireless cellular\nnetwork to hinder the self-healing process of the CPDS. The lognormal shadowing\nmodel and search theory are applied to quantitatively describe the process of\nthe coordinated cyber-physical attacks. Further, the constructed three-stage\ndynamic game model is equivalently recast as a tri-level max-min-max\noptimization model, which is solved using column-and-constraint generation\ncombined with enumeration method.

In this study, we characterize the observational properties of the m =\n1 mode by analyzing time-distance subsurface flow maps. Synoptic flow maps,\nconstructed from daily subsurface flow maps using a tracking rate corresponding\nto the rotation at latitude 65 degrees, are filtered in both the spherical\nharmonic and Fourier domains to retain only the m = 1 mode and its dominant\nfrequencies. Our analysis reveals a power distribution that is significantly\nstronger in the northern polar region. The mode's power exhibits an\nanti-correlation with solar activity, remaining strong and persistent during\nthe solar activity minimum and becoming weaker and more fragmented during the\nsolar maximum. Magnetic flux transported from low to high latitudes influences\nboth the mode's power and lifetime, enhancing its power and shortening its\nlifetime upon arrival. The phases of the m = 1 mode in the northern and\nsouthern polar regions are near-antisymmetric for most of the time with short\ndeviations. We also compute zonal and meridional phase velocities of the mode\nand find that it exhibits significantly less differential rotation than its\nsurrounding plasma. The meridional phase velocity, comprising both the local\nplasma's meridional flow and the mode's intrinsic phase motion, is directed\npoleward below latitude 70 degrees and equatorward above this latitude. These\nobservational findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of the\ninternal dynamics of the low-m modes, which may offer valuable insights into\nthe structure and dynamics of the solar interior.",

We focus on two representative models: a two-qubit\nsystem under collective dissipation, and a nonlinear driven-dissipative Kerr\nresonator. After characterizing the parameter regimes that support\nmetastability, we introduce and analyze a protocol for error recovery during\nthe metastable dynamics. Using spectral properties of the Liouvillian, we\ncharacterize which types of errors can be possibly autonomously reversed. In\nparticular, we show that in the qubit model, the state affected by either\nbit-flip error or spontaneous emission can be recovered up to a certain\nmeasure. Instead, phase-flip errors would require further strategies. For the\nbosonic system, we show that dephasing-induced errors on cat states can be\npartially recovered, with a trade-off between fidelity and recovery time.

Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a\npromising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular\ndynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on\nforce matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with\ncorresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not\nrecorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing\ndatasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force\nmatching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference\natomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields\nwhich recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local\ndistortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this\nwork, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that\nsubstantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global\nconformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing\nthat flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from\nconfigurational samples.",

Gaussian wings are\nfound only at low O32 = [O III]5007/[O II]3726,3729 and high metallicity, while\npower-law wings span the full range of these parameters. The general evidence\nsuggests a dual-mode paradigm for LyC escape: radiation-driven superwinds\ntraced by power-law wings and supernova-driven feedback traced by Gaussian\nwings. For the former, the < 3 Myr-old, pre-supernova stellar population\ncorrelates with more luminous, faster winds. The data also show that\nradiation-driven wind parameters like wind luminosity and power-law slope\ndepend on the UV luminosity more than the optically thick covering fraction,\nconsistent with ``picket-fence\" radiative transfer. Observed wing slope values\nflatten with both escaping LyC luminosity and higher extinction, while still\npreserving the anticorrelation between these two quantities. Additionally, the\ndifferential between red and blue slopes implies that extinction and dense gas\nare centrally concentrated relative to the wind emission. Overall, our results\nshow that power-law emission-line wings probe LyC-driven winds and LyC escape\nin metal-poor starbursts.",

However, variations\nin system parameters, also referred to as parametric variability, can lead to\ndrastically different model behavior and output, posing challenges for\nconstructing models that generalize across parameter regimes. In this work, we\nintroduce the Parametric Hypernetwork for Learning Interpolated Networks\n(PHLieNet), a framework that simultaneously learns: (a) a global mapping from\nthe parameter space to a nonlinear embedding and (b) a mapping from the\ninferred embedding to the weights of a dynamics propagation network. The\nlearned embedding serves as a latent representation that modulates a base\nnetwork, termed the hypernetwork, enabling it to generate the weights of a\ntarget network responsible for forecasting the system's state evolution\nconditioned on the previous time history. By interpolating in the space of\nmodels rather than observations, PHLieNet facilitates smooth transitions across\nparameterized system behaviors, enabling a unified model that captures the\ndynamic behavior across a broad range of system parameterizations. The\nperformance of the proposed technique is validated in a series of dynamical\nsystems with respect to its ability to extrapolate in time and interpolate and\nextrapolate in the parameter space, i.e., generalize to dynamics that were\nunseen during training.

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities to\ngenerate coherent text, they suffer from the issue of hallucinations --\nfactually inaccurate statements. Among numerous approaches to tackle\nhallucinations, especially promising are the self-correcting methods. They\nleverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to iteratively generate verification\nquestions inquiring additional evidence, answer them with internal or external\nknowledge, and use that to refine the original response with the new\ncorrections. These methods have been explored for encyclopedic generation, but\nless so for domains like news summarization. In this work, we investigate two\nstate-of-the-art self-correcting systems by applying them to correct\nhallucinated summaries using evidence from three search engines. We analyze the\nresults and provide insights into systems' performance, revealing interesting\npractical findings on the benefits of search engine snippets and few-shot\nprompts, as well as high alignment of G-Eval and human evaluation.",

This giant Type II outburst, observed in April-June 2025,\nmarks the source's return to activity after nearly three decades of quiescence.\nUtilizing our NuSTAR observations together with Swift/XRT and SRG/ART-XC ones,\nwe trace the evolution of the outburst to a peak bolometric luminosity of\n$L_{\\rm bol} = 3.6 \\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The broadband spectra are well\ndescribed by an absorbed cutoff power law, two blackbody components (hot and\nsoft), and a narrow Fe K$\\alpha$ line. No cyclotron absorption features are\ndetected in either the phase-averaged or phase-resolved spectra in the 5-50 keV\nband. Most notably, we report the discovery of a previously undetected\nquasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at $0.8 \\pm 0.1$ mHz, characterized by a\nfractional root-mean-square amplitude of 18% at a super-Eddington bolometric\nluminosity of $L_{\\rm bol} = 2.5 \\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In contrast, the\npreviously reported 1.27 Hz QPO is not detected. While the sub-mHz QPO is\npresent, the pulsed fraction (PF) is low in soft X-rays, consistent with other\nsuper-Eddington pulsars exhibiting mHz QPOs, but rises above 20 keV reaching\n35%. The QPO vanishes in subsequent observations coinciding with a sharp\nincrease in the PF and a distinct change in pulse profile morphology. It is not\nobserved in any follow-up observations at luminosities above or below its\ninitial detection, suggesting it is a transient phenomenon.",

To mitigate the cost\nlimitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed,\nallowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a\nstandard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we\npropose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram\ndata.

The model\nsuccessfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two\nevents per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and\nreconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a\nsmoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer\ndetails. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial\ncapacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector\nconfiguration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector\nconfigurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable\nalternative to conventional PET scanner designs.

Our AFM\nimaging reveals water molecules as sharp, asymmetric boomerang-like features\nradically departing from the symmetric triangular motifs previously attributed\nto molecular water. Strikingly, these features localize near subsurface\ndefects.

Density functional theory identifies\nCe$^{3+}$ sites adjacent to subsurface vacancies as the thermodynamically\nfavored adsorption sites, where defect-induced symmetry breaking governs water\norientation. Force spectroscopy and simulations further distinguish Ce$^{3+}$\nfrom Ce$^{4+}$ centers through their unique interaction signatures.

    "abstract": "The classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has long served as a\ncornerstone for modeling magnetization dynamics in magnetic systems, yet its\nclassical nature limits its applicability to inherently quantum phenomena such\nas entanglement and nonlocal correlations. Inspired by the need to incorporate\nquantum effects into spin dynamics, recently a quantum generalization of the\nLLG equation is proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 266704 (2024)] which captures\nessential quantum behavior in many-body systems. In this work, we develop a\nrobust numerical methodology tailored to this quantum LLG framework that not\nonly handles the complexity of quantum many-body systems but also preserves the\nintrinsic mathematical structures and physical properties dictated by the\nequation. We apply the proposed method to a class of many-body quantum spin\nsystems, which host topological states of matter, and demonstrate rich quantum\nbehavior, including the emergence of long-time entangled states. This approach\nopens a pathway toward reliable simulations of quantum magnetism beyond\nclassical approximations, potentially leading to new discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in computer science,\nespecially for tasks involving code understanding and generation. However,\nexisting work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code\nwritten for government applications. In particular, government enterprise\nsoftware is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language\ncode (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context\nwindow size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are\nprimarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited\ntesting with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy\nlanguages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines\nthe application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written\nin ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We\ninvestigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary\nmodule comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking\nmethods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including\nGPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs\ncan select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We\nalso find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks\nsuch as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that\nare up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create\npartitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable\nreplacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided\nmodernization.",

Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations\nof lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining\nreliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion\nvariability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise,\nand is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large\nunlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the\nnuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.\n  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method\nthat learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based\nskeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from\nhealthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its\ndownstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with\nmetastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a\nstate-of-the-art SSL method.\n  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models,\nachieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The\nmethod achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24\n(baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions\nlarger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32\npatients.\n  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant\ninductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of\nbone lesions.

This work addresses this challenge by\nexploring DIPE with low-depth quantum circuits. We first establish that DIPE\nwith an arbitrary unitary $2$-design ensemble achieves an average sample\ncomplexity of $\\Theta(\\sqrt{2^n})$, where $n$ is the number of qubits.

Furthermore, we analyze\nthe state-dependent variance for the brickwork and Clifford ensembles.\nRemarkably, we find that DIPE with the global Clifford ensemble requires\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{2^n})$ copies for arbitrary state pairs, with its efficiency\nfurther enhanced by the nonstabilizerness of the state pairs. Numerical\nsimulations with GHZ states and Haar random states up to $26$ qubits show that\nlow-depth circuit ensembles can match the performance of unitary $4$-designs in\npractice.

    "abstract": "Efficient quantum control is a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum\ntechnologies, from computation to sensing and communications. Several\napproaches in quantum control, e.g. optimal control and inverse engineering,\nuse the pulse amplitude and frequency shaping as the control tools. Often,\nthese approaches prescribe pulse shapes which are difficult or impossible to\nimplement. To this end, we develop the concept of isoprobability classes of\nmodels of qubit dynamics, in which various pairs of time-dependent pulse\namplitude and frequency generate the same transition probability profile\n(albeit different temporal evolutions toward this probability). In this manner,\nwe introduce an additional degree of freedom, and hence flexibility in qubit\ncontrol, as some models can be easier to implement than others. We demonstrate\nthis approach with families of isoprobability models, which derive from the\nestablished Landau-Majorana-St\\\"uckelberg-Zener (LMSZ) and Allen-Eberly-Hioe\n(AEH) classes. We demonstrate the isoprobability performance of these models on\nan IBM Quantum processor. Instead of frequency (i.e. detuning) shaping, which\nis difficult to implement on this platform, we exploit the time-dependent phase\nof the driving field to induce an effective detuning. Indeed, the temporal\nderivative of the phase function emulates a variable detuning, thereby\nobviating the need for direct detuning control. The experimental validation of\nthe isoprobability concept with the time-dependent phase control underscores\nthe potential of this robust and accessible method for high-fidelity quantum\noperations, paving the way for scalable quantum control in a variety of\napplications.",

For the aforementioned challenges,\nwe propose the Feature-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting Framework (FAF), which\nconsists of three key components: the Generalized Knowledge Module (GKM), the\nTask-Specific Module (TSM), and the Rank Module (RM). During training phase,\nthe GKM is updated through a meta-learning mechanism that enables the model to\nextract generalized features across related tasks. Meanwhile, the TSM is\ntrained to capture diverse local dynamics through multiple functional regions,\neach of which learns specific features from individual tasks. During testing\nphase, the RM dynamically selects the most relevant functional region from the\nTSM based on input sequence features, which is then combined with the\ngeneralized knowledge learned by the GKM to generate accurate forecasts. This\ndesign enables FAF to achieve robust and personalized forecasting even with\nsparse historical observations We evaluate FAF on five diverse real-world\ndatasets under few-shot time series forecasting settings. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FAF consistently outperforms baselines that include three\ncategories of time series forecasting methods.

    "abstract": "Galaxy clusters detected through their X-ray emission or Sunyaev--Zeldovich\neffect (SZE), both produced by the intra-cluster medium (ICM), are key probes\nin cosmological and astrophysical studies. To maximise the scientific return of\nsuch surveys, complementary data are required for cluster confirmation and\nredshift estimation. This is typically provided by wide-field optical and\ninfrared surveys, which are increasingly challenged by ongoing and future\nICM-selected samples. In particular, at high redshifts ($z>1$) probed by\nupcoming SZE-selected samples, current large surveys may be insufficient for\nreliable confirmation. Deep, high-resolution infrared surveys like Euclid will\nthus be essential for confirming most high-redshift clusters. We present an\nanalysis of the first sizeable Euclid dataset (Q1), overlapping with several\nICM-selected cluster samples. We apply an adaptation of the MCMF cluster\nconfirmation tool to estimate key properties, including redshift and richness,\nand to predict Euclid's capabilities for high-redshift cluster confirmation. We\nfind promising performance, particularly at high redshifts, while richness\nestimates at low redshifts ($z<0.4$) are currently limited by Q1 data quality\nbut should improve with future releases. Using MCMF runs on random lines of\nsight, we predict that Euclid will confirm clusters at $1<z<2$ as effectively\nas current optical surveys at $z<0.6$, significantly enhancing high-redshift\nconfirmation. SZE-selected samples will thus greatly benefit from Euclid\noverlap. Among five known high-$z$ SZE clusters in Q1, we identify the\nhighest-redshift jellyfish galaxy candidate to date, EUCLJ035330.86$-$504347.6\nin SPT-CLJ0353$-$5043 ($z=1.32$), two massive star-forming galaxies near\nACT-CLJ0350.0$-$4819 ($z=1.46$), and strong lensing features in\nSPT-CLJ0353$-$5043 and SPT-CLJ0421$-$4845.",

The game involves linear\ninput/output/state dynamics and quadratic cost functions with heterogeneous\ndiscount factors. For the finite-horizon version, which forms the basis of the\ninfinite-horizon game, we analyze the structure of the coupled generalized\ndiscrete Riccati difference equations related to the feedback Nash equilibrium\n(FNE) and derive a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the\nfinite-horizon FNE. Under this condition, the FNE can be efficiently computed\nvia the proposed algorithm. In the infinite-horizon game, assume all players\nadopt this finite-horizon strategy. If the iterations of the coupled equations\nrelated to the FNE converge, and the invertibility and stability conditions\nhold, we prove the convergence of each player's total cost under the\nfinite-horizon strategy, even when players use individual prediction horizons.\nFurthermore, we provide an explicit upper bound on the cost difference between\nthe finite-horizon strategy and the infinite-horizon FNE associated with the\nlimiting matrices, expressed via the distance between their feedback strategy\nmatrices. This bound vanishes as $T$ tends to infinity, implying convergence to\nthe infinite-horizon FNE cost. A non-scalar numerical example illustrates the\nconvergence behavior.",

Privacy extraction attacks, such as\njailbreaking, expose vulnerabilities in LLMs by crafting inputs that force the\nmodels to output sensitive information. However, these attacks cannot verify\nwhether the extracted private information is accurate, as no public datasets\nexist for cross-validation, leaving a critical gap in private information\ndetection during inference. To address this, we propose PrivacyXray, a novel\nframework detecting privacy breaches by analyzing LLM inner states. Our\nanalysis reveals that LLMs exhibit higher semantic coherence and probabilistic\ncertainty when generating correct private outputs. Based on this, PrivacyXray\ndetects privacy breaches using four metrics: intra-layer and inter-layer\nsemantic similarity, token-level and sentence-level probability distributions.\nPrivacyXray addresses critical challenges in private information detection by\novercoming the lack of open-source private datasets and eliminating reliance on\nexternal data for validation. It achieves this through the synthesis of\nrealistic private data and a detection mechanism based on the inner states of\nLLMs. Experiments show that PrivacyXray achieves consistent performance, with\nan average accuracy of 92.69% across five LLMs. Compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, PrivacyXray achieves significant improvements, with an average\naccuracy increase of 20.06%, highlighting its stability and practical utility\nin real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning for vision tasks have seen the rise of State\nSpace Models (SSMs) like Mamba, celebrated for their linear scalability.\nHowever, their adaptation to 2D visual data often necessitates complex\nmodifications that may diminish efficiency. In this paper, we introduce\nMambaOutRS, a novel hybrid convolutional architecture for remote sensing image\nclassification that re-evaluates the necessity of recurrent SSMs. MambaOutRS\nbuilds upon stacked Gated CNN blocks for local feature extraction and\nintroduces a novel Fourier Filter Gate (FFG) module that operates in the\nfrequency domain to capture global contextual information efficiently. Our\narchitecture employs a four-stage hierarchical design and was extensively\nevaluated on challenging remote sensing datasets: UC Merced, AID,\nNWPU-RESISC45, and EuroSAT. MambaOutRS consistently achieved state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performance across these benchmarks. Notably, our MambaOutRS-t variant\n(24.0M parameters) attained the highest F1-scores of 98.41\\% on UC Merced and\n95.99\\% on AID, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including\nlarger transformer models and Mamba-based architectures, despite using\nconsiderably fewer parameters. An ablation study conclusively demonstrates the\ncritical role of the Fourier Filter Gate in enhancing the model's ability to\ncapture global spatial patterns, leading to robust and accurate classification.\nThese results strongly suggest that the complexities of recurrent SSMs can be\neffectively superseded by a judicious combination of gated convolutions for\nspatial mixing and frequency-based gates for spectral global context. Thus,\nMambaOutRS provides a compelling and efficient paradigm for developing\nhigh-performance deep learning models in remote sensing and other vision\ndomains, particularly where computational efficiency is paramount.",

A matching is optimal if the matching maximizes the sum of the\n1st utility, subject to this, maximizes the sum of the 2nd utility, and so on.\nThe profile-based matching can express rank-maximal matching\n\\cite{irving2006rank}, fair matching \\cite{huang2016fair}, and weight-maximal\nmatching \\cite{huang2012weight}. These problems can be reduced to maximum\nweight matching problems, but the reduction is known to be inefficient due to\nthe huge weights.\n  This paper presents the condition for a weight function to find an optimal\nmatching by reducing profile-based matching to the maximum weight matching\nproblem.

By considering the full kinematic\ninformation of the decay products, we find that the sensitivities to\nIm$d_{\\tau}$ and Re$d_{\\tau}$ can reach $10^{-21}$ $ecm$ at CEPC $\\sqrt s =\nm_Z$, compared to $10^{-20}$ $ecm$ at Belle-II $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance and\n$10^{-17}$ $ecm$ at BEPCII $\\psi(2S)$ resonance. For $a_{\\tau}$, we find that\nIm$a_{\\tau}$ and Re$a_{\\tau}$ with a precision of $10^{-5}$ at Belle-II $\\sqrt\ns=10.58$ GeV can be attained.",

    "abstract": "We present a detailed X-ray/UV high-time resolution monitoring of the final\nreflaring phase of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX~J1808.4$-$3658. During\nits 2022 outburst, we obtained simultaneous XMM-Newton and Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) observations. We detected coherent X-ray pulsations down to a\n0.5-10~keV luminosity of $L_{X(low)\\,0.5-10} \\simeq 6.21^{+0.20}_{-0.15} \\times\n10^{34} \\, d^2_{3.5}\\,\\mathrm{erg \\, s^{-1}}$, among the lowest ever observed\nin this source. The uninterrupted coverage provided by XMM-Newton enabled a\ndetailed characterisation of the spectral and temporal evolution of the source\nX-ray emission as the flux varied by approximately one order of magnitude. At\nthe lowest flux levels, we observed significant variations in pulse amplitude\nand phase correlated with the X-ray source flux. We found a sharp phase jump of\n$\\sim 0.4$ cycles, accompanied by a doubling of the pulse amplitude and a\nsoftening of the X-ray emission. We interpret the changes in the X-ray pulse\nprofiles as drifts of emission regions on the neutron star surface due to an\nincrease of the inner disk radius occurring when the mass accretion rate\ndecreases. The phase evolution was consistent with a magnetospheric radius\nscaling as $R_{m} \\propto \\dot{M}^{\\Lambda}$, with $\\Lambda = -0.17(9)$, in\nbroad agreement with theoretical predictions. Simultaneous HST observations\nconfirmed the presence of significant UV pulsations. The measured pulsed\nluminosity $-$ $L_{pulsed}^{UV} = (9 \\pm 2) \\times 10^{31} \\, \\text{erg} \\,\n\\text{s}^{-1}$ $-$ was approximately half that observed during the 2019\noutburst, but the pulsed X-ray to UV luminosity ratio simultaneously measured\nremained consistent. Yet, such a UV luminosity exceeds the predictions of\nstandard emission models, as further confirmed by the shape of the pulsed\nspectral energy distribution.",

In this paper we explore these questions by conducting a\ncase-study, in which we train a foundation model on a large regional fetal\nultrasound dataset of 2M images.

(ii) Well-tuned\nmethods from computer vision are making it feasible to train custom foundation\nmodels for a given medical domain, requiring no hyperparameter tuning and\nlittle methodological adaptation.

We used\nintegral-field spectroscopic observations to estimate stellar velocity\ndispersion and built a 3D dynamical model using these density solutions and the\nobserved rotation curve. We generated simulated surface brightness maps and\ncompared them with observations to verify modeling consistency. The dynamical\nmodel was inclined to 90{\\deg} to produce an edge-on surface density map, which\nwe investigated by fitting different 2D functions and plotting vertical cuts in\nlogarithmic scale. We estimated vertical stellar velocity dispersion using an\niterative method, obtaining results consistent with the Disk Mass Survey\nformalism. Through dynamical modeling, we produced moment maps that reasonably\nmatched observations. We examined the simulated edge-on model by taking\nvertical cuts and decomposing them into multiple Gaussian components. We find\nthat artificial double Gaussian components arise due to line-of-sight\nintegration effects, even for single-component disks. This indicates that\ndecomposing vertical intensity cuts into multiple Gaussian components is\nunreliable for multicomponent disks. Instead, an up-bending break visible in\nlogarithmic-scale vertical cuts serves as a more reliable indicator for\ntwo-component disks. We performed 2D fitting on the edge-on surface density map\nusing the product of a scaled modified Bessel function and $sech^2$ function to\nestimate structural parameters. These traditional methods systematically\nunderestimate the scale length and flattening ratio. Therefore, we suggest\nusing detailed modeling to accurately deduce stellar disk structural\nparameters.",

Toward\nthis end we perform a new 3D global hydrodynamic CE simulation with the mass of\nthe companion point particle set equal to the mass of the asymptotic giant\nbranch star core particle to maximize symmetry and facilitate interpretation.\nFirst, we find that a region around the particles of a scale comparable to\ntheir separation contributes essentially all of the torque. Second, the density\npattern of the torque-dominating gas and, to an extent, this gas itself, is\nroughly in corotation with the binary. Third, approximating the spatial\ndistribution of the torquing gas as a uniform-density prolate spheroid whose\nmajor axis resides in the orbital plane and lags the line joining the binary\ncomponents by a constant phase angle reproduces the torque evolution remarkably\nwell, analogous to studies of binary supermassive black holes. Fourth, we\ncompare the torque measured in the simulation with the predictions of a model\nthat assumes two weak point-mass perturbers undergoing circular motion in a\nuniform background without gas self-gravity, and find remarkable agreement with\nour results if the background density is taken to be equal to a fixed fraction\n($\\approx 0.44$) of the density at the spheroid surface.

In soft porous\ncrystals, in particular, adsorption of guest molecules induces host framework\ndeformation and changes in rigidity, underpinning their characteristic\nstimuli-responsive behaviour. Surface-mediated adsorption leads to\ninhomogeneous adsorbate distribution, which, through local framework\ndeformation, induces spatial variations in rigidity -- elastic heterogeneity.\nAlthough this heterogeneity is expected to affect adsorption kinetics and\nmechanical behaviour, its role remains poorly understood. Here we show that\nelastic heterogeneity governs adsorption kinetics, leading to emergent\nphenomena including size-dependent uptake, surface creasing, and anomalous\ndynamic scaling that is distinct from established scaling. Stress relaxation\nnear corners facilitates adsorption, resulting in a size-dependent deviation\nfrom diffusive kinetics. Away from corners, flexible unadsorbed regions between\nrigid adsorbed domains relieve stress through crease formation. The resulting\nlateral correlations exhibit anomalous dynamic scaling, characterized by a\nbreakdown of scale invariance between global and local interfacial\nfluctuations. These findings provide a mechanistic foundation for controlling\nadsorption and deformation kinetics in soft porous materials via elastic\nheterogeneity.

The method correctly predicts the kinetics in bulk copper and\nequilibrium impurity concentrations in aluminum, in agreement with the\nLangmuir-Mclean solution in the dilute limit. Notably, this technique can reach\nrealistic diffusion time scales of days, weeks, and even years in a\ncomputational time of hours, demonstrating its capability to study the\nlong-term chemo-thermo-mechanically coupled behavior of atomic ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) aims to identify an optimal hyperparameter\nconfiguration (HPC) such that the resulting model generalizes well to unseen\ndata. As the expected generalization error cannot be optimized directly, it is\nestimated with a resampling strategy, such as holdout or cross-validation. This\napproach implicitly assumes that minimizing the validation error leads to\nimproved generalization. However, since validation error estimates are\ninherently stochastic and depend on the resampling strategy, a natural question\narises: Can excessive optimization of the validation error lead to overfitting\nat the HPO level, akin to overfitting in model training based on empirical risk\nminimization? In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon, which we term\novertuning, a form of overfitting specific to HPO. Despite its practical\nrelevance, overtuning has received limited attention in the HPO and AutoML\nliterature. We provide a formal definition of overtuning and distinguish it\nfrom related concepts such as meta-overfitting. We then conduct a large-scale\nreanalysis of HPO benchmark data to assess the prevalence and severity of\novertuning. Our results show that overtuning is more common than previously\nassumed, typically mild but occasionally severe. In approximately 10% of cases,\novertuning leads to the selection of a seemingly optimal HPC with worse\ngeneralization error than the default or first configuration tried. We further\nanalyze how factors such as performance metric, resampling strategy, dataset\nsize, learning algorithm, and HPO method affect overtuning and discuss\nmitigation strategies. Our results highlight the need to raise awareness of\novertuning, particularly in the small-data regime, indicating that further\nmitigation strategies should be studied.",

Lagrangian\ntracer particles in RMHD simulations carried out using the PLUTO code are used\nto track the fluid quantities of each `ensemble of electrons' through time to\ncalculate the radio emissivity ex-situ. By using the magnetic field directly\nfrom simulations, the full set of linear Stokes parameters I, Q, and U can be\ncalculated to study the synthetic radio polarisation of radio AGN sources. We\napply this method to a suite of RMHD simulations to study their polarisation\nproperties. The turbulent magnetic field present in radio lobes influences the\nemission, causing a complex clumpy structure that is visible at high\nresolution. Our synthetic polarisation properties are consistent with\nobservations; we find that the fractional polarisation is highest\n(approximately 50 percent) at the lobe edges. We show that for the same source,\nthe integrated and mean fractional polarisation depends on viewing angle to the\nsource. At oblique viewing angles the behaviour of the integrated and mean\nfractional polarisation over time depends on the morphology of the jet cocoon.\nUsing Faraday rotation measures, we reproduce known depolarisation effects such\nas the Laing-Garrington depolarisation asymmetry in jets angled to the line of\nsight.

Not\nunexpectedly, the recovery problem becomes harder when the formula gets more\ncomplex, that is, when the number of variables and operators gets larger.\nVariables in naturally occurring symbolic formulas often appear only in fixed\ncombinations. This can be exploited in symbolic regression by substituting one\nnew variable for the combination, effectively reducing the number of variables.\nHowever, finding valid substitutions is challenging.

Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that, unlike He-Schramm's work, the type theory for infinite ICPs\ndepends not only on the structure of the cellular decomposition but also on the\nselection of intersection angles. In fact, we construct Example 4.13 to show\nthe difference. Consequently, we obtain the existence and rigidity of IIP with\nprescribed exterior angles. Due to the example, our results on the type problem\nof infinite ICPs and the existence of IIP are sharp. For ICPs with arbitrary\nangles, our example also demonstrates that the VEL-parabolicity and\nICP-parabolicity are not equivalent (while in He and Schramm's settings,\nVEL-parabolicity and CP-parabolicity are equivalent), indicating that our\nsetting is extremely distinct from He and Schramm's. To prove our results, we\ndevelop a uniform Ring Lemma via the technique of pointed Gromov-Hausdorff\nconvergence for ICPs.",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language\nModels (LVLMs), discrepancies often occur between visual inputs and textual\noutputs--a phenomenon we term visual hallucination. This critical reliability\ngap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)\napplications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective\ndetection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric\nhallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,\noverlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We\ndevelop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,\nwhich enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning\ncapabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,\nscenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed\nmore visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of\nrelation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination\ndetection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to\nefficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model\ninference phase. Specifically, our approach employs simple mass functions to\nmitigate the computational complexity of evidence combination on power sets. We\nconduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs, LLaVA-v1.5,\nmPLUG-Owl2 and mPLUG-Owl3, with the new PRE-HAL benchmark. Experimental results\nindicate that our method outperforms five baseline uncertainty metrics,\nachieving average AUROC improvements of 4%, 10%, and 7% across three LVLMs. Our\ncode is available at https://github.com/HT86159/Evidential-Conflict.",

    "abstract": "Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to\nedges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks.\nGenerative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by\ntransmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent\nrepresentations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on\nthe alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that\npossessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless\ntransmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this\npaper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm\nfor GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the\ncloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and\nused to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel\nconditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge\ndistillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,\nan optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge\ndistillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression\nrates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment\nbetween the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.\nMoreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the\nbaseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.",

For each simulation code, we measure the following statistics:\nvoid size function, void ellipticity function, core density function, and the\nvoid radial density profile. We use these statistics to quantify the accuracy\nof PINOCCHIO relative to OpenGADGET3 in the context of cosmic voids.

We observe that quantizing\nthe KV cache of different tokens has varying impacts on the quality of\nattention outputs. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we perform\nforward error propagation analysis on attention and propose the Anchor Score\n(AnS) that quantifies the sensitivity of each token's KV cache to\nquantization-induced error. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in AnS\nacross tokens, suggesting that preserving a small subset with full precision\n(FP16) of high-AnS tokens can greatly mitigate accuracy loss in aggressive\nquantization scenarios. Based on this insight, we introduce AnTKV, a novel\nframework that leverages Anchor Token-aware Vector Quantization to compress the\nKV cache. Furthermore, to support efficient deployment, we design and develop a\ntriton kernel that is fully compatible with FlashAttention, enabling fast\nonline Anchor Token selection. AnTKV enables LLaMA-3-8B to handle context\nlengths up to 840K tokens on a single 80GB A100 GPU, while achieving up to 3.5x\nhigher decoding throughput compared to the FP16 baseline.

Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy\nand security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be\neffectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital\nhealthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce\nModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise\nmodality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that\nModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical\nmodels on our custom data.

While recent work in efficient\nreasoning seeks to reduce reasoning length while preserving accuracy, it\nremains unclear whether such optimization is truly a free lunch. Drawing on the\nintuition that compressing reasoning may reduce the robustness of model\nresponses and lead models to omit key reasoning steps, we investigate whether\nefficient reasoning strategies introduce behavioral inconsistencies. To\nsystematically assess this, we introduce $ICBENCH$, a benchmark designed to\nmeasure inconsistency in LRMs across three dimensions: inconsistency across\ntask settings (ITS), inconsistency between training objectives and learned\nbehavior (TR-LB), and inconsistency between internal reasoning and\nself-explanations (IR-SE). Applying $ICBENCH$ to a range of open-source LRMs,\nwe find that while larger models generally exhibit greater consistency than\nsmaller ones, they all display widespread \"scheming\" behaviors, including\nself-disagreement, post-hoc rationalization, and the withholding of reasoning\ncues. Crucially, our results demonstrate that efficient reasoning strategies\nsuch as No-Thinking and Simple Token-Budget consistently increase all three\ndefined types of inconsistency. These findings suggest that although efficient\nreasoning enhances token-level efficiency, further investigation is imperative\nto ascertain whether it concurrently introduces the risk of models evading\neffective supervision.",

To generate paired data for supervising the editing\nmodel, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate\ngeometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also\nintroduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits,\nleveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training\nand multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing\ncapabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D\nconsistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.",

    "abstract": "As chiplet-based integration and many-core architectures become the norm in\nhigh-performance computing, on-chip wireless communication has emerged as a\ncompelling alternative to traditional interconnects. However, scalable Medium\nAccess Control (MAC) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly under dense\ntraffic and limited spectral resources. This paper presents TRMAC, a novel\ncross-layer MAC protocol that exploits the spatial focusing capability of Time\nReversal (TR) to enable multiple parallel transmissions over a shared frequency\nchannel. By leveraging the quasi-deterministic nature of on-chip wireless\nchannels, TRMAC pre-characterizes channel impulse responses to coordinate\naccess using energy-based thresholds, eliminating the need for orthogonal\nresource allocation or centralized arbitration. Through detailed physical-layer\nsimulation and system-level evaluation on diverse traffic, TRMAC demonstrates\ncomparable or superior performance to existing multi-channel MAC protocols,\nachieving low latency, high throughput, and strong scalability across hundreds\nof cores. TRMAC provides a low-complexity, high-efficiency solution for future\nWireless Networks-on-Chip (WNoCs), particularly in chiplet-based systems where\nspatial reuse and modularity are critical. With simulations we prove that TRMAC\ncan be utilized for parallel transmissions with a single frequency channel with\na similar throughput and latency as in using multiple frequency bands omitting\nthe need for complex transceivers. This work establishes a new design direction\nfor MAC protocols that are tightly integrated with the underlying channel\nphysics to meet the demands of next-generation computing platforms.",

The geometry may be modelled in two ways: either two points\nare defined as close if they are similar in all dimensions, or they are defined\nas close if they are similar in some dimensions. The first option is\nmathematically more natural since it can be described by metrics. However, the\nsecond option is arguably the better model for social networks if the different\ndimensions represent features like profession, kinship, or interests. In such\ncases, nodes already form bonds if they align in some, but not all dimensions.\nFor the first option, it is known that the resulting networks are poor\nexpanders. We study the second option in the form of Minimum-Component Distance\nGIRGs, and find that those behave the opposite way for dimension $d\\ge 2$, and\nthat they have strong expanding properties. More precisely, for a suitable\nconstant $C>0$, the subgraph induced by vertices of (expected) degree at least\n$(\\log n)^C$ forms an expander. Moreover, we study how the expansion factor of\nthe resulting subgraph depends on the choice of $C$, and show that this\nexpansion factor is $\\omega(1)$ except for sets that already take up a constant\nfraction of the vertices.

This article provides a comprehensive\nreview of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher\neducation, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We\nsynthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of\nconversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural\nlearning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic\nmethod, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting\nstrategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors\nwith these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive\nlearning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where\nLLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it\nchallenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps\nin applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency\nto provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,\nand the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human\nexpertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better\nalign LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts\nthat encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student\nreflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and\ncontextual relevance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between educational theory\nand the emerging practice of AI-driven conversational learning, offering\ninsights and tools for making LLM-based dialogues more educationally productive\nand theory-aligned.",

To address this gap, we\npropose, for the first time in the literature, an analytical model for the\ndepth dose distribution of carbon ion beams by adapting and extending Bortfeld\nproton dose model. The Bortfeld model was modified and expanded by introducing\nadditional terms and parameters to account for the energy deposition and\nfragmentation effects characteristic of carbon ions. Our model was implemented\nin MATLAB software to calculate depth-dose distributions of carbon ion beams\nacross the clinical energy range of 100-430 MeV/u.

Unlike existing\nmethods, HMSViT employs pooling-based hierarchical and dual attention\nmechanisms with absolute positional encoding, enabling efficient multi-scale\nfeature extraction by capturing fine-grained local details in early layers and\nintegrating global context in deeper layers, all at a lower computational cost.\nA block-masked self supervised learning framework is designed for the HMSViT\nthat reduces reliance on labelled data, enhancing feature robustness, while a\nmulti-scale decoder is used for segmentation and classification by fusing\nhierarchical features. Experiments on clinical CCM datasets showed HMSViT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, with 61.34% mIoU for nerve segmentation\nand 70.40% diagnostic accuracy, outperforming leading hierarchical models like\nthe Swin Transformer and HiViT by margins of up to 6.39% in segmentation\naccuracy while using fewer parameters. Detailed ablation studies further reveal\nthat integrating block-masked SSL with hierarchical multi-scale feature\nextraction substantially enhances performance compared to conventional\nsupervised training. Overall, these comprehensive experiments confirm that\nHMSViT delivers excellent, robust, and clinically viable results, demonstrating\nits potential for scalable deployment in real-world diagnostic applications.",

    "abstract": "Bright points (BPs) are ubiquitous, small-scale energetic events with\nmultithermal signatures, typically observed in the chromosphere and linked to\nboth photospheric structure and coronal composition. Their evolution is\ninfluenced by various physical processes, including plasma dynamics and\nmagnetic interactions. This paper examines BP evolution using a large\nstatistical sample, focusing on when they reach maximum values for key\nattributes, and explores differences between BPs in the \"Active Quiet Sun\"\n(AQS, above the network) and the \"True Quiet Sun\" (TQS, above the\ninternetwork). Observed attributes include maximum brightness (total and\nintrinsic), plane-of-sky (POS) speed, travel distance, acceleration, and\napparent size (POS area). BPs can reach maximum brightness and size at almost\nany time during their lifetime, likely due to complex chromospheric\ninteractions. AQS and TQS BPs show similar behaviour overall and tend to reach\nmaximum POS speed around the midpoint of their lifetimes. Positive acceleration\nusually occurs early, while negative acceleration is more common near the end.\nPreliminary results suggest two distinct BP regimes with differing\nrelationships between intrinsic brightness and area. We interpret these trends\nas evidence that BPs, whether due to plasma motion or a heating event, follow\narched paths -- likely along short magnetic loops. In this model, the midpoint\nof a BP's life corresponds to the crest of the arch, producing the greatest POS\nspeeds. Reconnection may occur at a footpoint, with the BP moving along the\nloop before returning to the photosphere. Deviations from this expected\nevolution may result from complex chromospheric interactions or BPs with highly\nnon-linear POS motions.",

The field of the Crab Nebula was\nobserved between 120 and 168 MHz as part of the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey\n(LoTSS), and the data were re-processed to include the LOFAR international\nstations to create a high angular resolution ($0.43'' \\times 0.28''$) map at a\ncentral frequency of 145 MHz. Combining the ILT map with archival\ncentimeter-range observations of the Nebula with the Very Large Array (VLA) and\nLOFAR data at 54 MHz, we become sensitive to the effects of free-free\nabsorption against the synchrotron emission of the pulsar wind nebula. This\nabsorption is caused by the ionised filaments visible in optical and infrared\ndata of the Crab Nebula, which are the result of the pulsar wind nebula\nexpanding into the denser stellar ejecta that surrounds it and forming\nRayleigh-Taylor fingers. The LOFAR observations are sensitive to two components\nof these filaments: their dense cores, which show electron densities of\n$\\gtrsim1,000$ cm$^{-3}$, and the diffuse envelopes, with electron densities of\n$\\sim50-250$ cm$^{-3}$. The denser structures have widths of $\\sim0.03$ pc,\nwhereas the diffuse component is at one point as large as $0.2$ pc. The\nmorphology of the two components is not always the same.

While UAV trajectory\noptimization offers high flexibility and Line-of-Sight (LoS) advantages, it\nsuffers from significant energy consumption, latency, and complex trajectory\noptimization. Conversely, MA technology provides fine-grained spatial\nreconfiguration (antenna positioning within a confined area) with ultra-low\nenergy overhead and millisecond-scale response, enabling real-time channel\nmanipulation and covert beam steering. To systematically compare these\nparadigms, we establish a dual-scale mobility framework where a UAV-mounted\nuniform linear array (ULA) serves as a base station transmitting confidential\ninformation to a legitimate user (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper\n(Eve). We formulate non-convex average secrecy rate (ASR) maximization problems\nfor both schemes: 1) MA-based micro-mobility: Jointly optimizing antenna\npositions and beamforming (BF) vectors under positioning constraints; 2)\nUAV-based macro-mobility: Jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and BF\nvectors under kinematic constraints. Extensive simulations reveal distinct\noperational regimes: MA micro-mobility demonstrates significant ASR advantages\nin low-transmit-power scenarios or under antenna constraints due to its\nenergy-efficient spatial control. Conversely, UAV macro-mobility excels under\nresource-sufficient conditions (higher power, larger antenna arrays) by\nleveraging global mobility for optimal positioning. The findings highlight the\ncomplementary strengths of both approaches, suggesting hybrid micro-macro\nmobility as a promising direction for balancing security, energy efficiency,\nand deployment complexity in future wireless networks.",

The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo\n(DSMC) method is required to estimate aerodynamic forces due to the breakdown\nof the continuum assumption. In DSMC, the Maxwell model is the most widely used\napproach for GSI. It simplifies the process by treating it as a superposition\nof diffuse and specular reflections while assuming a constant accommodation\ncoefficient. In reality, this coefficient is influenced by multiple factors,\nsuch as the angle and magnitude of the incident velocity. A high-precision GSI\nmodel could significantly improve satellite aerodynamics optimization and the\ndesign of efficient intakes for atmospheric breathing propulsion systems. This\nadvancement would greatly refine mission planning and fuel requirement\ncalculations, ultimately extending operational lifetimes and lowering costs. To\ngain a deep understanding of the GSI at the microscopic level, molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations provide valuable insights into the physical processes\ninvolved.

Instead, we use MD to analyze the impact of selected\nvelocity vectors on a amorphous $\\text{Al}_2\\text{O}_3$ surface. The obtained\nscattering kernels for the respective velocity vectors are then used to train a\nconditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE).

However, angiographic X-rays expose\npersonnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays,\nwhich are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to\nangiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by\nthe lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making\nhigh-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We\nfind that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and\nstruggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels,\nresulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as\ndisconnections or unnatural curvatures.

While most existing approaches focus on identifying\nvulnerable packages or libraries, they often overlook the specific functions\nresponsible for these vulnerabilities. Pinpointing vulnerable functions within\npackages or libraries is critical, as it can significantly reduce the risks\nassociated with using open-source software. Identifying vulnerable patches is\nchallenging because developers often submit code changes that are unrelated to\nvulnerability fixes.

To assess the model's\neffectiveness, we construct six code and generic code chunk based datasets\nusing two approaches: (1) integrating patch information with large language\nmodels to label vulnerable samples and (2) leveraging large language models\nalone to detect vulnerabilities in function-level code.

    "abstract": "A subcoloring of a graph is a partition of its vertex set into subsets\n(called colors), each inducing a disjoint union of cliques. It is a natural\ngeneralization of the classical proper coloring, in which each color must\ninstead induce an independent set. Similarly to proper coloring, we define the\nsubchromatic number of a graph as the minimum integer k such that it admits a\nsubcoloring with k colors, and the corresponding problem k-Subcoloring which\nasks whether a graph has subchromatic number at most k. In this paper, we\ninitiate the study of the subcoloring of (unit) disk graphs. One motivation\nstems from the fact that disk graphs can be seen as a dense generalization of\nplanar graphs where, intuitively, each vertex can be blown into a large\nclique--much like subcoloring generalizes proper coloring. Interestingly, it\ncan be observed that every unit disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most 7\ncolors. We first prove that the subchromatic number can be 3-approximated in\npolynomial-time in unit disk graphs. We then present several hardness results\nfor special cases of unit disk graphs which somehow prevents the use of\nclassical approaches for improving this result. We show in particular that\n2-subcoloring remains NP-hard in triangle-free unit disk graphs, as well as in\nunit disk graphs representable within a strip of bounded height. We also solve\nan open question of Broersma, Fomin, Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il, and Woeginger (2002) by\nproving that 3-Subcoloring remains NP-hard in co-comparability graphs. Finally,\nwe prove that every $n$-vertex disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most\n$O(\\log^3(n))$ colors and present a $O(\\log^2(n))$-approximation algorithm for\ncomputing the subchromatic number of such graphs. This is achieved by defining\na decomposition and a special type of co-comparability disk graph, called\n$\\Delta$-disk graphs, which might be of independent interest.",

Unlike\ntraditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each\ntoken depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency\nmakes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can\nsignificantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this\npaper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token\nsimilarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage\nchannels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is\ncombinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with\nlookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces\nthe residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the\nmessage-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain\ntoken packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a\nlookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates\nwithout replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates\nsampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.\nExperiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned\nimages) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores\ncomparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up\nto 40$\\times$.

This transition has the potential for the converter to\ntransiently lose synchronization due to such current saturation. Therefore,\nthis paper proposes an alternative current saturation algorithm to improve\ntransient synchronization stability during mode switching. The algorithm is\ndesigned for grid-forming converters to meet low-voltage ride-through (LVRT)\nrequirements and grid-fault standards in addition to transient synchronization\nstability. Moreover, it limits the converter output current during grid faults\nwith a new control parameter. The presented method introduces converter output\nvirtual fluxes to calculate the current references in the d- and q-axes for the\ncurrent saturation algorithm to enhance LVRT performance and grid stability.\nThe method exploits the correlation between the converter's virtual fluxes and\ncurrents to modify the current saturation levels through real-time converter\nvirtual flux estimation. The adaptive saturation levels ensure precise control\nand high dynamics during grid faults and facilitate optimal power injection or\nabsorption to support the grid. The proposed current-saturation algorithm is\nanalytically evaluated. Further, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

Gradient integration is a building block in\nthe attribution analysis by integrating the gradients from multiple derived\nsamples to highlight the semantic features relevant to inferences. Such a\nbuilding block often combines with other information from visual models such as\nactivation or attention maps to form ultimate explanations. Yet, our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that the extent to the alignment of the\nsample distribution in gradient integration with respect to natural image\ndistribution gives a lower bound of explanation certainty. Prior works add\nnoise into images as samples and the noise distributions can lead to low\nexplanation certainty. Counter-intuitively, our experiment shows that extra\ninformation can saturate neural networks. To this end, building trustworthy\nattribution analysis needs to settle the sample distribution misalignment\nproblem. Instead of adding extra information into input images, we present a\nsemi-optimal sampling approach by suppressing features from inputs. The sample\ndistribution by suppressing features is approximately identical to the\ndistribution of natural images. Our extensive quantitative evaluation on large\nscale dataset ImageNet affirms that our approach is effective and able to yield\nmore satisfactory explanations against state-of-the-art baselines throughout\nall experimental models.",

The\nmethodology's ability to quantify ANS-induced changes in AV node conduction\nproperties was evaluated by analyzing ECG data from 21 patients in AF\nundergoing a tilt test protocol.\n  The estimated refractory period and conduction delay matched the simulated\nground truth based on ECG recordings with a mean absolute error ($\\pm$ std) of\n169$\\pm$14 ms for the refractory period in the fast pathway; 131$\\pm$13 ms for\nthe conduction delay in the fast pathway; 67$\\pm$10 ms for the refractory\nperiod in the slow pathway; and 178$\\pm$28 ms for the conduction delay in the\nslow pathway.

We formulate the SEVRP-T as a\ntwo-stage stochastic mixed-integer second-order cone model, where the first\nstage determines the sequences of customers to be visited, and the second stage\nincorporates charging activities. The objective is to minimize the expected\ntotal duration of the routes, composed by travel times and recharging\noperations. To cope with the computational complexity of the model, we propose\na heuristic based on an Iterated Local Search (ILS) procedure coupled with a\nSet Partitioning problem. To further speed up the heuristic, we develop two\nlower bounds on the corresponding first-stage customer sequences. Furthermore,\nto handle a large number of energy consumption scenarios, we employ a scenario\nreduction technique. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed solution strategy and to assess the\nimportance of considering the stochastic nature of the energy consumption.

    "abstract": "Soft robots, compared to rigid robots, possess inherent advantages, including\nhigher degrees of freedom, compliance, and enhanced safety, which have\ncontributed to their increasing application across various fields. Among these\nbenefits, adaptability is particularly noteworthy. In this paper, adaptability\nin soft robots is categorized into external and internal adaptability. External\nadaptability refers to the robot's ability to adjust, either passively or\nactively, to variations in environments, object properties, geometries, and\ntask dynamics. Internal adaptability refers to the robot's ability to cope with\ninternal variations, such as manufacturing tolerances or material aging, and to\ngeneralize control strategies across different robots. As the field of soft\nrobotics continues to evolve, the significance of adaptability has become\nincreasingly pronounced. In this review, we summarize various approaches to\nenhancing the adaptability of soft robots, including design, sensing, and\ncontrol strategies. Additionally, we assess the impact of adaptability on\napplications such as surgery, wearable devices, locomotion, and manipulation.\nWe also discuss the limitations of soft robotics adaptability and prospective\ndirections for future research. By analyzing adaptability through the lenses of\nimplementation, application, and challenges, this paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive understanding of this essential characteristic in soft robotics\nand its implications for diverse applications.",

If the distance between the new\nreadings and the base readings falls within an acceptable threshold, then the\nuser is successfully authenticated. Various methods exist for comparing time\nseries data, such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and the Time Warp Edit Distance\n(TWED), each offering advantages and drawbacks depending on the context.\nMoreover, many of these techniques do not inherently preserve privacy, which is\na critical consideration in biometric authentication due to the complexity of\nresetting biometric credentials.\n  In this work, we propose ZK-SERIES to provide privacy and efficiency to a\nbroad spectrum of time series-based authentication protocols. ZK-SERIES uses\nthe same building blocks, i.e., zero-knowledge multiplication proofs and\nefficiently batched range proofs, to ensure consistency across all protocols.\nFurthermore, it is optimized for compatibility with low-capacity devices such\nas smartphones.

Previous research suffers from the\nproblems raised from camera motion, occlusion, large tissue deformation, lack\nof tissue-specific biomechanical priors, and reliance on offline processing.\nUnlike previous studies where the tissue geometry and deformation are\nrepresented by 3D points and displacements, the proposed method models tissue\ngeometry as the 3D point and derivative map and tissue deformation as the 3D\ndisplacement and local deformation map. For a single surface point, 6\nparameters are used to describe its rigid motion and 3 parameters for its local\ndeformation. The method is formulated under the camera-centric setting, where\nall motions are regarded as the scene motion with respect to the camera.\nInter-frame alignment is realized by optimizing the inter-frame deformation,\nmaking it unnecessary to estimate camera pose. The concept of the canonical map\nis introduced to optimize tissue geometry and deformation in an online\napproach. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were conducted using in vivo\nand ex vivo laparoscopic datasets. With the inputs of depth and optical flow,\nthe method stably models tissue geometry and deformation even when the tissue\nis partially occluded or moving outside the field of view. Results show that\nthe 3D reconstruction accuracy in the non-occluded and occluded areas reaches\n0.37$\\pm$0.27 mm and 0.39$\\pm$0.21 mm in terms of surface distance,\nrespectively.

This paper proposes an\nintelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe\nextraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE\nmetric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual\nsensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy.\nThe QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming\n(MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational\nresources under horizon-fairness constraints.

Existing\ndefense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which\nrequires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense\nperformance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective\ndefense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of\nPVA.

Finally, the \"data comments\"\nare replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to\nresponding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the\nattack fails.

    "abstract": "We present CID-GraphRAG (Conversational Intent-Driven Graph Retrieval\nAugmented Generation), a novel framework that addresses the limitations of\nexisting dialogue systems in maintaining both contextual coherence and\ngoal-oriented progression in multi-turn customer service conversations. Unlike\ntraditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation\nRAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic\nintent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements\na dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph\ntraversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to\nsimultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual\nsemantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In\nextensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both\nautomatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG\nsignificantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based\nGraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG\ndemonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic\nmetrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and\nmost notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge\nevaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent\ntransition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that\nneither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an\neffective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual\ncoherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn\ndialogues.",

    "abstract": "Electromagnetic structure (EMS) design plays a critical role in developing\nadvanced antennas and materials, but remains challenging due to\nhigh-dimensional design spaces and expensive evaluations. While existing\nmethods commonly employ high-quality predictors or generators to alleviate\nevaluations, they are often data-intensive and struggle with real-world scale\nand budget constraints. To address this, we propose a novel method called\nProgressive Quadtree-based Search (PQS). Rather than exhaustively exploring the\nhigh-dimensional space, PQS converts the conventional image-like layout into a\nquadtree-based hierarchical representation, enabling a progressive search from\nglobal patterns to local details. Furthermore, to lessen reliance on highly\naccurate predictors, we introduce a consistency-driven sample selection\nmechanism. This mechanism quantifies the reliability of predictions, balancing\nexploitation and exploration when selecting candidate designs. We evaluate PQS\non two real-world engineering tasks, i.e., Dual-layer Frequency Selective\nSurface and High-gain Antenna. Experimental results show that our method can\nachieve satisfactory designs under limited computational budgets, outperforming\nbaseline methods. In particular, compared to generative approaches, it cuts\nevaluation costs by 75-85%, effectively saving 20.27-38.80 days of product\ndesigning cycle.",

While conventional phase shifter-based beamformers\nmay offer partial mitigation, True Time Delay (TTD) units provide a\nfundamentally more effective solution by enabling frequency-independent beam\nsteering. However, the high cost of TTD units has recently driven much interest\nin Sparse-TTD architectures, which combine a limited number of TTDs with a\nhigher number of conventional phase shifters to balance performance and cost.\nThis paper provides a critical examination of beam squint mitigation strategies\nin wideband hybrid beamformers, comparing Full-TTD, Sparse-TTD, and Non-TTD\narchitectures.

In this star-forming subsample,\nbar length increases by 10 percent from 3.6 um to g band, and by 17 percent to\nJ0378 band; moreover, the bar can appear up to 20${-}$30 percent longer in\nbluer mocks than in the mass map. Over 90 percent of bars vanish in UV due to\nminimal emission by dominant stellar populations. We reproduced the bar\nproperties morphological dependence phenomenon using age-filtered mass maps,\nwhere older stars form shorter, rounder bars, and younger stars generate\nlonger, more elliptical ones. TNG50 bars exhibit a wavelength-dependent trend\nsimilar to observations: bars appear more elliptical and longer in bluer\nfilters, with this effect being stronger in star-forming galaxies.",

    "abstract": "In radiobiological experiments, the cells can either float in suspension or\nadhere to the walls of the sample holder. When irradiation is performed in the\npresence of dose modifying agents such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), the\ndifferent shapes of the floating or adherent cells may imply a different dose\nto the nucleus, with biological consequences such as cell survival. Recently,\nit has been reported that the survival rate varies by up to a factor of 1.5 for\nthe two cell geometries and by up to a factor of 2 for different orientation of\nthe cells with respect to the incident beam. These results are examined in this\npaper and possible methodological issues are analyzed. This analysis shows that\nthe simulation setup corresponds to the case of cells in the dose build-up\nregion near the surface of a water phantom, where different depths result in\ndifferent dose and survival probabilities. The validation of the simulations by\ncomparison with experimental data is misleading, as the apparent agreement is\ndue to a neglect of the quadratic term of the linear-quadratic survival model.\nThe analysis further shows that the reported step-like changes between the\nsurvival predicted from the mean dose and the LEM could be explained by the\nfact that in the entire simulation only in one event an ionizing interaction of\na photon took place in an AuNP. It is shown that the probability of this is in\nthe permille range and that the total number of electrons leaving an AuNP,\nestimated from the reported electron spectrum, is three orders of magnitude\nhigher than the value estimated from the expectation of photon interactions in\nthe AuNPs. This contradiction would be resolved if the AuNP diameter in the\nsimulations were a factor of 10 larger than intended. Another possible\nexplanation for the discrepancies is a hidden bias in the simulation geometry,\nfor example, if the distribution of AuNPs was non-uniform.",

The diffusion fluxes of the\ngoverning equations are directly approximated by a high-order finite difference\nscheme based on the Hermite interpolation.

These improvements effectively address key limitations\nobserved in the DCNv2, including information loss in Cross layers, implicit\nmanagement of collisions through learnable lookup-level weights, and explicit\nmodeling of pairwise similarities with a custom layer that emulates FFMs'\nbehavior.

    "abstract": "In real-world settings of the Deferred Acceptance stable matching algorithm,\nsuch as the American medical residency match (NRMP), school choice programs,\nand various national university entrance systems, candidates need to decide\nwhich programs to list. In many of these settings there is an initial phase of\ninterviews or information gathering which affect the preferences on one or both\nsides. We ask: which interviews should candidates seek? We study this question\nin a model, introduced by Lee (2016) and modified by Allman and Ashlagi (2023),\nwith preferences based on correlated cardinal utilities.\n  We describe a distributed, low-communication strategy for the doctors and\nstudents, which lead to non-match rates of $e^{(-\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{k}))}$ in\nthe residency setting and $e^{(-\\widetilde{O}(k))}$ in the school-choice\nsetting, where $k$ is the number of interviews per doctor in the first setting,\nand the number of proposals per student in the second setting; these bounds do\nnot apply to the agents with the lowest public ratings, the bottommost agents,\nwho may not fare as well. We also obtain bounds on the expected utilities each\nnon-bottommost agent obtains.\n  These results are parameterized by the capacity of the hospital programs and\nschools. Larger capacities improve the outcome for the hospitals and schools,\nbut don't significantly affect the outcomes of the doctors or students.\nFinally, in the school choice setting we obtain an $\\epsilon$-Nash type\nequilibrium for the students apart from the bottommost ones; importantly, the\nequilibrium holds regardless of the actions of the bottommost students. We also\ndiscuss to what extent this result extends to the residency setting. We\ncomplement our theoretical results with an experimental study that shows the\nasymptotic results hold for real-world values of $n$.",

Accurate\nmodeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward\npropagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and\ncoupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier\nNeural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while\npreserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets\nfrom the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and\nionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to\nWACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide\none year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively\npredicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds,\ntemperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling\napproaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET\nintroduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction\nfrom core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary\nphysical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables\nare predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for\nefficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational\ncost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model.

These methods also typically require complete data modalities,\nlimiting their clinical applicability with incomplete modalities, such as\nmissing either pathology or genomic data.

Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel\nparadigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by\ntransmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task\nperformance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining\ntask accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In\nsuch attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by\nanalyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based\nnature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality\nindicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be\ninadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences\ndo not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a\ndiffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes\nsemantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with\nself-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our\nmodel also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion\nto ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio\nenvironments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric\nthat better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary.\nExperimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset,\nDiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable\nperformance under dynamic channels.

The non-Markovianity measure N_C shows\nmemory effects persisting at low temperatures but diminishing at high\ntemperatures due to enhanced damping.

Under the MMDA setting, the samples\nin both domains have all the modalities. In two newly proposed modules of our\nPMC, the multiple modalities are cooperated for selecting the reliable\npseudo-labeled target samples, which captures the modality-specific information\nand modality-integrated information, respectively. Under the MMDA-PI setting,\nsome modalities are missing in the target domain. Hence, to better exploit the\nmulti-modality data in the source domain, we further propose the PMC with\nprivileged information (PMC-PI) method by proposing a new multi-modality data\ngeneration (MMG) network. MMG generates the missing modalities in the target\ndomain based on the source domain data by considering both domain distribution\nmismatch and semantics preservation, which are respectively achieved by using\nadversarial learning and conditioning on weighted pseudo semantics. Extensive\nexperiments on three image datasets and eight video datasets for various\nmulti-modality cross-domain visual recognition tasks under both MMDA and\nMMDA-PI settings clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PMC\nframework.",

    "abstract": "The chain of contagion task (CCT) is a pychological test to measure the\namount of contagious beliefs in individuals. Contagious beliefs thereby refer\nto the perception that certain objects, people, or substances can transmit\ncontamination through mere contact or proximity (Rozin et al., 1986). In the\nCCT, a neutral object (usually a pen) is rubbed against an inherently\ndisgusting object (e.g. a toilet paper with feces) and participants are asked\nhow contaminated this pen is on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very\ncontaminated). Afterwards, this pen is rubbed against another pen, and again,\nthe experienced degree of contamination is assessed. This is repeated 12 times.\nThe CCT has first been experimentally investigated by Tolin et al. (2004) in an\nin vivo procedure with real disgusting objects. The authors could show that\ncontagious beliefs measured with the CCT show a strong bias for people with\ncontamination-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (C-OCD) compared to anxious\nindividuals and non-anxious controls. Fink-Lamotte et al. (2024) replicated\nthese findings with an online version of the CCT using audio-imagery-based and\nvideo-based stimuli and instructions. Both studies used 12 pens to assess the\ndegree of contagious beliefs. Within this brief report, we show that after 8\npens, hardly any additional variance is explained between participants and\nafter the tenth pen, no new information is gained. Thus, we recommend only\nusing 8 pens instead of 12 when using the CCT to assess contagious beliefs.",

Inspired by\nthe idea of structural state space equations, FlightKooba directly constructs\nthe Koopman operators from data.

    "abstract": "Platooning within autonomous vehicles has proven effective in addressing\ndriver shortages and reducing fuel consumption. However, as platooning lengths\nincrease, traditional C-V2X (cellular vehicle-to-everything) architectures are\nsusceptible to end-to-end (E2E) latency increases. This is due to the necessity\nof relaying information through multiple hops from the leader vehicle to the\nlast vehicle. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid\ncommunication architecture based on a simulation that integrates light fidelity\n(LiFi) and C-V2X. The proposed architecture introduces multiple-leader vehicles\nequipped with outdoor LiFi communication nodes in platoons to achieve\nhigh-speed and low-delay communication between leader vehicles, which reduces\nE2E delay.",

This paper demonstrates that adversarial attacks, carefully crafted\nFDIAs, can evade existing DLSs used for FDIA detection in Line Current\nDifferential Relays (LCDRs). We propose a novel adversarial attack framework,\nutilizing the Fast Gradient Sign Method, which exploits DLS vulnerabilities by\nintroducing small perturbations to LCDR remote measurements, leading to\nmisclassification of the FDIA as a legitimate fault while also triggering the\nLCDR to trip. We evaluate the robustness of multiple deep learning models,\nincluding multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, long\nshort-term memory networks, and residual networks, under adversarial\nconditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that while these models\nperform well, they exhibit high degrees of vulnerability to adversarial\nattacks. For some models, the adversarial attack success rate exceeds 99.7%. To\naddress this threat, we introduce adversarial training as a proactive defense\nmechanism, significantly enhancing the models' ability to withstand adversarial\nFDIAs without compromising fault detection accuracy.

In recent years,\nimages have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image\nrecognition models.

Many\nexisting models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image\ncompression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully\ndesigning the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant\non their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently\nconsidered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and\ninterpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual\ncompression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding\nmethods such as JPEG2000.

The high penetration of\nrenewable energy and the wide application of inverter-based resources make the\noperating conditions of renewable power systems more volatile, which urges the\nadoption of the online relay setting calculation strategy. However, the\ncomputation speed of existing EOCS methods based on local enumeration,\nheuristic algorithms, and mathematical programming cannot meet the efficiency\nrequirement of online relay setting calculation. To reduce the time overhead,\nthis paper, for the first time, proposes an efficient deep learning-based EOCS\nmethod suitable for online relay setting calculation. First, the power system\ninformation is formulated as four layers, i.e., a component parameter layer, a\ntopological connection layer, an electrical distance layer, and a graph\ndistance layer, which are fed into a parallel graph neural network (PGNN) model\nfor feature extraction. Then, the four feature layers corresponding to each\nnode are spliced and stretched, and then fed into the decision network to\npredict the extreme operating condition of the system. Finally, the proposed\nPGNN method is validated on the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems,\nwhere some of the synchronous generators are replaced by renewable generation\nunits.

    "abstract": "Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned\nsurface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed\ndecisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on\ninstance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).\nHowever, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception\ndatasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,\nlimiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the\nadvancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to\nintroduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for\nwaterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region\nlong-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual\ngeo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k\nimage-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose\nDa Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we\npropose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor\n(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for\nboth global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby\nsignificantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual\noutputs.

    "abstract": "Symbolic execution is a widely used technique for test generation, offering\nsystematic exploration of program paths through constraint solving. However, it\nis fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code\nincluding library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability\nof underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex\nfeatures remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test\ninputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths\nand often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting\nan LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In\nthis paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic\npath enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates\npossible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an\nexecutable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This\navoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead\nconstructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the\nfirst to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage\nalongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they\nexercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend\nhelps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are\nactually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and\nvisualization of their path profiles.",

The QPOs frequencies evolve from $\\sim 1.6 - 3.6$ Hz, and\nQRMs have low frequencies around 0.05 - 0.07 Hz. The reflection fraction varies\nduring the outburst and has a positive correlation with the hardness ratio when\nQPOs are detected. The centroid frequency of QPOs is anti-correlated to the\nreflection fraction. This is consistent with the prediction of precessing inner\nflow model and provides evidence for a geometrical origin of QPOs. The centroid\nfrequency of QRMs also shows an anti-correlation to the reflection fraction,\nbut the hardness ratio shows no relation to the reflection fraction during the\nperiod.

Soft happy colouring of a partially coloured graph $G$ is the problem of\nfinding a vertex colouring $\\sigma$ that preserves the precolouring and has the\nmaximum number of $\\rho$-happy vertices. It is already known that this problem\nis NP-hard and directly relates to the community structure of the graphs; under\na certain condition on the proportion of happiness $\\rho$ and for graphs with\ncommunity structures, the induced colouring by communities can make all the\nvertices $\\rho$-happy.

A large deviation upgrade,\nsfl LD RDT [96,97], moves things further and enables \\emph{atypical} features\ncharacterizations as well. Utilizing the machinery of [96,97] we here develop a\ngeneric framework to study LE as an ABP's atypical feature. Already on the\nsecond level of lifting we discover that the LE results are closely matching\nthose obtained through replica methods. For classical zero threshold ABP, we\nobtain that LE breaks down for $\\alpha$ in $(0.77,0.78)$ interval which\nbasically matches $\\alpha\\sim 0.75-0.77$ range that currently best ABP solvers\ncan handle and effectively indicates that LE's behavior might indeed be among\nkey reflections of the ABP's computational gaps presumable existence.",

Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current\nhardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks\ndue to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis\n(qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and\nqubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian\ngeometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs\ninherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves\nthe neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent\nspace, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We\nderive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding\nonto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10\nshow that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and\nhybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance\nto reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML\nclassification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST\nand Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on\nreal hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient\nperformance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.",

The surface entrapment process is\ndivided into three main stages. Initially, bacteria swim towards the surface at\nan approach velocity proportional to the motor rotation frequency.\nSubsequently, during the reorientation stage, the cotangent of the inclination\nangle decays exponentially with the product of the motor rotation frequency and\ntime. Finally, the combined effect of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and\nDLVO forces drives the bacteria to a stable fixed point $(h^{*},\\Psi^{*})$ near\nthe surface. Bacteria with left-handed chiral flagella exhibit clockwise\ncircular motion on the surface. The stable height, inclination angle, and\nradius of curvature of these circular trajectories are collectively determined\nby the flagellar morphology and ionic strength of the electrolyte solution.\nMore precisely, increasing the contour length of the flagellum decreases the\nstable inclination angle and increases the radius of curvature. In contrast,\ndecreasing the ionic strength increases the stable height and radius of\ncurvature, while also decreasing the stable inclination angle. Typically, the\nstable inclination angle falls within $(\\pi/2,\\pi)$, the stable height ranges\nfrom a few nanometers to approximately one hundred nanometers, and the radius\nof curvature of the circular motion spans several to tens of micrometers.",

We show that these two learning strategies can be uniformly\nformulated as domain classifier learning with positive or negative weights on\nthe losses.

    "abstract": "While the efficacy of deep learning models heavily relies on data, gathering\nand annotating data for specific tasks, particularly when addressing novel or\nsensitive subjects lacking relevant datasets, poses significant time and\nresource challenges. In response to this, we propose a novel Automated Image\nRecognition (AIR) framework that harnesses the power of generative AI. AIR\nempowers end-users to synthesize high-quality, pre-annotated datasets,\neliminating the necessity for manual labeling. It also automatically trains\ndeep learning models on the generated datasets with robust image recognition\nperformance. Our framework includes two main data synthesis processes, AIR-Gen\nand AIR-Aug. The AIR-Gen enables end-users to seamlessly generate datasets\ntailored to their specifications. To improve image quality, we introduce a\nnovel automated prompt engineering module that leverages the capabilities of\nlarge language models. We also introduce a distribution adjustment algorithm to\neliminate duplicates and outliers, enhancing the robustness and reliability of\ngenerated datasets. On the other hand, the AIR-Aug enhances a given dataset,\nthereby improving the performance of deep classifier models. AIR-Aug is\nparticularly beneficial when users have limited data for specific tasks.\nThrough comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the efficacy of our\ngenerated data in training deep learning models and showcased the system's\npotential to provide image recognition models for a wide range of objects. We\nalso conducted a user study that achieved an impressive score of 4.4 out of\n5.0, underscoring the AI community's positive perception of AIR.",

We conduct the first\ncomprehensive analysis of topology-based privacy leakage across realistic\nadversarial knowledge scenarios, demonstrating that adversaries with varying\ndegrees of structural knowledge can infer sensitive data distribution patterns\neven under strong differential privacy guarantees. Through systematic\nevaluation of 4,720 attack instances, we analyze six distinct adversarial\nknowledge scenarios: complete topology knowledge and five partial knowledge\nconfigurations reflecting real-world deployment constraints. We propose three\ncomplementary attack vectors: communication pattern analysis, parameter\nmagnitude profiling, and structural position correlation, achieving success\nrates of 84.1%, 65.0%, and 47.2% under complete knowledge conditions.\nCritically, we find that 80% of realistic partial knowledge scenarios maintain\nattack effectiveness above security thresholds, with certain partial knowledge\nconfigurations achieving performance superior to the baseline complete\nknowledge scenario. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose and\nempirically validate structural noise injection as a complementary defense\nmechanism across 808 configurations, demonstrating up to 51.4% additional\nattack reduction when properly layered with existing privacy techniques.

However, a direct\nexperimental characterization of individual defect environments is not\nscalable, as spin bath measurements are extremely time consuming. In this work,\nwe address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering the atomic positions and\nhyperfine couplings of random nuclei surrounding spin-defects from sparse\nexperimental coherence signals, which can be obtained in hours. To address the\nchallenge to determine the number of isotopic nuclear spins along with their\nhyperfine couplings, we employ a trans-dimensional Bayesian approach that\nincorporates ab initio data. This approach provides posterior distributions of\nthe numbers, hyperfine couplings, and locations of nuclear spins present in the\nsample. In addition to enabling high-throughput screening of spin-defects, we\ndemonstrate how this trans-dimensional Bayesian approach can guide experimental\ndesign for dynamical decoupling experiments to detect nuclear spins within\ntargeted hyperfine coupling regimes. While the primary focus is on accelerating\nspin-defect characterization, this Bayesian approach also lays the foundation\nfor digital twin studies of spin-defects, where a virtual model of the\nspin-defect system evolves in real time with ongoing experimental measurements.\nTogether, the set of tools we designed and applied paves the way for scalable\ndeployment of spin-defects in semiconductors for quantum sensing and\ninformation applications.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention due to\ntheir event-driven and low-power characteristics, making them particularly\neffective for processing event-based neuromorphic data. Recent studies have\nshown that directly trained SNNs suffer from severe overfitting issues due to\nthe limited scale of neuromorphic datasets and the gradient mismatching\nproblem, which fundamentally constrain their generalization performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a temporal regularization training (TRT) method by\nintroducing a time-dependent regularization mechanism to enforce stronger\nconstraints on early timesteps. We compare the performance of TRT with other\nstate-of-the-art methods performance on datasets including CIFAR10/100,\nImageNet100, DVS-CIFAR10, and N-Caltech101. To validate the effectiveness of\nTRT, we conducted ablation studies and analyses including loss landscape\nvisualization and learning curve analysis, demonstrating that TRT can\neffectively mitigate overfitting and flatten the training loss landscape,\nthereby enhancing generalizability. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical\ninterpretation of TRT's temporal regularization mechanism based on the results\nof Fisher information analysis. We analyze the temporal information dynamics\ninside SNNs by tracking Fisher information during the TRT training process,\nrevealing the Temporal Information Concentration (TIC) phenomenon, where Fisher\ninformation progressively concentrates in early timesteps. The time-decaying\nregularization mechanism implemented in TRT effectively guides the network to\nlearn robust features in early timesteps with rich information, thereby leading\nto significant improvements in model generalization.

Because the fundamental frequency (F0), a\nphysical correlate of pitch, is one of the essential features of speech, there\nhas been particular interest in characterizing the FFR at F0, especially when\nF0 varies over time. The standard method for extracting F0 in FFRs has been the\nAutocorrelation Function (ACF). This paper investigates\nharmonic-structure-based F0 estimation algorithms, originally developed for\nspeech and music, and resolves their poor performance when applied to FFRs in\ntwo steps. Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs\nis already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively\naggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at\nnon-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation\n(HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus\nF0. Secondly, unlike other pitch tracking methods that select the highest peak,\nour method chooses the most prominent one, as it better reflects the underlying\nperiodicity of FFRs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to\npropose an F0 estimation algorithm for FFRs that relies on harmonic structure.\nAnalyzing recorded FFRs from 16 normal hearing subjects to 4 natural speech\nstimuli with a wide F0 variation from 89 Hz to 452 Hz showed that this method\noutperformed ACF by reducing the average Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) within\neach response and stimulus F0 contour pair by 8.8% to 47.4%, depending on the\nstimulus.",

Notably, it attains a minimum at dimension 7,\ncoinciding with the dimension at which the volume of the unit sphere is\nmaximized. This reflects a unique regime of maximal spatial diffuseness and\nminimal inferential sensitivity, arising from the interplay between weakening\ncurvature and still-latent concentration. The alignment between volumetric and\nstatistical extrema reveals a deeper duality between geometry and information.\nWe also analyze the characteristic function, which exhibits a dichotomy: in\neven dimensions, it takes rational-exponential form, while in odd dimensions it\ninvolves Bessel and Struve functions. This distinction reflects differences in\nharmonic structure and boundary regularity across dimensions.

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions\nthrough retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a\nvectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.\nHowever, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in\npractical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of\nground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper\nproposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify\nresponses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized\ndatabase. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and\nutilizing the probability of generating \"Yes\" tokens from the outputs of\nmultiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,\nhallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through\nexperiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,\nand contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.\nThe results demonstrate a 10\\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct\nresponses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language\nmodels can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a\nscalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Behavior Cloning (BC) is an effective imitation learning technique and has\neven been adopted in some safety-critical domains such as autonomous vehicles.\nBC trains a policy to mimic the behavior of an expert by using a dataset\ncomposed of only state-action pairs demonstrated by the expert, without any\nadditional interaction with the environment. However, During deployment, the\npolicy observations may contain measurement errors or adversarial disturbances.\nSince the observations may deviate from the true states, they can mislead the\nagent into making sub-optimal actions. In this work, we use a global Lipschitz\nregularization approach to enhance the robustness of the learned policy\nnetwork. We then show that the resulting global Lipschitz property provides a\nrobustness certificate to the policy with respect to different bounded norm\nperturbations. Then, we propose a way to construct a Lipschitz neural network\nthat ensures the policy robustness. We empirically validate our theory across\nvarious environments in Gymnasium.

    "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance gyroscopes (NMRGs) employ noble-gas nuclear spins\nas inertial sensors and alkali-metal atoms as in-situ magnetometers. Heavy\nnoble gases, particularly xenon, are widely used due to their large nuclear\nspin and strong spin-exchange coupling with alkali-metal atoms. However, their\npresence introduces additional collisional mechanisms that affect the\nalkali-metal magnetic resonance linewidth, thereby influencing magnetometer\nsensitivity and overall gyro performance. In this work, we develop a\ntheoretical framework based on the density matrix formalism and master equation\napproach to quantitatively study how xenon-induced two-body and three-body\ninteractions modify the linewidth of alkali-metal atoms under realistic NMRG\nconditions. Our analysis reveals that Xe atoms primarily broaden the linewidth\nvia binary spindestruction collisions and van der Waals (vdW)-mediated\nF-damping processes, while the effect of Xe nuclear polarization is negligible\nat the ~1% level. We further demonstrate that nitrogen buffer gas plays a dual\nrole: it directly contributes to alkali-metal spin relaxation through binary\ncollisions and indirectly modulates vdW collision rates by altering molecular\nlifetimes. The interplay between these processes leads to an optimal nitrogen\ndensity that minimizes the linewidth. Additionally, we identify a temperature\nthreshold above which light-narrowing emerges, with this threshold increasing\nalongside Xe density. These findings provide theoretical insight for optimizing\nspin relaxation control in alkali-metal magnetometers and improving NMRG\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "A common paradigm to improve the performance of large language models is\noptimizing for a reward model. Reward models assign a numerical score to LLM\noutputs indicating, for example, which response would likely be preferred by a\nuser or is most aligned with safety goals. However, reward models are never\nperfect. They inevitably function as proxies for complex desiderata such as\ncorrectness, helpfulness, and safety. By overoptimizing for a misspecified\nreward, we can subvert intended alignment goals and reduce overall performance\n-- a phenomenon commonly referred to as reward hacking. In this work, we\ncharacterize reward hacking in inference-time alignment and demonstrate when\nand how we can mitigate it by hedging on the proxy reward. We study this\nphenomenon under Best-of-$n$ (BoN) and Soft-Best-of-$n$ (SBoN), and we\nintroduce Best-of-Poisson (BoP) that provides an efficient, near-exact\napproximation of the optimal reward-KL divergence policy at inference time. We\nshow that the characteristic pattern of hacking as observed in practice (where\nthe true reward first increases before declining) is an inevitable property of\na broad class of inference-time mechanisms, including BoN and BoP. To counter\nthis effect, hedging offers a tactical choice to avoid placing undue confidence\nin high but potentially misleading proxy reward signals. We introduce\nHedgeTune, an efficient algorithm to find the optimal inference-time parameter\nand avoid reward hacking. We demonstrate through experiments that hedging\nmitigates reward hacking and achieves superior distortion-reward tradeoffs with\nminimal computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used unsupervised\ndimensionality reduction technique in machine learning, applied across various\nfields such as bioinformatics, computer vision and finance. However, when the\nresponse variables are available, PCA does not guarantee that the derived\nprincipal components are informative to the response variables. Supervised PCA\n(SPCA) methods address this limitation by incorporating response variables into\nthe learning process, typically through an objective function similar to PCA.\nExisting SPCA methods do not adequately address the challenge of deriving\nprojections that are both interpretable and informative with respect to the\nresponse variable. The only existing approach attempting to overcome this,\nrelies on a mathematically complicated manifold optimization scheme, sensitive\nto hyperparameter tuning. We propose covariance-supervised principal component\nanalysis (CSPCA), a novel SPCA method that projects data into a\nlower-dimensional space by balancing (1) covariance between projections and\nresponses and (2) explained variance, controlled via a regularization\nparameter. The projection matrix is derived through a closed-form solution in\nthe form of a simple eigenvalue decomposition. To enhance computational\nefficiency for high-dimensional datasets, we extend CSPCA using the standard\nNystr\\\"om method. Simulations and real-world applications demonstrate that\nCSPCA achieves strong performance across numerous performance metrics.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the increasingly prominent problem of anomaly detection\nin distributed systems. It proposes a detection method based on federated\ncontrastive learning. The goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional\ncentralized approaches in terms of data privacy, node heterogeneity, and\nanomaly pattern recognition. The proposed method combines the distributed\ncollaborative modeling capabilities of federated learning with the feature\ndiscrimination enhancement of contrastive learning. It builds embedding\nrepresentations on local nodes and constructs positive and negative sample\npairs to guide the model in learning a more discriminative feature space.\nWithout exposing raw data, the method optimizes a global model through a\nfederated aggregation strategy. Specifically, the method uses an encoder to\nrepresent local behavior data in high-dimensional space. This includes system\nlogs, operational metrics, and system calls. The model is trained using both\ncontrastive loss and classification loss to improve its ability to detect\nfine-grained anomaly patterns. The method is evaluated under multiple typical\nattack types. It is also tested in a simulated real-time data stream scenario\nto examine its responsiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. It\ndemonstrates strong detection accuracy and adaptability, effectively addressing\ncomplex anomalies in distributed environments. Through careful design of key\nmodules and optimization of the training mechanism, the proposed method\nachieves a balance between privacy preservation and detection performance. It\noffers a feasible technical path for intelligent security management in\ndistributed systems.",

The measurement is based on\nevents detected in coincidence between the surface and in-ice detectors of the\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory. Air showers are recorded on the surface by\nIceTop, while a bundle of high-energy muons (\"TeV muons\") from the shower can\nsubsequently produce a track-like event in the IceCube in-ice array. Results\nare obtained assuming the hadronic interaction models Sibyll 2.1, QGSJet-II.04,\nand EPOS-LHC. The measured number of TeV muons is found to be in agreement with\npredictions from air-shower simulations. The results have also been compared to\na measurement of low-energy muons by IceTop, indicating an inconsistency\nbetween the predictions for low- and high-energy muons in simulations based on\nthe EPOS-LHC model.",

We reprocessed 224\nobservations totalling 75.02 hours from four clusters: Theia 1661, NGC 6259,\nPismis 3, and Trumpler 20. Our analysis identified five known pulsars and three\nnew rotating radio transient (RRAT) candidates. By comparing the measured\ndispersion measures (DMs) with the expected DM values for each cluster derived\nfrom YMW16 and NE2001 models, we conclude that most detected sources are likely\nbackground pulsars. However, RRAT J1749-25 in Theia 1661 and RRAT J1237-60 in\nTrumpler 20 have DMs reasonably close to their respective clusters, suggesting\npossible membership. The association between PSR J1750-2536 and Theia 1661\nremains ambiguous due to its intermediate DM. These candidate\ncluster-associated neutron stars warrant follow-up with more sensitive\ntelescopes such as MeerKAT or the SKA, potentially offering valuable insights\ninto neutron star retention mechanisms and evolution in open cluster\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Traditional recommendation systems often grapple with \"filter bubbles\",\nunderutilization of external knowledge, and a disconnect between model\noptimization and business policy iteration. To address these limitations, this\npaper introduces RecLLM-R1, a novel recommendation framework leveraging Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and drawing inspiration from the DeepSeek R1\nmethodology. The framework initiates by transforming user profiles, historical\ninteractions, and multi-faceted item attributes into LLM-interpretable natural\nlanguage prompts through a carefully engineered data construction process.\nSubsequently, a two-stage training paradigm is employed: the initial stage\ninvolves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to imbue the LLM with fundamental\nrecommendation capabilities. The subsequent stage utilizes Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning technique, augmented with\na Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism. This stage guides the model through\nmulti-step reasoning and holistic decision-making via a flexibly defined reward\nfunction, aiming to concurrently optimize recommendation accuracy, diversity,\nand other bespoke business objectives. Empirical evaluations on a real-world\nuser behavior dataset from a large-scale social media platform demonstrate that\nRecLLM-R1 significantly surpasses existing baseline methods across a spectrum\nof evaluation metrics, including accuracy, diversity, and novelty. It\neffectively mitigates the filter bubble effect and presents a promising avenue\nfor the integrated optimization of recommendation models and policies under\nintricate business goals.",

In this quantitative study, we benchmark over\n20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive\nexperiments.

Our experiments\ninvestigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training\nepoch selection strategies on detection performance.

Our research focused on the identification\nand characterisation of galaxies in the ZoA, using the new near-infrared data\nfrom the VVVX survey in the regions that cover the southern Galactic disc. We\nused our previously-established procedure based on photometric and\nmorphological criteria to identify galaxies. The large data volume collected by\nthe VVVX required alternatives to visual inspection, including artificial\nintelligence techniques, such as classifiers based on neural networks. The VVV\nNIR galaxy catalogue is presented, covering the southern Galactic disc,\nsignificantly extending the vision down to $K^0_s=16$ mag throughout the ZoA.\nThis catalogue provides positions, photometric and morphological parameters for\na total of 167,559 galaxies with their probabilities determined by the CNN and\nXGBoost algorithms based on image and photometric data, respectively. The\nconstruction of the catalogue involves the employment of optimal probability\ncriteria. 14% of these galaxies were confirmed by visual inspection or by\nmatching with previous catalogues. The peculiarities exhibited by distinct\nregions across the Galactic disc, along with the characteristics of the\ngalaxies, are thoroughly examined. The catalogue serves as a valuable resource\nfor extragalactic studies within the ZoA, providing a crucial complement to the\nforthcoming radio catalogues and future surveys utilizing the Vera C.~Rubin\nObservatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. We present a deep galaxy\nmap, covering a 1080 sq. deg. region, which reveals that the apparent galaxy\ndensity is predominantly influenced by foreground extinction from the Milky\nWay.

To this end, we characterize resonances of the\nscattering problem as eigenvalues of a holomorphic integral operator-valued\nfunction. This allows us to define defective resonances and associated\nexceptional points based on the geometric and algebraic multiplicities. Based\non the theory on holomorphic Fredholm operator-valued functions, we show\nfractional-order sensitivity of defective resonances with respect to operator\nperturbation. This property is particularly important in physics and associated\nwith intriguing phenomena, e.g., enhanced sensing and dissipation. A defective\nresonance is sought based on the perturbation analysis and Nystr\\\"om\ndiscretization of the boundary integral equation.

This makes it difficult for current models to achieve both\nstrong performance and high efficiency in long video understanding. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Video-XL-2, a novel MLLM that delivers superior\ncost-effectiveness for long-video understanding based on task-aware KV\nsparsification. The proposed framework operates with two key steps: chunk-based\npre-filling and bi-level key-value decoding. Chunk-based pre-filling divides\nthe visual token sequence into chunks, applying full attention within each\nchunk and sparse attention across chunks. This significantly reduces\ncomputational and memory overhead. During decoding, bi-level key-value decoding\nselectively reloads either dense or sparse key-values for each chunk based on\nits relevance to the task. This approach further improves memory efficiency and\nenhances the model's ability to capture fine-grained information. Video-XL-2\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on various long video understanding\nbenchmarks, outperforming existing open-source lightweight models.

    "abstract": "The objective of graph coarsening is to generate smaller, more manageable\ngraphs while preserving key information of the original graph. Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening\nmethods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to\nhundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost\nalways higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and\ngeneralization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to\nbecome a standard graph data preprocessing method.",

    "abstract": "Turbulent flows over canopies of rigid elements with different geometries and\nReynolds numbers (Re) are investigated to identify and characterise different\ncanopy density regimes. In the sparse regime, turbulence penetrates relatively\nunhindered within the canopy, whereas in the dense regime, the penetration is\nlimited. A common measure of canopy density is the ratio of frontal to bed\narea, the frontal density $\\lambda_f$. This is effective for canopies with no\npreferential orientation, but we observe that it does not accurately predict\nthe density regime for less conventional ones, so it may not encapsulate the\ngoverning physics. Instead, we propose density metrics based on the position\nand extent of eddies of intense Reynolds shear stress. We analyse a series of\ndirect simulations for isotropic and anisotropic layouts, across a range of\n$\\lambda_f$, height, element width-to-pitch ratio and Re. Canopies with\nstreamwise-packed elements but large spanwise gaps allow significant turbulence\npenetration, and appear sparse compared to isotropic or spanwise-packed\ncanopies with the same $\\lambda_f$. Turbulence penetration depends essentially\non the spanwise gap, and increases with it, but depends also on Re. A canopy\ncan behave as dense at low Re, but as sparser as Re increases. This suggests\nthat turbulence penetration depends on the size of the spanwise gap relative to\nthe typical width of the overlying eddies. Turbulence penetrates easily when\nthe spanwise gap is larger than the eddy size, and is essentially precluded\nfrom penetrating in the opposite case. A penetration length can then be defined\nthat is of the order of the spanwise gap or the eddy size, whichever is\nsmaller. If the penetration length is small compared to the canopy height, the\ncanopy behaves as dense; if it is comparable, as intermediate; and if it is\nroughly equal or larger, as sparse.",

    "abstract": "Dexterous robotic hands are essential for performing complex manipulation\ntasks, yet remain difficult to train due to the challenges of demonstration\ncollection and high-dimensional control. While reinforcement learning (RL) can\nalleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it\ntypically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which\nhinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous\nmanipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These\ntrajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL\npolicies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However,\nsourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a\nsignificant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference\ntrajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our\nkey insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the\ncommonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide\nexploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., \"open the cabinet\")\nand a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify\ntask-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D\ntrajectories for hand motion and object motion. Subsequently, we train a\nlow-level residual RL policy in simulation to track these coarse trajectories\nor \"scaffolds\" with high fidelity. Across a number of simulated tasks involving\narticulated objects and semantic understanding, we demonstrate that our method\nis able to learn robust dexterous manipulation policies. Moreover, we showcase\nthat our method transfers to real-world robotic hands without any human\ndemonstrations or handcrafted rewards.",

Despite their differences in workflows, existing\nLLM-based multi-agent systems mostly use natural language for agent\ncommunication. While this is appealing for its simplicity and interpretability,\nit also introduces inevitable information loss as one model must down sample\nits continuous state vectors to concrete tokens before transferring them to the\nother model. Such losses are particularly significant when the information to\ntransfer is not simple facts, but reasoning logics or abstractive thoughts. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a new communication protocol that transfers\nboth natural language tokens and token-wise state transition trajectory from\none agent to another. Particularly, compared to the actual state value, we find\nthat the sequence of state changes in LLMs after generating each token can\nbetter reflect the information hidden behind the inference process, so we\npropose a State Delta Encoding (SDE) method to represent state transition\ntrajectories.

Compared to other gravitational wave detection\ntechniques, astrometry operates in an extreme high-baseline-number and\nlow-SNR-per-baseline limit, which leads to computational difficulties when\nusing conventional Bayesian search techniques. We extend a technique for\nefficiently searching pulsar timing array datasets through the precomputation\nof inner products in the Bayesian likelihood, showing that it is applicable to\nastrometric datasets. Using this technique, we are able to reduce the total\ndataset size by up to a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(100)$, while remaining accurate\nto within 1% over two orders of magnitude in gravitational wave frequency.\nApplying this technique to simulated astrometric datasets for the Kepler Space\nTelescope and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope missions, we obtain forecasts\nfor the sensitivity of these missions to coherent gravitational waves. Due to\nthe low angular sky coverage of astrometric baselines, we find that coherent\ngravitational wave sources are poorly localized on the sky. Despite this, from\n$10^{-8}$ Hz to $10^{-6}$ Hz, we find that Roman is sensitive to coherent\ngravitational waves with an instantaneous strain above $h_0 \\simeq 10^{-11.4}$,\nand Kepler is sensitive to strains above $h_0 \\simeq $ $10^{-12.4}$. At this\nstrain, we can detect a source with a frequency of $10^{-7}$ Hz and a chirp\nmass of $10^9$ $M_\\odot$ at a luminosity distance of 3.6 Mpc for Kepler, and\n0.3 Mpc for Roman.",

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy shows an\nincrease in effective work function after phosphonic acid modification and\nclear evidence for photoemission from carbazole functional groups at the ITO\nsurface.

In this work, we propose the MOTIF hand, a novel multimodal and\nversatile robotic hand that extends the LEAP hand by integrating: (i) dense\ntactile information across the fingers, (ii) a depth sensor, (iii) a thermal\ncamera, (iv), IMU sensors, and (v) a visual sensor. The MOTIF hand is designed\nto be relatively low-cost (under 4000 USD) and easily reproducible. We validate\nour hand design through experiments that leverage its multimodal sensing for\ntwo representative tasks. First, we integrate thermal sensing into 3D\nreconstruction to guide temperature-aware, safe grasping. Second, we show how\nour hand can distinguish objects with identical appearance but different masses\n- a capability beyond methods that use vision only.",
