    "abstract": "In many multiferroics, rare-earth and transition-metal orders exist side by\nside. For analyzing their interaction and its consequences for the multiferroic\nstate, the associated domain patterns and their spatial correlation can give\nvaluable insight. Unfortunately, this is often hampered by the lack of access\nto the domains of the rare-earth order. Here, we uncover such a domain pattern\nfor the antiferromagnetic and multiferroic Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$. Optical\nsecond harmonic generation reveals the formation of column-like Dy/Tb domains.\nInterestingly, the columns form perpendicular to the magnetically induced\nelectric polarization. Hence, the antiferromagnetic rare-earth order forces the\nferroelectric domains to form nominally charged head-to-head and tail-to-tail\ndomain walls, thus playing a leading role in the domain formation within the\nmultiferroic phase. In turn, to reduce energy cost, the ferroelectric order\ncauses a reduced rare-earth domain-wall density along the direction of the\nelectric polarization. This interplay highlights the multiferroic character of\nthe Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$ domain pattern. We position\nDy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$ within the broader landscape of rare-earth\nmultiferroics and identify three distinct scenarios for the role of rare-earth\norder in these.",

It plays a critical role in domains such as fluid\ndynamics and thermodynamics. However, existing deep learning methods often fail\nto capture long-range temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance on time-evolving physical systems. To address this, we propose\nFR-Mamba, a novel spatiotemporal flow field reconstruction framework based on\nstate space modeling. Specifically, we design a hybrid neural network\narchitecture that combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and State Space Model\n(SSM) to capture both global spatial features and long-range temporal\ndependencies. We adopt Mamba, a recently proposed efficient SSM architecture,\nto model long-range temporal dependencies with linear time complexity. In\nparallel, the FNO is employed to capture non-local spatial features by\nleveraging frequency-domain transformations. The spatiotemporal representations\nextracted by these two components are then fused to reconstruct the full-field\ndistribution of the physical system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\napproach significantly outperforms existing PFR methods in flow field\nreconstruction tasks, achieving high-accuracy performance on long sequences.",

    "abstract": "Scientists often want to make predictions beyond the observed time horizon of\n\"snapshot\" data following latent stochastic dynamics. For example, in time\ncourse single-cell mRNA profiling, scientists have access to cellular\ntranscriptional state measurements (snapshots) from different biological\nreplicates at different time points, but they cannot access the trajectory of\nany one cell because measurement destroys the cell. Researchers want to\nforecast (e.g.) differentiation outcomes from early state measurements of stem\ncells. Recent Schr\\\"odinger-bridge (SB) methods are natural for interpolating\nbetween snapshots. But past SB papers have not addressed forecasting -- likely\nsince existing methods either (1) reduce to following pre-set reference\ndynamics (chosen before seeing data) or (2) require the user to choose a fixed,\nstate-independent volatility since they minimize a Kullback-Leibler divergence.\nEither case can lead to poor forecasting quality. In the present work, we\npropose a new framework, SnapMMD, that learns dynamics by directly fitting the\njoint distribution of both state measurements and observation time with a\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss. Unlike past work, our method allows us to\ninfer unknown and state-dependent volatilities from the observed data. We show\nin a variety of real and synthetic experiments that our method delivers\naccurate forecasts. Moreover, our approach allows us to learn in the presence\nof incomplete state measurements and yields an $R^2$-style statistic that\ndiagnoses fit. We also find that our method's performance at interpolation (and\ngeneral velocity-field reconstruction) is at least as good as (and often better\nthan) state-of-the-art in almost all of our experiments.",

Then an adaptive dynamic\ncoupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group\nshould be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under\nvarious domains.

    "abstract": "Subgraph densities play a crucial role in network analysis, especially for\nthe identification and interpretation of meaningful substructures in complex\ngraphs. Localized subgraph densities, in particular, can provide valuable\ninsights into graph structures. Distinguishing between\nmathematically-determined and domain-driven subgraph density features, however,\nposes challenges. For instance, the lack or presence of certain structures can\nbe explained by graph density or degree distribution. These differences are\nespecially meaningful in applied contexts as they allow us to identify\ninstances where the data induces specific network structures, such as\nfriendships in social networks. The goal of this paper is to measure these\ndifferences across various types of graphs, conducting social media analysis\nfrom a network perspective. To this end, we first provide tighter bounds on\nsubgraph densities. We then introduce the subgraph spread ratio to quantify the\nrealized subgraph densities of specific networks relative to the feasible\nbounds. Our novel approach combines techniques from flag algebras,\nmotif-counting, and topological data analysis. Crucially, effective adoption of\nthe state-of-the-art in the plain flag algebra method yields feasible regions\nup to three times tighter than prior best-known results, thereby enabling more\naccurate and direct comparisons across graphs. We additionally perform an\nempirical analysis of 11 real-world networks. We observe that social networks\nconsistently have smaller subgraph spread ratios than other types of networks,\nsuch as linkage-mapping networks for Wikipedia pages. This aligns with our\nintuition about social relationships: such networks have meaningful structure\nthat makes them distinct. The subgraph spread ratio enables the quantification\nof intuitive understandings of network structures and provides a metric for\ncomparing types of networks.",

We investigate\nwhether synthetic data generation can help identify at-risk students earlier in\na small, imbalanced dataset from an introductory programming module. The\nanalysis used anonymised records from 379 students, with 15\\% marked as\nfailing, and applied several machine learning algorithms. The first experiments\nshowed poor recall for the failing group. However, using synthetic data\ngeneration methods led to a significant improvement in performance. Our results\nsuggest that machine learning can help identify at-risk students early in\nprogramming courses when combined with synthetic data. This research lays the\ngroundwork for validating and using these models with live student cohorts in\nthe future, to allow for timely and effective interventions that can improve\nstudent outcomes. It also includes feature importance analysis to refine\nformative tasks. Overall, this study contributes to developing practical\nworkflows that help detect disengagement early and improve student success in\nprogramming education.",

In this work, we ask the following question: are these\nobservables independent of one another? We find that in the parity-odd sector\nof inflationary perturbation theory, the answer is a resounding no! In earlier\nwork we derived a correlator-to-correlator factorisation formula which states\nthat parity-odd correlators factorise into lower-point correlators under some\nmild assumptions on the underlying theory. In this work, we show that these\nassumptions are satisfied in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity where the action of\nminimal inflation is augmented by a coupling between the inflaton and the\ngravitational Chern-Simons term. Such a theory gives rise to a parity-odd\ntrispectrum of curvature perturbations, and we show that such a trispectrum can\nbe expressed solely in terms of the bispectrum that arises due to the minimal\ncoupling between the inflaton and graviton, and the graviton power spectrum\nwhich receives a parity-odd correction in this theory. The trispectrum is\nquadratic in this mixed inflaton-graviton bispectrum and can therefore be\ninterpreted as a ``double copy\". Our final expression for the parity-odd\ntrispectrum is a relatively simple function of the external momenta that is\nrational and factorised.",

This can be effective for tasks such as\ninformation retrieval, where constituent claims may be evaluated in isolation\nfor factuality, but is not appropriate for reasoning tasks, as steps of a\nlogical argument can be evaluated for correctness only within the context of\nthe claims that precede them.

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory\nmanagement choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term\nperformance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory operations that\nare widely used by many agent frameworks-addition, which incorporates new\nexperiences into the memory base, and deletion, which selectively removes past\nexperiences-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through\nour quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an\nexperience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the\ninput in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent\noutputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated\nwith this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences\ncompound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay,\nwhere outdated or irrelevant experiences negatively influence current tasks.\nThrough controlled experiments, we show that combining selective addition and\ndeletion strategies can help mitigate these negative effects, yielding an\naverage absolute performance gain of 10% compared to naive memory growth.\nFurthermore, we highlight how memory management choices affect agents' behavior\nunder challenging conditions such as task distribution shifts and constrained\nmemory resources.

In\nthis paper, we propose mesh-free SINDy, a novel algorithm which leverages the\npower of neural network approximation as well as auto-differentiation to\nidentify governing equations from arbitrary sensor placements and non-uniform\ntemporal data sampling. We show that mesh-free SINDy is robust to high noise\nlevels and limited data while remaining computationally efficient. In our\nimplementation, the training procedure is straight-forward and nearly free of\nhyperparameter tuning, making mesh-free SINDy widely applicable to many\nscientific and engineering problems. In the experiments, we demonstrate its\neffectiveness on a series of PDEs including the Burgers' equation, the heat\nequation, the Korteweg-De Vries equation and the 2D advection-diffusion\nequation. We conduct detailed numerical experiments on all datasets, varying\nthe noise levels and number of samples, and we also compare our approach to\nprevious state-of-the-art methods. It is noteworthy that, even in high-noise\nand low-data scenarios, mesh-free SINDy demonstrates robust PDE discovery,\nachieving successful identification with up to 75% noise for the Burgers'\nequation using 5,000 samples and with as few as 100 samples and 1% noise.

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models\n(LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy\nlarge MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert\noffloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on\nslow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited\nthe locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar\nexperts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models\nand remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure\nlocal routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance\n(SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs\nof a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which\nmeasures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size\nlimit. We analyzed 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and found\nthat models that apply MoE on every layer and do not use shared experts exhibit\nthe highest local routing consistency. We further showed that\ndomain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than\nvocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models can balance between cache\neffectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately 2x the active\nexperts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and\ndeployment without compromising inference speed.

A prophet inequality in this setting bounds the\ncompetitive ratio of sequential allocation (often using item pricing) against\nthe hindsight optimum. We study the dependence of the competitive ratio on the\nnumber of copies, $k$, of each item.\n  We show that the multi-unit combinatorial setting is strictly harder than its\nsingle-item counterpart in that there is a gap between the competitive ratios\nachieved by static item pricings in the two settings.

Detecting these anomalies is challenging due to\nthe complexity of accelerator systems, high data volume, and scarcity of\nlabeled fault data. Prior work identified faults using beam-based detection,\ncombining RF amplitude and beam-position monitor data. Due to the simplicity of\nthe RF amplitude data, classical methods are sufficient to identify faults, but\nthe recall is constrained by the low-frequency and asynchronous characteristics\nof the data. In this work, we leverage high-frequency, time-synchronous RF\nphase data to enhance anomaly detection in the LCLS accelerator. Due to the\ncomplexity of phase data, classical methods fail, and we instead train deep\nneural networks within the Coincident Anomaly Detection (CoAD) framework. We\nfind that applying CoAD to phase data detects nearly three times as many\nanomalies as when applied to amplitude data, while achieving broader coverage\nacross RF stations. Furthermore, the rich structure of phase data enables us to\ncluster anomalies into distinct physical categories. Through the integration of\nauxiliary system status bits, we link clusters to specific fault signatures,\nproviding additional granularity for uncovering the root cause of faults. We\nalso investigate interpretability via Shapley values, confirming that the\nlearned models focus on the most informative regions of the data and providing\ninsight for cases where the model makes mistakes.

The goal is to\ndetermine the minimum number of pebbles required to ensure that any target\nvertex can be reached, known as the pebbling number. Computing the pebbling\nnumber lies beyond NP in the polynomial hierarchy, leading to bounding methods.\nOne of the most prominent techniques for upper bounds is the Weight Function\nLemma (WFL), which relies on costly integer linear optimization. To mitigate\nthis cost, an alternative approach is to consider the dual formulation of the\nproblem, which allows solutions to be constructed by hand through the selection\nof strategies given by subtrees with associated weight functions. To improve\nthe bounds, the weights should be distributed as uniformly as possible among\nthe vertices, balancing their individual contribution. However, despite its\nsimplicity, this approach lacks a formal framework. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce a novel heuristic method that refines the selection of balanced\nstrategies. The method is motivated by our theoretical analysis of the\nlimitations of the dual approach, in which we prove lower bounds on the best\nbounds achievable. Our theoretical analysis shows that the bottleneck lies in\nthe farthest vertices from the target, forcing surplus weight onto the closer\nneighborhoods. To minimize surplus weight beyond the theoretical minimum, our\nproposed heuristic prioritizes weight assignment to the farthest vertices,\nbuilding the subtrees starting from the shortest paths to them and then filling\nin the weights for the remaining vertices.

Through a two-phase approach, consisting\nof a co-design session with 8 children followed by a field study with 106\nchildren (grades 3-8), we identified three models of AI reasoning: Deductive,\nInductive, and Inherent. Our findings reveal that younger children (grades 3-5)\noften attribute AI's reasoning to inherent intelligence, while older children\n(grades 6-8) recognize AI as a pattern recognizer. We highlight three tensions\nthat surfaced in children's understanding of AI reasoning and conclude with\nimplications for scaffolding AI curricula and designing explainable AI tools.",

To address this, we use the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element\nMethod (GMsFEM) that constructs localized spectral basis functions on coarse\ngrids. This approach efficiently captures dominant multiscale features while\nsolving heterogeneous PDEs accurately at reduced computational cost. However,\ncomputing these basis functions is computationally expensive.

On standard\nmultiscale benchmarks - namely a linear elliptic diffusion problem and the\nnonlinear, steady-state Richards equation - our hybrid method cuts solution\nerror by approximately $60\\%$ compared with standalone NOs and reduces\nbasis-construction time by about $60$ times relative to classical GMsFEM, while\nremaining independent of forcing terms and boundary conditions.

Effective VQA necessitates sensitivity to pixel-level distortions\nand a comprehensive understanding of video context to accurately determine the\nperceptual impact of distortions. Traditional hand-crafted and learning-based\nVQA models mainly focus on pixel-level distortions and lack contextual\nunderstanding, while recent LLM-based models struggle with sensitivity to small\ndistortions or handle quality scoring and description as separate tasks. To\naddress these shortcomings, we introduce CP-LLM: a Context and Pixel aware\nLarge Language Model. CP-LLM is a novel multimodal LLM architecture featuring\ndual vision encoders designed to independently analyze perceptual quality at\nboth high-level (video context) and low-level (pixel distortion) granularity,\nalong with a language decoder subsequently reasons about the interplay between\nthese aspects. This design enables CP-LLM to simultaneously produce robust\nquality scores and interpretable quality descriptions, with enhanced\nsensitivity to pixel distortions (e.g. compression artifacts). The model is\ntrained via a multi-task pipeline optimizing for score prediction, description\ngeneration, and pairwise comparisons.

    "abstract": "Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in\ndiffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow\nsampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the\nmulti-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step,\nenabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off\nbetween different distillation strategies and generative quality remain\nlimited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a\nfirst step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory\ndistillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each\nstep of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy\ndata. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and\nrescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal\nshrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both\ndiscretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a\ndynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that\nmaximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence\nof a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data\ncovariance structures.

Our analysis further reveals that\nfeature quality -- particularly the use of pretrained versus non-pretrained\nrepresentations -- plays a crucial role in determining which detectors will\nsucceed. Extensive experiments validate the strong performance of GradPCA, and\nour theoretical framework offers guidance for designing more principled\nspectral OOD detectors.",

Its equivalency to graph connectivity for $d=1$ is well\nknown; thus it can be viewed as a generalization that incorporates geometric\nconstraints. Graph connectivity is commonly quantified by the algebraic\nconnectivity, the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. Recently,\na graph invariant for quantifying graph rigidity in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, termed the\ngeneralized algebraic connectivity, was introduced. Recognizing the intrinsic\nrelationship between rigidity and connectivity, this article presents new\ncontributions. In particular, we introduce the d-rigidity ratio as a metric for\nexpressing the level of rigidity of a graph in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ relative to its\nconnectivity. We show that this ratio is bounded and provide extremal examples.\nAdditionally, we offer a new upper bound for the generalized algebraic\nconnectivity that depends inversely on the diameter and on the vertex\nconnectivity, thereby improving previous bounds. Moreover, we investigate the\nrelationship between graph rigidity and the diameter, a measure of the graph's\noverall extent. We provide the maximal diameter achievable by rigid graphs and\nshow that generalized path graphs serve as extremal examples. Finally, we\nderive an upper bound for the generalized algebraic connectivity of generalized\npath graphs that (asymptotically) improves upon existing ones by a factor of\nfour.",

To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA\nthat replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach.\nMETEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is\npreference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using\ndirect preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk\nselection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing\nindividual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance,\nglobal selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context\nexpansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k\nheuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier\nLLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation.\nThe framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using\nrationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation\nacross six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains\nshows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using\napproximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In\nadversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to\n0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating\nstrong resilience to poisoning attacks.

The current manuscript proposes several mathematical models for\nthe top-down bio-control of the aphid, as well as control via pesticides and\nneonicotinoids. The models are motivated empirically, and constructed based on\nlaboratory experiments conducted to test control of aphids by Lacewing larvae,\nas well as by a parasitic wasp (\\emph{Aphidius colemani}). The effectiveness of\nthese models is compared by taking into account factors such as economic injury\nlevels for soybeans, life history traits such as cannibalism amongst the\npredator, and intraguild predation between competing bio-control agents such as\npredators and parasitoids. The models predict multiple population peaks and\ntransient chaotic dynamics when a predator and/or insecticides are used. It is\nobserved that parasitoids, in conjunction with predators, are more efficient at\nstabilizing the population dynamics than insecticide use. They also suggest a\ncombination of predators, parasitoids, and insecticides would be more efficient\nat suppressing aphid populations than using only predators or parasitoids.

HST data\nfor its individual stars reveal that its older RGB stars comprise a smaller\npart, while the majority of visible stars have ages of less than one to a few\nGyr. Thus, Peekaboo dwarf can be considered as the nearest record-low-Z dwarf.\nAs such, the galaxy deserves a deeper multi-method study, including properties\nof both, young massive stars and the fainter older population, and its ionised\ngas and the dominant baryonic component of HI gas. We use the direct (Te)\nmethod for the east HII region, in which the [OIII]4363A line is well detected,\nto estimate its parameter 12+log(O/H). Since in the west HII region the line\n[OIII]4363A is not detected, its O/H is estimated via the empirical\n\"strong-line\" method. The resulting value of O/H is very close to that in the\neast HII region. The new spectroscopy of Peekaboo dwarf allows us to improve\nsubstantially the accuracy of its direct O/H estimate, which appears of\n12+log(O/H) = 6.99$\\pm$0.06. The new data reveal that emission lines in the E\nregion consist of two components with the velocity difference of ~65 km/s. The\nfainter, approaching, component can be related to a fast-moving WR star thrown\nfrom a cluster or a binary system. Using the HST $V$ magnitudes and colour\n$V-I$, we identify tentative O-type and very hot candidate WO stars, which are\nlikely the ionising stars of the studied HII regions.

Our empirical focus is a set of English filler-gap dependency\nconstructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely\nagree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based\nin Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LLMs converge on similar\nabstract analyses of these constructions.

    "abstract": "The usual way to describe mathematically a beam of coherent light passing\nthrough a system of waveplates is via the Jones vector and Jones matrix. This\npaper will show that a quaternion can be used to represent both the optical\nsignal and the waveplate component it passes through, replacing the Jones\nvector and the Jones matrix. The quaternion description is easier to manipulate\nthan the matrix-vector description; for example it can be inverted. As well as\nthe Jones vector, the state of polarization (SOP) of an optical signal is often\ndescribed as a three-dimensional vector on the Poincar\\'e sphere, or as a\npolarization ellipse, and it will be shown how these three forms are closely\nrelated to the quaternion representation. Similarly, the action of a waveplate\nmay be represented as a rotation about an axis on the Poincar\\'e sphere, and\nthat rotation is shown to have a logarithm-exponential relationship to the\nwaveplate's quaternion. The paper presents rules to decide if two optical\nsignals are aligned or orthogonal in phase or in polarization from their\nquaternions, and presents the quaternion operations to change the phase or\nchange the SOP. Light passing through a system of waveplates is written as a\nproduct of quaternions, and it can be hard to simplify or manipulate that\nexpression because quaternion multiplication does not commute. The paper brings\ntogether several mathematical tools that allow such a quaternion product to be\nrearranged, including the new idea of partial conjugation. Finally, a worked\nexample is included of the quaternion mathematics applied to a waveplate\nproblem that has not been solved before. It is shown that an endless optical\nphase shifter can be built using three rotatable waveplates, and equations for\nthe angles of rotation are derived to produce the desired phase shift for given\ninput and output SOPs.",

This logic is repeated for a simple model of\nself-propelled particles, run-and-tumble particles (RTP) in a harmonic trap,\nconfirming the claim that the system in 2D enjoys special status. This study\nrevisits the RTP-harmonic-trap model using an integral-equation formulation\nrecently proposed in Ref. \\cite{POF-Frydel-2024}. The formulation is based on\nreinterpreting RTP motion as a jump process. The key quantity of the\nformulation is a transition operator $G(x,x')$, representing the probability\ndistribution of the jumps of an auxiliary system. The stationary distribution\nis then obtained from the integral equation $\\rho(x) = \\int dx' \\, \\rho(x')\nG(x,x')$. In 2D, we find that $G(x,x')$ is reversible. This implies the\n$\\rho(x)$ satisfied the detailed balance condition, $\\rho(x') G(x,x') = \\rho(x)\nG(x',x)$, from which $\\rho(x)$ can be obtained without need of an integral\nequation. The reversibility of $G(x,x')$ does not mean that RTP particles are\nin equilibrium. It only means that our specific interpretation of the RTP\nmotion leads to an auxiliary system that is in equilibrium. The reversibility\nof the system in 2D is lost if the probability distribution of the waiting\ntimes (the times that determine the duration on the \"run\" stage of the RTP\nmotion) deviates from an exponential distribution.",

    "abstract": "The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges\nfor efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic\nspectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,\ntraditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically\ndeveloped to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and\namplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal\nsegmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these\nlimitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of\nexisting RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on\ncomplex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet\nintroduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex\nplane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training\nperformance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and\nreal-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of\n98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued\ncounterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet\nachieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,\ncompared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up\nto a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness\nof complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training\nefficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments.

Permanent magnet scanners\noperating in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) facilitate MRI of sick\ninfants, but have long scan times due to lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and\nlimited receive coils. This work accelerates in-NICU MRI with diffusion\nprobabilistic generative models by developing a training pipeline accounting\nfor these challenges.\n  Methods: We establish a novel training dataset of clinical, 1 Tesla neonatal\nMR images in collaboration with Aspect Imaging and Sha'are Zedek Medical\nCenter. We propose a pipeline to handle the low quantity and SNR of our\nreal-world dataset (1) modifying existing network architectures to support\nvarying resolutions; (2) training a single model on all data with learned class\nembedding vectors; (3) applying self-supervised denoising before training; and\n(4) reconstructing by averaging posterior samples. Retrospective under-sampling\nexperiments, accounting for signal decay, evaluated each item of our proposed\nmethodology. A clinical reader study with practicing pediatric\nneuroradiologists evaluated our proposed images reconstructed from 1.5x\nunder-sampled data.\n  Results: Combining all data, denoising pre-training, and averaging posterior\nsamples yields quantitative improvements in reconstruction. The generative\nmodel decouples the learned prior from the measurement model and functions at\ntwo acceleration rates without re-training. The reader study suggests that\nproposed images reconstructed from approximately 1.5x under-sampled data are\nadequate for clinical use.\n  Conclusion: Diffusion probabilistic generative models applied with the\nproposed pipeline to handle challenging real-world datasets could reduce scan\ntime of in-NICU neonatal MRI.",

    "abstract": "College students are increasingly affected by stress, anxiety, and\ndepression, yet face barriers to traditional mental health care. This study\nevaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health\nEvaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor\nand machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and\nself-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117),\nparticipants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of\ninterventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress\nlogging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, \"Moments of\nStress\" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and\nanalyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly,\nsecondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized\nAnxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire\n(PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also\nanalyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a\nsubstantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control\ngroup, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective\nscores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the\ntreatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS\nscores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth\ntools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for\nextended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like\ndepression.",

However, this reasoning\nprocess has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its\neffectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel\nframework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual\nreasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable\nVLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby\nenhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space\nreasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the\nmodel's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly\nintroduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a\ntwo-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on\nsynthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual\noperations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a\ncuriosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space\nreasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can\ninteract with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos\nto proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach\nsignificantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning\nbenchmarks. Our 7B model, \\model, achieves 84\\% on V* bench, 74\\% on\nTallyQA-Complex, and 84\\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy\nachieved by any open-source model to date.

In\nresponse to these gaps, this paper aims to address the challenges of automatic\ndataset creation and the generalization of PRMs to diverse reasoning tasks. To\nachieve this goal, we propose FoVer, an approach for training PRMs on\nstep-level error labels automatically annotated by formal verification tools,\nsuch as Z3 for formal logic and Isabelle for theorem proof, which provide\nautomatic and accurate verification for symbolic tasks. Using this approach, we\nsynthesize a training dataset with error labels on LLM responses for formal\nlogic and theorem proof tasks without human annotation. Although this data\nsynthesis is feasible only for tasks compatible with formal verification, we\nobserve that LLM-based PRMs trained on our dataset exhibit cross-task\ngeneralization, improving verification across diverse reasoning tasks.\nSpecifically, PRMs trained with FoVer significantly outperform baseline PRMs\nbased on the original LLMs and achieve competitive or superior results compared\nto state-of-the-art PRMs trained on labels annotated by humans or stronger\nmodels, as measured by step-level verification on ProcessBench and Best-of-K\nperformance across 12 reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME, ANLI, MMLU,\nand BBH.

    "abstract": "We present HornStr, the first solver for invariant synthesis for Regular\nModel Checking (RMC) with the specification provided in the SMT-LIB 2.6 theory\nof strings. It is well-known that invariant synthesis for RMC subsumes various\nimportant verification problems, including safety verification for\nparameterized systems. To achieve a simple and standardized file format, we\ntreat the invariant synthesis problem as a problem of solving Constrained Horn\nClauses (CHCs) over strings. Two strategies for synthesizing invariants in\nterms of regular constraints are supported: (1) L* automata learning, and (2)\nSAT-based automata learning. HornStr implements these strategies with the help\nof existing SMT solvers for strings, which are interfaced through SMT-LIB.\nHornStr provides an easy-to-use interface for string solver developers to apply\ntheir techniques to verification. At the same time, it allows verification\nresearchers to painlessly tap into the wealth of modern string solving\ntechniques. To assess the effectiveness of HornStr, we conducted a\ncomprehensive evaluation using benchmarks derived from applications including\nparameterized verification and string rewriting tasks. Our experiments\nhighlight HornStr's capacity to effectively handle these benchmarks, e.g., as\nthe first solver to verify the challenging MU puzzle automatically. Finally,\nHornStr can be used to automatically generate a new class of interesting\nSMT-LIB 2.6 string constraint benchmarks, which might in the future be used in\nthe SMT-COMP strings track. In particular, our experiments on the above\ninvariant synthesis benchmarks produce more than 30000 new QF_S constraints. We\nalso detail the performance of various integrated string solvers, providing\ninsights into their effectiveness on our new benchmarks.",

In this paper, we unveil for the first time a new\n\\textbf{\\textit{directional sparsity}} property of the 6DMA channels between\nthe base station (BS) and the distributed users, where each user has\nsignificant channel gains only with a (small) subset of 6DMA position-rotation\npairs, which can receive direct/reflected signals from the user.

However,\ncurrent progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while\noverlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific\ninsight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework\ndesigned for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction.\nMoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture\nwhere distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel\ngroups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to\nencode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then\nsynthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing\nmechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion\nprocess. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a\nnovel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for\nneuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by\nsharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers.\nThird, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing\nreveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and\nspatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate\nMoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further\ndemonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine\nneural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently,\nMoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and\ninterpretable fMRI-based visual decoding.

Optimal treatment allocations which may or may not\ndepend on baseline covariates have been derived for a variety of effect\nmeasures focusing on the trial population, the patient population represented\nby the trial participants. Frequently, clinical trial data are used to estimate\ntreatment effects in a target population that is related to but different from\nthe trial population. This article provides optimal treatment allocations that\naccount for the impact of such population differences. We consider three cases\nwith different data configurations: transportation, generalization, and\npost-stratification. Our results indicate that, for general effect measures,\noptimal treatment allocations may depend on the covariate distribution in the\ntarget population but not on the configuration of data or information that\ndescribes the target covariate distribution. For estimating average treatment\neffects, there is a unique covariate-dependent allocation that achieves maximal\nefficiency regardless of the target covariate distribution and the associated\ndata configuration.",

    "abstract": "When groups of inertial swimmers move together, hydrodynamic interactions\nplay a key role in shaping their collective dynamics, including the cohesion of\nthe group. To explore how these interactions influence group cohesion, we\ndevelop a three-dimensional, inviscid, far-field model of a swimmer. Focusing\non symmetric triangular, diamond, and circular group arrangements, we\ninvestigate whether passive hydrodynamics alone can promote cohesive behavior,\nand what role symmetry of the group plays. While small symmetric (and even\nasymmetric) groups can be cohesive, larger groups typically are not, instead\nbreaking apart into smaller, self-organized subgroups that are cohesive.\nNotably, we discover circular arrangements of swimmers that chase each other\naround a circle, resembling the milling behavior of natural fish schools; we\ncall this hydrodynamic milling. Hydrodynamic milling is cohesive in the sense\nthat it is a fixed point of a particular Poincar\\'e map, but it is unstable,\nespecially to asymmetric perturbations. Our findings suggest that while passive\nhydrodynamics alone cannot sustain large-scale cohesion indefinitely,\ncontrolling interactions between subgroups, or controlling the behavior of only\nthe periphery of a large group, could potentially enable stable collective\nbehavior with minimal active input.",

    "abstract": "Several papers from the mid to late 1990s suggest that Einstein's equations\nshould be thought of as the hydrodynamic equations of a special class of\nquantum systems. A classical solution defines subsystems by dividing space-time\nup into CAUSAL DIAMONDS and Einstein's equations are the hydrodynamics of a\nsystem that assigns a density matrix to each diamond whose modular Hamiltonian\nK has expectation value and fluctuation both given by A/4G. A is the maximal\nd-2 volume on the boundary of the diamond and G is Newton's constant. These\nproperties define the EMPTY DIAMOND STATE, the analog of the quantum field\ntheory (QFT) vacuum, in the background geometry. The assignment of density\nmatrices to each diamond enables one to define the analog of half sided modular\nflow along geodesics in the background manifold, as a unitary embedding of the\nHilbert space of a given diamond into the next one in a nesting with Planck\nscale time steps. We conjecture that this can be enhanced to a full set of\ncompatible unitary evolutions on a Hilbert bundle of the space of time-like\ngeodesics, using a QUANTUM PRINCIPLE OF EQUIVALENCE defined in the text. The\ncompatibility of this formalism with the experimental success of QFT is\ndiscussed, as well as the theoretical mechanism by which QFT emerges from this\nversion of quantum gravity.

To address\nthis gap, we introduce PhyX: the first large-scale benchmark designed to assess\nmodels capacity for physics-grounded reasoning in visual scenarios. PhyX\nincludes 3K meticulously curated multimodal questions spanning 6 reasoning\ntypes across 25 sub-domains and 6 core physics domains: thermodynamics,\nelectromagnetism, mechanics, modern physics, optics, and wave\\&acoustics. In\nour comprehensive evaluation, even state-of-the-art models struggle\nsignificantly with physical reasoning. GPT-4o, Claude3.7-Sonnet, and\nGPT-o4-mini achieve only 32.5%, 42.2%, and 45.8% accuracy\nrespectively-performance gaps exceeding 29% compared to human experts. Our\nanalysis exposes critical limitations in current models: over-reliance on\nmemorized disciplinary knowledge, excessive dependence on mathematical\nformulations, and surface-level visual pattern matching rather than genuine\nphysical understanding. We provide in-depth analysis through fine-grained\nstatistics, detailed case studies, and multiple evaluation paradigms to\nthoroughly examine physical reasoning capabilities.

    "abstract": "The CMIP global climate models (GCMs) assess that nearly 100% of global\nsurface warming observed between 1850-1900 and 2011-2020 is attributable to\nanthropogenic drivers like greenhouse gas emissions. These models also generate\nfuture climate projections based on shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs),\naiding in risk assessment and the development of costly Net-Zero climate\nmitigation strategies. Yet, the CMIP GCMs face significant scientific\nchallenges in attributing and modeling climate change, particularly in\ncapturing natural climate variability over multiple timescales throughout the\nHolocene. Other key concerns include the reliability of global surface\ntemperature records, the accuracy of solar irradiance models, and the\nrobustness of climate sensitivity estimates. Global warming estimates may be\noverstated due to uncorrected non-climatic biases, and the GCMs may\nsignificantly underestimate solar and astronomical influences on climate\nvariations. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to radiative forcing\ncould be lower than commonly assumed; empirical findings suggest ECS values\nlower than 3 K and possibly even closer to 1.1 +/- 0.4 K. Empirical models\nincorporating natural variability suggest that the 21st-century global warming\nmay remain moderate, even under SSP scenarios that do not necessitate Net-Zero\nemission policies. These findings raise important questions regarding the\nnecessity and urgency of implementing aggressive climate mitigation strategies.\nWhile GCMs remain essential tools for climate research and policymaking, their\nscientific limitations underscore the need for more refined modeling approaches\nto ensure accurate future climate assessments. Addressing uncertainties related\nto climate change detection, natural variability, solar influences, and climate\nsensitivity to radiative forcing will enhance predictions and better inform\nsustainable climate strategies.",

    "abstract": "Learning complex functions that involve multi-step reasoning poses a\nsignificant challenge for standard supervised learning from input-output\nexamples. Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, which provides intermediate\nreasoning steps together with the final output, has emerged as a powerful\nempirical technique, underpinning much of the recent progress in the reasoning\ncapabilities of large language models. This paper develops a statistical theory\nof learning under CoT supervision. A key characteristic of the CoT setting, in\ncontrast to standard supervision, is the mismatch between the training\nobjective (CoT risk) and the test objective (end-to-end risk). A central part\nof our analysis, distinguished from prior work, is explicitly linking those two\ntypes of risk to achieve sharper sample complexity bounds. This is achieved via\nthe *CoT information measure* $\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{D},\nh_\\star}^{\\mathrm{CoT}}(\\epsilon; \\calH)$, which quantifies the additional\ndiscriminative power gained from observing the reasoning process. The main\ntheoretical results demonstrate how CoT supervision can yield significantly\nfaster learning rates compared to standard E2E supervision. Specifically, it is\nshown that the sample complexity required to achieve a target E2E error\n$\\epsilon$ scales as $d/\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{D},\nh_\\star}^{\\mathrm{CoT}}(\\epsilon; \\calH)$, where $d$ is a measure of hypothesis\nclass complexity, which can be much faster than standard $d/\\epsilon$ rates.\nInformation-theoretic lower bounds in terms of the CoT information are also\nobtained. Together, these results suggest that CoT information is a fundamental\nmeasure of statistical complexity for learning under chain-of-thought\nsupervision.",

Here, we examine the\nvalidity of the ideal gas law (IGL) for a single quantum particle confined\nwithin a two-dimensional cavity. By interpreting the quantum wave function as a\nprobability density analogous to that of an ideal gas, we employ the energy\nequipartition principle to define the temperature of the quantum state. For the\nmean pressure we take two definitions, one straightforwardly based on the\nradiation pressure concept and the other taking advantage of a\nquasi-orthogonality relation valid for billiard eigenstates. We analyze systems\nwith regular dynamics-the circular and rectangular billiards-and compare them\nwith the classically chaotic Bunimovich stadium. We find that the IGL for the\nfirst definition of pressure holds exactly in isotropic systems (as the\ncircular case), while for anisotropic geometries, quantum eigenfunctions\ngenerally conform to the IGL only on average, exhibiting meaningful deviations.\nThese deviations are diminished in the presence of chaotic dynamics and for\ncoherent states. This observation is consistent with the Eigenstate\nThermalization Hypothesis (ETH). Notably, the second definition of pressure\nallows for a good matching with the IGL.",

By comparing these trends\nwith those of other Galactic populations we seek to understand the chemical\nrelationships between these structures. We obtained high-resolution H- and\nK-band spectra of NSD stars using the IGRINS spectrometer mounted on the Gemini\nSouth telescope. The giants were analyzed consistently with stars from a\ncomparison populations to minimize systematic uncertainties. The abundance\ntrends of NSD stars exhibit similarities with those of the inner-bulge and\nNuclear Star Cluster (NSC) populations across a broad range of elements with\ndifferent chemical evolution histories. The trends for 17 elements align\nclosely with the local thick-disc behaviour at subsolar metallicities. At\nsuper-solar metallicities, most elements follow the NSC and inner-bulge trends.\nSodium is the only element exhibiting a distinct trend, with enhanced\nabundances in the NSD and NSC compared to both thin-disc and inner-bulge stars.\nThe chemical similarity suggests that the NSD likely shares an evolutionary\nhistory with the NSC and possibly the inner-disc sequence. Further studies are\nrequired to determine potential evolutionary links to Liller 1 and metal-rich\nglobular clusters. We find no evidence of typical globular cluster abundance\nsignatures in our NSD stars with subsolar metallicities.

    "abstract": "Planning the transition to quantum-safe cryptosystems requires understanding\nthe cost of quantum attacks on vulnerable cryptosystems. In Gidney+Eker{\\aa}\n2019, I co-published an estimate stating that 2048 bit RSA integers could be\nfactored in eight hours by a quantum computer with 20 million noisy qubits. In\nthis paper, I substantially reduce the number of qubits required. I estimate\nthat a 2048 bit RSA integer could be factored in less than a week by a quantum\ncomputer with less than a million noisy qubits. I make the same assumptions as\nin 2019: a square grid of qubits with nearest neighbor connections, a uniform\ngate error rate of $0.1\\%$, a surface code cycle time of 1 microsecond, and a\ncontrol system reaction time of $10$ microseconds.\n  The qubit count reduction comes mainly from using approximate residue\narithmetic (Chevignard+Fouque+Schrottenloher 2024), from storing idle logical\nqubits with yoked surface codes (Gidney+Newman+Brooks+Jones 2023), and from\nallocating less space to magic state distillation by using magic state\ncultivation (Gidney+Shutty+Jones 2024). The longer runtime is mainly due to\nperforming more Toffoli gates and using fewer magic state factories compared to\nGidney+Eker{\\aa} 2019. That said, I reduce the Toffoli count by over 100x\ncompared to Chevignard+Fouque+Schrottenloher 2024.",

For dynamic horizon tracking with typical core\ncounts on a high-performance-computing cluster, BHaHAHA is approximately 2.1\ntimes faster than AHFinderDirect at accuracies limited by interpolation of\nmetric data from the host NR code.

Despite their dwarf-like stellar masses and low surface brightness,\nthey have large half-light radii and exhibit a diverse range of globular\ncluster (GC) populations. Some UDGs host many GCs while others have none,\nraising questions about the conditions under which star clusters (SC) form in\ndwarfs. GAMA526784, an isolated UDG with both an old stellar body and an\nextended star-forming (SF) front, including many young SCs, provides an\nexceptional case to explore the link between UDG evolution and star cluster\nformation. Aims. This study investigates the stellar populations, SCs, ionised\ngas, and kinematics of GAMA526784, focusing on its potential to form massive\nGCs and its connection to broader UDG formation scenarios. Methods. Imaging\nfrom HST and Subaru/HSC, alongside MUSE spectroscopy, were used to analyse the\ngalaxy's morphology, chemical composition, and kinematics. A combination of SED\nfitting and full spectral fitting was applied. Results. GAMA526784's central\nstellar body exhibits a low-metallicity ([M/H] ~ -1.0 dex) and an old age (~9.9\nGyr). The outskirts are much younger (~0.9 Gyr), but slightly more metal-poor\n([M/H] ~ -1.2 dex). The stellar kinematics show low velocity dispersions (~10\nkm/s) and a coherent rotational field, while the ionised gas exhibits higher\ndispersions (~50 km/s), a misaligned rotation axis (~20 deg) and localised SF,\nwhat could be suggestive of a recent interaction. The young SCs span ages of\n8-11 Myr and masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.0, while the old GCs have ~9 Gyr and\nstellar masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.5. Conclusions. GAMA526784's properties point to\ninteractions that triggered localised SF, leading to the formation of young\nSCs. Future observations of its molecular and neutral gas will help assess its\nenvironment, and the trigger of this SF episode.",

More recently, the RP phase nicklate\nLa$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer\nand single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure,\nexhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\\approx 64$ K,\ncapturing a lot of interests.

Our DFT\ncalculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of\nsub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and\nthe other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in\nthis material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an\n$s^\\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge\nfacilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson\ncoupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a\nprominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$\nwith pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually\ndecreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\\gamma$-pocket.

The task is to select $k$ facilities as centers and assign\neach client to a center such that: ($a$) no center exceeds its capacity, ($b$)\nthe number of centers selected from each group lies within specified lower and\nupper bounds (fair-range constraints), and ($c$) the clustering cost (e.g.,\n$k$-median or $k$-means) is minimized.\n  Prior work by Thejaswi et al. (KDD 2022) showed that satisfying fair-range\nconstraints is NP-hard, making the problem inapproximable to any polynomial\nfactor. We strengthen this result by showing that inapproximability persists\neven when the fair-range constraints are trivially satisfiable, highlighting\nthe intrinsic computational complexity of the clustering task itself. Assuming\nstandard complexity conjectures, we show that no non-trivial approximation is\npossible without exhaustively enumerating all $k$-subsets of the facility set.\nNotably, our inapproximability results hold even on tree metrics and when the\nnumber of groups is logarithmic in the size of the facility set.\n  In light of these strong inapproximability results, we focus on a more\npractical setting where the number of groups is constant. In this regime, we\ndesign two approximation algorithms: ($i$) a polynomial-time $O(\\log k)$- and\n$O(\\log^2 k)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-median and $k$-means\nobjectives, and ($ii$) a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm parameterized by\n$k$, achieving $(3+\\epsilon)$- and $(9 + \\epsilon)$-approximation,\nrespectively.

As a consequence, the\nself-similar evolution predicted by the commonly adopted conducting fluid model\ncan be altered or broken. Our results are obtained using a novel, efficient\nkinetic solver called KiSS-SIDM for tracing the gravothermal evolution based on\nthe Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) framework. In the long mean free path\nstage, the code is a viable alternative to the fluid model, yet requires no\ncalibration parameters.

Identifying an\nappropriate ansatz configuration for variational algorithms, however, remains a\nchallenging task, especially when taking into account restrictions imposed by\nreal quantum platforms. This motivated the development of digital-analog\nquantum circuits, where sequences of quantum gates are alternated with natural\nHamiltonian evolutions. A prominent example is the use of the controllable\nlong-range Ising interaction induced in ion-based quantum computers. This\ninteraction has recently been applied to develop an algorithm similar to the\nquantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), but native to the ion\nhardware. The performance of this algorithm has demonstrated a strong\ndependence on the strengths of the individual ion-ion interactions, which serve\nas ansatz hyperparameters. In this work, we propose a heuristic for identifying\na problem-specific ansatz configuration, which enhances the trainability of the\nion native digital-analog circuit. The proposed approach is systematically\napplied to random instances of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian for up\nto 15 qubits, providing favorable cost landscapes. As the result, the developed\napproach identifies a well-trainable ion native ansatz, which requires a lower\ncircuit depth to solve specific problems as compared to standard QAOA.

Its two optical continuum outbursts observed during the\n$\\sim$ 1.5-year long time span, starting Jan 2018, had been shown to coincide\nwith transition from the FSRQ to BLL state, manifested by a sharp drop in the\nequivalent width of MgII broad emission-line. Recently, a continuous monitoring\nof its blazar state, over a much longer duration (past $\\sim$ 5 years) has\nbecome possible by deploying the observed $\\gamma-ray$ spectral slope\n($\\Gamma_{\\gamma}$) as a diagnostic.

We find that all 4 such\ntransitions ($\\Gamma_{\\gamma}$ becoming < 2.0), observed during the past $\\sim$\n5 years, were accompanied by an optical flare. While this appears consistent\nwith the transition to BL Lac state happening purely due to an enhanced optical\ncontinuum (flaring) swamping out the broad emission-lines, this simple scheme\nmay need additional ingredients, considering the hint found for a day-like\noffset between the flaring and the state transition.",

Our formalism regards the gravitational path integral as a map from\nabstract objects called sources to complex numbers, and introduces additional\nobjects called partial sources, which form sources when glued together.

In these\ncontexts, the relevant gravitational Hilbert spaces contain states prepared by\npartial sources and can consequently have nontrivial $\\alpha$-sectors\nsupporting noncommuting operators.

Rapid binary population synthesis\n(BPS) codes simplify the complex physics of mass transfer by adopting\nparameterized prescriptions for the stability of mass transfer, accretion\nefficiency in stable mass transfer, and the efficiency of common-envelope\nejection. We calibrate these uncertain parameters by comparing BPS models with\nobservational data. White dwarf and main sequence binaries are an ideal\npopulation to study binary interaction, as they can be formed through stable or\nunstable mass transfer, or without interaction, which affect the orbital period\nand masses of the present-day population. The APOGEE-GALEX-Gaia catalog\nprovides a homogeneous sample of over 500 systems with well measured radial\nvelocities that can be used as a comparison baseline for BPS simulations of\nsuch binaries. We compare the distribution of observed maximum radial velocity\nvariation ($\\Delta RV_{\\rm max}$) and estimated masses to BPS models simulated\nwith COSMIC, varying the mass transfer and common-envelope ejection efficiency,\nand the criteria for mass transfer stability at key evolutionary stages. The\n$\\Delta RV_{\\rm max}$ comparison shows clear preference for a higher fraction\nof stable mass transfer during the first ascent giant branch, and for highly\neffective envelope ejection. For the systems with WD masses, there is a slight\npreference for non-conservative mass transfer. In COSMIC and similar codes, the\nenvelope ejection efficiency and the envelope binding energy are degenerate\nparameters. Our result of high ejection efficiency may indicate that either\nadditional sources of energy are required to eject the envelope, or that its\nbinding energy is lower than traditionally assumed.

Taking a representative\nexample of a rutile-lattice tight-binding minimal model in slab geometry, we\nuse the linear response theory to demonstrate the emergence of the domain wall\nAHE, finding that it is closely related with the orbital magnetization, while\nthe spin magnetization does not play a significant role.

The reason is conceptually straightforward. An\ninstrument such as CASPEr-Gradient begins with a large sample of nuclear spins\npolarised in a background magnetic field. In the presence of axion DM coupled\nto nucleons, the spin ensemble feels an effective magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}\n\\propto \\nabla a$ that tilts the spins, generating a potentially observable\nprecession.

This work also describes the Lya\nimaging for the KBSS-Lya survey for the first time. Our sample includes 734\nLya-selected galaxies and 119 continuum-selected galaxies with Lya narrow-band\nimaging, and we measure the spatial morphology of Lya and continuum emission\nfor stacked subsamples of these two populations. These samples allow us to\nstudy the variation in Lya emission profiles over a broad range of UV continuum\nluminosities and Lya equivalent widths (EW_Lya), including systems with net Lya\nabsorption in slit spectroscopy. We characterize the spatial profiles using two\ntechniques: directly fitting an exponential function to the stacked profile,\nand a multi-component forward-modeling technique using the empirical\nlarge-scale PSF. We find that both methods yield similar results and that the\nforward-modeling technique self-consistently fits profiles exhibiting central\nLya emission or Lya absorption, with the spatial scale of central Lya\napproximately matching that of the continuum emission. We also find extended\nLya emission such that all our subsamples -- including central Lya absorbers --\nare net Lya emitters on scales comparable to the circumgalactic medium (R > 50\nkpc, theta > 6''). We find that the scale length of the Lya halo is not\nstrongly dependent on the properties of the central galaxy, including its net\ncontinuum luminosity or EW_Lya, although we find a possible weak tendency of\ncontinuum-faint, high-EW_Lya galaxies to exhibit larger Lya halos in contrast\nwith previous work.",

For all\ngalaxies, we compute both their intrinsic and lensing-induced shear. The\nintrinsic component is derived from the luminosity-weighted inertia tensor of\nstellar particles, while the extrinsic (gravitational) shear is obtained\nthrough full-sky ray-tracing on the same lightcone. This allows us to directly\npredict the impact of intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies on the shear\ncorrelation function and popular convergence statistics in a fully non-linear\nforward model. We find that IA modifies the convergence power spectrum at all\nangular scales by up to 20%, it significantly impacts the PDF, altering its\ntails by 10-20%, and distorts peak and minimum counts up to 30%, depending on\nredshift and scale. We also evaluate the impact of the IA signal on the shear\ncorrelation function finding that, along with a redshift dependence, the signal\nstrongly increases for higher galaxy stellar mass cuts applied to the\ncatalogue. Notably, with the highest stellar mass cut we apply, the intrinsic\nshear autocorrelation can become comparable to the gravitational shear\ncomponent on small angular scales. Our results highlight the importance of\naccurately modeling IA for precision weak lensing cosmology with upcoming Stage\nIV surveys.",

    "abstract": "Large multimodal models excel in multimodal tasks but face significant\ncomputational challenges due to excessive computation on visual tokens. Unlike\ntoken reduction methods that focus on token-level redundancy, we identify and\nstudy the computation-level redundancy on vision tokens to ensure no\ninformation loss. Our key insight is that vision tokens from the pretrained\nvision encoder do not necessarily require all the heavy operations (e.g.,\nself-attention, FFNs) in decoder-only LMMs and could be processed more lightly\nwith proper designs. We designed a series of experiments to discover and\nprogressively squeeze out the vision-related computation redundancy. Based on\nour findings, we propose ProxyV, a novel approach that utilizes proxy vision\ntokens to alleviate the computational burden on original vision tokens. ProxyV\nenhances efficiency without compromising performance and can even yield notable\nperformance gains in scenarios with more moderate efficiency improvements.\nFurthermore, the flexibility of ProxyV is demonstrated through its combination\nwith token reduction methods to boost efficiency further.

    "abstract": "Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a\nfundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural\nnetworks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational\nalignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of\nvisual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The\nnecessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition\nlimits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL\nuses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot\nexamples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We\nleverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable\nnumber of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple\nsubjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context\nlearning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our\nmodel learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher\nvisual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing\nvoxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel\nimages, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also\ngeneralizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different\nsubjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates\nbetter interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending\nto semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables\ninterpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Exemplar-based image colorization aims to colorize a grayscale image using a\nreference color image, ensuring that reference colors are applied to\ncorresponding input regions based on their semantic similarity. To achieve\naccurate semantic matching between regions, we leverage the self-attention\nmodule of a pre-trained diffusion model, which is trained on a large dataset\nand exhibits powerful attention capabilities. To harness this power, we propose\na novel, fine-tuning-free approach based on a pre-trained diffusion model,\nmaking two key contributions. First, we introduce dual attention-guided color\ntransfer. We utilize the self-attention module to compute an attention map\nbetween the input and reference images, effectively capturing semantic\ncorrespondences. The color features from the reference image is then\ntransferred to the semantically matching regions of the input image, guided by\nthis attention map, and finally, the grayscale features are replaced with the\ncorresponding color features. Notably, we utilize dual attention to calculate\nattention maps separately for the grayscale and color images, achieving more\nprecise semantic alignment. Second, we propose classifier-free colorization\nguidance, which enhances the transferred colors by combining color-transferred\nand non-color-transferred outputs. This process improves the quality of\ncolorization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting techniques in terms of image quality and fidelity to the reference.\nSpecifically, we use 335 input-reference pairs from previous research,\nachieving an FID of 95.27 (image quality) and an SI-FID of 5.51 (fidelity to\nthe reference).

In this work, we explore two\nchallenges involved in creating such systems, having to do with basic\nproperties of how neural networks learn and structure their representations.\nThe first challenge regards when it is possible to train narrow models from\nscratch. Through experiments on a synthetic task, we find that it is sometimes\nnecessary to train networks on a wide distribution of data to learn certain\nnarrow skills within that distribution. This effect arises when skills depend\non each other hierarchically, and training on a broad distribution introduces a\ncurriculum which substantially accelerates learning. The second challenge\nregards how to transfer particular skills from large general models into small\nspecialized models. We find that model skills are often not perfectly localized\nto a particular set of prunable components. However, we find that methods based\non pruning can still outperform distillation. We investigate the use of a\nregularization objective to align desired skills with prunable components while\nunlearning unnecessary skills.",

In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis\nexperiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design,\noutput evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising\nfrom blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding\ntasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate\nchain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse\ngrounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals\nor box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and\npoor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy\nexamples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to\nunder-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three\ntargeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages\ndirect answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second,\nwe incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate\nreward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length\nnormalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better\noptimization on hard samples.

Preference-based optimization methods, such as Reinforcement\nLearning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),\nrely on human-annotated datasets to improve alignment. In this work, we\nidentify a crucial property of the existing learning method: the distinguishing\nsignal obtained in preferred responses is often concentrated in the early\ntokens. We refer to this as shallow preference signals.\n  To explore this property, we systematically truncate preference datasets at\nvarious points and train both reward models and DPO models on the truncated\ndata. Surprisingly, models trained on truncated datasets, retaining only the\nfirst half or fewer tokens, achieve comparable or even superior performance to\nthose trained on full datasets. For example, a reward model trained on the\nSkywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2 dataset outperforms the full dataset when\ntrained on a 40\\% truncated dataset. This pattern is consistent across multiple\ndatasets, suggesting the widespread presence of shallow preference signals.\n  We further investigate the distribution of the reward signal through decoding\nstrategies. We consider two simple decoding strategies motivated by the shallow\nreward signal observation, namely Length Control Decoding and KL Threshold\nControl Decoding, which leverage shallow preference signals to optimize the\ntrade-off between alignment and computational efficiency. The performance is\neven better, which again validates our hypothesis.\n  The phenomenon of shallow preference signals highlights potential issues in\nLLM alignment: existing alignment methods often focus on aligning only the\ninitial tokens of responses, rather than considering the full response.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of estimation and learning under temporal\ndistribution shift. Consider an observation sequence of length $n$, which is a\nnoisy realization of a time-varying groundtruth sequence. Our focus is to\ndevelop methods to estimate the groundtruth at the final time-step while\nproviding sharp point-wise estimation error rates. We show that, without prior\nknowledge on the level of temporal shift, a wavelet soft-thresholding estimator\nprovides an optimal estimation error bound for the groundtruth. Our proposed\nestimation method generalizes existing researches Mazzetto and Upfal (2023) by\nestablishing a connection between the sequence's non-stationarity level and the\nsparsity in the wavelet-transformed domain. Our theoretical findings are\nvalidated by numerical experiments. Additionally, we applied the estimator to\nderive sparsity-aware excess risk bounds for binary classification under\ndistribution shift and to develop computationally efficient training\nobjectives. As a final contribution, we draw parallels between our results and\nthe classical signal processing problem of total-variation denoising (Mammen\nand van de Geer,1997; Tibshirani, 2014), uncovering novel optimal algorithms\nfor such task.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) in building reasoning models that articulate chains of thoughts prior to\nproducing final answers. However, despite ongoing advances that aim at enabling\nreasoning for vision-language tasks, existing open-source visual reasoning\nmodels typically generate reasoning content with pure natural language, lacking\nexplicit integration of visual information. This limits their ability to\nproduce clearly articulated and visually grounded reasoning chains. To this\nend, we propose Grounded Reasoning with Images and Texts (GRIT), a novel method\nfor training MLLMs to think with images. GRIT introduces a grounded reasoning\nparadigm, in which models generate reasoning chains that interleave natural\nlanguage and explicit bounding box coordinates. These coordinates point to\nregions of the input image that the model consults during its reasoning\nprocess. Additionally, GRIT is equipped with a reinforcement learning approach,\nGRPO-GR, built upon the GRPO algorithm. GRPO-GR employs robust rewards focused\non the final answer accuracy and format of the grounded reasoning output, which\neliminates the need for data with reasoning chain annotations or explicit\nbounding box labels. As a result, GRIT achieves exceptional data efficiency,\nrequiring as few as 20 image-question-answer triplets from existing datasets.\nComprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GRIT effectively trains MLLMs to\nproduce coherent and visually grounded reasoning chains, showing a successful\nunification of reasoning and grounding abilities.",

The\nsurrogate is based on smoothing methods from the optimization literature, and\nis new for the fair supervised learning literature. The surrogate is a tight\napproximation which ensures the trained prediction models are fair, as opposed\nto other (e.g., convex) surrogates that can fail to lead to a fair prediction\nmodel in practice. (b) Rather than rely on regularizers (that lead to\noptimization problems that are difficult to solve) and corresponding\nregularization parameters (that can be expensive to tune), we propose a\nstrategy that employs hard constraints so that specific tolerances for\nunfairness can be enforced without the complications associated with the use of\nregularization.

To evaluate current retrievers on handling\nattribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with\n9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like\nretrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot\nability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image\nembeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other\ndetails. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model\n(MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with\nthis limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image\nembeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose\nto use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers,\nwhich boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for\nderiving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base\nretriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two\nacceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear\napproximations.

Extensive experiments on\nTopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that ConvSearch-R1 significantly\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvement\non the challenging TopiOCQA dataset while using smaller 3B parameter models\nwithout any external supervision.",

    "abstract": "Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) combined with Burer-Monteiro (BM)\nfactorization, dubbed ALM-BM, offers a powerful approach for solving\nlarge-scale low-rank semidefinite programs (SDPs). Despite its empirical\nsuccess, the theoretical understandings of the resulting non-convex ALM-BM\nsubproblems, particularly concerning their structural properties and efficient\nsubproblem solvability by first-order methods, still remain limited. This work\naddresses these notable gaps by providing a rigorous theoretical analysis. We\ndemonstrate that, under appropriate regularity of the original SDP, termed as\nprimal simplicity, ALM subproblems inherit crucial properties such as\nlow-rankness and strict complementarity when the dual variable is localized.\nFurthermore, ALM subproblems are shown to enjoy a quadratic growth condition,\nbuilding on which we prove that the non-convex ALM-BM subproblems can be solved\nto global optimality by gradient descent, achieving linear convergence under\nconditions of local initialization and dual variable proximity. Through\nillustrative examples, we further establish the necessity of these local\nassumptions, revealing them as inherent characteristics of the problem\nstructure. Motivated by these theoretical insights, we propose ALORA, a\nrank-adaptive augmented Lagrangian method that builds upon the ALM-BM\nframework, which dynamically adjusts the rank using spectral information and\nexplores negative curvature directions to navigate the nonconvex landscape.\nExploiting modern GPU computing architectures, ALORA exhibits strong numerical\nperformance, solving SDPs with tens of millions of dimensions in hundreds of\nseconds.",

Existing\nmethods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or\nencode context into latent representations for soft global compression.\nHowever, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity\nof demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the\nloss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose\n$\\textbf{Hy}$brid $\\textbf{Co}$ntext $\\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for\nLLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context\ncompression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details\nfor task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global\nsemantics with the global view, based on the observation that different\nadapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer\nthat assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local\nview, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a\nbalanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary\nparaphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This\npromotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant\ninformation while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing\nlocal and global information retention in context compression.

    "abstract": "One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on\ntesting possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks\nsuch as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the\nrelationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\\text{L}}$) and the angular\ndiameter distance ($D_{\\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation\n(CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\\eta(z) \\equiv\nD_{\\text{L}}(z)/D_{\\text{A}}(z) = (1+z)^{2}$, making it a powerful probe of a\npotential variation of such a fundamental constant. Hence, we test the\nviability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\\text{A}}$\nmeasurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES\nand DESI, in combination with $D_{\\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type\nIa Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed\non the SN data to match $D_{\\text{A}}$ with $D_{\\text{L}}$ at the same\nredshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2$\\sigma$\nconfidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined\ntogether, as well as when considering SNe with 3D BAO only. However, when SNe\nand 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\\sim\n4\\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently\ndiscussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in\naddition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually.\nTherefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL\nmodel, once these potential systematics are taken into account.",

While recent 3D generative models have\nachieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene\ngeneration often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and\nlow-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free\nframework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single\ntop-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based\ngeneration to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware\n3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry\ngeneration. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions\nand generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked\nrectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while\nmaintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome\nresolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D\nsupervision or fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,\nyet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that\ndisproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias\ndetection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid\nfairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This\npaper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that\nleverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other\ncrowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays\nstripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions\nacross demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.\nWe explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question\nphrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag\ndata segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and\nmachine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals\nfrom non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that\nvisual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.\nThis approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to\nconventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,\ncrowdsourced bias detection pipelines.",

Previous work in model free\nreinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats\nwhere a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we\npropose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using\ntemporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the\naction as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action\nvariables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up\nsimulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon\nsearch in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the\nplanner. In addition, in the model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting,\nit reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time\nfor models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action\ndurations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation\nand integrated into the MBRL framework.

Specifically, we predict\nthat a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the resonant energy transfer rate can be\ngained in the case of the F center in MgO at ~10nm distances from a dipolar\nsource, using rather moderate cavity with quality factor Q~400. We also show\nthat a similar suppression in the transfer rate can be achieved by off-tuning\nthe cavity resonance relative to the emitter transition energy. The framework\npresented here is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices\nwhere localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell\nnanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way\nto predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high\ndensity optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.",

We collected data on remote work\nregulation from corporate HR and/or management representatives from 68\ncorporate entities that vary in size, location, and orientation towards remote\nor office work. Our findings reveal that although many companies prioritize\noffice-centred working (50%), most companies in our sample permit hybrid\nworking to varying degrees (85%). Remote work regulation does not reveal any\nparticular new \"best practice\" as policies differ greatly, but the single most\npopular arrangement was the three in-office days per week. More than half of\nthe companies (51%) encourage or mandate office days, and more than quarter\n(28%) have changed regulations, gradually increasing the mandatory office\npresence or implementing differentiated conditions. Although no companies have\nincreased flexibility, only four companies are returning to full-time office\nwork. Our key recommendation for office-oriented companies is to consider a\ntrust-based alternative to strict office presence mandates, while for companies\noriented toward remote working, we warn about the points of no (or hard)\nreturn.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications\nranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main\napproaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and\njailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even\nagainst Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates\nadversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search\nspace over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding\nsuccessful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to\nlocal minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we\nassess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed\nthreat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment\nprocess. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the\nintermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting\nas a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly\neffective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show\nour informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show\na gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack\nperformance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to\nsuccessfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective\nacross diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs,\neffective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses,\nthat these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit\nalignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together,\nour results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and\nthe need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.",

Sample size determination (SSD) is a\nkey aspect of clinical trial design and various methods for Bayesian sample\nsize determination are available. However, it is unclear how these methods are\nbeing used in practice. A systematic literature review was conducted to\nunderstand how sample sizes for Bayesian randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are\ndetermined and inform the design of future Bayesian trials. We searched five\ndatabases in May 2023, and updated in January 2025, including efficacy RCTs in\nhumans which utilized a Bayesian framework for the primary data analysis,\npublished in English, and enrolled participants between 2009 and 2024. The\nliterature search produced 19,182 records, of which 105 studies were selected\nfor data extraction. Results show that the most common method for SSD in\nBayesian RCTs was a hybrid approach in which elements of Bayesian and\nfrequentist theory are combined. Many RCTs did not provide a justification for\nSSD, while fully Bayesian methods were rarely used in practice, despite\nsignificant theoretical development. Our review also revealed a lack of\nstandardized reporting, making it challenging to review the SSD. The CONSORT\nstatement for reporting RCTs states that sample size calculations must be\nreported, which was poorly adhered to. Among RCTs that reported SSD, relevant\ninformation was frequently omitted from the reports and discussed in poorly\nstructured supplementary materials.

To capture these features, a two-stage distributionally robust\noptimization (DRO) model is developed considering decision-dependent\nuncertainty (DDU), which encompasses variation of the underlying distributional\nambiguity due to the change of the first stage decisions.

In this\nstudy, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale empirical stability study\non popular machine learning global interpretations for both supervised and\nunsupervised tasks on tabular data. Our findings reveal that popular\ninterpretation methods are frequently unstable, notably less stable than the\npredictions themselves, and that there is no association between the accuracy\nof machine learning predictions and the stability of their associated\ninterpretations.

For the evaluation scheme, we\npropose several objective evaluation indicators and incorporate an additional\nLLM-as-a-judge approach to score open-ended questions. Experimental results on\n15 mainstream systems reveal significant variability, each exhibiting distinct\nstrengths and weaknesses, and provide valuable insights to guide future\nresearch in speech interaction systems.",

In this study, we aim to advance the\nfundamental understanding of the interaction between flexible bodies and\nheterogeneous flow conditions. We develop a linear inviscid model of an\nelastically mounted foil that passively pitches in response to a prescribed\nheaving motion and an incoming flow that consists of a traveling wave\ndisturbance superposed on a uniform flow. In addition to the well-known\nresonant response, the wavy flow induces an antiresonant response for\nnon-dimensional phase velocities near unity due to the emergence of\nnon-circulatory forces that oppose circulatory forces. We also find that the\nwavy flow destructively interferes with itself, effectively rendering the foil\na low-pass filter. The net result is that the waviness of the flow always\nimproves thrust and efficiency when the wavy flow is of a different frequency\nthan the prescribed heaving motion. Such a simple statement cannot be made when\nthe wavy flow and heaving motion have the same frequency. Depending on the\nwavenumber and relative phase, the two may work in concert or in opposition,\nbut they do open the possibility of simultaneous propulsion and net energy\nextraction from the flow, which is impossible in a uniform flow.",

Then we use the models' reasoning abilities to explore\nmitigation strategies for enhanced performance. Specifically, we do the\nfollowing: A.

B.\nDesign contrastive few-shot and chain-of-thought prompts by selecting typical\npositive and negative examples of detection reasoning. C.

We conducted extensive comparisons on the DepTweet\ndataset across the following subtasks: 1. identifying whether the speaker is\ndescribing their own depression; 2. accurately detecting the presence of PHQ-9\nsymptoms, and 3. finally, detecting depression. Human verification of\nstatistical outliers shows that LLMs demonstrate greater accuracy in analyzing\nand detecting explicit language of depression as opposed to implicit\nexpressions of depression.

We find that the prevailing assumption, that\nmemorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to\nfully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating\nlanguages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true\npatterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based\ncorrelation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze\ncross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages,\nthose with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend\nthat only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled.\nThese findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in\nevaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also\nconstitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains\nMemorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad\nimplications for multilingual NLP.",

We derive an upper bound on the entanglement that\ncan be harvested by such detectors and show that it scales as a double\nlogarithm with respect to the UV cutoff-significantly weaker than the\nsingle-logarithmic divergence of the standard CFT result.

To address these critical limitations, we propose PsyLLM, the first\nlarge language model designed to systematically integrate both diagnostic and\ntherapeutic reasoning for mental health counseling. To develop the PsyLLM, we\npropose a novel automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline processes\nreal-world mental health posts, generates multi-turn dialogue structures, and\nleverages LLMs guided by international diagnostic standards (e.g., DSM/ICD) and\nmultiple therapeutic frameworks (e.g., CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) to simulate\ndetailed clinical reasoning processes. Rigorous multi-dimensional filtering\nensures the generation of high-quality, clinically aligned dialogue data. In\naddition, we introduce a new benchmark and evaluation protocol, assessing\ncounseling quality across four key dimensions: comprehensiveness,\nprofessionalism, authenticity, and safety.

At pH = 3.0, the best performance was obtained.\nUnder optimum conditions of 20 mA cm-2 and 0.75 mM Fe2+, complete BP-4\ndegradation was achieved in remarkably short times: 2 min for 1-2.5 mg L-1, 3\nmin for 5 mg L-1, 4 min for 10 mg L-1, 5 min for 20 mg L-1, and 7 min for 40 mg\nL-1. Total mineralization was reached for low concentration of 1 mg L-1,\nvarying between 77 and 90% for higher loads up to 40 mg L-1. The reaction\nfollowed pseudo-first-order kinetics, with high apparent rate constant of 0.641\nmin-1 for 40 mg L-1 and lower energy consumption of 0.261 kWh (g TOC)-1.\nRadical quenching experiments with TBA confirmed that physisorbed BDD(.OH) and\nhomogeneous .OH were the predominant oxidants.

In this work, we demonstrate that,\nsurprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a\nphenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel\nmulti-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt\nthe LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current\nround, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards.\nAt the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context\nconsisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality\nof the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM\nis able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like\nan RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24,\ncreative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance\nimprovements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.\nSurprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM\nitself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting,\noffering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.",

There are usually a large\namount of LEMs, so we only consider those above some length threshold\n$\\mathcal{L}$. These are referred to as long LEMs. The purpose of long LEMs is\nto capture substring matches between a query and a text that are not\nnecessarily maximal in the pattern but still long enough to be important.\nTherefore efficient long LEMs finding algorithms are desired for these\ndatasets. However, these datasets are too large to query on traditional string\nindexes. Fortunately, these datasets are very repetitive. Recently, compressed\nstring indexes that take advantage of the redundancy in the data but retain\nefficient querying capability have been proposed as a solution. We therefore\ngive an efficient algorithm for computing all the long LEMs of a query and a\ntext in a BWT runs compressed string index. We describe an $O(m+occ)$ expected\ntime algorithm that relies on an $O(r)$ words space string index for outputting\nall long LEMs of a pattern with respect to a text given the matching statistics\nof the pattern with respect to the text. Here $m$ is the length of the query,\n$occ$ is the number of long LEMs outputted, and $r$ is the number of runs in\nthe BWT of the text. The $O(r)$ space string index we describe relies on an\nadaptation of the move data structure by Nishimoto and Tabei. We are able to\nsupport $LCP[i]$ queries in constant time given $SA[i]$. In other words, we\nanswer $PLCP[i]$ queries in constant time. Long LEMs may provide useful\nsimilarity information between a pattern and a text that MEMs may ignore.

Manually designing reward\nfunctions is tedious and error-prone. A principled alternative is to specify\nbehaviors in a formal language that can be automatically translated into\nrewards. Omega-regular languages are a natural choice for this purpose, given\ntheir established role in formal verification and synthesis. However, existing\nmethods using omega-regular specifications typically rely on discounted reward\nRL in episodic settings, with periodic resets. This setup misaligns with the\nsemantics of omega-regular specifications, which describe properties over\ninfinite behavior traces. In such cases, the average reward criterion and the\ncontinuing setting -- where the agent interacts with the environment over a\nsingle, uninterrupted lifetime -- are more appropriate.\n  To address the challenges of infinite-horizon, continuing tasks, we focus on\nabsolute liveness specifications -- a subclass of omega-regular languages that\ncannot be violated by any finite behavior prefix, making them well-suited to\nthe continuing setting. We present the first model-free RL framework that\ntranslates absolute liveness specifications to average-reward objectives. Our\napproach enables learning in communicating MDPs without episodic resetting. We\nalso introduce a reward structure for lexicographic multi-objective\noptimization, aiming to maximize an external average-reward objective among the\npolicies that also maximize the satisfaction probability of a given\nomega-regular specification. Our method guarantees convergence in unknown\ncommunicating MDPs and supports on-the-fly reductions that do not require full\nknowledge of the environment, thus enabling model-free RL.

It enables the\ndevelopment of robust and computationally efficient algorithms capable of\nconverging to accurate velocity models, even from poor initial estimates.\nTraditionally, these methods optimize an Augmented Lagrangian (AL) function,\nusing a scalar penalty parameter to weight the quadratic penalty term for\nwave-equation constraint violations. This penalty balances relaxation of the\nwave equation to improve data fit. However, it imposes uniform relaxation\nacross the model, regardless of source location and the natural decay of\nseismic amplitudes. To overcome this, we propose a variable penalty strategy\nthat introduces greater flexibility by assigning distance-dependent penalties\nto the wave-equation constraints. These nonstationary weights apply minimal\npenalties near the source and larger penalties with increasing distance. This\ncompensates for amplitude decay and allows the wave equation to be satisfied\nmore uniformly across the model. This eliminates the need for explicit source\nsignature estimation and relaxes the requirement for source alignment with grid\npoints, making the method more practical for real applications. The strategy is\nimplemented in the dual formulation of the multiplier method, where model\nparameters are eliminated, reducing the problem to a fixed-point iteration for\nsource multipliers. Once obtained, model parameters are recovered as a\nbyproduct. Numerical experiments show that this method eliminates explicit\nsource estimation and enhances convexity, improving robustness, convergence,\nand computational efficiency of FWI.",

    "abstract": "Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but\nits scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands\nof LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the\ntransformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model\nparameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small\nportion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still\nface three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure\ntransmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means\nthat federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing\nhigh communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to\ndownstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure,\nEfficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First,\nwe inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure\nend-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression\nand KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training\nand inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points\nfor input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on\nnatural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show\nthat FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and\nachieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of\nprivacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the\neffectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.",

Machine unlearning provides a systematic methodology for\ntargeted knowledge removal from trained models, enabling elimination of\nsensitive information influences. However, mainstream fine-tuning-based\nunlearning methods often fail to balance unlearning efficacy and model ability,\nfrequently resulting in catastrophic model collapse under extensive knowledge\nremoval. Meanwhile, in-context unlearning, which relies solely on contextual\nprompting without modifying the model's intrinsic mechanisms, suffers from\nlimited generalizability and struggles to achieve true unlearning. In this\nwork, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning paradigm that employs learnable\nparametric suffix (unlearning token) to steer language models toward targeted\nforgetting behaviors. UniErase operates through two key phases: (I) an\noptimization stage that binds desired unlearning outputs to the model's\nautoregressive probability distribution via token optimization, followed by\n(II) a lightweight model editing phase that activates the learned token to\nprobabilistically induce specified forgetting objective. Serving as a new\nresearch direction for token learning to induce unlearning target, UniErase\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across batch, sequential, and\nprecise unlearning under fictitious and real-world knowledge settings.\nRemarkably, in terms of TOFU benchmark, UniErase, modifying only around 3.66%\nof the LLM parameters, outperforms previous forgetting SOTA baseline by around\n4.01 times for model ability with even better unlearning efficacy. Similarly,\nUniErase, maintaining more ability, also surpasses previous retaining SOTA by\n35.96% for unlearning efficacy, showing dual top-tier performances in current\nunlearing domain.",

Monte Carlo\nDropout (MCD) is a widely used method for uncertainty quantification, as it can\nbe easily integrated into various deep architectures. However, conventional MCD\noften struggles with providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. To\naddress this, we introduce innovative frameworks that enhances MCD by\nintegrating different search solutions namely Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO),\nBayesian Optimization (BO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as well as an\nuncertainty-aware loss function, thereby improving the reliability of\nuncertainty quantification. We conduct comprehensive experiments using\ndifferent backbones, namely DenseNet121, ResNet50, and VGG16, on various\ndatasets, including Cats vs. Dogs, Myocarditis, Wisconsin, and a synthetic\ndataset (Circles). Our proposed algorithm outperforms the MCD baseline by 2-3%\non average in terms of both conventional accuracy and uncertainty accuracy\nwhile achieving significantly better calibration. These results highlight the\npotential of our approach to enhance the trustworthiness of deep learning\nmodels in safety-critical applications.",

To this end, we propose integrating swarm intelligence into the\nreasoning process by introducing a novel Agent-based Swarm Intelligence (ASI)\nparadigm. In this paradigm, we formulate LLM reasoning as an optimization\nproblem and use a swarm intelligence scheme to guide a group of LLM-based\nagents in collaboratively searching for optimal solutions. To avoid swarm\nintelligence getting trapped in local optima, we further develop a Swarm\nIntelligence Enhancing Reasoning (SIER) framework, which develops a\ndensity-driven strategy to enhance the reasoning ability. To be specific, we\npropose to perform kernel density estimation and non-dominated sorting to\noptimize both solution quality and diversity simultaneously. In this case, SIER\nefficiently enhances solution space exploration through expanding the diversity\nof the reasoning path. Besides, a step-level quality evaluation is used to help\nagents improve solution quality by correcting low-quality intermediate steps.\nThen, we use quality thresholds to dynamically control the termination of\nexploration and the selection of candidate steps, enabling a more flexible and\nefficient reasoning process.

Chemical\nreaction network (CRN) inference aims to identify, from observing species\nconcentrations over time, the unknown reactions between the species. Existing\napproaches largely focus on identifying a single, most likely CRN, without\naddressing uncertainty about the network structure. However, it is important to\nquantify structural uncertainty to have confidence in our inference and\npredictions. In this work, we do so by inferring an approximate posterior\ndistribution over CRN structures. This is done by keeping a large set of\nsuboptimal solutions found through sparse optimisation, in contrast to existing\noptimisation approaches which discard suboptimal solutions. We find that\ninducing reaction sparsity with nonconvex penalty functions results in more\nparsimonious CRNs compared to the popular lasso regularisation.

Classical algorithms by Luby\n[JACM'86] and Alon, Babai, and Itai [JALG'86] find an MIS in $O(\\log n)$ rounds\nin $n$-node graphs with high probability. Despite decades of research, the\nexistence of any $o(\\log n)$-round algorithm for general graphs remains one of\nthe major open problems in the field.\n  Interestingly, the hard instances for this problem must contain\nconstant-length cycles. This is because there exists a sublogarithmic-round\nalgorithm for graphs with super-constant girth; i.e., graphs where the length\nof the shortest cycle is $\\omega(1)$, as shown by Ghaffari~[SODA'16]. Thus,\nresolving this $\\approx 40$-year-old open problem requires understanding the\nfamily of graphs that contain $k$-cycles for some constant $k$.\n  In this work, we come very close to resolving this $\\approx 40$-year-old open\nproblem by presenting a sublogarithmic-round algorithm for graphs that can\ncontain $k$-cycles for all $k > 6$. Specifically, our algorithm finds an MIS in\n$O\\left(\\frac{\\log \\Delta}{\\log(\\log^* \\Delta)} + \\mathrm{poly}(\\log\\log\nn)\\right)$ rounds, as long as the graph does not contain cycles of length $\\leq\n6$, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. As a result, we push the\nlimit on the girth of graphs that admit sublogarithmic-round algorithms from $k\n= \\omega(1)$ all the way down to a small constant $k=7$. This also implies a\n$o(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ round algorithm for MIS in trees, refuting a conjecture from\nthe book by Barrenboim and Elkin.",

In the present\nwork, we extend our analysis to investigate how this scalar-photon coupling\naffects the CMB temperature-redshift law and CMB anisotropies.

To enhance the\nsecurity and trust for TLS 1.3 in such scenarios, we propose LURK-T, a provably\nsecure framework which allows for limited use of remote keys with added trust\nin TLS 1.3. We efficiently decouple the server side of TLS 1.3 into a LURK-T\nCrypto Service (CS) and a LURK-T Engine (E). CS executes all cryptographic\noperations in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), upon E's requests. CS and\nE together provide the whole TLS-server functionality. A major benefit of our\nconstruction is that it is application agnostic; the LURK-T Crypto Service\ncould be collocated with the LURK-T Engine, or it could run on different\nmachines. Thus, our design allows for in situ attestation and protection of the\ncryptographic side of the TLS server, as well as for all setups of CDNs over\nTLS. To support such a generic decoupling, we provide a full Application\nProgramming Interface (API) for LURK-T. To this end, we implement our LURK-T\nCrypto Service using Intel SGX and integrate it with OpenSSL. We also test\nLURK-T's efficiency and show that, from a TLS-client's perspective, HTTPS\nservers using LURK-T instead a traditional TLS-server have no noticeable\noverhead when serving files greater than 1MB.

However, current DNA data storage technologies are\nfacing challenges with respect to cost (writing data to DNA is expensive) and\nreliability (reading and writing data is error prone). Thus, data compression\nand error correction are crucial to scale DNA storage. Additionally, the DNA\nmolecules encoding several files are very often stored in the same place,\ncalled an oligo pool. For this reason, without random access solutions, it is\nrelatively impractical to decode a specific file from the pool, because all the\noligos from all the files need to first be sequenced, which greatly\ndeteriorates the read cost. This paper introduces PIC-DNA - a novel\nJPEG2000-based progressive image coder adapted to DNA data storage. This coder\ndirectly includes a random access process in its coding system, allowing for\nthe retrieval of a specific image from a pool of oligos encoding several\nimages. The progressive decoder can dynamically adapt the read cost according\nto the user's cost and quality constraints at decoding time. Both the random\naccess and progressive decoding greatly improve on the read-cost of image\ncoders adapted to DNA.",

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) accelerates progress in deep learning\nthrough systematic refinement of model architectures. The downside is\nincreasingly large energy consumption during the search process.\nSurrogate-based benchmarking mitigates the cost of full training by querying a\npre-trained surrogate to obtain an estimate for the quality of the model.\nSpecifically, energy-aware benchmarking aims to make it possible for NAS to\nfavourably trade off model energy consumption against accuracy. Towards this\nend, we propose three design principles for such energy-aware benchmarks: (i)\nreliable power measurements, (ii) a wide range of GPU usage, and (iii) holistic\ncost reporting. We analyse EA-HAS-Bench based on these principles and find that\nthe choice of GPU measurement API has a large impact on the quality of results.\nUsing the Nvidia System Management Interface (SMI) on top of its underlying\nlibrary influences the sampling rate during the initial data collection,\nreturning faulty low-power estimations. This results in poor correlation with\naccurate measurements obtained from an external power meter. With this study,\nwe bring to attention several key considerations when performing energy-aware\nsurrogate-based benchmarking and derive first guidelines that can help design\nnovel benchmarks. We show a narrow usage range of the four GPUs attached to our\ndevice, ranging from 146 W to 305 W in a single-GPU setting, and narrowing down\neven further when using all four GPUs. To improve holistic energy reporting, we\npropose calibration experiments over assumptions made in popular tools, such as\nCode Carbon, thus achieving reductions in the maximum inaccuracy from 10.3 % to\n8.9 % without and to 6.6 % with prior estimation of the expected load on the\ndevice.",

First,\nwe consider Demazure products associated to random pipe dreams, generalizing\nthe Grothendieck permutons introduced by Morales, Panova, Petrov, and\nYeliussizov by replacing staircase shapes with arbitrary order-convex shapes.\nUsing the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) with geometric\njumps, we prove precise scaling limit and fluctuation results for the\nassociated height functions, showing that these models belong to the\nKardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We then consider permutons\nobtained by applying deterministic sequences of bubble-sort operators to random\ninitial permutations. We again provide precise descriptions of the limiting\npermutons. In a special case, we deduce the exact forms of the standard\nbubble-sort permutons, the supports of which were computed by DiFranco.\n  A crucial tool in our analysis is a formulation, due to Chan and Pflueger, of\nthe Demazure product as matrix multiplication in the min-plus tropical\nsemiring. This allows us to define a Demazure product on the set of permutons.\nWe discuss further applications of this product. For instance, we show that the\nnumber of inversions of the Demazure product of two independent uniformly\nrandom permutations of size $n$ is $\\binom{n}{2}(1-o(1))$.",

The majority of past analyses focused on the images already captured,\nwhereas effects of the image formation pipeline and environment are less\nstudied. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the impact of\ncapture conditions, such as camera parameters and lighting, on DL model\nperformance on 3 vision tasks -- image classification, object detection, and\nvisual question answering (VQA). To this end, we assess capture bias in common\nvision datasets and create a new benchmark, SNAP (for $\\textbf{S}$hutter speed,\nISO se$\\textbf{N}$sitivity, and $\\textbf{AP}$erture), consisting of images of\nobjects taken under controlled lighting conditions and with densely sampled\ncamera settings. We then evaluate a large number of DL vision models and show\nthe effects of capture conditions on each selected vision task. Lastly, we\nconduct an experiment to establish a human baseline for the VQA task. Our\nresults show that computer vision datasets are significantly biased, the models\ntrained on this data do not reach human accuracy even on the well-exposed\nimages, and are susceptible to both major exposure changes and minute\nvariations of camera settings.

Recent works have proposed composing explanations\nfrom semantic concepts (e.g., colors, patterns, shapes) that are inherently\ninterpretable to the user of a model. However, these methods generally ignore\nthe communicative context of explanation-the ability of the user to understand\nthe prediction of the model from the explanation. For example, while a medical\ndoctor might understand an explanation in terms of clinical markers, a patient\nmay need a more accessible explanation to make sense of the same diagnosis. In\nthis paper, we address this gap with listener-adaptive explanations.

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of group cooperation constitutes a fundamental mechanism\nunderlying various social and biological systems. Complex networks provide a\nstructural framework for group interactions, where individuals can not only\nobtain information from their neighbors but also choose neighbors as\ncooperative partners. However, traditional evolutionary game theory models,\nwhere nodes are the game players, are not convenient for directly choosing\ncooperative partners. Here, we exchange the roles of nodes and edges and\ninnovatively propose the \"edge game\" model, using edges in complex networks as\nvirtual game players for group games. Theoretical analysis and simulation\nexperiments show that by configuring a synergy factor (r) that satisfies the\n\"moderate cooperation\" condition, a stable cooperative structure can be\nachieved for any network at the evolutionary equilibrium. Specifically, when\nthere is no constraint on the number of cooperators per node, the condition for\nthe evolution of cooperation in the network is r > kmax, where kmax is the\nmaximum degree of the nodes. When there is a threshold constraint, in\nnearest-neighbor coupled networks (with degree k), the condition for \"moderate\ncooperation\" is k < r < 2k. In heterogeneous networks, a variable synergy\nfactor scheme is adopted, where the synergy factor for each game group (rx) is\ndefined to be proportional to the degree of the central node (kx) in the group\n(rx = n-fold*kx), \"moderate cooperation\" can be achieved when 1 < n-fold < 2.\nIf the value of r exceeds the range, it may lead to \"excessive cooperation\"\nwith node overload. Comparing algorithm performance and time complexity, edge\ngames demonstrate advantages over other optimization algorithms. Simple and\nuniversal, the edge game provides a new approach to addressing multi-agent\ncooperation problems in the era of machine intelligence.",

    "abstract": "If one wants to establish optimality of a given bipartite entanglement\nwitness, the current standard approach is to check whether it has the spanning\nproperty. Although this is not necessary for optimality, it is most often\nsatisfied in practice, and for small enough dimensions or sufficiently\nstructured witnesses this criterion can be checked by hand. In this work we\nintroduce a novel characterization of the spanning property via\nentanglement-breaking channels, which in turn leads to a new sufficient\ncriterion for optimality. This criterion amounts to just checking the kernel of\nsome bipartite state. It is slightly weaker than the spanning property, but it\nis a lot easier to test for -- by hand as well as numerically -- and it applies\nto almost all witnesses which are known to have the spanning property. A second\ncriterion is derived from this, where one can simply compute the expectation\nvalue of the given witness on a maximally entangled state. Finally, this\napproach implies new spectral constraints on witnesses as well as on positive\nmaps.",

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving\ncomplex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by\ngenerating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit\nsubstantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we\ninvestigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically,\nwe first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient\nreasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on\nthis perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method\n(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target\nlength. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal\nbalance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based\non two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during\ntraining, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and\ndynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of\nthought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be\ndifficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.\nThis approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow\nthinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed\nLASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both\nreasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and\nits variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage\nby 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise\nreasoning patterns with less redundant \"self-reflections\". Resources are at\nhttps://github.com/hkust-nlp/Laser.",

    "abstract": "The power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has recently improved\nbeyond 20%. The active layers of these devices comprise of at least two organic\nsemiconductors, forming a type II heterojunction. Hereby, the device\nperformance is determined by the kinetic interplay of various species,\nincluding localized excitons, charge transfer states as well as\ncharge-separated states. However, a model which describes all relevant\nphotovoltaic measures has yet to be developed. Herein, we present a\ncomprehensive 5-state rate model which includes both singlet and triplet charge\ntransfer states and takes into account the formation, re-splitting and decay of\nthe local triplet state, parametric in the respective energy offset. We show\nthat this model not only describes key device properties such as charge\ngeneration efficiency, photoluminescence, electroluminescence and Langevin\nreduction factor simultaneously but also elucidate how these vary across\nmaterial combinations based on the D:A interfacial energy offset alone. We find\nthat the electroluminescence and Langevin reduction factor depend strongly on\nthe triplet properties and that the triplet decay becomes the dominant charge\nrecombination pathway for systems with moderate offset, in full agreement to\nprevious experimental results. Validation against literature data demonstrates\nthe model's ability to predict the device efficiency accurately. Subsequently,\nwe identify material combinations with singlet exciton to charge transfer state\nenergetic offset of roughly 150meV as particularly promising. Our model\nexplains further why recent certified efficiency records for binary blends\nremain at ca. 20% if no further means to improve photon and charge carrier\nharvesting are taken.",

Using a theoretical game structure\nframework, this study explores customer decision patterns regarding store\nvisits, product trials, and returns, while examining the strategic role of\nstore clerks in encouraging product trials. The findings suggest that retailers\ncan maximize profit through trial and return options when product fit\nprobability is low, emphasizing the importance of maintaining complementary\nphysical and online channels.

The integration allows efficient\nexecution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while\neliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating\nAI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression\ntesting across architectures, and device communication analysis. Our findings\ndemonstrate that embedding PCI devices into SystemC simulations significantly\nenhances",

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of this century, the significant advancements in\nartificial intelligence and neural networks have offered the potential to bring\nnew transformations to short-term earthquake prediction research. However,\ncurrently, there is no widely used benchmark for this task. To address this, we\nhave built a new benchmark (EPBench), which is, to our knowledge, the first\nglobal regional-scale short-term earthquake prediction benchmark. Our benchmark\ncomprises 924,472 earthquake records and 2959 multimodal earthquake records\ncollected from seismic networks around the world. Each record includes basic\ninformation such as time, longitude and latitude, magnitude, while each\nmultimodal record includes waveform and moment tensor information additionally,\ncovering a time span from 1970 to 2021. To evaluate performance of models on\nthis task, we have established a series of data partitions and evaluation\nmethods tailored to the short-term earthquake prediction task. We also provide\na variety of tools to assist future researchers in partitioning the data\naccording to their geographical understanding. Our benchmark includes a variety\nof neural network models widely used for time series forecasting, as well as a\nstatistical-based model currently employed by seismological bureaus in several\ncountries. We hope this benchmark will serve as a guide to attract more\nresearchers to explore new methods for addressing this task, which holds great\nsignificance for human existence.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by\ngrounding responses with retrieved information. As an emerging paradigm,\nAgentic RAG further enhances this process by introducing autonomous LLM agents\ninto the information seeking process. However, existing benchmarks fall short\nin evaluating such systems, as they are confined to a static retrieval\nenvironment with a fixed, limited corpus} and simple queries that fail to\nelicit agentic behavior. Moreover, their evaluation protocols assess\ninformation seeking effectiveness by pre-defined gold sets of documents, making\nthem unsuitable for the open-ended and dynamic nature of real-world web\nenvironments. To bridge this gap, we present InfoDeepSeek, a new benchmark with\nchallenging questions designed for assessing agentic information seeking in\nreal-world, dynamic web environments. We propose a systematic methodology for\nconstructing challenging queries satisfying the criteria of determinacy,\ndifficulty, and diversity. Based on this, we develop the first evaluation\nframework tailored to dynamic agentic information seeking, including\nfine-grained metrics about the accuracy, utility, and compactness of\ninformation seeking outcomes. Through extensive experiments across LLMs, search\nengines, and question types, InfoDeepSeek reveals nuanced agent behaviors and\noffers actionable insights for future research.",

In this paper, we introduce MIRB (Mathematical Information\nRetrieval Benchmark) to assess the MIR capabilities of retrieval models.

Recognizing that the convergence\nrate of power method is slow due to its dependence on the eigenvalue\ndistribution, we propose two improved versions of power method based on dual\ncomplex adjoint matrices and Aitken extrapolation, named DCAM-PM and ADCAM-PM.\nThey achieve notable efficiency improvements and demonstrate significantly\nfaster convergence. However, power method may be invalid for dual quaternion\nHermitian matrices with eigenvalues having identical standard parts but\ndistinct dual parts. To overcome this disadvantage, utilizing the\neigen-decomposition properties of dual complex adjoint matrix, we propose a\nnovel algorithm EDDCAM-EA which surpasses the power method in both accuracy and\nspeed. Application to eigenvalue computations of dual quaternion Hermitian\nmatrices in multi-agent formation control and numerical experiments highlight\nthe remarkable accuracy and speed of our proposed algorithms.",

However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and\nits variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance\nsegmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further\nhinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we\npropose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which\nincludes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we\nintroduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate\nsegmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from\nthe SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the\nMask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective\nvisual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater\nPrompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater\nprompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts,\nthus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for\nefficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model\nis effective, achieving significant performance improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets.

We show that six of the\nsystems are low-mass, double helium-core white dwarf binaries, with the last\none a carbon-oxygen -- helium core white dwarf binary. These binaries slowly\nspiral inwards due to gravitational wave energy losses and are expected to\nmerge within 36Myr--1.2Gyr, and we predict that the shortest orbital period\nbinary will show a measurable eclipse arrival time delay within a decade. The\ntwo longest systems show a delay in the arrival time of the secondary eclipse,\nwhich we attribute to a small eccentricity of $\\approx 2\\times10^{-3}$. This is\nthe first time that a non-zero eccentricity is measured in a compact double\nwhite dwarf binary. We suggest that these systems emerged from the common\nenvelope with this small eccentricity, and because of the relatively long\norbital period, gravitational wave emission has not yet circularised the\nbinaries. Finally, we predict that relativistic apsidal precession will result\nin a change in the delay of the secondary eclipse that is measurable within a\ndecade.",

We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a\nquery-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance\nscores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify\ninformative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained\nthrough a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned\nfusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a\ndistinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality,\ncross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch.

Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including\negocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\\% and\n8.0\\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language\nmodels, respectively.

This paper investigates all affine irreducible Coxeter\ngroups of rank 3, specifically those of affine types $\\widetilde{A}_2$,\n$\\widetilde{C}_2$, and $\\widetilde{G}_2$. By employing key concepts from\nbuilding theory, we develop novel techniques: first reducing and classifying\nthe convex hull in their Cayley graphs into finitely many cases, then proving\nthe strong hull conjecture for these cases through combinatorial computations.\nNotably, for the case of affine type $\\widetilde{G}_2$, we streamline the proof\nstrategy by reducing it to a corollary of results established for affine type\n$\\widetilde{A}_2$. The reduction techniques developed in this study demonstrate\npotential for generalization.

The generated\nmodel parameters reside in a low-dimensional subspace, enabling efficient\ncommunication and computation. FLowDUP's learning objective is theoretically\nmotivated by our new transductive multi-task PAC-Bayesian generalization bound,\nthat provides performance guarantees for unlabeled clients.

In contrast, axiomatic QFT (AxQFT) aspires to a consistent,\nmathematically rigorous foundation, yet lacks empirical applicability. This\npaper introduces the heuristic vehicle of a realism quotient to model and\nnavigate this tension, framing it as a dynamic balance between realism and\ninstrumentalism in the mathematical structures of physical theories. By\nreconstructing the historical development of QFT and extrapolating its\ntrajectory, the paper offers both a descriptive account of theoretical progress\nand a normative proposal: that CQFT and AxQFT must converge to address selected\nchallenges of physics beyond the Standard Model. The model also contributes to\nbroader debates in scientific realism, offering a structured framework for\nunderstanding the interplay between empirical adequacy and conceptual\nrobustness and mathematical rigour in foundational physics.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are essential for multimodal tasks, especially\ncompositional reasoning (CR) tasks, which require distinguishing fine-grained\nsemantic differences between visual and textual embeddings. However, existing\nmethods primarily fine-tune the model by generating text-based hard negative\nsamples, neglecting the importance of image-based negative samples, which\nresults in insufficient training of the visual encoder and ultimately impacts\nthe overall performance of the model. Moreover, negative samples are typically\ntreated uniformly, without considering their difficulty levels, and the\nalignment of positive samples is insufficient, which leads to challenges in\naligning difficult sample pairs. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive\nHard Negative Perturbation Learning (AHNPL). AHNPL translates text-based hard\nnegatives into the visual domain to generate semantically disturbed image-based\nnegatives for training the model, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\nAHNPL also introduces a contrastive learning approach using a multimodal hard\nnegative loss to improve the model's discrimination of hard negatives within\neach modality and a dynamic margin loss that adjusts the contrastive margin\naccording to sample difficulty to enhance the distinction of challenging sample\npairs. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method\neffectively boosts VLMs' performance on complex CR tasks. The source code is\navailable at https://github.com/nynu-BDAI/AHNPL.",

Traditional spectrum\ncartography methods have limitations in handling the temporal and spatial\ncomplexities inherent to these networks. Addressing these challenges, the\nproposed framework first employs a Reconstructive Masked Autoencoder (RecMAE)\ncapable of accurately reconstructing spectrum maps from sparse and temporally\nvarying sensor data using a novel dual-mask mechanism. This approach\nsignificantly enhances the precision of reconstructed radio frequency (RF)\npower maps. In the second stage, the Multi-agent Diffusion Policy (MADP) method\nintegrates diffusion-based reinforcement learning to optimize the trajectories\nof dynamic UAV sensors. By leveraging temporal-attention encoding, this method\neffectively manages spatial exploration and exploitation to minimize cumulative\nreconstruction errors. Extensive numerical experiments validate that this\nintegrated GenAI framework outperforms traditional interpolation methods and\ndeep learning baselines by achieving 57.35% and 88.68% reconstruction error\nreduction, respectively.

By solving the Klein-Gordon equation using both tunneling and\nfield-theoretic methods, we compute the pair production rate and identify an\neffective Unruh-like temperature. In particular, we apply the WKB approximation\nfor Hawking tunneling, justified by the infinite blueshift experienced by\noutgoing modes near the horizon. Instability arises when local acceleration\nexceeds the AdS curvature scale, linking near-horizon dynamics to thermal\nemission. Through the generalized uncertainty principle, which implies the\nexistence of a minimal length, we argue that quantum gravity effects can drive\nthe Hawking and Schwinger-like temperatures to zero.

The Lightning\nprotocol's complexity makes it hard to assess whether the protocol is secure.\nTo enable computer-aided security verification of Lightning, we formalize the\nprotocol in TLA+ and formally specify the security property that honest users\nare guaranteed to retrieve their correct balance. While model checking provides\na fully automated verification of the security property, the state space of the\nprotocol's specification is so large that model checking becomes unfeasible. We\nmake model checking the Lightning Network possible using two refinement steps\nthat we verify using proofs.

In a second step, we prove that it suffices to model check the\nprotocol for single payment channels and the protocol for multi-hop payments\nseparately.

As a result, the impact of the LLM positional\nbias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by\nrelated works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and\ndistracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that\nsophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM\npositional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.",

    "abstract": "Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping\ngrid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage\ndecentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool\nfor power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault\nline identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability\ndepends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor\nfailures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a\nchallenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically\nvalidated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the\nimpact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate\nrealistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative\ninsights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by\napplying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model\nremains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\\pm$ 0.000 even after\na 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance\ndecreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to\ncommunication failures at critical network points. These findings offer\nactionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection.\nThis enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.",

    "abstract": "Transformer language models have driven significant progress across various\nfields, including natural language processing and computer vision. A central\ncomponent of these models is the self-attention (SA) mechanism, which learns\nrich vector representations of tokens by modeling their relationships with\nothers in a sequence. However, despite extensive research, transformers\ncontinue to suffer from training instability -- often manifesting as spikes or\ndivergence in the training loss during a run.\n  In this work, we identify one source of this instability: SA's limited\nability to capture short-range dependencies, especially in tasks like language\nmodeling, where almost every token heavily relies on its nearby neighbors. This\nlimitation causes the pre-softmax logits of SA to grow rapidly, destabilizing\ntraining. To address this, we propose decomposing the SA into local\n(short-range) and global (long-range) attention heads. This decomposed\nattention, referred to as Long Short-attention (LS-attention), mitigates logit\nexplosion and results in more stable training compared to an equivalent\nmulti-head self-attention (MHSA). Empirical comparisons with two alternative\ntraining stabilization methods show that LS-attention reduces the validation\nperplexity to nearly 2/5 of that achieved by one method and reaches a similar\nperplexity as the other method using only 1/20 of the GPU hours. Additionally,\nour experiments demonstrate that LS-attention reduces inference latency by up\nto 36% compared to a state-of-the-art implementation of equivalent MHSA.",

The configuration (length and position) of\ntask's communication intervals directly define which task instances propagate\ndata through the chain and affect end-to-end latencies. Since not all task\ninstances propagate data through the chain, the execution of these instances\nwastes processing resources. By manipulating the configuration of communication\nintervals, it is possible to control which task instances are relevant for data\npropagation and end-to-end latencies. However, since tasks can belong to more\nthan one cause-effect chain, the problem of configuring communication intervals\nbecomes non-trivial given the large number of possible configurations. In this\npaper, we present a method to decrease the waste of processing resources while\nreducing end-to-end latencies. We use a search algorithm to analyze different\ncommunication interval configurations and find the combination that best\ndecrease system utilization while reducing end-to-end latencies. By controlling\ndata propagation by means of precedence constraints, our method modifies\ncommunication intervals and controls which task instances affect end-to-end\nlatencies.

    "abstract": "We consider decentralized optimization over a compact Riemannian submanifold\nin a network of $n$ agents, where each agent holds a smooth, nonconvex local\nobjective defined by its private data. The goal is to collaboratively minimize\nthe sum of these local objective functions. In the presence of data\nheterogeneity across nodes, existing algorithms typically require communicating\nboth local gradients and iterates to ensure exact convergence with constant\nstep sizes. In this work, we propose REXTRA, a Riemannian extension of the\nEXTRA algorithm [Shi et al., SIOPT, 2015], to address this limitation. On the\ntheoretical side, we leverage proximal smoothness to overcome the challenges of\nmanifold nonconvexity and establish a global sublinear convergence rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$, matching the best-known results. To our knowledge, REXTRA\nis the first algorithm to achieve a global sublinear convergence rate under a\nconstant step size while requiring only a single round of local iterate\ncommunication per iteration. Numerical experiments show that REXTRA achieves\nsuperior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while supporting\nlarger step sizes and reducing total communication by over 50\\%.",

In this article, we\nprovide a development of such an enhancement for Nakaoka-Palu's notion of\nextriangulated categories which contains exact and triangulated categories. The\nenhancement of them was recently initiated by Xiaofa Chen under the name of\nexact dg categories. In addition, it is known that a certain ideal quotient of\nan extriangulated category is still extriangulated, and such an extriangulated\nideal quotient was enhanced by the dg quotient of the associated connective\nexact dg category there. Motivated by Chen's enhanced extriangulated theory, we\nintroduce the notion of cohomological envelope of an exact dg category and\ngeneralize his enhanced ideal quotient. We indeed show that the dg quotient of\nexact dg categories passing to the cohomological envelope and substructures,\nwhere we call it the exact dg subquotient, enjoys compatibility with a wide\nclass of extriangulated quotients in the sense of Nakaoka-Ogawa-Sakai. To\nutilize and clarify the range of our approach, we formulate the extriangulated\nsubquotient which permits us to localize any extriangulated category by\nextension-closed subcategories. It includes not only both the ideal quotient\nand the Verdier quotient, but the quotient of an exact category by biresolving\nsubcategories. Notably the extriangulated subquotient is lifted to the exact dg\nsubquotient.",

Our setting is simplified, with uniform and\nnon-magnetised solar wind, to which we superpose turbulent fluctuations.

The ratio between the expansion and Alfv\\'en timescales, associated\nrespectively to propagation and internal crossing time, controls the resistance\nto transverse stretching and the increase of the flux rope radial extent; the\nplasma beta controls the overall size of the structure. Turbulent fluctuations\nmainly affect the flux rope transverse structure, spreading its axial field at\ndistances comparable to its size; on the contrary, dynamics along the radial\ndirection remains coherent and the increase in radial size is still\nconsistently observed.

We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference\nconcepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g.,\n\"positive\" and \"negative\"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target\nconcept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For\ninstance, the understanding of \"food\" should not skew toward any particular\nsentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of\nLLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring\nmodel responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort\nand captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based\non the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept\nActivation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract\ninterpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the\nvariation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of\nthe reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong\nagreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r >\n0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect\nusing existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a\npatient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic\nassessments.

    "abstract": "Coastal compound floods (CCFs) are triggered by the interaction of multiple\nmechanisms, such as storm surges, storm rainfall, tides, and river flow. These\nevents can bring significant damage to communities, and there is an increasing\ndemand for accurate and efficient probabilistic analyses of CCFs to support\nrisk assessments and decision-making. In this study, a multi-tiered Bayesian\nnetwork (BN) CCF analysis framework is established. In this framework,\nconceptual designs of multiple tiers of BN models with varying complexities are\ndeveloped for application with varying levels of data availability and\nresources. A case study is conducted in New Orleans, LA, with three tiers of BN\nmodels constructed to demonstrate this framework. In the Tier-1 BN model, storm\nsurges and river flow are incorporated based on hydrodynamic simulations. A\nseasonality node is used to capture the dependence between concurrent river\nflow and tropical cyclone (TC) parameters. In the Tier-2 BN model, joint\ndistribution models of TC parameters are built for separate TC intensity\ncategories. TC-induced rainfall is modeled as input to hydraulic simulations.\nIn the Tier-3 BN model, potential variations of meteorological conditions are\nincorporated by quantifying their effects on TC activity and coastal water\nlevel. Flood antecedent conditions are also incorporated to more completely\nrepresent the conditions contributing to flood severity. In this case study, a\nseries of joint distribution, numerical, machine learning, and experimental\nmodels are used to compute conditional probability tables needed for the BNs. A\nseries of probabilistic analyses is performed based on these BN models,\nincluding CCF hazard curve construction and CCF deaggregation. The results of\nthe analysis demonstrate the promise of this framework in performing CCF hazard\nanalysis under varying levels of resource availability and project needs.",

While\nsafety filters address this challenge in the model-based setting by modifying\nunsafe control inputs, they typically rely on predictive models derived from\nphysics or data. This reliance limits their applicability for advanced\nmodel-free learning control methods. To address this gap, we propose a new\noptimization-based control framework that determines safe control inputs\ndirectly from data. The benefit of the framework is that it can be updated\nthrough arbitrary model-free learning algorithms to pursue optimal performance.\nAs a key component, the concept of direct data-driven safety filters (3DSF) is\nfirst proposed. The framework employs a novel safety certificate, called the\nstate-action control barrier function (SACBF). We present three different\nschemes to learn the SACBF. Furthermore, based on input-to-state safety\nanalysis, we present the error-to-state safety analysis framework, which\nprovides formal guarantees on safety and recursive feasibility even in the\npresence of learning inaccuracies. The proposed control framework bridges the\ngap between model-free learning-based control and constrained control, by\ndecoupling performance optimization from safety enforcement.

To address this challenge, we introduce Advantage Modulation PPO\n(AM-PPO), a novel enhancement of PPO that adaptively modulates advantage\nestimates using a dynamic, non-linear scaling mechanism. This adaptive\nmodulation employs an alpha controller that dynamically adjusts the scaling\nfactor based on evolving statistical properties of the advantage signals, such\nas their norm, variance, and a predefined target saturation level. By\nincorporating a tanh-based gating function driven by these adaptively scaled\nadvantages, AM-PPO reshapes the advantage signals to stabilize gradient updates\nand improve the conditioning of the policy gradient landscape. Crucially, this\nmodulation also influences value function training by providing consistent and\nadaptively conditioned learning targets. Empirical evaluations across standard\ncontinuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AM-PPO achieves superior reward\ntrajectories, exhibits sustained learning progression, and significantly\nreduces the clipping required by adaptive optimizers.

Our construction defines a distinct composition\noperator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each\naxis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific\noperators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that\nenables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first\napproach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical\nsequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and\ntransformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For\nexample, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the\nfamiliar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the\nSSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support\nrecursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several\npotential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured\npositional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and\nsymbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future\ndeep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of\nour framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is\ntheoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to\nfuture work, which we plan to undertake.",

In this work, we\ntake a step further and analyze whether these models can be adapted to target\ndatasets having very different distributions and classes compared to what these\nmodels have been trained on, using only a few labeled examples from the target\ndataset. In such scenarios, finetuning large pretrained models is challenging\ndue to problems of overfitting as well as loss of generalization, and has not\nbeen well explored in prior literature. Since, the pre-training data of such\nmodels are unavailable, it is difficult to comprehend the performance on\nvarious downstream datasets. First, we try to answer the question: Given a\ntarget dataset with a few labelled examples, can we estimate whether further\nfine-tuning can enhance the performance compared to zero-shot evaluation? by\nanalyzing the common vision-language embedding space. Based on the analysis, we\npropose a novel prompt-tuning method, PromptMargin for adapting such\nlarge-scale VLMs directly on the few target samples.

To address\nthis, integrating additional thermal radiation data with RGB images\ndemonstrates enhanced performance and robustness. However, how to effectively\nreconcile the modality discrepancies and fuse the RGB and thermal features\nremains a well-known challenge. In this work, we address this challenge from a\nnovel spectral perspective. We observe that the multi-modal features can be\ncategorized into two spectral components: low-frequency features that provide\nbroad scene context, including color variations and smooth areas, and\nhigh-frequency features that capture modality-specific details such as edges\nand textures. Inspired by this, we propose the Spectral-aware Global Fusion\nNetwork (SGFNet) to effectively enhance and fuse the multi-modal features by\nexplicitly modeling the interactions between the high-frequency,\nmodality-specific features. Our experimental results demonstrate that SGFNet\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MFNet and PST900 datasets.",

A 15-parameter dual\noutput model correcting for spill over contamination and partial volume effects\nwith peak fitting cost functions was developed for simultaneous estimation of\nmodel corrected blood input function (MCIF) and kinetic rate constants for\ndynamic FDG PET images of rat heart in vivo. Major drawbacks of this model are\nits dependence on manual annotations for the Image Derived Input Function\n(IDIF) and manual determination of crucial model parameters to compute MCIF. To\novercome these limitations, we performed semi-automated segmentation and then\nformulated a Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell network to train and predict\nMCIF in test data using a concatenation of IDIFs and myocardial inputs and\ncompared them with reference-modeled MCIF. Thresholding along 2D plane slices\nwith two thresholds, with T1 representing high-intensity myocardium, and T2\nrepresenting lower-intensity rings, was used to segment the area of the LV\nblood pool.

While the collection of such data is\nessential for third-party platforms, it raises significant privacy concerns.\nLocal differential privacy (LDP) has been shown as a framework providing\nprovable individual privacy, even when the third-party platform is untrusted.\nFor numerical data with bounded domains, existing state-of-the-art LDP\nmechanisms are piecewise-based mechanisms, which are not optimal, leading to\nreduced data utility.\n  This paper investigates the optimal design of piecewise-based mechanisms to\nmaximize data utility under LDP. We demonstrate that existing piecewise-based\nmechanisms are heuristic forms of the $3$-piecewise mechanism, which is far\nfrom enough to study optimality. We generalize the $3$-piecewise mechanism to\nits most general form, i.e. $m$-piecewise mechanism with no pre-defined form of\neach piece. Under this form, we derive the closed-form optimal mechanism by\ncombining analytical proofs and off-the-shelf optimization solvers. Next, we\nextend the generalized piecewise-based mechanism to the circular domain (along\nwith the classical domain), defined on a cyclic range where the distance\nbetween the two endpoints is zero. By incorporating this property, we design\nthe optimal mechanism for the circular domain, achieving significantly improved\ndata utility compared with existing mechanisms.\n  Our proposed mechanisms guarantee optimal data utility under LDP among all\ngeneralized piecewise-based mechanisms.

To manage\nthe biological variation and limit normal-tissue damage, LET-modifying\nobjective functions on, e.g., dose-weighted LET or dirty dose and/or usage of\nvariable RBE models were introduced. Because shaping LET by proton irradiation\nalone has its limits, this work proposes to jointly optimize mixed-modality\nproton-photon treatments based on directly LET-modifying objective functions.\nThe investigated objective functions rely on either dose-weighted LET or dirty\ndose concepts. To formulate a consistent combined optimization problem, the\ncontribution of secondary electron LET in photon treatments is considered (and\ndiscussed) as well. Combined dose/LET calculation and optimization are realized\nin the open source toolkit matRad. Phantom plans as well as a patient plans are\noptimized for analysis on the method, combining five proton fractions with 25\nphoton fractions. Dose-optimized combined plans are used as a reference. The\nreference plan shows that protons are, in general, dosimetrically superior and\nthus preferred, with photons aiding in achieving conformity. The introduction\nof LET modified objectives locally modifies the proton contribution in the\ntargeted regions of interest. Especially at the distal edge, the photon\ncontribution increases to move high-LET/dirty dose out of the OARs. Dirty dose\nobjectives seem to allow a more comprehensive steering of the high-LET regions\ncompared to LETxDose. Incorporating LET-based objectives into a jointly\noptimized proton-photon system allows for improved dose conformity and reduced\nhigh-LET exposure in critical regions in proximity to the distal proton edge.\nThis approach enables the utilization of modality-specific strengths and can\ncontribute to safer, more effective treatment plans.",

    "abstract": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common approach to improve the\ndomain-specific question-answering (QA) performance of large language models\n(LLMs). However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between\nLLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla\nSFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we\nfirst design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and\nthen conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge\nconflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute\ndifferently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic\nperformance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data,\nappropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by\nthis, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely\nKaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to\nadapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training\nsamples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT\nbrings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses\nprove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates\nthe hallucination.",

Previous works have often used numerical\nintegrators that alternate between linear drifts and velocity kicks (such as\nthe Leapfrog scheme). This approach contrasts with the sophisticated methods\ndeveloped in planetary dynamics, for which integrators alternate between\nKeplerian drifts and velocity kicks.\n  Aims. Inspired by the splitting methods used in planetary dynamics, we aim to\nbuild an integration scheme dedicated to stellar and galactic dynamics.\n  Methods. We took advantage of the properties of H\\'enon's isochrone potential\nto design a symplectic splitting scheme that can be used to integrate the\nmotion of stars in any gravitational potential. This scheme alternates between\nisochrone drifts and velocity kicks. As a first application, we consider the\nmotion of a star in a Plummer potential -- an essential constituent of galactic\npotentials -- and determine integration parameters that provide the best\nefficiency (i.e. best conservation of energy for lowest computational cost).\n  Results. We derive the analytical solution for all kinds of orbits in\nH\\'enon's isochrone potential (bound and unbound trajectories) as needed in our\nintegration scheme. Our experiments for stars in a Plummer potential show\nexcellent performances in the inner and outer parts of the gravity field, that\nis, where the motion of stars is well approximated by isochrone trajectories\n(with perturbations of order $10^{-3}$ or less). For highly elongated orbits\nthat cross the characteristic length of the Plummer potential, the performance\nis equivalent to that of previous methods.\n  Conclusions. The splitting scheme presented here is a good alternative to\nprevious methods: it performs at least as well, and up to orders of magnitude\nbetter, depending on the dynamical regime of the star.",

Due to high edge density, along with continuous generation and spread\nof messages, brain networks must contend with congestion, which may limit\npolysynaptic message survival in complex ways. Here we study congestion with a\ncolliding-spreading model, a synchronous Markovian process where messages\narriving coincidentally at a node are deleted, while surviving messages spread\nto all nearest neighbors. Numerical simulations on a large sample of mammal\nconnectomes demonstrate that message survival follows a positively skewed\nlognormal-like distribution for all connectomes tested. This distribution\nmirrors empirical distributions of interareal distances and edge weights.\nHowever, the distribution of message survival is an emergent property of system\ndynamics and graph topology alone; it does not require interareal distances or\nedge weights. We then show that message survival is well predicted by log brain\nvolume (r = -0.64) across species. Thus, messages survive longer in small\ncompared to large mammals, in accordance with the notion that larger brains\nbecome more modular. Chimpanzee showed the lowest message survival among the\nanimals tested.

    "abstract": "Large language models have achieved remarkable success in various tasks.\nHowever, it is challenging for them to learn new tasks incrementally due to\ncatastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches rely on experience replay,\noptimization constraints, or task differentiation, which encounter strict\nlimitations in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Joint\nFlashback Adaptation. We first introduce flashbacks -- a limited number of\nprompts from old tasks -- when adapting to new tasks and constrain the\ndeviations of the model outputs compared to the original one. We then\ninterpolate latent tasks between flashbacks and new tasks to enable jointly\nlearning relevant latent tasks, new tasks, and flashbacks, alleviating data\nsparsity in flashbacks and facilitating knowledge sharing for smooth\nadaptation. Our method requires only a limited number of flashbacks without\naccess to the replay data and is task-agnostic. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on state-of-the-art large language models across 1000+\ninstruction-following tasks, arithmetic reasoning tasks, and general reasoning\ntasks. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in\nimproving generalization on new tasks and reducing forgetting in old tasks.",

Here, we\nfocus on rotating Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection, being the canonical model\nsystem to study geophysical and astrophysical flows.

We compare two different\ntechniques for measuring these energy fluxes throughout the domain: one based\non a spatial filtering approach and an adapted Fourier-based method. We show\nhow one can use these methods to measure the energy flux adequately in the\nanisotropic, aperiodic domains encountered in rotating convection, even in\ndomains with spatial confinement. Our measurements reveal that in the studied\nregime, the bulk flow is dominated by the direct cascade, while significant\ninverse cascading action is observed most strongly near the top and bottom\nplates, due to the vortex merging of Ekman plumes into larger flow structures.",

An\nextensive validation between the simulation results in this work and\nmeasurement data from various research groups is carried out in order to\nreliably understand the complicated chemical kinetics defining the reactive\nspecies densities. Atomic oxygen densities in parallel plate radio frequency\ndriven He/O$_2$ micro-scaled atmospheric pressure plasma jets ($\\mu$APPJs) have\nbeen measured in the literature by several research groups with different\nmethods including: two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence (TALIF)\nspectroscopy and optical emission spectroscopy (OES)-based methods. These\nmeasurement data with a variation of the absorbed power, the He gas flow rate\nand the O$_2$ mixture ratio are simulated in this paper with a zero-dimensional\n(0-D) plasma-chemical plug-flow model coupled with a two-term Boltzmann\nequation solver. The simulated atomic oxygen densities agree well with most of\nthe measured ones. Specifically, good agreement is achieved between the\nsimulations and most of the TALIF measurements over a range of operating\nconditions. Our model prediction accuracy relative to these TALIF measurements\nis quantified by the percentage error between the measured and simulated atomic\noxygen densities. An approximate normal distribution is observed in the\nhistogram plot of the percentage error, and the mean is close to zero. The mean\nis shifted positively and negatively in the case of removing a dominant atomic\noxygen gain and loss reaction channel, which implies the underestimation and\noverestimation of the simulation results relative to the measurement data,\nrespectively. This indicates that proper incorporation of the dominant reaction\nchannels in the simulations plays a key role in the model prediction accuracy.",

In this work, we introduce the Reinforcement\nLearning for Personalized Alignment (RLPA) framework, in which an LLM interacts\nwith a simulated user model to iteratively infer and refine user profiles\nthrough dialogue.

Of central\nimportance is the spatial diffusion tensor of cosmic rays, which can be\ncomputed in an ab~initio manner if the turbulence in the background medium is\nknown. The study aimed to establish a suitable framework to compute the\nevolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and, hence, the diffusion\ntensor in the dynamical halos of galaxies. The Reynolds-averaged single-fluid\nMHD equations were solved numerically on a cylindrical grid, assuming axial\nsymmetry and fixed boundary conditions on a central ellipsoid representing the\ngalaxy. The physical properties of both large-scale MHD and small-scale\nturbulent quantities, including the coefficients of parallel and perpendicular\ndiffusion, were extracted from the resulting steady state. Hydrodynamic\nvalidation revealed a persistent instability of the near-axis flow, which could\nbe traced to the galaxy's gravitating mass.

Current approaches often rely on\nheuristic methods or pseudo-label supervised annotations, which are both costly\nand limited in scalability across diverse scenarios.

An iterated amplification strategy is adopted to perform\nalternating cyclic training in the video CoT system, where each component\nundergoes iterative cycles of refinement to improve its capabilities.

Model-based methods struggle with accurate\nmodeling, while model-free approaches falter in efficiently navigating very\nhigh-dimensional and nonlinear control objective landscapes. This article\npresents a novel hybrid model-free/model-based approach to flight control based\non the recently proposed reinforcement twinning algorithm. The model-based (MB)\napproach relies on an adjoint formulation using an adaptive digital twin,\ncontinuously identified from live trajectories, while the model-free (MF)\napproach relies on reinforcement learning. The two agents collaborate through\ntransfer learning, imitation learning, and experience sharing using the real\nenvironment, the digital twin and a referee. The latter selects the best agent\nto interact with the real environment based on performance within the digital\ntwin and a real-to-virtual environment consistency ratio. The algorithm is\nevaluated for controlling the longitudinal dynamics of a flapping-wing drone,\nwith the environment simulated as a nonlinear, time-varying dynamical system\nunder the influence of quasi-steady aerodynamic forces. The hybrid control\nlearning approach is tested with three types of initialization of the adaptive\nmodel: (1) offline identification using previously available data, (2) random\ninitialization with full online identification, and (3) offline pre-training\nwith an estimation bias, followed by online adaptation.

Through\nextensive experiments on DeiT-III and DINOv2 training on ImageNet-1K, we show\nthat octic ViTs yield more computationally efficient networks while also\nimproving performance. In particular, we achieve approximately 40% reduction in\nFLOPs for ViT-H while simultaneously improving both classification and\nsegmentation results.",

    "abstract": "Serendipity has been associated with numerous benefits in the context of\nrecommender systems, e.g., increased user satisfaction and consumption of\nlong-tail items. Despite this, serendipity in the context of recommender\nsystems has thus far remained conceptually ambiguous. This conceptual ambiguity\nhas led to inconsistent operationalizations between studies, making it\ndifficult to compare and synthesize findings. In this paper, we conceptualize\nthe user's experience of serendipity. To this effect, we interviewed 17\nparticipants and analyzed the data following the grounded theory paradigm.\nBased on these interviews, we conceptualize experienced serendipity as \"a user\nexperience in which a user unintentionally encounters content that feels\nfortuitous, refreshing, and enriching\". We find that all three components --\nfortuitous, refreshing and enriching -- are necessary and together are\nsufficient to classify a user's experience as serendipitous. However, these\ncomponents can be satisfied through a variety of conditions. Our\nconceptualization unifies previous definitions of serendipity within a single\nframework, resolving inconsistencies by identifying distinct flavors of\nserendipity. It highlights underexposed flavors, offering new insights into how\nusers experience serendipity in the context of recommender systems. By\nclarifying the components and conditions of experienced serendipity in\nrecommender systems, this work can guide the design of recommender systems that\nstimulate experienced serendipity in their users, and lays the groundwork for\ndeveloping a standardized operationalization of experienced serendipity in its\nmany flavors, enabling more consistent and comparable evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Generating hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB images through spectral\nreconstruction can significantly reduce the cost of HSI acquisition. In this\npaper, we propose a Fractal-Based Recursive Spectral Reconstruction Network\n(FRN), which differs from existing paradigms that attempt to directly integrate\nthe full-spectrum information from the R, G, and B channels in a one-shot\nmanner. Instead, it treats spectral reconstruction as a progressive process,\npredicting from broad to narrow bands or employing a coarse-to-fine approach\nfor predicting the next wavelength. Inspired by fractals in mathematics, FRN\nestablishes a novel spectral reconstruction paradigm by recursively invoking an\natomic reconstruction module. In each invocation, only the spectral information\nfrom neighboring bands is used to provide clues for the generation of the image\nat the next wavelength, which follows the low-rank property of spectral data.\nMoreover, we design a band-aware state space model that employs a\npixel-differentiated scanning strategy at different stages of the generation\nprocess, further suppressing interference from low-correlation regions caused\nby reflectance differences. Through extensive experimentation across different\ndatasets, FRN achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting offers a promising approach for drone\nidentification and security, although it suffers from significant performance\ndegradation when operating on different transmission channels. This paper\npresents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the\nproblem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)\nidentification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different\nRF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that\nmaintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We\nvalidate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world\nover-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several\nfrequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world\nscenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to\n99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only\n26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in\nmore difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels\n1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller\nclassification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce\nperformance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high\nidentification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it\nparticularly suitable for practical drone security applications.",

    "abstract": "Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to map sign language videos to spoken\nlanguage text. A common approach relies on gloss annotations as an intermediate\nrepresentation, decomposing SLT into two sub-tasks: video-to-gloss recognition\nand gloss-to-text translation. While effective, this paradigm depends on\nexpert-annotated gloss labels, which are costly and rarely available in\nexisting datasets, limiting its scalability. To address this challenge, we\npropose a gloss-free pseudo gloss generation framework that eliminates the need\nfor human-annotated glosses while preserving the structured intermediate\nrepresentation. Specifically, we prompt a Large Language Model (LLM) with a few\nexample text-gloss pairs using in-context learning to produce draft sign\nglosses from spoken language text. To enhance the correspondence between\nLLM-generated pseudo glosses and the sign sequences in video, we correct the\nordering in the pseudo glosses for better alignment via a weakly supervised\nlearning process. This reordering facilitates the incorporation of auxiliary\nalignment objectives, and allows for the use of efficient supervision via a\nConnectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss. We train our SLT mode, which\nconsists of a vision encoder and a translator, through a three-stage pipeline,\nwhich progressively narrows the modality gap between sign language and spoken\nlanguage. Despite its simplicity, our approach outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art gloss-free frameworks on two SLT benchmarks and achieves\ncompetitive results compared to gloss-based methods.",

To enable this CoF\ncapability, we present a two-stage training pipeline, including supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we\nconstruct the MM-CoF dataset, comprising 3K samples derived from a visual agent\ndesigned to adaptively identify key regions to solve visual tasks with\ndifferent image resolutions and questions. We use MM-CoF to fine-tune the\nQwen2.5-VL model for cold start. In the RL stage, we leverage the outcome\naccuracies and formats as rewards to update the Qwen2.5-VL model, enabling\nfurther refining the search and reasoning strategy of models without human\npriors. Our model achieves significant improvements on multiple benchmarks. On\nthe V* benchmark that requires strong visual reasoning capability, our model\noutperforms existing VLMs by 5% among 8 image resolutions ranging from 224 to\n4K, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed CoF method and facilitating\nthe more efficient deployment of VLMs in practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning about temporal causality, particularly irreversible transformations\nof objects governed by real-world knowledge (e.g., fruit decay and human\naging), is a fundamental aspect of human visual understanding. Unlike temporal\nperception based on simple event sequences, this form of reasoning requires a\ndeeper comprehension of how object states change over time. Although the\ncurrent powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive\nperformance on a wide range of downstream tasks, their capacity to reason about\ntemporal causality remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce\n\\textbf{TimeCausality}, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the\ncausal reasoning ability of VLMs in the temporal dimension. Based on our\nTimeCausality, we find that while the current SOTA open-source VLMs have\nachieved performance levels comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4o on\nvarious standard visual question answering tasks, they fall significantly\nbehind on our benchmark compared with their closed-source competitors.\nFurthermore, even GPT-4o exhibits a marked drop in performance on TimeCausality\ncompared to its results on other tasks. These findings underscore the critical\nneed to incorporate temporal causality into the evaluation and development of\nVLMs, and they highlight an important challenge for the open-source VLM\ncommunity moving forward.

Hunyuan-TurboS features an\nadaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching\nbetween rapid responses for simple queries and deep \"thinking\" modes for\ncomplex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B\nactivated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention,\nFFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear\ncomplexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE\nstructure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context\nlength and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our\ncomprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised\nFine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method,\nMulti-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage\nLarge-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general\ninstruction-following.

Unlike the Neural Network,\nthe SVM solutions are typically more stable, sparse, optimal and interpretable.\nHowever, there are only few literature which addresses the UQ in SVM\nprediction. At first, we provide a comprehensive summary of existing Prediction\nInterval (PI) estimation and probabilistic forecasting methods developed in the\nSVM framework and evaluate them against the key properties expected from an\nideal PI model. We find that none of the existing SVM PI models achieves a\nsparse solution. To introduce sparsity in SVM model, we propose the Sparse\nSupport Vector Quantile Regression (SSVQR) model, which constructs PIs and\nprobabilistic forecasts by solving a pair of linear programs. Further, we\ndevelop a feature selection algorithm for PI estimation using SSVQR that\neffectively eliminates a significant number of features while improving PI\nquality in case of high-dimensional dataset. Finally we extend the SVM models\nin Conformal Regression setting for obtaining more stable prediction set with\nfinite test set guarantees. Extensive experiments on artificial, real-world\nbenchmark datasets compare the different characteristics of both existing and\nproposed SVM-based PI estimation methods and also highlight the advantages of\nthe feature selection in PI estimation.

However, concerns have also arisen\nregarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and\nexhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world\napplications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on\nemploying security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or\nalternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive\nconcepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory\nperformance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal\nmodel output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content\nin some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to\nidentifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text\nembedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting\nindividual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt\ntowards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model\nrobustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the\nimpact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method\ncan also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social\nresponsibility.

While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can make these models\nmore efficient, they often require costly retraining or even training from\nscratch. Recent developments aim to reduce these computational costs by\nleveraging pretrained networks. These have been shown to produce sparse\nactivation patterns in the Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) of the encoder\nblocks, allowing for conditional activation of only relevant subnetworks for\neach sample. Building on this idea, we propose a new method to construct MoE\nvariants from pretrained models. Our approach extracts expert subnetworks from\nthe model's MLP layers post-training in two phases. First, we cluster output\nactivations to identify distinct activation patterns. In the second phase, we\nuse these clusters to extract the corresponding subnetworks responsible for\nproducing them.

Traditionally, image sensors and LiDAR\nhave played this role. However, a new type of vision sensor, event cameras, has\nrecently attracted attention. Event cameras respond to changes in the\nsurrounding environment (e.g., motion), exhibit strong robustness against\nmotion blur, and perform well in high dynamic range environments, which are\ndesirable in robotics applications. Furthermore, the asynchronous and\nlow-latency principles of data acquisition make event cameras suitable for\noptical communication.

Additionally, receiving information\nsuch as signal timing and traffic volume enables speed adjustment and optimal\nroute selection, facilitating more efficient driving. In this study, we\nconstruct a vehicle visible light communication system where event cameras are\nreceivers, and multiple LEDs are transmitters. In driving scenes, the system\ntracks the transmitter positions and separates densely packed LED light sources\nusing pilot sequences based on Walsh-Hadamard codes.

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success on\nreasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, their\nenhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety\nperformance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important\nresearch question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs\nthrough Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an\nunexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1\nfails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify\nthree key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that\nexplicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can\nlead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and\ncomplex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we\nfind that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain\ncomparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn\nthan more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection\non the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math\nreasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and\nover-refusal. Overall, we hope our empirical study could provide a more\nholistic picture on enhancing the safety of LRMs. The code and data used in our\nexperiments are released in https://github.com/thu-coai/LRM-Safety-Study.",

Combining refined\nevaluation metrics, we benchmark current widely used LLMs. Our findings show\nthat LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not\neliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some\nmitigation. This recontextualization via cognitive psychology urges that LLM\nevaluations focus not on standard benchmarks or over-optimized robustness\ntests, but on cognitive-bias-aware trustworthy evaluation.",

While previous works improved the\ncapability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack\nthe ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e.,\nwhich part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the\nprompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where\nattention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level\nsemantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language\ngeneration, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for\nsampled generations.

Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive\ndetection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average\nAUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty\nscores as explanations for the hallucination.

However, existing methods fail to provide complete, faithful, and\nexpressive control over human avatars due to their entangled representation of\nfacial expressions and body movements. In this work, we introduce Expressive\nVirtual Avatars (EVA), an actor-specific, fully controllable, and expressive\nhuman avatar framework that achieves high-fidelity, lifelike renderings in real\ntime while enabling independent control of facial expressions, body movements,\nand hand gestures. Specifically, our approach designs the human avatar as a\ntwo-layer model: an expressive template geometry layer and a 3D Gaussian\nappearance layer. First, we present an expressive template tracking algorithm\nthat leverages coarse-to-fine optimization to accurately recover body motions,\nfacial expressions, and non-rigid deformation parameters from multi-view\nvideos. Next, we propose a novel decoupled 3D Gaussian appearance model\ndesigned to effectively disentangle body and facial appearance. Unlike unified\nGaussian estimation approaches, our method employs two specialized and\nindependent modules to model the body and face separately. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that EVA surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of rendering\nquality and expressiveness, validating its effectiveness in creating full-body\navatars.

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with discrete variables and finite\nsearch space are critical across numerous fields, and solving them in\nmetaheuristic algorithms is popular. However, addressing a specific COP\ntypically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor\nadjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm\nredevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs\ninto a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is\nvaluable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to\nperform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a\nresource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the\nfirst time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP.\nSubsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified\nas assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and\nconstraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the\nmodeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified\nsolution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure,\ndestruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the\ndevelopment of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4\nsingle-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured\nherein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading,\nassignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model\nthese COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the\ndesigned metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than\nGUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and\noutperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.",

    "abstract": "In today's digital era, internet plays a pervasive role in our lives,\ninfluencing everyday activities such as communication, work, and leisure. This\nonline engagement intertwines with offline experiences, shaping individuals'\noverall well-being. Despite its significance, existing research often falls\nshort in capturing the relationship between internet use and well-being,\nrelying primarily on isolated studies and self-reported data. One of the major\ncontributors to deteriorated well-being - both physical and mental - is stress.\nWhile some research has examined the relationship between internet use and\nstress, both positive and negative associations have been reported. Our primary\ngoal in this work is to identify the associations between an individual's\ninternet use and their stress. For achieving our goal, we conducted a\nlongitudinal multimodal study that spanned seven months. We combined\nfine-grained URL-level web browsing traces of 1490 German internet users with\ntheir sociodemographics and monthly measures of stress. Further, we developed a\nconceptual framework that allows us to simultaneously explore different\ncontextual dimensions, including how, where, when, and by whom the internet is\nused. Our analysis revealed several associations between internet use and\nstress that vary by context. Social media, entertainment, online shopping, and\ngaming were positively associated with stress, while productivity, news, and\nadult content use were negatively associated. In the future, the behavioral\nmarkers we identified can pave the way for designing individualized tools for\npeople to self-monitor and self-moderate their online behaviors to enhance\ntheir well-being, reducing the burden on already overburdened mental health\nservices.",

    "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems have become integral to smart\nmanufacturing, yet their growing connectivity has also exposed them to\nsignificant cybersecurity threats. Traditional intrusion detection systems\n(IDS) often rely on centralized architectures that raise concerns over data\nprivacy, latency, and single points of failure. In this work, we propose a\nnovel Federated Learning-Enhanced Blockchain Framework (FL-BCID) for\nprivacy-preserving intrusion detection tailored for IIoT environments. Our\narchitecture combines federated learning (FL) to ensure decentralized model\ntraining with blockchain technology to guarantee data integrity, trust, and\ntamper resistance across IIoT nodes. We design a lightweight intrusion\ndetection model collaboratively trained using FL across edge devices without\nexposing sensitive data. A smart contract-enabled blockchain system records\nmodel updates and anomaly scores to establish accountability. Experimental\nevaluations using the ToN-IoT and N-BaIoT datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our framework, achieving 97.3% accuracy while reducing\ncommunication overhead by 41% compared to baseline centralized methods. Our\napproach ensures privacy, scalability, and robustness-critical for secure\nindustrial operations. The proposed FL-BCID system provides a promising\nsolution for enhancing trust and privacy in modern IIoT security architectures.",

    "abstract": "Power systems are getting more complex than ever and are consequently\noperating close to their limit of stability. Moreover, with the increasing\ndemand of renewable wind generation, and the requirement to maintain a secure\npower system, the importance of transient stability cannot be overestimated.\nCurrent deterministic industry practices of transient stability assessment\nignore the probability of variables involved. With increasing system\nuncertainties and widespread electricity market deregulation, there is a strong\ninevitability to incorporate probabilistic transient stability analysis.\nCircuit breakers play a critical role in fault clearing and consequently in\ndetermining the system transient stability. It is important that they undergo\ntimely and appropriate maintenance procedures based on some criterion.\nConsidering the need of incorporating risk in modern power systems, this paper\nproposes a risk-based probabilistic transient stability approach for ranking of\ncircuit breakers in a power system. A novel priority index was proposed to rank\nthe circuit breakers based on the system transient stability risk. DIgSILENT\nPowerFactory software was used to conduct the required simulations on IEEE 14\nbus system. The proposed risk-based framework was deemed to be efficient in\nidentification of the circuit breakers based on their priority rank index which\ncan aid in power system planning process.",

This classical problem asks how\nlarge a set in general position has to be to ensure the existence of $n$ points\nthat are the vertices of a convex $n$-gon. Moreover, Erd\\H{o}s further extended\nthis problem by asking what happens if we also require that this $n$-gon has an\nempty interior. In a 2-player Maker-Breaker setting, this problem inspires two\nmain games. In both games, Maker tries to obtain an empty convex $k$-gon, while\nBreaker tries to prevent her from doing so. The games differ only in which\npoints can comprise the winning $k$-gons: in the monochromatic version the\npoints of both players can make up a $k$-gon, while in the bichromatic version\nonly Maker's points contribute to such a polygon. Both settings are studied in\nthis paper. We show that in the monochromatic game, Maker always wins. Even in\na biased game where Breaker is allowed to place $s$ points per round, for any\nconstant $s \\geq 1$, Maker has a winning strategy. In the bichromatic setting,\nMaker still wins whenever Breaker is allowed to place $s$ points per round for\nany constant $s<2$. This settles an open problem posed by Aichholzer et al.\n(2019). Furthermore, we show that there are games that are not a lost cause for\nBreaker. Whenever $k\\ge 8$ and Breaker is allowed to play 12 or more points per\nround, she has a winning strategy. We also consider the one-round bichromatic\ngame (a.k.a.\\ the offline version).

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes\nsettings, their ability to refuse ethically sensitive prompts-such as those\ninvolving hate speech or illegal activities-has become central to content\nmoderation and responsible AI practices. While refusal responses can be viewed\nas evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research\nsuggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated\nassessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and\ntraining. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used\nto evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking\nand fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess\nrefusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot\nArena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how\ndifferent types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which\nexplicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., \"I can't help with that\nbecause it may be harmful\"), and technical refusals, which reflect system\nlimitations (e.g., \"I can't answer because I lack real-time data\"). We find\nthat LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more\nfavorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.\nWe refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for\nmodel-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.\nThis raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the\nnormative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.",

This\neffectively extracts multi-scale temporal patterns within EEG signals and\ncaptures long-short range spatiotemporal dependencies simultaneously. To\nfurther improve the performance of AAD, STC utilizes temporal and spatial\nconvolutions to aggregate expressive spatiotemporal representations.\nExperimental results show that the proposed MHANet achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with fewer trainable parameters across three datasets, 3 times\nlower than that of the most advanced model.

In this paper, we explore\nvarious LVLMs to identify the specific heads responsible for recognizing text\nfrom images, which we term the Optical Character Recognition Head (OCR Head).\nOur findings regarding these heads are as follows: (1) Less Sparse: Unlike\nprevious retrieval heads, a large number of heads are activated to extract\ntextual information from images. (2) Qualitatively Distinct: OCR heads possess\nproperties that differ significantly from general retrieval heads, exhibiting\nlow similarity in their characteristics. (3) Statically Activated: The\nfrequency of activation for these heads closely aligns with their OCR scores.\nWe validate our findings in downstream tasks by applying Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nto both OCR and conventional retrieval heads and by masking these heads. We\nalso demonstrate that redistributing sink-token values within the OCR heads\nimproves performance.

Likewise, high-gain, low-noise amplifiers with low polarization\ndependence are critical components of long-range optical communication systems.\nIntegrated photonic solutions show great potential in challenging application\nfields thanks to their drastic reduction in size, weight and cost, but this\ncomes at the expense of low optical power due to reduced energy storage\ncapacity in small devices. Recently, the large mode area (LMA) technology,\nwhich is well known for dramatically increasing the output power of fiber\namplifiers by orders of magnitude, has been brought to the chip-level. With a\nlarge optical mode in the gain medium, the energy storage capacity and\nsaturation power are increased significantly, allowing for high-power\namplification with watt-level output power directly from the chip. In this work\nwe demonstrate that a single integrated LMA amplifier is capable of both\nhigh-power amplification up to 800 mW with output saturation powers > 115 mW as\nwell as high small-signal net gain up to 30 dB and low-noise amplification with\nnoise figures < 4 dB. The LMA design further allows for a tuning of the\npolarization dependent gain (PDG) by adjusting the pump power and pump\npolarization, making it possible to completely nullify the\npolarization-sensitivity for any given signal power from the {\\mu}W to\nmW-level. The power and noise performance achieved surpasses the performance\nlevel of many integrated amplifiers and fiber-based amplifiers.

The precision and accuracy of those measurements can be degraded by\nrun-to-run instrumental variations, which introduce systematic errors in the\nholographic characterization measurements. We detect and mitigate these errors\nby introducing a class of inert reference beads whose polymer brush coating\nresists macromolecular binding. The holographically measured diameter and\nrefractive index of those beads serve as internal standards for THC\nmeasurements. To characterize the reference beads, we introduce a general\nall-optical method to measure the grafting density of the polymer brush that\ncombines holographic characterization of the bead diameter with a refractometry\nmeasurement of the polymer's specific volume. The latter technique shows the\nspecific volume of poly(ethylene oxide) to be 1.308(4) cubic nanometers per\nkilodalton. We use this suite of techniques to demonstrate a multiplexed\nimmunoassay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) whose success validates the\neffective-medium analysis of holographic characterization measurements.\nInternal negative controls provided by the reference beads are validated by\nnegative control measurements on alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which has a\nsimilar molecular weight to IgG but does not bind to the probe beads' binding\nsites.",

To bridge\nthis gap, we propose RRTL, a red teaming approach specifically designed to\nevaluate RLLMs in tool learning.

Our approach also\nincludes a benchmark for traditional LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation on seven mainstream RLLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) RLLMs\ngenerally achieve stronger safety performance than traditional LLMs, yet\nsubstantial safety disparities persist across models; (2) RLLMs can pose\nserious deceptive risks by frequently failing to disclose tool usage and to\nwarn users of potential tool output risks; (3) CoT prompting reveals\nmulti-lingual safety vulnerabilities in RLLMs. Our work provides important\ninsights into enhancing the security of RLLMs in tool learning.",

The goal is to determine whether the\nvalue of a given policy exceeds a specified threshold while minimizing the\nnumber of observations. We begin by deriving an instance-specific lower bound\nthat any algorithm must satisfy. This lower bound is characterized as the\nsolution to an optimization problem with non-convex constraints. We propose a\npolicy testing algorithm inspired by this optimization problem--a common\napproach in pure exploration problems such as best-arm identification, where\nasymptotically optimal algorithms often stem from such optimization-based\ncharacterizations. As for other pure exploration tasks in MDPs, however, the\nnon-convex constraints in the lower-bound problem present significant\nchallenges, raising doubts about whether statistically optimal and\ncomputationally tractable algorithms can be designed. To address this, we\nreformulate the lower-bound problem by interchanging the roles of the objective\nand the constraints, yielding an alternative problem with a non-convex\nobjective but convex constraints. Strikingly, this reformulated problem admits\nan interpretation as a policy optimization task in a newly constructed reversed\nMDP. Leveraging recent advances in policy gradient methods, we efficiently\nsolve this problem and use it to design a policy testing algorithm that is\nstatistically optimal--matching the instance-specific lower bound on sample\ncomplexity--while remaining computationally tractable.

    "abstract": "The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has\ndriven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass\nthese detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these\ntexts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require\nsubstantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser,\nand their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection\nalgorithms. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Co}ntrastive\n\\textbf{P}araphrase \\textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that\neffectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is\nto carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like\ntexts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can\nstill result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes\nthat can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an\nauxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like\ndistribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns\nfrom the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to\nproduce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical\nanalysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various\nscenarios.",

However, most RS foundation models are designed for\nmultispectral data, while hyperspectral imagery (HSI) - with its hundreds of\nspectral bands - remains less explored. Fine-tuning such models for downstream\ntasks is also challenging, often demanding considerable memory and storage. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient framework to fine-tune SpectralGPT, a\nmultispectral foundation model, for hyperspectral image classification (HSIC).\nWe explore several Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, including\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kronecker-based adaptation (KronA), Low-Rank\nKronecker (LoKr), and the recent LoRA+, which uses distinct learning rates for\nlow-rank adapters scaled by a factor lambda. Inspired by LoRA+, we introduce\nKronA+, which applies a similar mechanism to the Kronecker matrices. We\nevaluate our approach on five datasets from different sensors, showing\ncompetitive performance with state-of-the-art HSI models. Our full fine-tuning\n(FFT) setup for SpectralGPT even outperforms a dedicated hyperspectral\nfoundation model on some datasets while requiring only a quarter of the\ntraining epochs. Under the same number of epochs, KronA+ reaches similar\nperformance with far fewer trainable parameters - just 0.056 percent - and adds\nonly approximately 0.2 megabytes of storage, making it the most effective PEFT\nmethod tested.",

The partial conjunction\n(PC) p-value, which combines individual base p-values from multiple similar\nstudies, can gauge whether a feature of interest exhibits replicated signals\nacross studies. However, when a large set of features are examined as in\nhigh-throughput experiments, testing for their replicated signals\nsimultaneously can pose a very underpowered problem, due to both the\nmultiplicity burden and inherent limitations of PC $p$-values. This power\ndeficiency is markedly severe when replication is demanded for all studies\nunder consideration, which is nonetheless the most natural and appealing\nbenchmark for scientific generalizability a practitioner may request.\n  We propose ParFilter, a general framework that marries the ideas of filtering\nand covariate-adaptiveness to power up large-scale testing for replicated\nsignals as described above. It reduces the multiplicity burden by partitioning\nstudies into smaller groups and borrowing the cross-group information to filter\nout unpromising features.

Mainstream self-attention methods,\nwhile effective at modeling global pair-wise relations, fail to capture\nhigh-order associations inherent in real-world scenes and often suffer from\nredundant computation. Hypergraphs extend conventional graphs by modeling\nhigh-order interactions and offer a promising framework for addressing these\nlimitations. However, existing hypergraph neural networks typically rely on\nstatic and hard hyperedge assignments, leading to excessive and redundant\nhyperedges with hard binary vertex memberships that overlook the continuity of\nvisual semantics. To overcome these issues, we present Soft Hypergraph Neural\nNetworks (SoftHGNNs), which extend the methodology of hypergraph computation,\nto make it truly efficient and versatile in visual recognition tasks. Our\nframework introduces the concept of soft hyperedges, where each vertex is\nassociated with hyperedges via continuous participation weights rather than\nhard binary assignments. This dynamic and differentiable association is\nachieved by using the learnable hyperedge prototype. Through similarity\nmeasurements between token features and the prototype, the model generates\nsemantically rich soft hyperedges. SoftHGNN then aggregates messages over soft\nhyperedges to capture high-order semantics. To further enhance efficiency when\nscaling up the number of soft hyperedges, we incorporate a sparse hyperedge\nselection mechanism that activates only the top-k important hyperedges, along\nwith a load-balancing regularizer to ensure balanced hyperedge utilization.\nExperimental results across three tasks on five datasets demonstrate that\nSoftHGNN efficiently captures high-order associations in visual scenes,\nachieving significant performance improvements.",

    "abstract": "The Forest Augmentation Problem (FAP) asks for a minimum set of additional\nedges (links) that make a given forest 2-edge-connected while spanning all\nvertices. A key special case is the Path Augmentation Problem (PAP), where the\ninput forest consists of vertex-disjoint paths. Grandoni, Jabal Ameli, and\nTraub [STOC'22] recently broke the long-standing 2-approximation barrier for\nFAP, achieving a 1.9973-approximation. A crucial component of this result was\ntheir 1.9913-approximation for PAP; the first better-than-2 approximation for\nPAP. In this work, we improve these results and provide a 1.9412-approximation\nfor PAP, which implies a 1.9955-approximation for FAP. One of our key\ninnovations is a $(\\frac{7}{4} + \\varepsilon)$-approximation preserving\nreduction to so-called structured instances, which simplifies the problem and\nenables our improved approximation. Additionally, we introduce a new relaxation\ninspired by 2-edge covers and analyze it via a corresponding packing problem,\nwhere the relationship between the two problems is similar to the relationship\nbetween 2-edge covers and 2-matchings. Using a factor-revealing LP, we bound\nthe cost of our solution to the packing problem w.r.t. the relaxation and\nderive a strong initial solution. We then transform this solution into a\nfeasible PAP solution, combining techniques from FAP and related connectivity\naugmentation problems, along with new insights. A key aspect of our approach is\nleveraging the properties of structured PAP instances to achieve our final\napproximation guarantee. Our reduction framework and relaxation may be of\nindependent interest in future work on connectivity augmentation problems.",

Here we report the first observation of superconductivity in a\nbulk medium-entropy nitride (MEN), TiNbTaN3, which shows a Tc of 10 K at\nambient pressure. Notably, the electronic specific heat coefficient {\\gamma}(H)\nexhibits nonlinear H-dependence behavior, which is similar to other\nwell-studied multigap superconductors. Furthermore, TiNbTaN3 exhibits\nextraordinary pressure resilience, maintaining robust superconductivity under\nhigh-pressure conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate\nthat pressure exerts a negligible impact on the electronic structures of\nTiNbTaN3, thereby corroborating the experimental observations. These findings\nnot only advance our understanding of emergent phenomena in entropy-stabilized\nnitrides but also establish a new material platform for finding more high-Tc\nsuperconductors with combinations of 4d/5d transition metal elements and light\nelements, motivating further investigations into high-entropy functional\nceramics for extreme environment applications.",

However, this classical formulation does\nnot account for thermal emission arising from internal heat sources, which is\ncritical in a variety of astrophysical contexts such as hot Jupiters, brown\ndwarfs, and irradiated exoplanets, where the re-radiation of absorbed stellar\nenergy significantly alters the emergent intensity. To address this limitation,\nwe extend the diffuse reflection framework to incorporate both isotropic\nscattering and intrinsic thermal emission, leading to a generalized function\nknown as the $M(\\mu)$-function. Building on the formalism of Chandrashekhar\n(1960) combined with the recent work by Sengupta(2021), we derive the governing\nintegral equations for the $M$-function and express it in terms of three key\nphysical parameters: the radiation direction cosine $\\mu$, the thermal emission\ncoefficient $U(T) = B(T)/F$, and the single scattering albedo\n$\\tilde{\\omega}_0$. We implement a numerically stable iterative scheme, using\nGaussian quadrature method to compute high-precision values of $M(\\mu, U,\n\\tilde{\\omega}_0)$ across a broad parameter space. In the zero-emission limit,\nour results recover the classical $H$-function, thus validating the method.We\nprovide comprehensive values of $M$-function for $\\mu \\in [0, 1]$, $U < 0.7$,\nand $\\tilde{\\omega}_0 < 1$, enabling direct application to modeling diffusely\nreflected intensities from thermally emitting atmospheres.As a case study, we\napply this formalism to exoplanet K2-137b and identify the wavelength range\n(0.85 -2.5 $\\mu$m) where the model is most applicable, highlighting its\nrelevance to the observation range of the telescopes JWST, HST, ARIEL.",

    "abstract": "Crystal structures are defined by the periodic arrangement of atoms in 3D\nspace, inherently making them equivariant to SO(3) group. A fundamental\nrequirement for crystal property prediction is that the model's output should\nremain invariant to arbitrary rotational transformations of the input\nstructure. One promising strategy to achieve this invariance is to align the\ngiven crystal structure into a canonical orientation with appropriately\ncomputed rotations, or called frames. However, existing work either only\nconsiders a global frame or solely relies on more advanced local frames based\non atoms' local structure. A global frame is too coarse to capture the local\nstructure heterogeneity of the crystal, while local frames may inadvertently\ndisrupt crystal symmetry, limiting their expressivity. In this work, we revisit\nthe frame design problem for crystalline materials and propose a novel approach\nto construct expressive Symmetry-Preserving Frames, dubbed as SPFrame, for\nmodeling crystal structures. Specifically, this local-global associative frame\nconstructs invariant local frames rather than equivariant ones, thereby\npreserving the symmetry of the crystal. In parallel, it integrates global\nstructural information to construct an equivariant global frame to enforce\nSO(3) invariance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPFrame\nconsistently outperforms traditional frame construction techniques and existing\ncrystal property prediction baselines across multiple benchmark tasks.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of super-resolution (SR) in various fields,\nresearchers have begun to investigate its security. Previous studies have\ndemonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through\ndata poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an\nattacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a\nnormal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor\nattacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned\nlow-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR\nimages, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this\nproblem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR\nimages. The key idea of BadSR is to approximate the clean HR image and the\npre-defined target image in the feature space while ensuring that modifications\nto the clean HR image remain within a constrained range. The poisoned HR images\ngenerated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers. To further improve\nthe effectiveness of BadSR, we design an adversarially optimized trigger and a\nbackdoor gradient-driven poisoned sample selection method based on a genetic\nalgorithm. The experimental results show that BadSR achieves a high attack\nsuccess rate in various models and data sets, significantly affecting\ndownstream tasks.",

Despite wide success of RL, training effective\nagents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful\ntuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random\nseed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance.\nModel ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents\ninto a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However,\nexisting ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are\ndesigned as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific\ntasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we\npropose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with\ntask-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs).\nGiven a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into\ndistinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task\nconditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each\nindividual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the\ninference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and\nswitches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring\ndynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is\ndesigned to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds,\nhyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on\nthe Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model\nensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a novel agent-based approach for modelling the\ntransaction cost of buying or selling an asset in financial markets, e.g., to\nliquidate a large position as a result of a margin call to meet financial\nobligations. The simple act of buying or selling in the market causes a price\nimpact and there is a cost described as liquidity risk. For example, when\nselling a large order, there is market slippage -- each successive trade will\nexecute at the same or worse price. When the market adjusts to the new\ninformation revealed by the execution of such a large order, we observe in the\ndata a permanent price impact that can be attributed to the change in the\nfundamental value as market participants reassess the value of the asset. In\nour ABM model, we introduce a novel mechanism where traders assume orderflow is\ninformed and each trade reveals some information about the value of the asset,\nand traders update their belief of the fundamental value for every trade. The\nresult is emergent, realistic price impact without oversimplifying the problem\nas most stylised models do, but within a realistic framework that models the\nexchange with its protocols, its limit orderbook and its auction mechanism and\nthat can calculate the transaction cost of any execution strategy without\nlimitation. Our stochastic ABM model calculates the costs and uncertainties of\nbuying and selling in a market by running Monte-Carlo simulations, for a better\nunderstanding of liquidity risk and can be used to optimise for optimal\nexecution under liquidity risk. We demonstrate its practical application in the\nreal world by calculating the liquidity risk for the Hang-Seng Futures Index.",

Subsequently, several shallow multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) predict\nthe attributes of each Gaussians, including color, opacity, and covariance. To\nmitigate the adverse effects of transient objects on the reconstruction\nprocess, we ffne-tune a lightweight human detection network. Once ffne-tuned,\nthis network generates a visibility map that efffciently generalizes to other\ntransient objects (such as posters, banners, and cars) with minimal need for\nfurther adaptation. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by sky\nregions in outdoor scenes, we propose an effective sky-handling technique that\nincorporates a depth prior as a constraint. This allows the inffnitely distant\nsky to be represented on the surface of a large-radius sky sphere,\nsigniffcantly reducing ffoaters caused by errors in sky reconstruction.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel relocalization method that remains robust to\nchanges in lighting conditions while estimating the camera pose of a given\nimage within the reconstructed 3DGS scene. As a result, R3GS significantly\nenhances rendering ffdelity, improves both training and rendering efffciency,\nand reduces storage requirements.

Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such\nstochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the\nvariance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time\nlearning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate\ntask-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy\nexploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the\nagent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the\nagent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability\ndistribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability\ndistribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the\nparticular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our\ndesign is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL\nalgorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants\ndeveloped based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy\nexploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%.

In this work, such\ndisparities are exploited through a fresh perspective of non-linear feature\nsubspace. That is, a discriminative non-linear subspace is learned from InD\nfeatures to capture representative patterns of InD, while informative patterns\nof OoD features cannot be well captured in such a subspace due to their\ndifferent distribution. Grounded on this perspective, we exploit the deviations\nof InD and OoD features in such a non-linear subspace for effective OoD\ndetection. To be specific, we leverage the framework of Kernel Principal\nComponent Analysis (KPCA) to attain the discriminative non-linear subspace and\ndeploy the reconstruction error on such subspace to distinguish InD and OoD\ndata. Two challenges emerge: (i) the learning of an effective non-linear\nsubspace, i.e., the selection of kernel function in KPCA, and (ii) the\ncomputation of the kernel matrix with large-scale InD data. For the former, we\nreveal two vital non-linear patterns that closely relate to the InD-OoD\ndisparity, leading to the establishment of a Cosine-Gaussian kernel for\nconstructing the subspace. For the latter, we introduce two techniques to\napproximate the Cosine-Gaussian kernel with significantly cheap computations.\nIn particular, our approximation is further tailored by incorporating the InD\ndata confidence, which is demonstrated to promote the learning of\ndiscriminative subspaces for OoD data.

    "abstract": "Oversteer, wherein a vehicle's rear tires lose traction and induce\nunintentional excessive yaw, poses critical safety challenges. Failing to\ncontrol oversteer often leads to severe traffic accidents. Although recent\nautonomous driving efforts have attempted to handle oversteer through\nstabilizing maneuvers, the majority rely on expert-defined trajectories or\nassume obstacle-free environments, limiting real-world applicability. This\npaper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that\ntackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E\ntechniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and\nHybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or\nextensive experience. Yet even skilled human drivers struggle to provide\nperfect demonstrations under oversteer, and high transition variance hinders\naccumulating sufficient data. Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic\n(QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal\ndemonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we\nintroduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle\nencounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly\nplaced obstacles ahead. Experimental results show QC-SAC attains near-optimal\ndriving policies, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art IL, RL, and HL\nbaselines.

Furthermore, when a new question is proposed,\nLiveVLM incorporates an online question-answering process that efficiently\nfetches both short-term and long-term visual information, while minimizing\ninterference from redundant context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nLiveVLM enables the foundation LLaVA-OneVision model to process 44$\\times$\nnumber of frames on the same device, and achieves up to 5$\\times$ speedup in\nresponse speed compared with SoTA online methods at an input of 256 frames,\nwhile maintaining the same or better model performance.",

In recent years,\nsignificant research efforts have focused on mitigating its impact through two\ncomplementary approaches. On the one hand, researchers have investigated\npractical digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to mitigate or compensate\nfor nonlinear impairments, such as reversing fiber propagation effects through\ndigital backpropagation (DBP). However, the high computational complexity of\nthese techniques often discourages their practical implementation. On the other\nhand, information-theoretic studies have sought to establish the capacity\nlimits of the nonlinear optical fiber channel, providing a framework for\nevaluating the ultimate performance of existing optical networks and guiding\nthe design of next-generation systems.

Recent research suggests that models may\nbe particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as\n``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this\npaper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models\n(LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and\nvarious errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently\nsearch for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs)\nand text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework.\nRandomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation\noperations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models\ninto visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each\ninput is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as\nreward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs.\nExtensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

However, a critical yet underexplored question\nremains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of\ntask-specific $\\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end\nthis, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel\nmethod that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for\nefficient $\\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,\nGenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from\n$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\\Delta W$ into layer-shared and\nlayer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized\nflexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance\nacross CV and NLP tasks.

More generally, we formally\nreduce any end-to-end large-depth ResNet or transformer training into an\nequivalent unconstrained features model, thus justifying its wide use in the\nliterature even beyond data-agnostic settings. Our theoretical results are\nsupported by experiments on computer vision and language datasets showing that,\nas the depth grows, neural collapse indeed becomes more prominent.",

Mid-infrared spectral\nsurveys, now with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), pave the way to\nexplore this hypothesis. In this work, we test this theory for 8 compact disks\n($R_\\mathrm{dust}<$60 au) with JWST-MIRI/MRS observations. We analyse the\ndifferent reservoirs that can be probed with the pure rotational lines ($>$10\n$\\mathrm{\\mu}$m) through parametric column density profiles, multiple component\nslab models, and line flux ratios. We find that not all compact disks show\nstrong enhancements of the cold H$_2$O reservoir, instead we propose three\ndifferent classes of inner disk H$_2$O distributions. Four of our disks appear\nto have similar H$_2$O distributions as many of the large and structured disks\n(Type N or ``Normal'' disks), as is indicated by the slab model fitting and the\nline flux ratios. These disks have a small cold reservoir, suggesting the\ninward drift of dust, but it is not as efficient as hypothesised before. Only\ntwo disks do show a strong enhancement of the cold H$_2$O emission (Type E or\ncold H$_2$O enhanced disks), agreeing with the original hypothesis. The two\nremaining disks are found to be very H$_2$O-poor (Type P or H$_2$O-poor disks),\nyet show emission from either the hot or immediate reservoirs (depending on the\nfit) in addition to emission from the cold one. We find that different\nparametrisations are able to provide a good description of the observed H$_2$O\nspectra, with the multiple component analysis yielding similar results.\nFinally, we also report the detection of other molecules in these disks,\nincluding a tentative detection of CH$_4$ in CY Tau.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical\napplications, but existing models often struggle with the computational\ninefficiencies and challenges posed by complex medical data. State Space\nSequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range\ndependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in\nmedical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image\ntokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a\nbalance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic\ndependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel\narchitecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the\nSelf-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates\ncontextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most\nrelevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces\ncomputational complexity and improves the representation of complex image\nfeatures across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance\nMulti-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the\nencoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows\nthe model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies\nacross scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and\nhigh-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and\nendoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy\nthan current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba.

However, advancing\nlearning-based 3D scene understanding remains challenging due to two key\nlimitations: (1) the large scale and complexity of 3D scenes lead to higher\ncomputational costs and slower training compared to 2D counterparts; and (2)\nhigh-quality annotated 3D datasets are significantly scarcer than those\navailable for 2D vision. These challenges underscore the need for more\nefficient learning paradigms. In this work, we propose DC-Scene, a data-centric\nframework tailored for 3D scene understanding, which emphasizes enhancing data\nquality and training efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a CLIP-driven\ndual-indicator quality (DIQ) filter, combining vision-language alignment scores\nwith caption-loss perplexity, along with a curriculum scheduler that\nprogressively expands the training pool from the top 25% to 75% of\nscene-caption pairs. This strategy filters out noisy samples and significantly\nreduces dependence on large-scale labeled 3D data. Extensive experiments on\nScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that DC-Scene achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance (86.1 CIDEr with the top-75% subset vs. 85.4 with the full dataset)\nwhile reducing training cost by approximately two-thirds, confirming that a\ncompact set of high-quality samples can outperform exhaustive training.

    "abstract": "The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model successfully explains large-scale structure\nformation, but challenges remain at smaller scales, leading to interest in Warm\nDark Matter (WDM) as an alternative. The abundance of Milky Way subhalos\ndepends on the mass of WDM particles, allowing constraints to be obtained by\ncomparing observations and theoretical models. However, high-resolution\nsimulations of heavier WDM particle masses are computationally demanding,\nmaking semi-analytical approaches valuable. In this study, we evaluate the\nability of the Semi-Analytical Sub-Halo Inference Modeling for WDM (SASHIMI-W)\nto reproduce subhalo mass functions for heavier WDM particle masses. We perform\nhigh-resolution cosmological N-body simulations for CDM and WDM with particle\nmasses of 1 keV, 3 keV, and 10 keV, and compare the ratio of the subhalo mass\nfunction between WDM and CDM cases. Our results show that SASHIMI-W\nsuccessfully reproduces the simulation results over redshifts z = 0 to z = 2.\nFurthermore, both simulations and the semi-analytical model show a slight\nredshift dependence in the subhalo suppression ratio. However, a direct\ncomparison of the differential subhalo mass functions shows discrepancies in\nthe mid- and low-mass regions, suggesting that the tidal stripping effects\nimplemented in SASHIMI-W may be too strong for WDM subhalos, or that the\nremoval of spurious subhalos in the simulations is insufficient. These results\nvalidate the use of SASHIMI-W in constraining WDM properties, and highlight the\nneed for refinements in both tidal effect modeling and spurious subhalo\nfiltering to improve subhalo abundance predictions.",

To address this issue,\nincorporating an information bottleneck network into the task presents a\nstraightforward solution. However, relying solely on image-corresponding\nprompts results in suboptimal performance due to the inherent diversity of\nprompts. In this paper, we propose a multimodal conditional bottleneck network\nto reduce feature redundancy while enhancing the discriminative power of\nfeatures extracted by CLIP, thereby improving the model's generalization\nability. We begin with a semantic analysis experiment, where we observe that\narbitrary text features exhibit lower cosine similarity with real image\nfeatures than with fake image features in the CLIP feature space, a phenomenon\nwe refer to as \"bias\". Therefore, we introduce InfoFD, a text-guided\nAI-generated image detection framework. InfoFD consists of two key components:\nthe Text-Guided Conditional Information Bottleneck (TGCIB) and Dynamic Text\nOrthogonalization (DTO). TGCIB improves the generalizability of learned\nrepresentations by conditioning on both text and class modalities. DTO\ndynamically updates weighted text features, preserving semantic information\nwhile leveraging the global \"bias\".

    "abstract": "Group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO) aims to develop models that\nperform well across $m$ distributions simultaneously. Existing GDRO algorithms\ncan only process a fixed number of samples per iteration, either 1 or $m$, and\ntherefore can not support scenarios where the sample size varies dynamically.\nTo address this limitation, we investigate GDRO with flexible sample queries\nand cast it as a two-player game: one player solves an online convex\noptimization problem, while the other tackles a prediction with limited advice\n(PLA) problem. Within such a game, we propose a novel PLA algorithm,\nconstructing appropriate loss estimators for cases where the sample size is\neither 1 or not, and updating the decision using follow-the-regularized-leader.\nThen, we establish the first high-probability regret bound for non-oblivious\nPLA. Building upon the above approach, we develop a GDRO algorithm that allows\nan arbitrary and varying sample size per round, achieving a high-probability\noptimization error bound of $O\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^t\n\\frac{m}{r_j}\\log m}\\right)$, where $r_t$ denotes the sample size at round $t$.\nThis result demonstrates that the optimization error decreases as the number of\nsamples increases and implies a consistent sample complexity of $O(m\\log\n(m)/\\epsilon^2)$ for any fixed sample size $r\\in[m]$, aligning with existing\nbounds for cases of $r=1$ or $m$. We validate our approach on synthetic binary\nand real-world multi-class datasets.",

    "abstract": "Training a universal controller for robots with different morphologies is a\npromising research trend, since it can significantly enhance the robustness and\nresilience of the robotic system. However, diverse morphologies can yield\ndifferent dimensions of state space and action space, making it difficult to\ncomply with traditional policy networks. Existing methods address this issue by\nmodularizing the robot configuration, while do not adequately extract and\nutilize the overall morphological information, which has been proven crucial\nfor training a universal controller. To this end, we propose GCNT, a\nmorphology-agnostic policy network based on improved Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) and Transformer. It exploits the fact that GCN and Transformer\ncan handle arbitrary number of modules to achieve compatibility with diverse\nmorphologies. Our key insight is that the GCN is able to efficiently extract\nmorphology information of robots, while Transformer ensures that it is fully\nutilized by allowing each node of the robot to communicate this information\ndirectly. Experimental results show that our method can generate resilient\nlocomotion behaviors for robots with different configurations, including\nzero-shot generalization to robot morphologies not seen during training. In\nparticular, GCNT achieved the best performance on 8 tasks in the 2 standard\nbenchmarks.",

In this paper, we introduce DUSK, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate unlearning methods under realistic data overlap.\nDUSK constructs document sets that describe the same factual content in\ndifferent styles, with some shared information appearing across all sets and\nother content remaining unique to each.

Existing approaches\nhave rarely focused on transferring image textures onto 3D representations. 3D\nstyle transfer methods are capable of transferring abstract artistic styles to\n3D scenes. However, these methods often overlook the geometric information of\nthe scene, which makes it challenging to achieve high-quality 3D texture\ntransfer results.

From the perspective of matching\ntexture features with geometric information in rendered views, we identify the\nissue of insufficient texture features and propose a geometry-aware texture\naugmentation module to expand the texture feature set. Moreover, a\ngeometry-consistent texture loss is proposed to optimize texture features into\nthe scene representation.

This optimizes for pass@1\nperformance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of\nthe diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes\nthe sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder\nexamples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a\ntransformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of\npass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward\nwhen considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance\nunbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and\ncontinuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to\nstandard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and\nefficient transformation function.\n  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable\nrobust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of\ntrading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k\nduring training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1\nnumbers alongside significant pass@k gains.\n  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the\nvariance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world\nexamples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation\neffectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable\nsolving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and\npass@k .

Unlike traditional\nfixed-position multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, a FAS possesses\nposition reconfigurability to switch on-demand among $N$ predefined ports over\na prescribed space. This paper explores the performance of a single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) model with a fixed-position antenna transmitter and a\nsingle-antenna FAS receiver, referred to as the Rx-SISO-FAS model, under\nspatially-correlated Rician fading channels. Our contributions include exact\nexpressions and closed-form bounds for the outage probability of the\nRx-SISO-FAS model, as well as exact and closed-form lower bounds for the\nergodic rate. Importantly, we also analyze the performance considering both\nuniform linear array (ULA) and uniform planar array (UPA) configurations for\nthe ports of the FAS. To gain insights, we evaluate the diversity order of the\nproposed model and our analytical results indicate that with a fixed overall\nsystem size, increasing the number of ports, $N$, significantly decreases the\noutage performance of FAS under different Rician fading factors. Our numerical\nresults further demonstrate that: $i)$ the Rx-SISO-FAS model can enhance\nperformance under spatially-correlated Rician fading channels over the\nfixed-position antenna counterpart; $ii)$ the Rician factor negatively impacts\nperformance in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime; $iii$) FAS can\noutperform an $L$ branches maximum ratio combining (MRC) system under Rician\nfading channels; and $iv)$ when the number of ports is identical, UPA\noutperforms ULA.",

Existing efforts to mitigate these biases face key limitations:\nin-context learning-based methods fail to address rooted biases due to the\nevaluator's limited capacity for self-reflection, whereas fine-tuning is not\napplicable to all evaluator types, especially closed-source models. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce the Reasoning-based Bias Detector (RBD), which is\na plug-in module that identifies biased evaluations and generates structured\nreasoning to guide evaluator self-correction. Rather than modifying the\nevaluator itself, RBD operates externally and engages in an iterative process\nof bias detection and feedback-driven revision. To support its development, we\ndesign a complete pipeline consisting of biased dataset construction,\nsupervision collection, distilled reasoning-based fine-tuning of RBD, and\nintegration with LLM evaluators. We fine-tune four sizes of RBD models, ranging\nfrom 1.5B to 14B, and observe consistent performance improvements across all\nscales. Experimental results on 4 bias types--verbosity, position, bandwagon,\nand sentiment--evaluated using 8 LLM evaluators demonstrate RBD's strong\neffectiveness. For example, the RBD-8B model improves evaluation accuracy by an\naverage of 18.5% and consistency by 10.9%, and surpasses prompting-based\nbaselines and fine-tuned judges by 12.8% and 17.2%, respectively.

The detection problem is firstly transformed into a\nhigh-dimensional sparse estimation problem via functional basis expansion, and\nthe penalized group selection is applied to estimate the number and locations\nof candidate change points in the first stage. To further circumvent the issue\nof overestimating the true number of change points in practice, a partial\nF-test is applied in the second stage to filter redundant change points so that\nthe false discovery rate of the F-test for multiple change points is\ncontrolled. Additionally, in order to reduce complexity of the proposed GS-PF\nmethod, a link parameter is adopted to generate candidate sets of potential\nchange points, which greatly reduces the number of detected change points and\nimproves the efficiency. Asymptotic results are established and validated to\nguarantee detection consistency of the proposed GS-PF method, and its\nperformance is evaluated through intensive simulations and real data analysis,\ncompared with the state-of-the-art detecting methods.

To address this challenge, we introduce MonoSplat, a novel\nframework that leverages rich visual priors from pre-trained monocular depth\nfoundation models for robust Gaussian reconstruction. Our approach consists of\ntwo key components: a Mono-Multi Feature Adapter that transforms monocular\nfeatures into multi-view representations, coupled with an Integrated Gaussian\nPrediction module that effectively fuses both feature types for precise\nGaussian generation. Through the Adapter's lightweight attention mechanism,\nfeatures are seamlessly aligned and aggregated across views while preserving\nvaluable monocular priors, enabling the Prediction module to generate Gaussian\nprimitives with accurate geometry and appearance. Through extensive experiments\non diverse real-world datasets, we convincingly demonstrate that MonoSplat\nachieves superior reconstruction quality and generalization capability compared\nto existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency with minimal\ntrainable parameters.

    "abstract": "Omni-domain infrared small target detection (IRSTD) poses formidable\nchallenges, as a single model must seamlessly adapt to diverse imaging systems,\nvarying resolutions, and multiple spectral bands simultaneously. Current\napproaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only\nstruggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target\nfeatures, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex\nomni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance\nvariations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing\nparadigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing\nimaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor\nplatforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this\nlimitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target\nDetector (AuxDet), a novel multi-modal framework that fundamentally reimagines\nthe IRSTD paradigm by incorporating textual metadata for scene-aware\noptimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with\nvisual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual\nsample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement\nmodule using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and\nrecover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging\nWideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information\nin improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks.

With the emergence of Large Code Models (LCMs), this field has\nwitnessed significant advancements. Due to the natural differences between\nopen-source and industrial codebases, such as coding patterns and unique\ninternal dependencies, it is a common practice for developers to conduct domain\nadaptation when adopting LCMs in industry. There exist multiple adaptation\napproaches, among which retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning\nare the two most popular paradigms. However, no prior research has explored the\ntrade-off of the two approaches in industrial scenarios.\n  To mitigate the gap, we comprehensively compare the two paradigms including\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-tuning (FT), for industrial code\ncompletion in this paper. In collaboration with Tencent's WXG department, we\ncollect over 160,000 internal C++ files as our codebase. We then compare the\ntwo types of adaptation approaches from three dimensions that are concerned by\nindustrial practitioners, including effectiveness, efficiency, and parameter\nsensitivity, using six LCMs. Our findings reveal that RAG, when implemented\nwith appropriate embedding models that map code snippets into dense vector\nrepresentations, can achieve higher accuracy than fine-tuning alone.\nSpecifically, BM25 presents superior retrieval effectiveness and efficiency\namong studied RAG methods. Moreover, RAG and fine-tuning are orthogonal and\ntheir combination leads to further improvement.

We tested our\napproach using both a simulation tool (CloudSim Plus) and real-world data. The\nresults show that HybridPSOGWO outperforms other methods, with up to 15\\%\nimprovement in makespan and 10\\% better throughput, while also distributing\ntasks more evenly across virtual machines. Our implementation achieves\nconsistent convergence within a few iterations, highlighting its potential for\nefficient and adaptive cloud scheduling.",

The\nmain benefit of luminescent thermometers and manometers is a possibility of\nremote temperature and/or pressure monitoring, in contrast to conventional\ngauges. Moreover, the use of luminescent nanoparticles as temperature/pressure\nsensors allow detection in micron- and nano-sized areas, previously\ninaccessible for conventional gauges. Therefore, the combination of both\nfunctionalities in a single material is highly appealing, as has been shown in\na growing number of reports in the last years. Moreover, the bifunctional\npressure and temperature sensors, operating with multiple independent\nspectroscopic parameters, allow simultaneous and distinct pressure and\ntemperature readouts. However, the development of such truly bifunctional and\nreliable sensors is very challenging and rarely reported.

    "abstract": "The current massive installation of distributed resources in electricity\ndistribution systems is transforming these systems into active dispatching\nsubjects. At the same time, the need to compensate for the intermittent\ngeneration of an increasing amount of renewable sources creates the need to\nacquire more ancillary services. Flexible resources in the distribution system\ncould provide these services not only within the perimeter of the distribution\nnetwork to which they are connected but also for the benefit of the\ntransmission system. However, this requires Transmission System Operators\n(TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to coordinate their dispatching\nactions effectively. One critical aspect of this coordination is establishing a\nmarket architecture that limits market power. This paper presents an innovative\ngame-theoretic approach to compare different TSO-DSO coordination models for\nacquiring ancillary services from distribution resources. Several schemes are\nconsidered: some with coordinated market management by TSOs and DSOs, others\nwith sequential or independent local markets. For each scheme, the dispatching\nproblem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic sequential game, where the\nfirst stage is the day-ahead market and the second stage is the balancing\nmarket. Nash equilibrium solutions are obtained by iteratively solving the\nprofit maximization problem of each market player. Numerical tests on a CIGRE\nbenchmark network show that coordination schemes enabling distribution\nresources to provide ancillary services to the transmission system can\nsignificantly increase system costs when congestion occurs in the transmission\nnetwork.",

Long-term uncertainties, such as investment and\nmaintenance costs of different technologies, are combined with short-term\nuncertainties, including solar radiation, electricity prices, and uncontrolled\nload variations. We formulate the problem as a multistage multi-horizon\nstochastic Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, minimizing the total\ncost of a domestic building complex's energy system. The model integrates\nlong-term investment decisions, such as the capacity of photovoltaic panels and\nbattery energy storage systems, with short-term operational decisions,\nincluding energy dispatch, grid exchanges, and load supply. To ensure robust\noperation under extreme scenarios, first- and second-order stochastic dominance\nrisk-averse measures are considered preserving the time consistency of the\nsolution. Given the computational complexity of solving the stochastic MILP for\nlarge instances, a rolling horizon-based matheuristic algorithm is developed.\nAdditionally, various lower-bound strategies are explored, including\nwait-and-see schemes, expected value approximations, multistage grouping and\nclustering schemes.

ATM adaptively reduces tokens across\nlayers and batches by carefully adjusting layer-specific similarity thresholds,\nthereby preventing the undesirable merging of less similar tokens with respect\nto each layer. Furthermore, ATM introduces a novel token matching technique\nthat considers not only similarity but also merging sizes, particularly for the\nfinal layers, to minimize the information loss incurred from each merging\noperation. We empirically validate our method across a wide range of pretrained\nmodels, demonstrating that ATM not only outperforms all existing training-free\nmethods but also surpasses most training-intensive approaches, even without\nadditional training. Remarkably, training-free ATM achieves over a 30%\nreduction in FLOPs for the DeiT-T and DeiT-S models without any drop in their\noriginal accuracy.",

Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher\nannualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and\noutperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint\nfactor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy\nand strategy robustness. Our code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent.",

However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)\nreasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened\noutputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does\nnot universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks.\nTo address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel\nframework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form\nreasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and\nevaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low\nconfidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal\nVQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both\nshort-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance\nbetween accuracy and efficiency.",

However, theoretical studies, which largely employ models with a\nsingle cavity mode, cannot explain the experimentally observed kinetic changes.\nWhile simplified multimode models with one spatial dimension can capture\nexperimental features involving the polariton states, it is unclear whether\nthey can also describe the dark states. Here, we study the delocalization of\ndark states for molecules in a multimode cavity, accounting for the\nthree-dimensional nature of experimental setups. Accounting for energetic and\norientational disorder, but fixing Rabi splitting and intermolecular distances\n(i.e., no positional disorder), we find that the delocalization of the dark\nstates scales linearly with the number of molecules in the plane parallel to\nthe cavity mirrors, in contrast to one-dimensional multimode models. Adding\nlayers of molecules along the axis normal to the mirrors increases the\ndelocalization much less. Similar to the one-dimensional models, the dark-state\ndelocalization is enhanced for smaller values of molecular energetic disorder,\nrelative to the light-matter coupling, and cavities with longer longitudinal\nlength. Our work indicates that for certain phenomena, understanding the dark\nstates under strong light-matter coupling might require a proper multimode\ndescription of the optical cavity.",

Besides, we propose Any-variate Attention,\nenabling a unified model structure to seamlessly handle both univariate and\nmultivariate time series, thereby supporting channel-independent modeling\nduring pretraining and channel-mixed modeling for finetuning. Furthermore, we\ndesign a graph learning module that constructs relations among sequences from\nfrequency-domain features, providing more precise guidance to capture\ninter-series dependencies in channel-mixed modeling.

Therefore, in this work, we address the issue of inheriting\nsuboptimality from the perspective of dataset preprocessing. Motivated by the\nsuccess of the weighted empirical risk minimization, we propose a simple yet\neffective approach, learning history filtering (LHF), to enhance ICRL by\nreweighting and filtering the learning histories based on their improvement and\nstability characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, LHF is the first\napproach to avoid source suboptimality by dataset preprocessing, and can be\ncombined with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) ICRL algorithms. We\nsubstantiate the effectiveness of LHF through a series of experiments conducted\non the well-known ICRL benchmarks, encompassing both discrete environments and\ncontinuous robotic manipulation tasks, with three SOTA ICRL algorithms (AD,\nDPT, DICP) as the backbones.

Previous methods either adopt a fixed speculative\ndecoding configuration regardless of the prefix tokens, or train draft models\nin an offline or online manner to align them with the context. This paper\nproposes a training-free online learning framework to adaptively choose the\nconfiguration of the hyperparameters for speculative decoding as text is being\ngenerated. We first formulate this hyperparameter selection problem as a\nMulti-Armed Bandit problem and provide a general speculative decoding framework\nBanditSpec. Furthermore, two bandit-based hyperparameter selection algorithms,\nUCBSpec and EXP3Spec, are designed and analyzed in terms of a novel quantity,\nthe stopping time regret. We upper bound this regret under both stochastic and\nadversarial reward settings. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility\nresult, it is shown that the regret performance of UCBSpec is optimal up to\nuniversal constants. Finally, extensive empirical experiments with LLaMA3 and\nQwen2 demonstrate that our algorithms are effective compared to existing\nmethods, and the throughput is close to the oracle best hyperparameter in\nsimulated real-life LLM serving scenarios with diverse input prompts.",

Under ideal conditions, when\nthe user's perception aligns closely with the machine's perception of\nsimilarity, consistent and precise judgments can elevate the target to the top\nposition within a few iterations. However, in practical scenarios, expecting\nusers to provide consistent judgments is often unrealistic, especially when the\nunderlying embedding features used for similarity measurements lack\ninterpretability. To enhance robustness, we first introduce a pairwise relative\njudgment feedback that improves the stability of top-k selections by mitigating\nthe impact of misaligned feedback. Then, we decompose user perception into\nmultiple sub-perceptions, each represented as an independent embedding space.\nThis approach assumes that users may not consistently align with a single\nrepresentation but are more likely to align with one or several among multiple\nrepresentations. We develop a predictive user model that estimates the\ncombination of sub-perceptions based on each user feedback instance. The\npredictive user model is then trained to filter out the misaligned\nsub-perceptions.

We investigate whether\nthe cosmic web environments affect the spatial and velocity anisotropies of\nstellar halos in Milky Way-mass galaxies. Using high-resolution data from the\nTNG50 simulation, we analyze 29 stellar halos from each environment and\nquantify their spatial and kinematic anisotropies as a function of halo-centric\nradius. We find that stellar halos across all environments generally exhibit\nincreasing spatial anisotropy with radius, with fluctuations corresponding to\nbound substructures. The velocity anisotropy profiles show radially dominated\norbits on average, but also display significant local variation, including\ntangentially dominated regions. However, no statistically significant\ndifferences are observed in the mean spatial or velocity anisotropy profiles\nacross environments, for either the total stellar halo population or for the in\nsitu and ex situ components individually. The large scatter within each\nenvironment suggests that the formation of stellar halos is primarily driven by\nstochastic, small-scale processes such as satellite merger histories, rather\nthan the large-scale geometry of the cosmic web. Our results imply that, at\nfixed halo mass, the influence of cosmic web environment on the structure of\nstellar halo is weak or highly non-deterministic. Possible environmental\neffects may be more prominent at higher masses where accretion is more\nanisotropic. Exploring this regime will require simulations with both larger\nvolume and higher resolution.",

Especially under challenging conditions such\nas adverse weather and low-light environments, the combined use of\nmillimeter-wave radar and RGB-D sensors has shown distinct advantages. However,\nexisting multi-sensor datasets in the fields of autonomous driving and robotics\noften lack high-quality millimeter-wave radar data. To address this gap, we\npresent a new multi-sensor dataset:RadarRGBD. This dataset includes RGB-D data,\nmillimeter-wave radar point clouds, and raw radar matrices, covering various\nindoor and outdoor scenes, as well as low-light environments. Compared to\nexisting datasets, RadarRGBD employs higher-resolution millimeter-wave radar\nand provides raw data, offering a new research foundation for the fusion of\nmillimeter-wave radar and visual sensors. Furthermore, to tackle the noise and\ngaps in depth maps captured by Kinect V2 due to occlusions and mismatches, we\nfine-tune an open-source relative depth estimation framework, incorporating the\nabsolute depth information from the dataset for depth supervision. We also\nintroduce pseudo-relative depth scale information to further optimize the\nglobal depth scale estimation.

    "abstract": "Pretrained generative models have opened new frontiers in brain decoding by\nenabling the synthesis of realistic texts and images from non-invasive brain\nrecordings. However, the reliability of such outputs remains\nquestionable--whether they truly reflect semantic activation in the brain, or\nare merely hallucinated by the powerful generative models. In this paper, we\nfocus on EEG-to-text decoding and address its hallucination issue through the\nlens of posterior collapse. Acknowledging the underlying mismatch in\ninformation capacity between EEG and text, we reframe the decoding task as\nsemantic summarization of core meanings rather than previously verbatim\nreconstruction of stimulus texts. To this end, we propose the Generative\nLanguage Inspection Model (GLIM), which emphasizes learning informative and\ninterpretable EEG representations to improve semantic grounding under\nheterogeneous and small-scale data conditions. Experiments on the public ZuCo\ndataset demonstrate that GLIM consistently generates fluent, EEG-grounded\nsentences without teacher forcing. Moreover, it supports more robust evaluation\nbeyond text similarity, through EEG-text retrieval and zero-shot semantic\nclassification across sentiment categories, relation types, and corpus topics.\nTogether, our architecture and evaluation protocols lay the foundation for\nreliable and scalable benchmarking in generative brain decoding.",

Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with\ndisease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of\nfine-grained token representations.

    "abstract": "Graph-structured data pervades domains such as social networks, biological\nsystems, knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. While foundation models\nhave transformed natural language processing, vision, and multimodal learning\nthrough large-scale pretraining and generalization, extending these\ncapabilities to graphs -- characterized by non-Euclidean structures and complex\nrelational semantics -- poses unique challenges and opens new opportunities. To\nthis end, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) aim to bring scalable, general-purpose\nintelligence to structured data, enabling broad transfer across graph-centric\ntasks and domains. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of GFMs,\nunifying diverse efforts under a modular framework comprising three key\ncomponents: backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and adaptation\nmechanisms. We categorize GFMs by their generalization scope -- universal,\ntask-specific, and domain-specific -- and review representative methods, key\ninnovations, and theoretical insights within each category. Beyond methodology,\nwe examine theoretical foundations including transferability and emergent\ncapabilities, and highlight key challenges such as structural alignment,\nheterogeneity, scalability, and evaluation. Positioned at the intersection of\ngraph learning and general-purpose AI, GFMs are poised to become foundational\ninfrastructure for open-ended reasoning over structured data.

These\nstrategically constructed hard negatives guide the encoder to learn more\ndiscriminative features by emphasizing critical semantic differences between\ngraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to existing GCL methods across a variety\nof datasets and tasks.",

Through nonlinear regression and least squares\nparameter fitting, a novel temperature correction equation is proposed, which\nsignificantly reduces the prediction error for core losses under\nhigh-temperature conditions. The average relative error is decreased to 16.03%,\nthereby markedly enhancing the accuracy.

A\ndata-driven predictive model for core loss is developed, demonstrating\nexcellent performance with an R*R value of 0.9703 through machine learning\nregression analysis, indicating high prediction accuracy and broad\napplicability. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model considering\nboth core loss and transmission magnetic energy is proposed.

    "abstract": "Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a key capability that\nenables large vision-language models (LVLMs) to adapt to novel tasks without\nparameter updates, expanding their utility across various real-world\napplications. However, ICL remains unstable, even with well-matched in-context\ndemonstrations (ICDs), suggesting that LVLMs struggle to fully utilize the\nprovided context. While existing efforts focus on prompt engineering or\npost-hoc logit calibration, we instead investigate the underlying attention\ndynamics to overcome LVLMs' inherent limitations. We identify two critical\ndeficits in their self-attention that impair effective ICL. To bridge the gap,\nwe propose \\textbf{Context-Aware Modulated Attention} (CAMA), a plug-and-play\nand training-free method that dynamically modulates LVLM's attention logits\nbased on the input in-context sequence. CAMA employs a two-stage attention\nmodulation to address both identified deficits, enhancing the focus on\nsemantically significant tokens, particularly visual ones. Across four LVLMs\nand seven benchmarks, CAMA consistently outperforms vanilla models and\nbaselines, demonstrating great effectiveness and generalization. It can also\nactivate the desired effects of prompt engineering methods and remains robust\nunder diverse sequence configurations. Thus, CAMA paves the way for deeper\nexplorations of attention dynamics to advance multimodal reasoning.",

Existing\nLLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like\nmanner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click\nhistory, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often\nleads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we\npropose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1\nto System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking\nactivation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and\ninjects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable\nreasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying\nuser preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this,\nwe propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning\ndifficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users'\nlatent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users,\nthereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the\naccuracy and interpretability of recommendations.

Traditional time-frequency (TF) domain anti-jamming methods\nare prone to TF aliasing in multi-component signal scenarios, and cannot\neffectively suppress ISRJ with energy close to the real target under low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes an anti-jamming method based on generalized linear canonical Wigner\ndistribution (GLWD) line detection. By setting the parameters reasonably, the\nTF image of GLWD can have excellent TF resolution and energy concentration,\ngreatly improving the signal separation and SNR. Furthermore, in order to\nenhance the detection capability of the target LFM signal, the existing mobile\nline segment detection (M-LSD) is improved and the mobile long line segment\ndetection (M-LLSD) is proposed. M-LLSD can detect the target signal more easily\nand reduce the sensitivity to the jamming signal, so as to efficiently and\naccurately extract the TF position information of the target signal. Finally, a\nTF filter is constructed based on the mapping between GLWD and short-time\nFourier transform (STFT), performing filtering in the STFT domain to suppress\njamming. Simulations and experiments show that the method can effectively\nsuppress such difficult-to-distinguish jamming and is suitable for real-time\nradar anti-jamming with good robustness.",

    "abstract": "It is straightforward to design an unbiased gradient estimator that\nstochastically cuts the backpropagation flow through any part of a\ncomputational graph. By cutting the parts that have little effect on the\ncomputation, one can potentially save a significant amount of backpropagation\ncomputation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient\nvariance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention\nmechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention\nbecomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically\nwith sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very\nsmall, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small\nfraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising\ntargets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule\ncontrolled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts back-propagation through most\nattention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention\nhead. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the\nattention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear\ncomplexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical\ntransformer model, cutting about $99\\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e.\nchoosing $c \\sim 25-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only\nabout $1\\%$ for $n \\sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is\namenable to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for\nmaking the cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward\npass when training a transformer model on long sequences.",

Mapping and monitoring these green spaces\nare crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees\nis challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image\nresolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes. While\ndeep learning architectures have shown promise in addressing these challenges,\ntheir effectiveness remains strongly dependent on the availability of large and\nmanually labeled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain in\nsufficient quantity.

The complexity is further amplified\nby the detailed nature of texts in CNG. To enhance the confidence of HCPs in\ntools powered by LLMs, this study evaluates the reliability of 12 open-weight\nand proprietary LLMs from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and OpenAI in CNG in terms\nof their ability to generate notes that are string equivalent (consistency\nrate), have the same meaning (semantic consistency) and are correct (semantic\nsimilarity), across several iterations using the same prompt.

However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution\nand uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in\nreal-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO\ndisproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented\nones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness.

Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by\nreweighting optimization based on domain prevalence.

However, FLOPS regularization does not ensure\nsparsity among terms - only within a given query or document. Terms with very\nhigh Document Frequencies (DFs) substantially increase latency in production\nretrieval engines, such as Apache Solr, due to their lengthy posting lists.

We find that\nDF-FLOPS successfully reduces the prevalence of high-DF terms and lowers\nretrieval latency (around 10x faster) in a production-grade engine while\nmaintaining effectiveness both in-domain (only a 2.2-point drop in MRR@10) and\ncross-domain (improved performance in 12 out of 13 tasks on which we tested).\nWith retrieval latencies on par with BM25, this work provides an important step\ntowards making LSR practical for deployment in production-grade search engines.",

    "abstract": "Galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping develop gaseous tails that can\nextend several kiloparsecs outside the galaxy disc. We used far-ultraviolet and\nH$\\alpha$ imaging from the GASP survey to investigate how different stages of\nstripping affect star formation properties in the tail and disc of 13 galaxies\nundergoing stripping. These galaxies have different stripping strengths, as\nidentified from the MUSE integral field spectroscopy. The star-forming knots in\nthe disc and tails show a good correspondence between the measured FUV and\nH$\\alpha$ flux. This is especially true for strong and extreme cases of\nstripping, which have developed extended ionized gaseous tails featuring clumpy\nstructures. The mechanism behind the H$\\alpha$ emission on the tails of these\nregions, which correlates well with FUV emission, is photoionization caused by\nyoung massive stars. The optical emission line ratio maps enable us to\nunderstand the emission mechanism, which can be attributed to star formation,\nLINER activity, or a combination of both phenomena and AGN. The star-forming\nregions in the emission line maps correspond well to the areas with significant\nFUV flux in these galaxies. Six galaxies exhibit minimal star formation in\ntheir tails, with two cases star formation is limited to the central regions\nand their discs are truncated. In galaxies with truncated discs, star formation\nis confined to a smaller region on the disc, as indicated by the FUV flux,\ncompared to H$\\alpha$. Galaxies with strong stripping are undergoing recent\nstar formation and are likely recent infalls. Galaxies with truncated discs\nconfine star formation to the center, likely because they have completed a\ncluster crossing that depleted most of their outer gaseous disc. Galaxies with\nminimal FUV flux along their tails exhibit unresolved H$\\alpha$ emission which\nmay be attributed to processes other than star formation.",

    "abstract": "When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often\nassociate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For\ninstance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate\n\"hormones helping mental disorders\" with \"melatonin being a hormone and\ninsomnia a mental disorder\" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models\n(LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving\nscientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not\ndirectly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE)\naddresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured\nknowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many\nhypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose\nSelf-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic\nassociative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts\nstructured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the\nqueried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls\nand token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on\nsmaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate\nknowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE\nwith a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B\nmodels by up to $\\textbf{28.5%$\\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and\n$\\textbf{78.6$\\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging\nbiomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or\noutperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\\%.\nSelf-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and\nreasoning with associative thinking.",

Using CO(2-1) observations from ALMA and SMA, together\nwith HI data from MeerKAT, we examine the interplay between gas phases and\nenvironmental influences. A joint morphological and kinematic analysis reveals\nthat while the kinematic behavior of HI and CO are often similar,\nmorphologically the atomic gas is more extended compared to centrally\nconcentrated CO distributions, making it more susceptible to environmental\nstripping. However, we also find evidence for molecular gas asymmetries,\ndisturbed velocity fields, and H2 deficiencies in some galaxies, indicating\nthat H2 reservoirs can also be disrupted in dense environments. Compared to\nVirgo-a dynamically unrelaxed, non-cool-core cluster-A2626's relaxed, cool-core\nstructure likely results in less intense ram-pressure stripping. This may allow\ngalaxies to retain more atomic gas, while local interactions or pre-processing\nmay still affect the molecular phase, causing relatively low HI deficiencies\nbut high H2 deficiencies in A2626 galaxies. This is also reflected in the\nhigher gas fractions, slightly elevated SFRs, along with shorter depletion\ntimescales (0.3-3 Gyr), implying moderately enhanced star formation efficiency\nA2626 galaxies. Moreover, the lack of correlation between H2 deficiency and\ncluster-centric distance or velocity suggests that molecular gas evolution in\nA2626 may be shaped more by early infall or local interactions than by current\ncluster location.",

EEG measurements offer a promising solution for extensive AD detection.\nHowever, the intricate and nonlinear dynamics of multichannel EEG signals pose\na considerable challenge for real-time AD diagnosis. This paper introduces a\nnovel algorithm, which is based on Quaternion Principal Component Analysis\n(QPCA) of multichannel EEG signals, for AD classification. The algorithm\nextracts high dimensional correlations among different channels to generate\nfeatures that are maximally representative with minimal information redundancy.\nThis provides a multidimensional and precise measure of brain connectivity in\ndisease assessment. Simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance\nand to identify the most critical EEG channels or brain regions for AD\nclassification. The results reveal a significant drop of connectivity measure\nin the alpha bands. The average AD classification accuracy for all 4-channel\ncombinations reached 95%, while some particular permutations of channels\nachieved 100% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the temporal lobe emerges as one of\nthe most important regions in AD classification given that the EEG signals are\nrecorded during the presentation of an auditory stimulant. The selection of key\nparameters of the QPCA algorithm have been evaluated and some recommendations\nare proposed for further performance enhancement.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for\nenhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an\nLLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However,\ncurrent RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are\nfixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking\nand generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently\ntrain both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central\ninnovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is\ntrained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is\ntrained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without\nrequiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained\nverifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to\ndeterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual\nreinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both\ncomponents of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models:\nthe generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level\nmath benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the\nverifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit\nparticularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical\nreasoning problems. Code is at: https://github.com/kaiwenzha/rl-tango.",

Unlike low-density\ncollectives like bird flocks and insect swarms, in which hydrodynamic and\nstatistical phenomena dominate, the physics of glasses and supercooled fluids\nis important to understand clogging behaviors in high-density collectives. Our\nprevious work revealed that fire ants flowing in confined tunnels utilize\ndiverse behaviors like unequal workload distributions, spontaneous direction\nreversals, and limited interaction times to mitigate clogging and jamming and\nthus maintain functional flow; implementation of similar rules in a small\nrobophysical swarm led to high performance through spontaneous dissolution of\nclogs and clusters. However, how the insects learn such behaviors, and how we\ncan develop \"task capable\" active matter in such regimes, remains a challenge\nin part because interaction dynamics are dominated by local, time-consuming\ncollisions and no single agent can guide the entire collective. Here, we\nhypothesized that effective flow and clog mitigation could emerge purely\nthrough local learning. We tasked small groups of robots with pellet excavation\nin a narrow tunnel, allowing them to modify reversal probabilities over time.\nInitially, robots had equal probabilities and clogs were common. Reversals\nimproved flow. When reversal probabilities adapted via collisions and noisy\ntunnel length estimates, workload inequality and performance improved. Our\nrobophysical study of an excavating swarm shows that, despite the seeming\ncomplexity and difficulty of the task, simple learning rules can mitigate or\nleverage unavoidable features in task-capable dense active matter, leading to\nhypotheses for dense biological and robotic swarms.",

A precise LTV prediction\nsystem enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed\nadvertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.\nNonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically\nobserved in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among\nregistered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset\nwhere the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is\ninsufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction\nmodel. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks\nwith high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's\ncontribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths\nof these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly\ncorrelated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant\non forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely\naffect the accuracy of both tasks.

Here, we review methodologies for\ndistinguishing the stellar signal from the interstellar contribution in the\ncontext of massive stars. We first characterize ISP with distance using a\nrecent compilation of starlight polarization catalogs. Several scenarios\ninvolving Thomson scattering, rapidly rotating stars, optically thick winds,\nand interacting binaries are considered specifically to contrast the\nwavelength-dependent effects of ISP in the ultraviolet versus optical bands.\nISP is recognizable in the stellar polarization from Thomson scattering in the\npolarization position angle rotations.

In the case of quite dense winds, strong ultraviolet lines\ntrace the ISP, which is not always the case in the optical.

Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of\nnanostructures with subwavelength thickness, have recently shown extraordinary\ncapability in manipulating classical and quantum states of light and realizing\nminiaturized SPDC sources. Whereas previous studies have primarily focused on\nperiodic metasurfaces, we uncover the potential of spatially modulated\nnanopatterns for further SPDC enhancement and state engineering. Specifically,\nwe propose a nonlinear metasurface featuring a lateral guided-mode cavity\nformed by two distributed Bragg reflectors. With the quasi-normal mode theory,\nwe predict an SPDC rate up to 157 Hz/mW, which represents about 30 times rate\nenhancement when compared to the metasurface without a cavity. Furthermore, the\ncavity supports a continuous set of high-Q resonances across a broad bandwidth,\nallowing the all-optical tuning of the photon-pair emission directions\ntransverse to the cavity by controlling the pump wavelength, which can find\napplications in quantum imaging.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation addresses achieving causal interpretability in Deep\nLearning for Software Engineering (DL4SE). While Neural Code Models (NCMs) show\nstrong performance in automating software tasks, their lack of transparency in\ncausal relationships between inputs and outputs limits full understanding of\ntheir capabilities. To build trust in NCMs, researchers and practitioners must\nexplain code predictions. Associational interpretability, which identifies\ncorrelations, is often insufficient for tasks requiring intervention and change\nanalysis. To address this, the dissertation introduces DoCode, a novel post hoc\ninterpretability method for NCMs. DoCode uses causal inference to provide\nprogramming language-oriented explanations of model predictions. It follows a\nfour-step pipeline: modeling causal problems using Structural Causal Models\n(SCMs), identifying the causal estimand, estimating effects with metrics like\nAverage Treatment Effect (ATE), and refuting effect estimates. Its framework is\nextensible, with an example that reduces spurious correlations by grounding\nexplanations in programming language properties. A case study on deep code\ngeneration across interpretability scenarios and various deep learning\narchitectures demonstrates DoCode's benefits. Results show NCMs' sensitivity to\ncode syntax changes and their ability to learn certain programming concepts\nwhile minimizing confounding bias. The dissertation also examines associational\ninterpretability as a foundation, analyzing software information's causal\nnature using tools like COMET and TraceXplainer for traceability. It highlights\nthe need to identify code confounders and offers practical guidelines for\napplying causal interpretability to NCMs, contributing to more trustworthy AI\nin software engineering.",

Our first\nprincipal calculations and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the\nformation of the antiferromagnetic skyrmions are due to nonuniformity of RKKY\ncoupling associated with the proximity effect induced magnetic moments in the\nPt and Ru layers. The skyrmions in the Pt and Ru layers adjacent to the Co\nlayers lead to the observed topological Hall effect. This work not only\nprovides insight into the effect of the magnetic proximity effect and RKKY\ncoupling to the SAF skyrmions, but also an effective detection method for the\nSAF skyrmion systems, thereby laying a foundation for the practical application\nof antiferromagnetic skyrmions in spintronic devices.",

The goal of\nvalue-alignment is to create agents that not only do their tasks but through\ntheir behaviours also promote these values. Many of the norms are written as\nlaws or rules (legal / safety norms) but even more remain unwritten (social\nnorms). Furthermore, the techniques used to represent these norms also differ.\nSafety / legal norms are often represented explicitly, for example, in some\nlogical language while social norms are typically learned and remain hidden in\nthe parameter space of a neural network. There is a lack of approaches in the\nliterature that could combine these various norm representations into a single\nalgorithm. We propose a novel method that integrates these norms into the\nreinforcement learning process. Our method monitors the agent's compliance with\nthe given norms and summarizes it in a quantity we call the agent's reputation.\nThis quantity is used to weigh the received rewards to motivate the agent to\nbecome value-aligned. We carry out a series of experiments including a\ncontinuous state space traffic problem to demonstrate the importance of the\nwritten and unwritten norms and show how our method can find the value-aligned\npolicies. Furthermore, we carry out ablations to demonstrate why it is better\nto combine these two groups of norms rather than using either separately.",

In response, a modern system programming language, Rust,\nhas emerged as a memory-safe alternative. Moreover, automating the C-to-Rust\ntranslation empowered by the rapid advancements of the generative capabilities\nof LLMs is gaining growing interest for large volumes of legacy C code. Despite\nsome success, existing LLM-based approaches have constrained the role of LLMs\nto static prompt-response behavior and have not explored their agentic\nproblem-solving capability. Applying the LLM agentic capability for the\nC-to-Rust translation introduces distinct challenges, as this task differs from\nthe traditional LLM agent applications, such as math or commonsense QA domains.\nFirst, the scarcity of parallel C-to-Rust datasets hinders the retrieval of\nsuitable code translation exemplars for in-context learning. Second, unlike\nmath or commonsense QA, the intermediate steps required for C-to-Rust are not\nwell-defined. Third, it remains unclear how to organize and cascade these\nintermediate steps to construct a correct translation trajectory. To address\nthese challenges in the C-to-Rust translation, we propose a novel intermediate\nstep, the Virtual Fuzzing-based equivalence Test (VFT), and an agentic planning\nframework, the LLM-powered Agent for C-to-Rust code translation (LAC2R). The\nVFT guides LLMs to identify input arguments that induce divergent behaviors\nbetween an original C function and its Rust counterpart and to generate\ninformative diagnoses to refine the unsafe Rust code. LAC2R uses the MCTS to\nsystematically organize the LLM-induced intermediate steps for correct\ntranslation.

Nevertheless, such learning-based systems entail numerous safety\nrisks throughout development and on-road deployment, and existing\nsafety-analysis methods struggle to identify these risks comprehensively. To\naddress this gap, we propose the Unified System Theoretic Process Analysis\n(UniSTPA) framework, which extends the scope of STPA from the operational phase\nto the entire lifecycle of an end-to-end autonomous driving system, including\ninformation gathering, data preparation, closed loop training, verification,\nand deployment. UniSTPA performs hazard analysis not only at the component\nlevel but also within the model's internal layers, thereby enabling\nfine-grained assessment of inter and intra module interactions. Using a highway\nNavigate on Autopilot function as a case study, UniSTPA uncovers multi-stage\nhazards overlooked by conventional approaches including scene design defects,\nsensor fusion biases, and internal model flaws, through multi-level causal\nanalysis, traces these hazards to deeper issues such as data quality, network\narchitecture, and optimisation objectives. The analysis result are used to\nconstruct a safety monitoring and safety response mechanism that supports\ncontinuous improvement from hazard identification to system optimisation. The\nproposed framework thus offers both theoretical and practical guidance for the\nsafe development and deployment of end-to-end autonomous driving systems.",

While\neffective for pristine videos, FRMs drive codecs to preserve artifacts when the\ninput is degraded, resulting in suboptimal compression.

To avoid large deviations from\nthe input, we add sum of squared errors (SSE) regularization.

Through extensive experiments, we find\nthat: (1) while some speech LLMs perform competitively on contextual reasoning\ntasks involving basic arithmetic, they still struggle with direct arithmetic\nproblems; (2) current LLMs exhibit a strong bias toward symbolic mathematical\nexpressions written in LaTex and have difficulty interpreting verbalized\nmathematical expressions; and (3) mathematical knowledge reasoning abilities\nare significantly degraded in current speech LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language\nModels (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While\nChain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee\ncorrectness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is\ncomputationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model\n(EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy\nBased Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to\nassign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels,\nthereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting\ndiscriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking\ncandidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final\noutcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks\n(GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with\nLlama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively\nleverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the\nperformance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome\nreliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.",

    "abstract": "Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity\nstandard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric\nproperties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,\nTversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a\nrepresentation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a\nfunction of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been\nused in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating\ndiscrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of\nTversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive\nneural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which\nunlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.\nThrough experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that\nthe Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear\nprojection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image\nclassification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer\nachieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter\nbaseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases\nby 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified\ninterpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input\nstimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization\ntechnique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our\nwork offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in\ndeep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an\nestablished theory of psychological similarity.",

    "abstract": "The non-locality of quantum correlations is a fundamental feature of quantum\ntheory. The Bell inequality serves as a benchmark for distinguishing between\npredictions made by quantum theory and local hidden variable theory (LHVT).\nRecent advancements in photon-entanglement experiments have addressed potential\nloopholes and have observed significant violations of variants of Bell\ninequality. However, examples of Bell inequalities violation in high energy\nphysics are scarce. In this study, we utilize $(10.087\\pm0.044)\\times10^{9}$\n$J/\\psi$ events collected with the BES-III detector at the BEPCII collider,\nperforming non-local correlation tests using the entangled hyperon pairs. The\nmassive-entangled $\\Lambda\\bar\\Lambda$ systems are formed and decay through\nstrong and weak interactions, respectively. Through measurements of the angular\ndistribution of $p\\bar{p}$ in $J/\\psi\\to \\gamma\\eta_c$ and subsequent\n$\\eta_c\\to\\Lambda(p\\pi^-)\\bar\\Lambda(\\bar{p}\\pi^{+})$ cascade decays, a\nsignificant violation of LHVT predictions is observed. The exclusion of LHVT is\nfound to be statistically significant at a level exceeding $5.2\\sigma$ in the\ntesting of three Bell-like inequalities.",

    "abstract": "Generalizing control policies to novel embodiments remains a fundamental\nchallenge in enabling scalable and transferable learning in robotics. While\nprior works have explored this in locomotion, a systematic study in the context\nof manipulation tasks remains limited, partly due to the lack of standardized\nbenchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for learning\ncross-embodiment manipulation, focusing on two foundational tasks-reach and\npush-across a diverse range of morphologies. The benchmark is designed to test\ngeneralization along three axes: interpolation (testing performance within a\nrobot category that shares the same link structure), extrapolation (testing on\na robot with a different link structure), and composition (testing on\ncombinations of link structures). On the benchmark, we evaluate the ability of\ndifferent RL policies to learn from multiple morphologies and to generalize to\nnovel ones. Our study aims to answer whether morphology-aware training can\noutperform single-embodiment baselines, whether zero-shot generalization to\nunseen morphologies is feasible, and how consistently these patterns hold\nacross different generalization regimes. The results highlight the current\nlimitations of multi-embodiment learning and provide insights into how\narchitectural and training design choices influence policy generalization.",

In this paper, we revisit the pre-validation procedure and extend the\nproblem formulation without any independence assumption on the two feature\nsets. We propose not only an analytical distribution of the test statistic for\nthe pre-validated predictor under certain models, but also a generic bootstrap\nprocedure to conduct inference.

Traditional dense retrieval\nmodels, such as DTR and ColBERT, not only incur high computational costs for\nlarge-scale retrieval tasks but also require retraining or fine-tuning on new\ndatasets, limiting their adaptability to evolving domains and knowledge. In\nthis work, we propose $\\textbf{CRAFT}$, a cascaded retrieval approach that\nfirst uses a sparse retrieval model to filter a subset of candidate tables\nbefore applying more computationally expensive dense models and neural\nre-rankers. Our approach achieves better retrieval performance than\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) sparse, dense, and hybrid retrievers. We further\nenhance table representations by generating table descriptions and titles using\nGemini Flash 1.5.

    "abstract": "For future human-autonomous vehicle (AV) interactions to be effective and\nsmooth, human-aware systems that analyze and align human needs with automation\ndecisions are essential. Achieving this requires systems that account for human\ncognitive states. We present a novel computational model in the form of a\nDynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) that infers the cognitive states of both AV\nusers and other road users, integrating this information into the AV's\ndecision-making process. Specifically, our model captures the well-being of\nboth an AV user and an interacting road user as cognitive states alongside\ntrust. Our DBN models infer beliefs over the AV user's evolving well-being,\ntrust, and intention states, as well as the possible well-being of other road\nusers, based on observed interaction experiences. Using data collected from an\ninteraction study, we refine the model parameters and empirically assess its\nperformance. Finally, we extend our model into a causal inference model (CIM)\nframework for AV decision-making, enabling the AV to enhance user well-being\nand trust while balancing these factors with its own operational costs and the\nwell-being of interacting road users. Our evaluation demonstrates the model's\neffectiveness in accurately predicting user's states and guiding informed,\nhuman-centered AV decisions.",
