    "abstract": "Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any\nspecific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have\ndirect causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous\nalgorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes,\noften overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap\nby introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped\nlargely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To\ndemonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a\nconcrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social\ndeterminants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma\ndistribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact\nindividual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers\nfindings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates,\nthat are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings\nsuggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes\nmay introduce new structural injustice when addressing existing discrimination.\nConsidering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a\nmore comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by\nindividuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual\nenvironments, which is essential for understanding and achieving fairness\neffectively and transparently.",

    "abstract": "To generalise evolution families we consider systems of contractions\n$\\{\\varphi(u, v)\\}_{(u, v) \\in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\\mathcal{G}\n= (\\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \\emph{divisibility}, can\nbe modelled via $\\varphi(u, v)\\varphi(v, w) = \\varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v),\n(v, w), (u, w) \\in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive\nBanach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\\ast}$-algebras; and 3)\nCPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting,\nwe are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to\ndivisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective\nisometries resp. $C^{\\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary\nrepresentations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with\nthe order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous\ndilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and\n$C^{\\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with\nstring-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of\nStroescu [44], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [50].",

However, they were not\nequipped with security mechanisms to protect user data. Data encryption and\nauthentication can be used to secure beat sensor applications, but generating a\nsecure cryptographic key is challenging. In this paper, we proposed an\nSRAM-based Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) combining a high-reliability\nbit selection algorithm with a lightweight error-correcting code to generate\nreliable secure keys for data encryption. The system employs a feature of beat\nsensors, in which the microcontroller is powered on to transmit the ID signals\nand then powered off. This fits the SRAM-based PUF requirement, which needs the\nSRAM to be powered off to read out its random values. The proposed system has\nbeen evaluated on STM32 Cortex M0+ microcontrollers and has been implemented to\nprotect important data on beat sensors.",

To mitigate these privacy risks, differential privacy (DP) has become\na widely adopted technique for safeguarding individual data. Despite its\nadvantages, implementing DP in decentralized min-max optimization poses\nchallenges, as the added noise can hinder convergence, particularly in\nnon-convex scenarios with complex agent interactions in min-max optimization\nproblems.

    "abstract": "Designing and building visual analytics (VA) systems is a complex, iterative\nprocess that requires the seamless integration of data processing, analytics\ncapabilities, and visualization techniques. While prior research has\nextensively examined the social and collaborative aspects of VA system\nauthoring, the practical challenges of developing these systems remain\nunderexplored. As a result, despite the growing number of VA systems, there are\nonly a few structured knowledge bases to guide their design and development. To\ntackle this gap, we propose VA-Blueprint, a methodology and knowledge base that\nsystematically reviews and categorizes the fundamental building blocks of urban\nVA systems, a domain particularly rich and representative due to its intricate\ndata and unique problem sets. Applying this methodology to an initial set of 20\nsystems, we identify and organize their core components into a multi-level\nstructure, forming an initial knowledge base with a structured blueprint for VA\nsystem development. To scale this effort, we leverage a large language model to\nautomate the extraction of these components for other 81 papers (completing a\ncorpus of 101 papers), assessing its effectiveness in scaling knowledge base\nconstruction. We evaluate our method through interviews with experts and a\nquantitative analysis of annotation metrics. Our contributions provide a deeper\nunderstanding of VA systems' composition and establish a practical foundation\nto support more structured, reproducible, and efficient system development.\nVA-Blueprint is available at https://urbantk.org/va-blueprint.",

    "abstract": "The visualization and analysis of street and pedestrian networks are\nimportant to various domain experts, including urban planners, climate\nresearchers, and health experts. This has led to the development of new\ntechniques for street and pedestrian network visualization, expanding how data\ncan be shown and understood more effectively. Despite their increasing\nadoption, there is no established design framework to guide the creation of\nthese visualizations while addressing the diverse requirements of various\ndomains. When exploring a feature of interest, domain experts often need to\ntransform, integrate, and visualize a combination of thematic data (e.g.,\ndemographic, socioeconomic, pollution) and physical data (e.g., zip codes,\nstreet networks), often spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales. This not\nonly complicates the process of visual data exploration and system\nimplementation for developers but also creates significant entry barriers for\nexperts who lack a background in programming. With this in mind, in this paper,\nwe reviewed 45 studies utilizing street-overlaid visualizations to understand\nhow they are used. Through qualitative coding of these visualizations, we\nanalyzed three key aspects of street and pedestrian network visualization\nusage: the analytical purpose they serve, the visualization approaches\nemployed, and the data sources used in their creation. Building on this design\nspace, we introduce StreetWeave, a declarative grammar for designing custom\nvisualizations of multivariate spatial network data across multiple\nresolutions. We demonstrate how StreetWeave can be used to create various\nstreet-overlaid visualizations, enabling effective exploration and analysis of\nspatial data.

This paper introduces ALOPE, an\nadaptive layer-optimization framework designed to enhance LLM-based QE by\nrestructuring Transformer representations through layer-wise adaptation for\nimproved regression-based prediction. Our framework integrates low-rank\nadapters (LoRA) with regression task heads, leveraging selected pre-trained\nTransformer layers for improved cross-lingual alignment. In addition to the\nlayer-specific adaptation, ALOPE introduces two strategies-dynamic weighting,\nwhich adaptively combines representations from multiple layers, and multi-head\nregression, which aggregates regression losses from multiple heads for QE. Our\nframework shows improvements over various existing LLM-based QE approaches.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that intermediate Transformer layers in LLMs\nprovide contextual representations that are more aligned with the cross-lingual\nnature of the QE task.

    "abstract": "Density functional theory (DFT) is a widespread and effective tool in\nelectronic structure calculations for ground-state electron systems. Its\nsuccess has prompted exploration into the use of DFT for non-collective excited\nstates. The delta self-consistent field ($\\Delta$SCF) method allows for the\nextension of DFT to excited-state energies by restricting the Kohn-Sham orbital\noccupations, producing an excited-state electron density, and then computing\nits energy. In this paper, we examine the performance of the LSDA, PBE\ngeneralized-gradient approximation (GGA), and SCAN/r2SCAN meta-GGA for the\nexcitation energies of several important systems. We consider the energies of\natoms with atomic number 1-18. For the hydrogen atom, where we use the exact\nelectron density and have no multiplet splitting, we find significant\nimprovement up the ladder from LSDA to PBE to SCAN. For the uniform gas, we\nfind an effective mass different from the bare mass only with r2SCAN. We split\nthe case of multi-electron atoms into non-aufbau excitations, where the\nhighest-energy electron is excited to the lowest state in the next nl subshell\n(where accuracy is least limited by available basis sets), and spin-flip\nexcitations, where the spin of an electorn is flipped, leading to a\nhigher-energy state of the same nl configuration. We find reasonably accurate\napproximate excitation energies, except for the spin-flip cases where the\nauxiliary non-interacting wavefunction of a non-Hund's-rule spin state is not\nwell-described by a single determinant.",

In addition to total sample comparisons, two subcategories of\nmicro-filaments, GG (linking galaxy groups) and CC (linking galaxy clusters),\nare introduced to further analyze discrepancies between the $\\Lambda$CDM model\nand observation. While $\\Lambda$CDM produces extended macro-filaments, such\nstructures are largely absent in SDSS, and where present, they exhibit higher\ndensities than their simulated counterparts. Micro-filaments also show notable\ndensity discrepancies: at fixed length and thickness, observational filaments\nare significantly denser than those in the simulation. Employing radial density\nprofiles reveal that micro-filaments in the $\\Lambda$CDM simulation exhibit\nhigher contrasts in mass density relative to the background compared to their\nobservational counterparts. Notably, CC type micro-filaments displayed enhanced\ndensity contrasts over GG types in the simulation, while observational data\nshowed the opposite trend.

Prior work has identified positional biases, such as the\nLost in the Middle (LiM) effect, where models perform better when information\nappears at the beginning (primacy bias) or end (recency bias) of the input,\nrather than in the middle. However, long-context studies have not consistently\nreplicated these effects, raising questions about their intensity and the\nconditions under which they manifest. To address this, we conducted a\ncomprehensive analysis using relative rather than absolute input lengths,\ndefined with respect to each model's context window. Our findings reveal that\nthe LiM effect is strongest when inputs occupy up to 50% of a model's context\nwindow. Beyond that, the primacy bias weakens, while recency bias remains\nrelatively stable. This effectively eliminates the LiM effect; instead, we\nobserve a distance-based bias, where model performance is better when relevant\ninformation is closer to the end of the input. Furthermore, our results suggest\nthat successful retrieval is a prerequisite for reasoning in LLMs, and that the\nobserved positional biases in reasoning are largely inherited from retrieval.\nThese insights have implications for long-context tasks, the design of future\nLLM benchmarks, and evaluation methodologies for LLMs handling extended inputs.",

We\nfurther study the effect of a magnetic field on the $s$-wave spin-singlet\nsuperconducting state. In the presence of the field, the magnetic orbital\nsusceptibility becomes nonzero due to a combination of multiorbital and\nretardation effects, while the spin susceptibility remains zero at low\ntemperatures.

Experimental investigation of\nthe kinetics and mechanisms of such processes is, however, hampered by the\nlimited spatiotemporal resolution of existing experimental techniques. While\nmolecular simulations have become indispensable for unraveling the underlying\nprinciples of nanoscale transport, they also suffer from some important\ntechnical limitations. In our previous works, we identified strong\npolarization-induced finite-size effects in molecular dynamics simulations of\nhindered ion transport, caused by spurious long-range interactions between the\ntraversing ion and the periodic replicates of other ions. To rectify these\nartifacts, we introduced the Ideal Conductor/Dielectric Model (\\textsc{Icdm}),\nwhich treats the system as a combination of conductors and dielectrics, and\nconstructs an analytical correction to the translocation free energy profile.\nHere, we investigate some limitations of this model. Firstly, we propose a\ngeneralized approach based on Markov State models that is capable of estimating\ntranslocation timescales in the thermodynamic limit for free energy profiles\nwith multiple comparable barriers. Second, we identify a new category of\npolarization-induced finite-size effects, which significantly alter the spatial\ndistribution of non-traversing ions in smaller systems. These secondary effects\ncannot be corrected by the ICDM model and must be avoided by selecting\nsufficiently large system sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate through multiple\ncase studies that finite-size artifacts can reverse expected trends in ion\ntransport kinetics. Our findings underscore the necessity for careful selection\nof system sizes and the judicious application of the \\textsc{Icdm} model to\nrectify residual finite-size artifacts.",

Each transaction may access at most $k$\nshards, and we denote by $d$ the worst distance between a transaction and its\naccessing (destination) shards (the parameter $d$ is unknown to the shards). To\nhandle different values of $d$, we assume a locality sensitive decomposition of\n$G_s$ into clusters of shards, where every cluster has a leader shard that\nschedules transactions for the cluster. We first examine the simpler case of\nthe stateless model, where leaders are not aware of the current state of the\ntransaction accounts, and we prove a $O(d \\log^2 s \\cdot \\min\\{k, \\sqrt{s}\\})$\ncompetitive ratio for latency.

AURA includes questions across\nsix challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo\nand AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill\nprofiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality.

The forecasting process follows a two-stage approach: first,\nclear-sky irradiance values are predicted using weather variables only (e.g.,\ntemperature, humidity, wind speed); second, actual (cloudy-sky) irradiance\nvalues are forecasted by integrating the predicted clear-sky irradiance with\nweather variables and cloud type.

Models were developed for annual and\nseasonal forecasting, capturing variations between the wet and dry seasons. The\nannual Random Forest model's normalised Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) values\nwere 0.22 for DHI, 0.33 for DNI, and 0.19 for GHI. For seasonal forecasts, wet\nseason nRMSE values were 0.27 for DHI, 0.50 for DNI, and 0.27 for GHI, while\ndry season nRMSE values were 0.15 for DHI, 0.22 for DNI, and 0.12 for GHI. The\npredicted actual irradiance values were combined with solar system\nspecifications (e.g., maximum power (Pmax), open-circuit voltage (Voc),\nshort-circuit current (Isc), and AC power (Pac)) using PVLib Python to estimate\nthe final energy output.

In the\nuniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model,\nwhile the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous\npredictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which\nyields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating\nsignal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore,\nwe find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature\nphononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature\nincreases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value\ncharacteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This\ncrossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above\nwhich the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains\nthe absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing\nopen question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where\nintegrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal\nintricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations,\ndynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic,\nnuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar\nanomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.",

While traditional human driver\nsimulation models offer computational tractability, they do so by abstracting\naway the very complexity that defines human driving. On the other hand, recent\nadvances in infrastructure-mounted camera-based roadway sensing have enabled\nthe extraction of vehicle trajectory data, presenting an opportunity to shift\ntoward generative, agent-based models. Yet, a major bottleneck remains: most\nexisting datasets are either overly sanitized or lack standardization, failing\nto reflect the noisy, imperfect nature of real-world sensing. Unlike data from\nvehicle-mounted sensors-which can mitigate sensing artifacts like occlusion\nthrough overlapping fields of view and sensor fusion-infrastructure-based\nsensors surface a messier, more practical view of challenges that traffic\nengineers encounter. To this end, we present the I-24 MOTION Scenario Dataset\n(I24-MSD)-a standardized, curated dataset designed to preserve a realistic\nlevel of sensor imperfection, embracing these errors as part of the learning\nproblem rather than an obstacle to overcome purely from preprocessing. Drawing\nfrom noise-aware learning strategies in computer vision, we further adapt\nexisting generative models in the autonomous driving community for I24-MSD with\nnoise-aware loss functions. Our results show that such models not only\noutperform traditional baselines in realism but also benefit from explicitly\nengaging with, rather than suppressing, data imperfection. We view I24-MSD as a\nstepping stone toward a new generation of microscopic traffic simulation that\nembraces the real-world challenges and is better aligned with practical needs.",

However, to address the\nchallenge of learning effective features from a sparse reward signal, recent\ntrends have shifted towards adding complex auxiliary objectives or fully\ndecoupling the two processes, often at the cost of increased design complexity.\nThis work proposes an alternative to both decoupling and naive end-to-end\nlearning, arguing that performance can be significantly improved by structuring\nthe interaction between distinct perception and control networks with a\nprincipled, game-theoretic dynamic. We formalize this dynamic by introducing\nthe Stackelberg Coupled Representation and Reinforcement Learning (SCORER)\nframework, which models the interaction between perception and control as a\nStackelberg game. The perception network (leader) strategically learns features\nto benefit the control network (follower), whose own objective is to minimize\nits Bellman error. We approximate the game's equilibrium with a practical\ntwo-timescale algorithm. Applied to standard DQN variants on benchmark tasks,\nSCORER improves sample efficiency and final performance.

The learning bias\nstems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to\nprioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)\nfeature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class\nconsistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model\nresponses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set\ninto subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to\nfilter a purified dataset.

    "abstract": "Hydraulic systems have been one of the most used technologies in many\nindustries due to their reliance on incompressible fluids that facilitate\nenergy and power transfer. Within such systems, hydraulic cylinders are prime\ndevices that convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. Some of the\ngenuine and very common problems related to hydraulic cylinders are leakages.\nLeakage in hydraulic systems can cause a drop in pressure, general\ninefficiency, and even complete failure of such systems. The various ways\nleakage can occur define the major categorization of leakage: internal and\nexternal leakage. External leakage is easily noticeable, while internal\nleakage, which involves fluid movement between pressure chambers, can be harder\nto detect and may gradually impact system performance without obvious signs.\nWhen leakage surpasses acceptable limits, it is classified as a fault or\nfailure. In such cases, leakage is divided into three categories: no leakage,\nlow leakage, and high leakage. It suggests a fault detection algorithm with the\nbasic responsibility of detecting minimum leakage within the Hydraulic system,\nand minimizing detection time is the core idea of this paper. In order to fully\ndevelop this idea, experimental data collection of Hydraulic systems is\nrequired. The collected data uses pressure sensors and other signals that are\nsingle-related. Due to the utilization of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nrecurrent neural networks, more complex data analysis was enabled, which the\nLSTM-based leakage detection algorithm successfully achieved, providing almost\n96% accuracy in classifying leakage types. Results demonstrate that the\nproposed method can perform real-time and online fault diagnosis for each\ncycle, reducing maintenance costs and prolonging the hydraulic system's\nlifespan.",

Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their\nexperimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold\natomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more\nrecently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy\nscales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize\nand investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic\ncorrelations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional\nsuperconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review\npresents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material\nrealization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the\norigin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical\nlattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries.\nObservations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and\ntheoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non\nperturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band\nmaterials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this\nreview aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body\nphenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.",

In the previous paper [1], we discussed\ndelay-induced breathing in a system of swarmalators - a model coupling\nparticles' internal phases to spatial interactions.

It is the aging of a\ntwo-dimensional crystal with defects and inhomogeneous lattice constants, and\ntakes place after the breathing transients subside. We show that aging proceeds\nthrough the gradual elimination of five-fold and seven-fold coordination number\ndefects, which merge pairwise or migrate to the cluster boundary, incrementally\nincreasing the hexatic order parameter in the bulk. Despite this process,\ndefects usually do not fully disappear; some residual number of defects remain\nfrozen in the interior. However, we found that it is possible to achieve a\nnearly total elimination of coordination number defects at sufficiently low\ndelay - when the surface of the cluster develops a sufficeintly thick fluidized\n``boiling layer''. This mechanism of boundary-mediated annealing reveals a\nnon-equilibrium pathway to achieving high crystalline order in the bulk, and\nraises a tantalizing possibility for controlling defects in active matter with\nfree boundaries.",

In this paper, we present\nDeepLight, a novel deep learning architecture for predicting lightning\noccurrences. Existing prediction models face several critical limitations: they\noften struggle to capture the dynamic spatial context and inherent uncertainty\nof lightning events, underutilize key observational data, such as radar\nreflectivity and cloud properties, and rely heavily on Numerical Weather\nPrediction (NWP) systems, which are both computationally expensive and highly\nsensitive to parameter settings. To overcome these challenges, DeepLight\nleverages multi-source meteorological data, including radar reflectivity, cloud\nproperties, and historical lightning occurrences through a dual-encoder\narchitecture. By employing multi-branch convolution techniques, it dynamically\ncaptures spatial correlations across varying extents. Furthermore, its novel\nHazy Loss function explicitly addresses the spatio-temporal uncertainty of\nlightning by penalizing deviations based on proximity to true events, enabling\nthe model to better learn patterns amidst randomness.

The definition of the\ntoughness corresponds to the total energy dissipated after the total fracture\nof the RVE -- which can be accurately obtained thanks to the dissipation\ncontrol -- divided by the RVE transverse area (length in 2D). The proposed\nestimate accounts for both the effect of heterogeneity in toughness and elastic\nresponse on the overall fracture energy and allows as well to account for\nphases with anisotropic elastic and fracture response (fracture by cleavage).\nTo improve toughness predictions, crack-tip enrichment is used to model initial\ncracks. The method is applied to obtain the effective toughness of composites\nand elastic polycrystals in a series of examples. In the two types of\nmaterials, it is found that both heterogeneity in elastic response and fracture\nenergy contribute to increase the effective toughness.

Inevitably, modern\nhardware designed for such tasks and contemporary algorithms are needed in\norder to meet the challenges posed by the stringent, high-frequency data rates.\nIn this work, I present our graph neural network-based pipeline, developed for\ncharged particle track reconstruction at the LHCb experiment at CERN. The\npipeline was implemented end-to-end inside LHCb's first-level trigger, entirely\non GPUs. Its performance was compared against the classical tracking algorithms\ncurrently in production at LHCb. The pipeline was also accelerated on the FPGA\narchitecture, and its performance in terms of power consumption and processing\nspeed was compared against the GPU implementation.",

More\nprecisely, the diffusion is nonlinear and may vanish or become multivalued for\ncertain values of the unknown, so the parabolic equation becomes hyperbolic or\nelliptic, respectively. After performing an Euler implicit time-stepping, a\nsplitting strategy is applied to the time-discrete equations. This leads to a\nformulation that is more suitable for dealing with the degeneracies. Based on\nthis splitting, different iterative linearization strategies are considered,\nnamely the Newton scheme, the L-scheme, and the modified L-scheme. We prove the\nconvergence of the latter two schemes even for the double-degenerate case. In\nthe non-degenerate case, we prove that the scheme is contractive, and the\ncontraction rate is proportional to a non-negative exponent of the time-step\nsize. Moreover, an a posteriori estimator-based adaptive algorithm is developed\nto select the optimal parameters for the M-scheme, which accelerates its\nconvergence. Numerical results are presented, showing that the M- and the\nM-adaptive schemes are more stable than the Newton scheme, as they converge\nirrespective of the mesh. Moreover, the adaptive M-scheme consistently\nout-competes not only the M/L-schemes, but also the Newton scheme showing\nquadratic convergence behavior.",

To\ncomplement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise\nspatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image\nencoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently\nadapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions.

The previously developed\nMultimodal ENSO Forecast (MEF) model uses 80 ensemble predictions by two\nindependent deep learning modules: a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN)\nand a time-series module. In their approach, outputs of the two modules are\ncombined using a weighting strategy wherein one is prioritized over the other\nas a function of global performance. Separate weighting or testing of\nindividual ensemble members did not occur, however, which may have limited the\nmodel to optimize the use of high-performing but spread-out forecasts. In this\nstudy, we propose a better framework that employs graph-based analysis to\ndirectly model similarity between all 80 members of the ensemble. By\nconstructing an undirected graph whose vertices are ensemble outputs and whose\nweights on edges measure similarity (via RMSE and correlation), we identify and\ncluster structurally similar and accurate predictions. From which we obtain an\noptimized subset of 20 members using community detection methods. The final\nprediction is then obtained by averaging this optimized subset. This method\nimproves the forecast skill through noise removal and emphasis on ensemble\ncoherence. Interestingly, our graph-based selection shows robust statistical\ncharacteristics among top performers, offering new ensemble behavior insights.\nIn addition, we observe that while the GNN-based approach does not always\noutperform the baseline MEF under every scenario, it produces more stable and\nconsistent outputs, particularly in compound long-lead situations. The approach\nis model-agnostic too, suggesting that it can be applied directly to other\nforecasting models with gargantuan ensemble outputs, such as statistical,\nphysical, or hybrid models.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI\nagents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing\nagent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after\ndeployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving\nenvironments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution\ntechniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction\ndata and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation\nfor self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation\nmodels with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.\nIn this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for\nself-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified\nconceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of\nself-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components:\nSystem Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a\nfoundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this\nframework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques\nthat target different components of the agent system. We also investigate\ndomain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as\nbiomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are\ntightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated\ndiscussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for\nself-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their\neffectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and\npractitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents,\nlaying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and\nlifelong agentic systems.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural robots have emerged as powerful members in agricultural tasks,\nnevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or untransportable railway\nfor movement, resulting in limited mobility and poor adaptability.\nVision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) enables robots to navigate to the target\ndestinations following natural language instructions, demonstrating strong\nperformance on several domains. However, none of the existing benchmarks or\nmethods is specifically designed for agricultural scenes. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose Agriculture to Agriculture (A2A) benchmark, containing 1,560\nepisodes across six diverse agricultural scenes, in which all realistic RGB\nvideos are captured by front-facing camera on a quadruped robot at a height of\n0.38 meters, aligning with the practical deployment conditions. Meanwhile, we\npropose Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots (AgriVLN)\nbaseline based on Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompted with carefully crafted\ntemplates, which can understand both given instructions and agricultural\nenvironments to generate appropriate low-level actions for robot control. When\nevaluated on A2A, AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles\nwith long instructions, because it often fails to track which part of the\ninstruction is currently being executed. To address this, we further propose\nSubtask List (STL) instruction decomposition module and integrate it into\nAgriVLN, improving Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47. We additionally compare\nAgriVLN with several existing VLN methods, demonstrating the state-of-the-art\nperformance in the agricultural domain.",

This paper presents a modular model for leveraging GAI in developing\nstrategic plans for large scale government organizations and evaluates leading\nmachine learning techniques in their application towards one of the identified\nmodules. Specifically, the performance of BERTopic and Non-negative Matrix\nFactorization (NMF) are evaluated in their ability to use topic modeling to\ngenerate themes representative of Vision Elements within a strategic plan. To\naccomplish this, BERTopic and NMF models are trained using a large volume of\nreports from the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The generated topics\nfrom each model are then scored for similarity against the Vision Elements of a\npublished strategic plan and the results are compared. Our results show that\nthese techniques are capable of generating themes similar to 100% of the\nelements being evaluated against. Further, we conclude that BERTopic performs\nbest in this application with more than half of its correlated topics achieving\na \"medium\" or \"strong\" correlation. A capability of GAI-enabled strategic plan\ndevelopment impacts a multi-billion dollar industry and assists the federal\ngovernment in overcoming regulatory requirements which are crucial to the\npublic good.

However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their\nvulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly\ntransferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,\nwithout accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly\ndegrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a\nunified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is\nguided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant\nknowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each\ntransformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These\nforgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To\ndetect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that\nlearns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling\nreliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist\nadversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention\nlayers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by\nadversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the\nadversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean\nimages. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack\nmethods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level\nforgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization.

In this paper, we introduce LET-US,\na framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive\ncompression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving\ncritical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal\ninferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the\nsubstantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we\nadopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model\nwith the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous\ntemporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided\ncross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering\nand similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.\nMoreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to\ntrain our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM\nembedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse\nset of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization\nand moment retrieval.

This approach is\nfounded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings\ncan enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this\nassumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical\nresearch gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this\npaper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer\nthis question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of\ntext and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and\nindividually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do\nmultimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is\neach individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate\nthe effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality\nknockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant\nvalues or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study,\nwe evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal\nthat: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance -\nparticularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion\nmodels. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion\nschemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality\nalone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most\ncases, whereas the image modality alone does not.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the shadow images of rotating charged black holes in\nKalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, using an accretion disk that is both optically and\ngeometrically thin and located on the equatorial plane as the light source\nmodel. The results show that, compared to Sgr A*, the observational data of\nM87* impose stronger constraints on the charge parameter Q and the\nLorentz-violating parameter G. Under the thin accretion disk model, a larger\nobserver inclination theta_o deforms the inner shadow into a hat-like\nstructure. The parameters (a, Q, G) mainly affect the size of the inner shadow\nand the brightness of the critical curve, where increasing these parameters\nreduces the shadow size and enhances the distinguishability of the critical\ncurve. In the retrograde accretion disk case, the gravitational redshift\nsignificantly reduces the observed brightness of the image. In addition, we\ncompute the distribution of the redshift factor on the projection screen. The\nresults indicate that the Doppler effect induced by large theta_o enhances the\nblueshift in the image, while the light emitted by particles plunging into the\nblack hole leads to strong redshift near the inner shadow. Finally, we study\nthe polarization images under synchrotron radiation and find that the\npolarization intensity P_o reaches its maximum around the lensed image and\nhigher-order images, whereas no polarization vectors appear within the inner\nshadow. This stands in sharp contrast to horizonless compact objects. These\nfindings contribute to a deeper understanding of the shadow properties of\ncharged black holes within Lorentz-violating gravity.",

However, analyzing such data is\ninherently complex and iterative, requiring expertise across multiple domains.\nThe need to manage diverse datasets, distill intricate workflows, and integrate\nvarious analytical methods presents a high barrier to entry, especially for\nresearchers and urban experts who lack proficiency in data management, machine\nlearning, and visualization. Advancements in large language models offer a\npromising solution to lower the barriers to the construction of analytics\nsystems by enabling users to specify intent rather than define precise\ncomputational operations. However, this shift from explicit operations to\nintent-based interaction introduces challenges in ensuring alignment throughout\nthe design and development process. Without proper mechanisms, gaps can emerge\nbetween user intent, system behavior, and analytical outcomes. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Urbanite, a framework for human-AI collaboration in\nurban visual analytics. Urbanite leverages a dataflow-based model that allows\nusers to specify intent at multiple scopes, enabling interactive alignment\nacross the specification, process, and evaluation stages of urban analytics.\nBased on findings from a survey to uncover challenges, Urbanite incorporates\nfeatures to facilitate explainability, multi-resolution definition of tasks\nacross dataflows, nodes, and parameters, while supporting the provenance of\ninteractions.

To address this, we introduce Inversion Tasks for TVG (Invert4TVG),\na novel framework that enhances both localization accuracy and action\nunderstanding without additional data. Our approach leverages three inversion\ntasks derived from existing TVG annotations: (1) Verb Completion, predicting\nmasked action verbs in queries from video segments; (2) Action Recognition,\nidentifying query-described actions; and (3) Video Description, generating\ndescriptions of video segments that explicitly embed query-relevant actions.\nThese tasks, integrated with TVG via a reinforcement learning framework with\nwell-designed reward functions, ensure balanced optimization of localization\nand semantics. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches, achieving a 7.1\\% improvement in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA for a 3B\nmodel compared to Time-R1.

However, whether it constitutes a fundamentally\ndistinct phase or merely a continuous extension of the liquid and gas states\nremains an open question. Here we show that a SCF is defined by sub-short-range\n(SSR) structural order in the spatial arrangement of particles, setting it\napart from the gas (disordered), liquid (short-range ordered), and solid\n(long-range ordered) states. The SSR structural order can be characterized by a\nlength scale effectively quantified by the number of observable peaks in the\nradial distribution function. This length grows from a minimum microscopic\nvalue, on the order of the inter-particle distance at the gas-SCF boundary, to\na diverging value at the SCF-liquid boundary. Based on the emergence of SSR\norder, we demonstrate that the transport and dynamical properties of the SCF\nstate, including the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity\nautocorrelation function, also clearly distinguish it from both the liquid and\ngas states. Theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics\nsimulations of argon and further supported by existing experimental evidence.\nOur study confirms and assigns physical significance to the refined phase\ndiagram of matter in the supercritical region, consisting of three distinct\nstates (gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid) separated by two crossover\nboundaries that follow universal scaling laws.",

Navigation guidance is delivered through an\nembodied AR agent, equipped with voice interaction and locomotion, to enhance\nuser experience. A real-world user study yields a System Usability Scale (SUS)\nscore of 80.5, indicating excellent usability, and comparative evaluations show\nthat the embodied interface can significantly improves users' perception of\nsystem intelligence. These results underscore the importance and potential of\nlanguage-grounded reasoning and embodiment in the design of user-centered AR\nnavigation systems.",

We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results\nshowed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base\nperformance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly\n(52.9% for Meditron-70B).

    "abstract": "The conceptual framework proposed in this paper centers on the development of\na deliberative moral reasoning system - one designed to process complex moral\nsituations by generating, filtering, and weighing normative arguments drawn\nfrom diverse ethical perspectives. While the framework is rooted in Machine\nEthics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by\noutlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action\nunder time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is\nnot constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive\ndeliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled\nmanner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the\nconceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a\nmoral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support\nreal-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative\nreasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to\nenable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the\ndual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through\ntop-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh\ncompeting considerations in context while integrating culturally specific\nnormative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold. By\nextending the notion of moral complexity to include not only conflicting\nbeliefs but also multifactorial dilemmas, multiple stakeholders, and the\nintegration of non-moral considerations, the framework aims to support morally\ngrounded decision-making in realistic, high-stakes contexts.",

Enhancing their seismic resilience requires identifying\nand strengthening vulnerable components in a cost-effective and system-aware\nmanner. However, existing studies often overlook the systemic behavior of power\nnetworks under seismic loading. Common limitations include isolated component\nanalyses that neglect network-wide interdependencies, oversimplified damage\nmodels assuming binary states or damage independence, and the exclusion of\nelectrical operational constraints. These simplifications can result in\ninaccurate risk estimates and inefficient retrofit decisions. This study\nproposes a multi-model probabilistic framework for seismic risk assessment and\nretrofit planning of electric power systems. The approach integrates: (1)\nregional seismic hazard characterization with ground motion prediction and\nspatial correlation models; (2) component-level damage analysis using fragility\nfunctions and multi-state damage-functionality mappings; (3) system-level\ncascading impact evaluation through graph-based island detection and\nconstrained optimal power flow analysis; and (4) retrofit planning via\nheuristic optimization to minimize expected annual functionality loss (EAFL)\nunder budget constraints. Uncertainty is propagated throughout the framework\nusing Monte Carlo simulation. The methodology is demonstrated on the IEEE\n24-bus Reliability Test System, showcasing its ability to capture cascading\nfailures, identify critical components, and generate effective retrofit\nstrategies.

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models\npretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from\nother sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include\nretraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or\neven need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first\nperforms modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,\nrevealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused\nfeatures begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need\nrevisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address\ncross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with\nphysics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a\npatch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel\ninference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key\nadvantages: (1) $\\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly\nenhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\\textit{Low Generalization\nCost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial\ntest inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or\neven hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in\ntackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of\n$512\\times512\\times8$ image within $\\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and\n$4000\\times4000\\times8$ image within $\\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest\nsetting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than\nzero-shot methods.",

Existing research on interoperability predominantly focuses either\non technological interoperability itself or on the legal regulations concerning\ninteroperability, with insufficient exploration of their interdisciplinary\nintersection. This paper compares the technological interoperability in Web 3.0\nwith the theoretical framework of legal interoperability established by the EU\nData Act, analysing the areas of convergence and mismatch. The goal is to align\ntechnical interoperability with legal concepts of interoperability, thereby\nenhancing the practical implementation of systematic interoperability in the\nnext generation of the Web. This study finds that, firstly, Web 3.0's concept\nof interoperability spans data, systems, and applications, while the Data Act\nfocuses solely on data. This narrow scope risks creating a fragmented\necosystem, where data exchange is possible, but full integration of systems and\napplications is hindered, leading to inefficiencies, and obstructing seamless\ndata flow across platforms. Secondly, while Web 3.0 technically seeks to\nachieve interoperability through the integration of entire systems and\ndecentralised applications, the compliance with Data Act might negatively limit\nsuch system and application interoperability through its data interoperability\nprovisions. This paper suggests interdisciplinary recommendations to enhance\nthe implementation and enforcement of interoperability.

Among these,\n2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface\nreconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated\nnormal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale\nand complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete\nbuilding reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided\nGaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building\nmodels for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of\nrelying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings\ninitializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic\n3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the\nplanar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,\nproviding strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural\naccuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits\nreconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian\nprimitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.\nExperiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves\nreconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%.

In CoMoE, we first systematically analyze\nexisting expert aggregation techniques, including expert parameter\nmerging,knowledge distillation,and parameter sharing decomposition, identifying\ntheir limitations in dynamic mobile environments.We then investigate expert\noffloading strategies encompassing expert prediction and prefetching, expert\ncaching and scheduling, and multi-tier storage architectures, revealing the\ninterdependencies between routing decisions and offloading performance.The\nCoMoE incorporates adaptive scheduling mechanisms that respond to user mobility\nand varying network conditions, enabling efficient MoE deployment across\nheterogeneous edge devices. Extensive experiments on real mobile edge testbeds\ndemonstrate that CoMoE achieves approximately 70% reduction in memory usage\ncompared to baseline methods, 10.5% lower inference latency than existing\nexpert offloading techniques, while maintaining model performance stability.\nFor large-scale MoE models (e.g,7.4B-parameter Switch-Base-128), the CoMoE\nreduces memory requirements from 15.6GB to 4.7GB, enabling deployment on\nresource-constrained mobile edge devices that previously could only support\nmuch smaller models.",

Here, we investigate the effect\nof evaporation on the measured surface tension using experiments and numerical\nsimulations.

Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing\nsemantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully\nleveraging its powerful generative prior.

SAIPE extracts rich features\nfrom low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space\nsemantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it\npreserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we\npropose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the\ncompression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the\noptimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process.

These numbers and their limits, as the number of points grows,\nin fact contain some important information about the whole space. In\nparticular, by knowing them, we can determine whether this space can be\nisometrically embedded in the Hilbert space. We show that the limits of these\nnumbers exist almost surely, are nonrandom and the same for all Borel\nprobability measures of full support, and, moreover, are naturally related to\nthe operators defining the multidimensional scaling (MDS) method. We also\nrelate them to the signature of the pseudo-Euclidean space in which the given\nmetric space can be isometrically embedded. In addition, we provide several\nexamples of explicit calculations or just estimates of those limits for sample\nmetric spaces. In particular, for a large class of countable spaces (for\ninstance, containing all graphs with bounded intrinsic metrics), we get that\nthe number of negative eigenvalues increases to infinity as the size of samples\ngrows. However, we are able to provide examples when the number of samples\ngrows to infinity and the numbers of both negative and positive eigenvalues\nincreases to infinity, or the number of positive eigenvalues is bounded (but as\nlarge as desired), and the number of positive ones is fixed. Finally, we\nconsider the example of the universal countable Rado graph.",

To address these issues, this paper proposes an\nefficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)\nand CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian\nmatrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and\nweights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers\nwhile ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we\ndesign an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,\ncombined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment\nand scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory\nfootprint and inference latency. Extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our method on mainstream large models such as the OPT series\nand Mixtral 8*7B: on datasets like Wikitext2 and C4, the inference accuracy of\nthe low-bit quantized model approaches that of the full-precision model, while\nGPU memory usage is reduced by about 60%, and inference latency is\nsignificantly improved.",

    "abstract": "Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding,\nchemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate\nphenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics.\nIdentifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the\nprogress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such\nprocesses. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that\nincorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular\nor incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through\nincreasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it\nprovides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and\nyield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further\nillustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean\ncirculation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results\ndemonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without\nexhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general,\nflexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and\nlongitudinal datasets.",

This approach requires only a few queries for\ntraining, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and\nallowing attacks across various tasks.\n  CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text\nclassification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks\nsubstitute models.\n  In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six\ntasks--spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image\ngeneration--CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100\nqueries.

Traditional path planner, such\nas Artificial Potential Field (APF), offer computational efficiency but suffer\nfrom local minima issue due to position-based potential field functions and\noscillatory motion near the obstacles due to Newtonian mechanics. To address\nthis limitation, an Energy-based Artificial Potential Field (APF) framework is\nproposed in this paper that integrates position and velocity-dependent\npotential functions. E-APF ensures dynamic adaptability and mitigates local\nminima, enabling uninterrupted progression toward the goal. The proposed\nframework integrates E-APF with a hybrid trajectory optimizer that jointly\nminimizes jerk and execution time under velocity and acceleration constraints,\nensuring geometric smoothness and time efficiency. The entire framework is\nvalidated in simulation using the 7-degree-of-freedom Kinova Gen3 robotic\nmanipulator. The results demonstrate collision-free, smooth, time-efficient,\nand oscillation-free trajectory in the presence of obstacles, highlighting the\nefficacy of the combined trajectory optimization and real-time obstacle\navoidance approach.

By applying the Luminescence Intensity Ratio (LIR) method\nto transitions originating from two Stark components of the $^4$S$_{3/2}$\nmanifold of the Er$^{3+}$ ions, we achieve thermal sensitivities up to 1.25 %\nK$^{-1}$ at 100 K and temperature resolutions reaching 0.2 K.

    "abstract": "Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input\nimages in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to\nthe image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and\nunderstand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically\ncapitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection\ninformation, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To\naddress these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image\nCaptioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text\nretrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap\nemploys an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and\nrelation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined\nprompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping\nnetwork is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to\nvisual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and\nvisual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature\nembeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap\nrequires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%\nCIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the \"Karpathy\" test split.

In\nthis paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,\nEvidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware\nreward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the\nmodel to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training\nparadigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To\nsupport this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum\nlearning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a\nhigh-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation\nbenchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments\nacross a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently\nmaintaining strong results on single-page benchmarks.",

While\nAxiom C was dismissed in the past due to its association with modal collapse,\nwe show that the collapse only arises under classical and bivalent assumptions,\nand specifically in the presence of Axiom T. Hence we avoid Axiom T and adopt a\nparacomplete semantic framework, grounded in Weak Kleene logic or Description\nLogic, where undefined propositions coexist with modal assertions. This\nprevents the modal collapse and guarantees a layering to distinguish between\nfactual and conjectural statements. Under this framework we define new modal\nsystems, e.g., KC and KDC, and show that they are complete, decidable, and\nrobust under partial knowledge. Finally, we introduce a dynamic operation,\n$\\mathsf{settle}(\\varphi)$, which formalizes the transition from conjecture to\naccepted fact, capturing the event of the update of a world's cognitive state\nthrough the resolution of uncertainty.",

In this paper, we propose XEmoRAG, a\nnovel framework to enable zero-shot emotion transfer from Chinese to Thai using\na large language model (LLM)-based model, without relying on parallel emotional\ndata. XEmoRAG extracts language-agnostic emotional embeddings from Chinese\nspeech and retrieves emotionally matched Thai utterances from a curated\nemotional database, enabling controllable emotion transfer without explicit\nemotion labels. Additionally, a flow-matching alignment module minimizes pitch\nand duration mismatches, ensuring natural prosody. It also blends Chinese\ntimbre into the Thai synthesis, enhancing rhythmic accuracy and emotional\nexpression, while preserving speaker characteristics and emotional consistency.\nExperimental results show that XEmoRAG synthesizes expressive and natural Thai\nspeech using only Chinese reference audio, without requiring explicit emotion\nlabels.

The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch\ncommunication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances\nboundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under\nboundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding\n79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet\npretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

In 2008, the zero forcing number of a graph was shown to be an\nupper bound on its maximum nullity. In addition, the combinatorial optimization\nproblem for the zero forcing number was shown to be NP-hard. Since then, the\nstudy of zero forcing and its related parameters has received considerable\nattention. In 2018, the forts of a graph were defined as non-empty subsets of\nvertices where no vertex outside the set has exactly one neighbor in the set.\nForts have been used to model zero forcing as an integer program and provide\nlower bounds on the zero forcing number. To date, three integer programming\nmodels have been developed for the zero forcing number of a graph: the\nInfection Model, Time Step Model, and Fort Cover Model. In this article, we\npresent variations of these models for computing the zero forcing number and\nrelated graph parameters, such as the minimum and maximum propagation times,\nthrottling number, and fractional zero forcing number. In addition, we present\nseveral new models for computing the realized propagation time interval, all\nminimal forts of a graph, and the fort number of a graph. We conclude with\nseveral numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our models\nwhen applied to small and medium order graphs.

We show that forward-backward\nrepresentations can also describe conservative finite dimensional deterministic\nsystems when they are coupled to an infinite-dimensional conservative heat\nbath. A novel key observation is that the heat bath acts on the\nfinite-dimensional conservative system by {\\em state-feedback} and can shift\nits eigenvalues to make the system dissipative but may also generate another\ntotally unstable model which naturally evolves backward in time.\n  In the second part, we address the stochastic description of these two\nrepresentations.

The visual imperceptibility,\nrobustness, and embedding capacity of these approaches are all challenges that\nmust be addressed. In this paper, a novel solution to reversible video\nsteganography based on DWT and QR codes is proposed to address these concerns.\nIn order to increase the security level of the suggested method, an enhanced\nElGamal cryptosystem has also been proposed. Prior to the embedding stage, the\nsuggested method uses the modified ElGamal algorithm to encrypt secret QR\ncodes. Concurrently, it applies two-dimensional DWT on the Y-component of each\nvideo frame resulting in LL, LH, HL, and HH sub-bands. Then, the encrypted Low\n(L), Medium (M), Quantile (Q), and High (H) QR codes are embedded into the HL\nsub-band, HH sub-band, U-component, and V-component of video frames,\nrespectively, using the LSB technique. As a consequence of extensive testing of\nthe approach, it was shown to be very secure and highly invisible, as well as\nhighly resistant to attacks from Salt & Pepper, Gaussian, Poisson, and Speckle\nnoises, which has an average SSIM of more than 0.91.

To\nguide the learning process progressively, a dual-channel, three-stage\ncurriculum reinforcement learning (CRL) scheme is further integrated into the\nsystem. The framework was tested across a range of tasks including target\napproach, object grasping, and stable lifting with wall-mounted robotic arms,\ndemonstrating reliable performance throughout. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms baseline\napproaches in both task success rate and energy efficiency.

    "abstract": "Accurate information extraction from specialized texts is a critical\nchallenge, particularly for named entity recognition (NER) in the architecture,\nengineering, and construction (AEC) domain to support automated rule checking\n(ARC). The performance of standard pre-trained models is often constrained by\nthe domain gap, as they struggle to interpret the specialized terminology and\ncomplex relational contexts inherent in AEC texts. Although this issue can be\nmitigated by further pre-training on large, human-curated domain corpora, as\nexemplified by methods like ARCBERT, this approach is both labor-intensive and\ncost-prohibitive. Consequently, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for\nautomated knowledge generation has emerged as a promising alternative. However,\nthe optimal strategy for generating knowledge that can genuinely enhance\nsmaller, efficient models remains an open question. To address this, we propose\nARCE (augmented RoBERTa with contextualized elucidations), a novel approach\nthat systematically explores and optimizes this generation process. ARCE\nemploys an LLM to first generate a corpus of simple, direct explanations, which\nwe term Cote, and then uses this corpus to incrementally pre-train a RoBERTa\nmodel prior to its fine-tuning on the downstream task. Our extensive\nexperiments show that ARCE establishes a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark\nAEC dataset, achieving a Macro-F1 score of 77.20%. This result also reveals a\nkey finding: simple, explanation-based knowledge proves surprisingly more\neffective than complex, role-based rationales for this task.

Yet ASR systems continue to\nstruggle with the inherent variability of human speech, such as accents,\ndialects, and speaking styles, as well as environmental interference, including\nbackground noise. Moreover, domain-specific conversations often employ\nspecialized terminology, which can exacerbate transcription errors.

Because redesigning\nan ASR model is costly and time-consuming, non-intrusive refinement techniques\nthat leave the model's architecture unchanged have become increasingly popular.\nIn this survey, we systematically review current non-intrusive refinement\napproaches and group them into five classes: fusion, re-scoring, correction,\ndistillation, and training adjustment.

We give a step-by-step review of the classical formulation of the\nproblem, where the geometric shape generated by the velocity vectors -- the\nspeed profile indicatrix -- is strongly convex at each point. We derive new\nglobal results for the cases where the indicatrix field is only time-dependent.\nIn such (meso-scale realistic) cases, Zermelo navigation exhibits particularly\nfavorable properties that have not been previously explored, making them\nespecially appealing for both theoretical and numerical investigations.\nMoreover, motivated by real-world phenomena and examples, we obtain novel\nresults for non-convex (or multi-convex) navigation, i.e. when the indicatrices\nfail to be convex. In this new setting -- which is not unlike the corresponding\nFinsler setting for Snell's law -- optimal paths may involve so-called tacking,\nwhich stems from discontinuous shifts of direction of motion. The tacking\nbehaviour thus results in zig-zag trajectories, as observed in time-optimal\nsailboat navigation and surprisingly also in the flight paths of far-ranging\nseabirds.

    "abstract": "Current large speech language models (Speech-LLMs) often exhibit limitations\nin empathetic reasoning, primarily due to the absence of training datasets that\nintegrate both contextual content and paralinguistic cues. In this work, we\npropose two approaches to incorporate contextual paralinguistic information\ninto model training: (1) an explicit method that provides paralinguistic\nmetadata (e.g., emotion annotations) directly to the LLM, and (2) an implicit\nmethod that automatically generates novel training question-answer (QA) pairs\nusing both categorical and dimensional emotion annotations alongside speech\ntranscriptions. Our implicit method boosts performance (LLM-judged) by 38.41%\non a human-annotated QA benchmark, reaching 46.02% when combined with the\nexplicit approach, showing effectiveness in contextual paralinguistic\nunderstanding. We also validate the LLM judge by demonstrating its correlation\nwith classification metrics, providing support for its reliability.",

By varying the Gd\nthickness or inserting a Pt spacer layer between Co and Gd, we control the\nangular momentum transferred from the rare earth sublattice to the transition\nmetal sublattice. Our results show that when Gd is abundant and strongly\ncoupled to Co, angular momentum is efficiently transferred during Gd\ndemagnetization, leading to ultrafast Co reversal. In contrast, reducing the Gd\nthickness or introducing a Pt barrier impedes this transfer, resulting in a\ndomain growth mediated reversal on nanosecond and possibly to microsecond\ntimescales as previously observed in CoDy and CoHo alloys. As a result, in rare\nearth transition metal systems, replacing Gd with heavier rare-earth elements\nsuch as Dy or Ho slows down the switching due to a reduced angular momentum\ntransfer towards Co upon demagnetization as demonstrated in CoGdDy alloys. Our\nfindings establish angular momentum availability and transfer pathways as key\nparameters governing AO HIS dynamics, offering a unified framework for fast and\nslow magnetization reversal across rare earth transition metal systems.",

Compared with\naddressing the corresponding mean field teams problem, the mean field games\nproblem with state coupling presents greater challenges. This is not only\nreflected in the explosive increase in the number of adjoint equations when\napplying variational analysis but also in the need for more Riccati equations\nduring decoupling the high-dimensional forward-backward stochastic differential\nequations system. We take a different set of steps and ingeniously utilize the\ninherent properties of the equations to address this challenge. First, we solve\nan $N$-player games problem within a vast and finite population setting, and\nobtain a set of forward-backward stochastic differential equations by\nvariational analysis. Then, we derive the limiting forward-backward stochastic\ndifferential equations by taking the limit as $N$ approaches infinity and\napplying the law of large numbers. Based on the existence and uniqueness of\nsolutions to backward stochastic differential equations, some variables in the\nequations are identically zero, which significantly reduces the complexity of\nthe analysis. This allows us to introduce just two Riccati equations to\nexplicitly construct decentralized strategies for all participants. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that the constructed decentralized strategies constitute an\n$\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium strategy for the original problem. We also extend\nthe results to the infinite-horizon case and analyze the solvability of\nalgebraic Riccati equations. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to\nillustrate the preceding conclusions.",

Building upon this benchmark, we propose\nDQ-Net, a compact teacher-student framework designed to infer grasp\nconfigurations from limited perceptual cues. During training, the teacher\nnetwork leverages privileged information to holistically model both the static\ngeometric properties and dynamic motion characteristics of the target, and\nintegrates a grasp fusion module to deliver robust guidance for motion\nplanning. Concurrently, we design a lightweight student network that performs\ndual-viewpoint temporal modeling using only the target mask, depth map, and\nproprioceptive state, enabling closed-loop action outputs without reliance on\nprivileged data. Extensive experiments on DQ-Bench demonstrate that DQ-Net\nachieves robust dynamic objects grasping across multiple task settings,\nsubstantially outperforming baseline methods in both success rate and\nresponsiveness.",

    "abstract": "Heuristic negative sampling enhances recommendation performance by selecting\nnegative samples of varying hardness levels from predefined candidate pools to\nguide the model toward learning more accurate decision boundaries. However, our\nempirical and theoretical analyses reveal that unobserved environmental\nconfounders (e.g., exposure or popularity biases) in candidate pools may cause\nheuristic sampling methods to introduce false hard negatives (FHNS). These\nmisleading samples can encourage the model to learn spurious correlations\ninduced by such confounders, ultimately compromising its generalization ability\nunder distribution shifts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method\nnamed Causal Negative Sampling via Diffusion (CNSDiff). By synthesizing\nnegative samples in the latent space via a conditional diffusion process,\nCNSDiff avoids the bias introduced by predefined candidate pools and thus\nreduces the likelihood of generating FHNS. Moreover, it incorporates a causal\nregularization term to explicitly mitigate the influence of environmental\nconfounders during the negative sampling process, leading to robust negatives\nthat promote out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Comprehensive\nexperiments under four representative distribution shift scenarios demonstrate\nthat CNSDiff achieves an average improvement of 13.96% across all evaluation\nmetrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines, verifying its effectiveness and\nrobustness in OOD recommendation tasks.",

To address these issues,\nspeculative inference and processing-in-memory (PIM) techniques have been\nexplored at the algorithmic and hardware levels. However, speculative inference\nresults in more compute-intensive GEMM operations, creating new design\ntrade-offs for existing GEMV-accelerated PIM architectures. Furthermore, there\nexists a significant amount of redundant draft tokens in tree-based speculative\ninference, necessitating efficient token management schemes to minimize energy\nconsumption. In this work, we present LP-Spec, an architecture-dataflow\nco-design leveraging hybrid LPDDR5 performance-enhanced PIM architecture with\ndraft token pruning and dynamic workload scheduling to accelerate LLM\nspeculative inference. A near-data memory controller is proposed to enable data\nreallocation between DRAM and PIM banks. Furthermore, a data allocation unit\nbased on the hardware-aware draft token pruner is developed to minimize energy\nconsumption and fully exploit parallel execution opportunities.

With this operation,\nrecommenders can access and learn the additional world knowledge and reasoning\ninformation via LLMs. However, in general, for different users and items, the\nworld knowledge derived from LLMs suffers from issues of hallucination, content\nredundant, and information homogenization. Directly feeding the generated\nresponse embeddings into the recommendation model can lead to unavoidable\nperformance deterioration. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge\nSelection \\& Exploitation Recommendation (KSER) framework, which effectively\nselect and extracts the high-quality knowledge from LLMs. The framework\nconsists of two key components: a knowledge filtering module and a embedding\nspaces alignment module. In the knowledge filtering module, a Embedding\nSelection Filter Network (ESFNet) is designed to assign adaptive weights to\ndifferent knowledge chunks in different knowledge fields. In the space\nalignment module, an attention-based architecture is proposed to align the\nsemantic embeddings from LLMs with the feature space used to train the\nrecommendation models. In addition, two training\nstrategies--\\textbf{all-parameters training} and \\textbf{extractor-only\ntraining}--are proposed to flexibly adapt to different downstream tasks and\napplication scenarios, where the extractor-only training strategy offers a\nnovel perspective on knowledge-augmented recommendation.

In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform\nto human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually\ndestroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving\nsemantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired\nmultimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net\nutilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within\nimages and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack\nof semantic relationships in the visual information.

It assigns\nweights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and\nimage features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.\nWe also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and\ntext features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,\ninspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder\n(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary\ninformation in manipulated regions without loss.

Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the\nemergence of strong, gapless collective charge fluctuations within the Anderson\ninsulating phase where single-particle excitations are gapped.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due\nto the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.\nExisting methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and\nhigh-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain\ngap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on\nrectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,\nsynthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,\ngiven unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation\nModule (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as\nintermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and\ninvertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the\nrealism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided\nDegradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in\nFourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world\ndegradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,\nproducing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic\nLR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR\nnetworks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in\nreal-world scenarios.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided\nNetwork (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale\nhigh-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive\nbranches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an\nimage restoration branch that performs the core restoration task.

Through joint training, depth features\ncontribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features\nfrom the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation.

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,\nwe further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,\nfocusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating\nhow effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together,\nthese results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and\nillustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL\ncapabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks.",

As\nthe Internet grows, and more users connect, IPv6 is increasingly supported and\navailable to users and servers alike. But despite this steady growth, it\nremains unclear if the information control systems that implement censorship\n(firewalls, deep packet inspection, DNS injection, etc) are as effective with\nIPv6 traffic as they are with IPv4. In this paper, we perform the first global\nmeasurement of DNS censorship on the IPv6 Internet. Leveraging a recent\ntechnique that allows us to discover IPv6-capable open resolvers (along with\ntheir corresponding IPv4 address), we send over 20 million A and AAAA DNS\nrequests to DNS resolvers worldwide, and measure the rate at which they block,\nat the resolver, network, and country level as well examine the characteristics\nof blocked domains. We observe that while nearly all censors support blocking\nIPv6, their policies are inconsistent with and frequently less effective than\ntheir IPv4 censorship infrastructure. Our results suggest that supporting IPv6\ncensorship is not all-or-nothing: many censors support it, but poorly. As a\nresult, these censors may have to expend additional resources to bring IPv6\ncensorship up to parity with IPv4. In the meantime, this affords censorship\ncircumvention researchers a new opportunity to exploit these differences to\nevade detection and blocking.",

The\nresults for 104,187 articles show that Gemma-3-27b-it scores correlate\npositively with an expert research quality score proxy for all 34 Units of\nAssessment (broad fields) from the UK Research Excellence Framework 2021.

Differently from the two\nlarger LLMs, the Gemma-3-27b-it correlations do not increase substantially when\nthe scores are averaged across five repetitions, its scores tend to be lower,\nand its reports are relatively uniform in style. Overall, the results show that\nresearch quality score estimation can be conducted by offline LLMs, so this\ncapability is not an emergent property of the largest LLMs. Moreover, score\nimprovement through repetition is not a universal feature of LLMs. In\nconclusion, although the largest LLMs still have the highest research\nevaluation score estimation capability, smaller ones can also be used for this\ntask, and this can be helpful for cost saving or when secure offline processing\nis needed.",

Extensive experiments on seven real-world\nbenchmarks demonstrate that TALON achieves superior performance across all\ndatasets, with average MSE improvements of up to 11\\% over recent\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Retraining these massive\nmodels is computationally prohibitive, while existing knowledge editing\ntechniques can be slow and may introduce unforeseen side effects. To address\nthis, we propose DySK-Attn, a novel framework that enables LLMs to efficiently\nintegrate real-time knowledge from a dynamic external source. Our approach\nsynergizes an LLM with a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) that can be updated\ninstantaneously. The core of our framework is a sparse knowledge attention\nmechanism, which allows the LLM to perform a coarse-to-fine grained search,\nefficiently identifying and focusing on a small, highly relevant subset of\nfacts from the vast KG. This mechanism avoids the high computational cost of\ndense attention over the entire knowledge base and mitigates noise from\nirrelevant information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on\ntime-sensitive question-answering tasks that DySK-Attn significantly\noutperforms strong baselines, including standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) and model editing techniques, in both factual accuracy for updated\nknowledge and computational efficiency.

The mechanical response of the material is modeled by a\nnonlinear constitutive relationship that algebraically relates stress to\nlinearized strain. This approach serves to mitigate non-physical strain\nsingularities and ensures that the crack-tip strains don't grow, unlike\nsingular stresses. A significant advancement is thus achieved in the\nformulation of boundary value problems (BVPs) for such complex scenarios. The\ngoverning equilibrium equation, derived from the balance of linear momentum and\nthe nonlinear constitutive model, is formulated as a second-order,\nvector-valued, quasilinear elliptic BVP. A classical traction-free boundary\ncondition is imposed on the crack face. The problem is solved using a robust\nnumerical scheme in which a Picard-type linearization is combined with a\ncontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the discretization. Analyses are\nperformed for both an isotropic and a transversely isotropic elastic solid\ncontaining a crack subjected to compressive loads. The primary crack-tip\nvariables**-stress, strain, and strain energy density-**are examined in detail.\nIt is demonstrated that while high concentrations of compressive stress and\nstrain energy density are observed at the crack tip, the growth of strain is\nsubstantially lower than that of stress. These findings are shown to be\nconsistent with the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics, but a\nmore physically meaningful representation of the crack-tip field is provided by\nthe nonlinear approach. A rigorous basis is thus established for investigating\nfundamental processes like crack propagation and damage in anisotropic,\nstrain-limiting solids under various loading conditions, including compression.",

    "abstract": "The rise of Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs), which integrate visual\nand auditory processing with text, necessitates robust safety evaluations to\nmitigate harmful outputs. However, no dedicated benchmarks currently exist for\nOLLMs, and prior benchmarks designed for other LLMs lack the ability to assess\nsafety performance under audio-visual joint inputs or cross-modal safety\nconsistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Omni-SafetyBench, the first\ncomprehensive parallel benchmark for OLLM safety evaluation, featuring 24\nmodality combinations and variations with 972 samples each, including dedicated\naudio-visual harm cases. Considering OLLMs' comprehension challenges with\ncomplex omni-modal inputs and the need for cross-modal consistency evaluation,\nwe propose tailored metrics: a Safety-score based on conditional Attack Success\nRate (C-ASR) and Refusal Rate (C-RR) to account for comprehension failures, and\na Cross-Modal Safety Consistency Score (CMSC-score) to measure consistency\nacross modalities. Evaluating 6 open-source and 4 closed-source OLLMs reveals\ncritical vulnerabilities: (1) no model excels in both overall safety and\nconsistency, with only 3 models achieving over 0.6 in both metrics and top\nperformer scoring around 0.8; (2) safety defenses weaken with complex inputs,\nespecially audio-visual joints; (3) severe weaknesses persist, with some models\nscoring as low as 0.14 on specific modalities. Our benchmark and metrics\nhighlight urgent needs for enhanced OLLM safety, providing a foundation for\nfuture improvements.",

While a recognized paradigm\nframes safe fine-tuning as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing\nuser task performance with safety alignment, we find existing solutions are\ncritically sensitive to the harmful ratio, with defenses degrading sharply as\nharmful ratio increases. We diagnose that this failure stems from conflicting\ngradients, where the user-task update directly undermines the safety objective.\nTo resolve this, we propose SafeGrad, a novel method that employs gradient\nsurgery. When a conflict is detected, SafeGrad nullifies the harmful component\nof the user-task gradient by projecting it onto the orthogonal plane of the\nalignment gradient, allowing the model to learn the user's task without\nsacrificing safety.

    "abstract": "Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in\na video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring\nexpressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic\nstructure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to\nimage-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and\nobject-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event\nattributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges\ntraditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose\nthe Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS\ninto object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization\nphase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which\nare then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to\nexchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR\nextracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into\nhighly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted\ndirected acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose\nTemporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of\neach temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can\nbe interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role\nrelations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark\ndatasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms\nstate-of-the-art RVOS methods.

If the\nassociation with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why\nwas this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New\nphysics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to\nreach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected\nwhen the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical\nmechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz\ninvariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain\nquantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of\nparticle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background,\nand cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the\nphoton time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the\n300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV\nrange. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints\non the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles.\nFirst-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by\nanalyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher\norders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with\n$E_{\\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \\times 10^{-7} E_{\\rm Pl}$ (95.4%\ncredibility level; $E_{\\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all\nthe observed data.",

Second, we feed these forecasts into a regime switch that chooses either\na rough Bergomi or a calibrated Heston simulator, depending on the predicted\nroughness. Third, we accelerate signature-kernel evaluations with Random\nFourier Features (RFF), cutting computational cost while preserving accuracy.\nEmpirical tests on S&P 500 equity-index options reveal that the assumption of\npersistent roughness is frequently violated, particularly during stable market\nregimes when H(t) approaches or exceeds 0.5. The proposed hybrid framework\nprovides a flexible structure that adapts to changing volatility roughness,\nimproving performance over fixed-roughness baselines and reducing duality gaps\nin some regimes.

Equalization is possible with\na single tap filter, and low-complexity equalization makes OFDM an attractive\nphysical layer. However the performance of OFDM degrades with mobility, since\nDoppler spreads introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) between subcarriers\nand they are no longer orthogonal. Zak-transform based orthogonal time\nfrequency space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to be robust to doubly\nselective channels. Zak-OTFS signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD)\ndomain, converted to time domain (TD) for transmission and reception, then\nreturned to the DD domain for processing. The received signal is a\nsuperposition of many attenuated copies since the doubly selective channel\nintroduces delay and Doppler shifts. The received symbols are more difficult to\nequalize since they are subject to interference along both delay and Doppler\naxes. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity method of equalizing\nZak-OTFS in the frequency domain (FD). We derive the FD system model and show\nthat it is unitarily equivalent to the DD system model. We show that the\nchannel matrix in the FD is banded, making it possible to apply conjugate\ngradient methods to reduce the complexity of equalization. We show that\ncomplexity of FD equalization is linear in the dimension of a Zak-OTFS frame.\nFor comparison the complexity of naive MMSE equalization is cubic in the frame\ndimension.

Recent diffusion-based models have\nshown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian\nbehavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic\nmodelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in\nmisinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above\nchallenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction\nframework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.\nShort-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which\ndecouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion\npatterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based\nendpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated\nprobabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.\nFurthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive\nguidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising\naccuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and\nSDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment\nLearning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that\nefficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large\nHVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on\nthree typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape\npattern and multi-person interaction pattern.

It incorporates three specialized\nexperts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on\nboth input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of\nalignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between\nlightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and\ninstance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL\neffectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns\nfrom large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.\nExtensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the DPAL.

This paper examines ASR bias through a\nphilosophical lens, arguing that systematic misrecognition of certain speech\nvarieties constitutes more than a technical limitation -- it represents a form\nof disrespect that compounds historical injustices against marginalized\nlinguistic communities. We distinguish between morally neutral classification\n(discriminate1) and harmful discrimination (discriminate2), demonstrating how\nASR systems can inadvertently transform the former into the latter when they\nconsistently misrecognize non-standard dialects. We identify three unique\nethical dimensions of speech technologies that differentiate ASR bias from\nother algorithmic fairness concerns: the temporal burden placed on speakers of\nnon-standard varieties (\"temporal taxation\"), the disruption of conversational\nflow when systems misrecognize speech, and the fundamental connection between\nspeech patterns and personal/cultural identity. These factors create asymmetric\npower relationships that existing technical fairness metrics fail to capture.\nThe paper analyzes the tension between linguistic standardization and pluralism\nin ASR development, arguing that current approaches often embed and reinforce\nproblematic language ideologies.

The system detects poor posture, including forward lean,\nslouching, hunched shoulders, crossed legs, etc. Some challenges we faced were\nobtaining posture data, transferring data from the Raspberry Pi to the App, and\nsafely storing user data. We used a Flask server to pass data from the\nRaspberry Pi to the mobile application, Firebase to store user data, and the\nFlutter framework to create the app. To test the analysis system viability, we\ndesigned an experiment that tested the system accuracy across several different\nperspectives and postures. The results indicate that the system is able to\neffectively detect poor posture whenever the user\\'s joints are not blocked by\nthe table or their limbs. The results demonstrate the potential for the system\nto be further improved and used on a larger scale for poor posture monitoring.",

    "abstract": "In the literature of pinching-antenna systems, in-waveguide attenuation is\noften neglected to simplify system design and enable more tractable analysis.\nHowever, its effect on overall system performance has received limited\nattention in the existing literature. While a recent study has shown that, in\nline-of-sight (LoS)-dominated environments, the data rate loss incurred by\nomitting in-waveguide attenuation is negligible when the communication area is\nnot excessively large, its effect under more general conditions remains\nunclear. This work extends the analysis to more realistic scenarios involving\narbitrary levels of LoS blockage. We begin by examining a single-user case and\nderive an explicit expression for the average data rate loss caused by\nneglecting in-waveguide attenuation. The results demonstrate that, even for\nlarge service areas, the rate loss remains negligible under typical LoS\nblockage conditions. We then consider a more general multi-user scenario, where\nmultiple pinching antennas, each deployed on a separate waveguide, jointly\nserve multiple users. The objective is to maximize the average sum rate by\njointly optimize antenna positions and transmit beamformers to maximize the\naverage sum rate under probabilistic LoS blockage. To solve the resulting\nstochastic and nonconvex optimization problem, we propose a dynamic sample\naverage approximation (SAA) algorithm. At each iteration, this method replaces\nthe expected objective with an empirical average computed from dynamically\nregenerated random channel realizations, ensuring that the optimization\naccurately reflects the current antenna configuration. Extensive simulation\nresults are provided to the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the substantial\nperformance gains of pinching-antenna systems, particularly in environments\nwith significant LoS blockage.",
