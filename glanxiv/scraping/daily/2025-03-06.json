    "abstract": "The increasing complexity of LLMs presents significant challenges to their\ntransparency and interpretability, necessitating the use of eXplainable AI\n(XAI) techniques to enhance trustworthiness and usability. This study\nintroduces a comprehensive evaluation framework with four novel metrics for\nassessing the effectiveness of five XAI techniques across five LLMs and two\ndownstream tasks. We apply this framework to evaluate several XAI techniques\nLIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and\nAttention Mechanism Visualization (AMV) using the IMDB Movie Reviews and Tweet\nSentiment Extraction datasets. The evaluation focuses on four key metrics:\nHuman-reasoning Agreement (HA), Robustness, Consistency, and Contrastivity. Our\nresults show that LIME consistently achieves high scores across multiple LLMs\nand evaluation metrics, while AMV demonstrates superior Robustness and\nnear-perfect Consistency. LRP excels in Contrastivity, particularly with more\ncomplex models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and\nlimitations of different XAI methods, offering guidance for developing and\nselecting appropriate XAI techniques for LLMs.",

    "abstract": "As question answering (QA) systems advance alongside the rapid evolution of\nfoundation models, the need for robust, adaptable, and large-scale evaluation\nbenchmarks becomes increasingly critical. Traditional QA benchmarks are often\nstatic and publicly available, making them susceptible to data contamination\nand memorization by large language models (LLMs). Consequently, static\nbenchmarks may overestimate model generalization and hinder a reliable\nassessment of real-world performance. In this work, we introduce Dynamic-KGQA,\na scalable framework for generating adaptive QA datasets from knowledge graphs\n(KGs), designed to mitigate memorization risks while maintaining statistical\nconsistency across iterations. Unlike fixed benchmarks, Dynamic-KGQA generates\na new dataset variant on every run while preserving the underlying\ndistribution, enabling fair and reproducible evaluations. Furthermore, our\nframework provides fine-grained control over dataset characteristics,\nsupporting domain-specific and topic-focused QA dataset generation.\nAdditionally, Dynamic-KGQA produces compact, semantically coherent subgraphs\nthat facilitate both training and evaluation of KGQA models, enhancing their\nability to leverage structured knowledge effectively. To align with existing\nevaluation protocols, we also provide static large-scale train/test/validation\nsplits, ensuring comparability with prior methods. By introducing a dynamic,\ncustomizable benchmarking paradigm, Dynamic-KGQA enables a more rigorous and\nadaptable evaluation of QA systems.",

    "abstract": "As a unified theory of sentient behaviour, active inference is formally\nintertwined with multiple normative theories of optimal behaviour.\nSpecifically, we address what we call the subsumption thesis: The claim that\nexpected utility from economics, as an account of agency, is subsumed by active\ninference. To investigate this claim, we present multiple examples that\nchallenge the subsumption thesis. To formally compare these two accounts of\nagency, we analyze the objective functions for MDPs and POMDPs. By imposing\ninformation-theoretic rationality bounds (ITBR) on the expected utility agent,\nwe find that the resultant agency is equivalent to that of active inference in\nMDPs, but slightly different in POMDPs. Rather than being strictly resolved,\nthe subsumption thesis motivates the construction of a formal bridge between\nactive inference and expected utility. This highlights the necessary formal\nassumptions and frameworks to make these disparate accounts of agency\ncommensurable.",

It\ncrystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group like its parent compound,\nAg3LiIr2O6. Our susceptibility measurements reveal an effective moment = 2.6\nmuB, which is higher than the moments of the parent compound and less than that\nof the Ru-analog (Ag3LiRu2O6), suggesting the presence of magnetic Ir4+ (Jeff=\n1/2) and Ru4+ (S=1). Bulk magnetic susceptibility suggests long-range order\n(LRO)at T~20 K, whereas no clear signature is present in the heat capacity.\nLikewise, there is a loss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity around T~20 K as\nexpected at the onset of LRO, but a complete wipe-out is not seen in contrast\nto the result in Ag3LiIr2O6. There is also a T~20 K anomaly in the 7Li NMR\nrelaxation rate and also a fall in the 7Li NMR shift with decreasing\ntemperature. These results suggest LRO at T~20 K in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6. However,\nat low-T below 10 K, we observe a power law variation in magnetic heat capacity\nand spin lattice relaxation rate, temperature-independent-7K, and no further\nloss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity. These results might suggest the\npersistence or stabilisation of a quantum spin liquid-like phase, perhaps from\na fraction of the sample in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6 below 10 K. Our muon spin\nrelaxation measurements suggest ordering around 20 K, consistent with our other\nprobes. It appears that the main effect of Ru-substitution is to shift the LRO\nto a higher temperature in comparison with Ag3LiIr2O6, though there are\nsignatures of a novel phase below about 10 K.",

As a result, balancing locomotion performance\nwith noise constraints is crucial for the successful real-world deployment of\nquadrupedal robots. However, achieving adaptive noise control is challenging\ndue to (a) the trade-off between agility and noise minimization, (b) the need\nfor generalization across diverse deployment conditions, and (c) the difficulty\nof effectively adjusting policies based on noise requirements. We propose\nQuietPaw, a framework incorporating our Conditional Noise-Constrained Policy\n(CNCP), a constrained learning-based algorithm that enables flexible,\nnoise-aware locomotion by conditioning policy behavior on noise-reduction\nlevels. We leverage value representation decomposition in the critics,\ndisentangling state representations from condition-dependent representations\nand this allows a single versatile policy to generalize across noise levels\nwithout retraining while improving the Pareto trade-off between agility and\nnoise reduction. We validate our approach in simulation and the real world,\ndemonstrating that CNCP can effectively balance locomotion performance and\nnoise constraints, achieving continuously adjustable noise reduction.",

As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis\nprocedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron\nemission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural\nmagnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient\nsolution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have\nfacilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD\npathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains\nchallenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a\nresult, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid\npositivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other\nhand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid\npositivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid\npositive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard\ntests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation.

Our work introduced a novel tokenization scheme for\ntetrahedral meshes, incorporating anatomical landmarks generated by a\npre-trained Gaussian process model.

Compared to dense transformers that\nrequire the same amount of floating point operations (FLOPs) per forward pass,\nMoEs benefit from improved sample efficiency at training time and achieve much\nstronger performance. Many closed-source and open-source frontier language\nmodels have thus adopted an MoE architecture. Naturally, practitioners will\nwant to extend the capabilities of these models with large amounts of newly\ncollected data without completely re-training them. Prior work has shown that a\nsimple combination of replay and learning rate re-warming and re-decaying can\nenable the continual pre-training (CPT) of dense decoder-only transformers with\nminimal performance degradation compared to full re-training. In the case of\ndecoder-only MoE transformers, however, it is unclear how the routing algorithm\nwill impact continual pre-training performance: 1) do the MoE transformer's\nrouters exacerbate forgetting relative to a dense model?; 2) do the routers\nmaintain a balanced load on previous distributions after CPT?; 3) are the same\nstrategies applied to dense models sufficient to continually pre-train MoE\nLLMs? In what follows, we conduct a large-scale (>2B parameter switch and\nDeepSeek MoE LLMs trained for 600B tokens) empirical study across four MoE\ntransformers to answer these questions. Our results establish a surprising\nrobustness to distribution shifts for both Sinkhorn-Balanced and\nZ-and-Aux-loss-balanced routing algorithms, even in MoEs continually\npre-trained without replay.

    "abstract": "A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control\n(MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and\nair-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce\nenergy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this\npotential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field\ndemonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world\ndata that support the business case for deployment. Here we review 24 papers\nthat document field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and\n80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as\nexperiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment\nprotocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the\nreviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to\nunreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as\nreliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration,\nare 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these\nsavings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL\nalso requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and\nmaintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss\nrelated challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for\nfuture field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting\ndeployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and\ninstrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside\nother distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as\npeak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid\nreliability services.",

To address this,\nwe propose Reasoning-enhanced Finetuning for interpretable LLM Safety\n(Rational), a novel framework that trains models to engage in explicit safe\nreasoning before response. Fine-tuned models leverage the extensive pretraining\nknowledge in self-generated reasoning to bootstrap their own safety through\nstructured reasoning, internalizing context-sensitive decision-making. Our\nfindings suggest that safety extends beyond refusal, requiring context\nawareness for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive responses.

To address this challenge, we propose a scheme that\nencodes the photonic qubit in the frequency degree-of-freedom.

Moreover, an\nefficient method to minimize all kinds of objective functions is urgently\nneeded, especially the nonsmooth objective function. Therefore, in the current\npaper, we focus on proposing a novel numerical method tailored for\nunconstrained optimization problems whether the objective function is smooth or\nnot. To be specific, based on the variational procedure to refine the gradient\nand Hessian matrix approximations, an efficient quadratic model with $2n$\nconstrained conditions is established. Moreover, to improve the computational\nefficiency, a simplified model with 2 constrained conditions is also proposed,\nwhere the gradient and Hessian matrix can be explicitly updated, and the\ncorresponding boundedness of the remaining $2n-2$ constrained conditions is\nderived. On the other hand, the novel numerical method is summarized, and\napproximation results on derivative information are also analyzed and shown.\nNumerical experiments involving smooth, derivative blasting, and non-smooth\nproblems are tested, demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency. Compared\nwith existing methods, our proposed method can efficiently solve smooth and\nnon-smooth unconstrained optimization problems for the first time, and it is\nvery easy to program the code, indicating that our proposed method not also has\ngreat application prospects, but is also very meaningful to explore practical\ncomplex engineering and scientific problems.",

Quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates\nquantum computing with machine learning, holds immense potential across various\nfields but remains largely unexplored in geosciences. However, its progress is\nhindered by the limitations of current NISQ hardware. To address these\nchallenges, hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) have emerged, combining\nquantum layers within classical neural networks to leverage the strengths of\nboth paradigms. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first\napplication of QML to subsurface imaging through the development of hybrid\nquantum physics-informed neural networks (HQ-PINNs) for seismic inversion. We\napply the HQ-PINN framework to invert pre-stack and post-stack seismic\ndatasets, estimating P- and S-impedances. The proposed HQ-PINN architecture\nfollows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder (HQNN), processes\nseismic data to estimate elastic parameters, while the decoder utilizes these\nparameters to generate the corresponding seismic data based on geophysical\nrelationships. The HQ-PINN model is trained by minimizing the misfit between\nthe input and predicted seismic data generated by the decoder. We\nsystematically evaluate various quantum layer configurations, differentiation\nmethods, and quantum device simulators on the inversion performance, and\ndemonstrate real-world applicability through the individual and simultaneous\ninversion cases of the Sleipner dataset.

    "abstract": "Indexing data is a fundamental problem in computer science. Recently, various\npapers apply machine learning to this problem.\n  For a fixed integer $\\varepsilon$, a \\emph{learned index} is a function $h :\n\\mathcal{U} \\rightarrow [0, n]$ where $\\forall q \\in \\mathcal{U}$, $h(q) \\in\n[\\text{rank}(q) - \\varepsilon, \\text{rank}(q) + \\varepsilon]$. These works use\nmachine learning to compute $h$. Then, they store $S$ in a sorted array $A$ and\naccess $A[\\lfloor h(q) \\rfloor]$ to answer queries in $O(k + \\varepsilon + \\log\n|h|)$ time. Here, $k$ denotes the output size and $|h|$ the complexity of $h$.\nFerragina and Vinciguerra (VLDB 2020) observe that creating a learned index is\na geometric problem. They define the PGM index by restricting $h$ to a\npiecewise linear function and show a linear-time algorithm to compute a PGM\nindex of approximate minimum complexity.\n  Since indexing queries are decomposable, the PGM index may be made dynamic\nthrough the logarithmic method. When allowing deletions, range query times\ndeteriorate to worst-case $O(N + \\sum\\limits_i^{\\lceil \\log n \\rceil }\n(\\varepsilon + \\log |h_i|))$ time (where $N$ is the largest size of $S$ seen so\nfar).\n  This paper offers a combination of theoretical insights and experiments as we\napply techniques from computational geometry to dynamically maintain an\napproximately minimum-complexity learned index $h : \\mathcal{U} \\rightarrow [0,\nn]$ with $O(\\log^2 n)$ update time.\n  We also prove that if we restrict $h$ to lie in a specific subclass of\npiecewise-linear functions, then we can combine $h$ and hash maps to support\nqueries in $O(k + \\varepsilon + \\log |h|)$ time (at the cost of increasing\n$|h|$). We implement our algorithm and compare it to the existing\nimplementation. Our empirical analysis shows that our solution supports more\nefficient range queries in the special case where the update sequence contains\nmany deletions.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory forecasting has become a popular deep learning task due to its\nrelevance for scenario simulation for autonomous driving. Specifically,\ntrajectory forecasting predicts the trajectory of a short-horizon future for\nspecific human drivers in a particular traffic scenario. Robust and accurate\nfuture predictions can enable autonomous driving planners to optimize for\nlow-risk and predictable outcomes for human drivers around them. Although some\nwork has been done to model driving style in planning and personalized\nautonomous polices, a gap exists in explicitly modeling human driving styles\nfor trajectory forecasting of human behavior. Human driving style is most\ncertainly a correlating factor to decision making, especially in edge-case\nscenarios where risk is nontrivial, as justified by the large amount of traffic\npsychology literature on risky driving. So far, the current real-world datasets\nfor trajectory forecasting lack insight on the variety of represented driving\nstyles. While the datasets may represent real-world distributions of driving\nstyles, we posit that fringe driving style types may also be correlated with\nedge-case safety scenarios. In this work, we conduct analyses on existing\nreal-world trajectory datasets for driving and dissect these works from the\nlens of driving styles, which is often intangible and non-standardized.",

These variations in data\ndistribution, known as domain shift, present a significant challenge in\nadapting imaging analysis models for practical healthcare applications.\n  Most current domain adaptation (DA) approaches aim either to align the\ndistributions between the source and target domains or to learn an invariant\nfeature space that generalizes well across all domains. However, both\nstrategies require access to a sufficient number of examples, though not\nnecessarily annotated, from the test domain during training. This limitation\nhinders the widespread deployment of models in clinical settings, where target\ndomain data may only be accessible in real time.\n  In this work, we introduce HyDA, a novel hypernetwork framework that\nleverages domain characteristics rather than suppressing them, enabling dynamic\nadaptation at inference time. Specifically, HyDA learns implicit domain\nrepresentations and uses them to adjust model parameters on-the-fly,\neffectively interpolating to unseen domains. We validate HyDA on two clinically\nrelevant applications - MRI brain age prediction and chest X-ray pathology\nclassification - demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks and\nmodalities.

Split\nFederated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on\nresource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to\nedge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge\nnetworks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream\ntasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL\nscenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings,\nwhich are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for\nparticipation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's\ndistinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and\nfine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel\nPrice-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer\nstrategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for\nefficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient\nglobal SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by\nindependent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence\nbound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance\nimprovements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants.

To address these\nchallenges, energy-efficient hardware and custom accelerators have become\nessential. Additionally, adaptable DNN s are being developed to dynamically\nbalance performance and efficiency. The use of these strategies became more\ncommon to enable sustainable AI deployment. However, these efficiency-focused\ndesigns may also introduce vulnerabilities, as attackers can potentially\nexploit them to increase latency and energy usage by triggering their\nworst-case-performance scenarios. This new type of attack, called\nenergy-latency attacks, has recently gained significant research attention,\nfocusing on the vulnerability of DNN s to this emerging attack paradigm, which\ncan trigger denial-of-service ( DoS) attacks. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive overview of current research on energy-latency attacks,\ncategorizing them using the established taxonomy for traditional adversarial\nattacks. We explore different metrics used to measure the success of these\nattacks and provide an analysis and comparison of existing attack strategies.\nWe also analyze existing defense mechanisms and highlight current challenges\nand potential areas for future research in this developing field.

Future\nspintronic device technology will require scalable film growth of high-quality\nmaterial. We grow epitaxial films of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_y$ (BSTS, $x\n= 0.58, y = 1$) and confirm the gapless band structure with optimal doping\nusing angle-resolved photoelectron spectra. The temperature dependence of\nlongitudinal resistivity shows bulk transport is suppressed as temperature is\ndecreased, and at low temperature surface transport dominates. We evaluate the\nspin transport properties in BSTS without using ferromagnetic tunnel contacts\nvia a non-local resistance experiment as a function of temperature and applied\ncharge current. As expected, these experiments reveal the necessity of\ndecreasing the bulk conduction to best enhance the spin transport.

To solve this problem,\nwe propose an approximately Bayesian deep neural network architecture called\nForeClassNet for time series forecasting and classification. This network\narchitecture forces the network to consider possible future realizations of the\ntime series, by forecasting future time points and their likelihood of\noccurring, before making its final classification decision. To facilitate this,\nwe introduce two novel neural network layers, Welford mean-variance layers and\nBoltzmann convolutional layers. Welford mean-variance layers allow networks to\niteratively update their estimates of the mean and variance for the forecasted\ntime points for each inputted time series to the network through successive\nforward passes, which the model can then consider in combination with a learned\nrepresentation of the observed realizations of the time series for its\nclassification decision.

Recent research highlights the\nimportance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the \"multi-modality\" of\ntrajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However,\nreal-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and\nadapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents,\nreferred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study,\nwe advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key\nrole in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept\nof intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an\nefficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on\ninformation contained in the road agent's trajectory.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly challenged traditional\nepidemiological models due to factors such as delayed diagnosis, asymptomatic\ntransmission, isolation-induced contact changes, and underreported mortality.\nIn response to these complexities, this paper introduces a novel CURNDS model\nprioritizing compartments and transmissions based on contact levels, rather\nthan merely on symptomatic severity or hospitalization status. The framework\nsurpasses conventional uniform mixing and static rate assumptions by\nincorporating adaptive power laws, dynamic transmission rates, and spline-based\nsmoothing techniques. The CURNDS model provides accurate estimates of\nundetected infections and undocumented deaths from COVID-19 data, uncovering\nthe pandemic's true impact. Our analysis challenges the assumption of\nhomogeneous mixing between infected and non-infected individuals in traditional\nepidemiological models. By capturing the nuanced transmission dynamics of\ninfection and confirmation, our model offers new insights into the spread of\ndifferent COVID-19 strains. Overall, CURNDS provides a robust framework for\nunderstanding the complex transmission patterns of highly contagious,\nquarantinable diseases.",

    "abstract": "Individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation is to evaluate the causal\neffects of treatment strategies on some important outcomes, which is a crucial\nproblem in healthcare. Most existing ITE estimation methods are designed for\ncentralized settings. However, in real-world clinical scenarios, the raw data\nare usually not shareable among hospitals due to the potential privacy and\nsecurity risks, which makes the methods not applicable. In this work, we study\nthe ITE estimation task in a federated setting, which allows us to harness the\ndecentralized data from multiple hospitals. Due to the unavoidable confounding\nbias in the collected data, a model directly learned from it would be\ninaccurate. One well-known solution is Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting\n(IPTW), which uses the conditional probability of treatment given the\ncovariates to re-weight each training example. Applying IPTW in a federated\nsetting, however, is non-trivial. We found that even with a well-estimated\nconditional probability, the local model training step using each hospital's\ndata alone would still suffer from confounding bias. To address this, we\npropose FED-IPTW, a novel algorithm to extend IPTW into a federated setting\nthat enforces both global (over all the data) and local (within each hospital)\ndecorrelation between covariates and treatments. We validated our approach on\nthe task of comparing the treatment effects of mechanical ventilation on\nimproving survival probability for patients with breadth difficulties in the\nintensive care unit (ICU). We conducted experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world eICU datasets and the results show that FED-IPTW outperform\nstate-of-the-art methods on all the metrics on factual prediction and ITE\nestimation tasks, paving the way for personalized treatment strategy design in\nmechanical ventilation usage.",

Precise pose estimation is an important task for mobile\nrobots exploring planetary surfaces, as they operate in GPS-denied\nenvironments. Although visual odometry provides accurate localization, it is\ncomputationally expensive and can fail in dim or high-contrast lighting. Wheel\nencoders can also provide odometry estimation, but are prone to slipping on the\nsandy terrain encountered on Mars. Although traditionally a scientific\nsurveying sensor, GPR has been used on Earth for terrain classification and\nlocalization through subsurface feature matching. The Perseverance rover and\nthe upcoming ExoMars rover have GPR sensors already equipped to aid in the\nsearch of water and mineral resources. We propose to leverage GPR to aid in\nMars rover localization. Specifically, we develop a novel GPR-based deep\nlearning model that predicts 1D relative pose translation. We fuse our GPR pose\nprediction method with inertial and wheel encoder data in a filtering framework\nto output rover localization. We perform experiments in a Mars analog\nenvironment and demonstrate that our GPR-based displacement predictions both\noutperform wheel encoders and improve multi-modal filtering estimates in\nhigh-slip environments.

Yet, until recently other quantum geometric\nquantities such as the metric and connection received only little attention due\nto the relatively few effects which have been documented for them. This review\ngives a modern perspective how quantum geometric quantities naturally enter the\nnonlinear responses of quantum materials and demonstrate their deep connection\nwith excitation energy, lifetimes, symmetry, and corresponding physical\nprocesses. The multitude of nonlinear responses can be subdivided into\nnonlinear optical effects, subgap responses, and nonlinear transport phenomena.\nSuch a distinction by energy scales facilitates an intuitive understanding of\nthe underlying electronic transitions, giving rise to a unified picture of the\nelectron motion beyond linear order. The well-known injection and shift\ncurrents constitute the main resonances in the optical regime. Exploiting their\nrespective lifetime and symmetry dependencies, this review elucidates how these\nresonances can be distinguished by a corresponding quantum geometric quantity\nthat shares the same symmetry. This is followed by a brief exposition of the\nrole of quasiparticle lifetimes for nonlinear subgap responses, which presents\na window into the microscopic short-term dynamics as well as the ground state\ncorrelation and localization. We conclude with an account of the anomalous\nmotion due to the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole in nonlinear\ntransport, clarifying the correspondence between physical observables and the\nunderlying mechanisms. This review highlights the close relationship between\nquantum geometry and nonlinear response, showing the way towards promising\nprobes of quantum geometry and enabling novel avenues to characterize complex\nmaterials.",

However, the aspect of internal language learning, where\nlanguage serves not only as a communicative tool with others but also as a\nmeans for individual thinking, self-reflection, and problem-solving remains\nunderexplored. Developing a language through self-play, without another agent's\ninvolvement, poses a unique challenge. It requires an agent to craft symbolic\nrepresentations and train them using direct gradient methods. The challenge\nhere is that if an agent attempts to learn symbolic representations through\nself-play using conventional modeling and techniques such as REINFORCE, the\nsolution will offer no advantage over previous multi-agent approaches. We\nintroduce VQEL, a novel method that incorporates Vector Quantization into the\nagents' architecture, enabling them to autonomously invent and develop discrete\nsymbolic representations in a self-play referential game. Following the\nself-play phase, agents can enhance their language through reinforcement\nlearning and interactions with other agents in the mutual-play phase.

We examine two proposed lunar gravitational-wave\ndetector concepts operating in the sub-hertz band (0.1-1 Hz): the\nGravitational-Wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (a proxy for suspended test\nmass detectors) and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (a proxy for seismic\narray detectors). We estimate that these detectors could reach distances of up\nto $\\sim$1 Gpc for the most massive mergers. We show that lunar detectors could\nobserve up to dozens of massive WD mergers annually, including those\noriginating from globular clusters. Lunar detectors would constrain the masses\nof these WDs with an unprecedented accuracy of one part in a million.\nFurthermore, these detectors would provide early warnings of weeks before\nmerger, including sky-localization of square arcminute resolution, enabling a\nnew era of coordinated multi-messenger follow-up of electromagnetic\ntransients-whether they evolve into Type Ia supernovae or accretion-induced\ncollapse events.",

    "abstract": "Atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a fascinating\nplatform for the exploration of novel physical phenomena arising from their\nreduced dimensionality and exceptional material properties. Their\nsingle-crystalline nature and ultimate miniaturization position them as leading\ncandidates for next-generation spintronic applications. Antiferromagnetic (AF)\nvdW magnets are of particular interest, as they combine the advantages of vdW\nmagnets with the functionality of AF spintronics, offering unique opportunities\nfor ultrafast and robust spintronic devices. However, the lack of approaches to\nlocally and deterministically manipulate their order parameter -- the\nN\\'eel-vector -- remains a key limitation. Here, we introduce a fundamentally\nnew paradigm in nanomagnetism, which we term lateral exchange bias (LEB), to\nachieve N\\'eel vector control in bilayers of the vdW AF CrSBr. We exploit the\nsingle-crystalline registry formed by terraced CrSBr samples, where the bilayer\nN\\'eel vector is controlled by LEB from neighboring, odd-layered flakes, whose\nnonzero magnetization we manipulate using magnetic fields. Using this control,\nwe achieve nonvolatile manipulation of magnetic domains and domain walls (DWs)\nin AF CrSBr bilayers, establishing a powerful toolkit for controlling\natomically thin AFs at the nanoscale. Our results challenge conventional views\non exchange bias and provide a previously unexplored mechanism for achieving\natomic-scale control of AFic order. Our findings pave the way for the\ndevelopment of advanced spintronic architectures and quantum technologies based\non vdW magnets.",

Despite successful applications in research, their commercial use\nis limited. One of the primary reasons for this is the absence of validated\nmodels capable of accurately representing the falling film flow coupled with\ncounter-current gas flow within these probes. For this reason, a test rig has\nbeen developed to facilitate the validation of future models. This test rig\nallows for the replication of flow phenomena appearing within geothermal probes\nunder controlled conditions. The test rig was successfully tested within the\nfirst measurement campaign presented in this paper. Within the framework of\nthis measurement campaign water was used as liquid due to its similar Kapitza\nnumber compared to \\(CO_{2}\\), typically used within geothermal probes, and\nhumid air as gas. For the gas phase, velocity profiles were measured and for\nthe liquid phase high temporal resolution film thickness measurements were\nconducted. Both measurement systems show qualitative comparable results to\nliterature. Additionally, the sampled film thickness data were averaged to\nenable a time-independent interpretation. The investigation of the average film\nthickness in flow direction, without gas flow, revealed an increase in film\nthickness along flow direction for \\(Re_{film}=500\\). In contrast, for\n\\(Re_{film}\\geq 980\\), an opposing trend was observed. Furthermore, the\ninfluence of gas flow on the average film thickness was investigated.

For this work, we utilize data from the Charting Cluster Construction\nwith VUDS and ORELSE Survey (C3VO) along with extensive spectroscopic and\nphotometric datasets available for the COSMOS field, including the HST-Hyperion\nSurvey. To evaluate potential merger and interaction activity, we measure the\nfraction of galaxies with close kinematic companions ($f_{ckc}$) both within\nHyperion and the coeval field by means of a Monte Carlo (MC) methodology\ndeveloped in this work that probabilistically employs our entire combined\nspectroscopic and photometric dataset. We validate our $f_{ckc}$ MC methodology\non a simulated lightcone built from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly\nsemi-analytic model, and we determine correction factors that account for the\nunderlying spectroscopic sampling rate of our dataset. We find that galaxies in\nHyperion have close kinematic companions $\\gtrsim 2\\times$ more than galaxies\nin the field and measure a corrected $f_{ckc}=49_{-7.8}^{+7.4}$% for Hyperion\nand a corrected $f_{ckc}=23_{-1.3}^{+1.2}$% for the surrounding field; a\n$>3\\sigma$ difference. This increase in $f_{ckc}$ indicates an enhancement in\nthe merger and interaction activity within Hyperion and matches the trend seen\nin other structures. The rate of merger and interactions within the field\nimplied from our field $f_{ckc}$ measurement is well aligned with values\nmeasured from other observations in similar redshift ranges.

The properties that\nmake LLMs so valuable for these tasks -- creativity, ability to produce fluent\nspeech, and ability to quickly and effectively abstract information from large\ncorpora -- also present new challenges to evaluating their outputs. The rush to\nmarket has led teams to fall back on quick, cost-effective automatic\nevaluations which offer value, but do not obviate the need for human judgments\nin model training and evaluation. This paper argues that in cases in which end\nusers need to agree with the decisions made by ML models -- e.g. in toxicity\ndetection or extraction of main points for summarization -- models should be\ntrained and evaluated on data that represent the preferences of those users. We\nsupport this argument by explicating the role of human feedback in labeling and\njudgment tasks for model training and evaluation. First, we propose methods for\ndisentangling noise from signal in labeling tasks. Then we show that noise in\nlabeling disagreement can be minimized by adhering to proven methodological\nbest practices, while signal can be maximized to play an integral role in model\ntraining and evaluation tasks. Finally, we illustrate best practices by\nproviding a case study in which two guardrails classifiers are evaluated using\nhuman judgments to align final model behavior to user preferences.

The key novelty of the proposed method lies in its adjustment\nstep, which uses a graph-based algorithm to navigate within the set of optimal\npoints of the convex relaxation while reducing the number of fractional entries\nin the solution.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free\ncontrol approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids\n(MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs),\nloads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked\nsystem where the DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a\nstatic interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the\ninputs, outputs, and disturbances of DGs and lines are connected in a DC MG.\nEach DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller. To design\nthe controllers, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and\nformulate a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility\nof this problem, we identify a set of necessary local and global conditions to\nenforce in a specifically developed LMI-based local controller design process.\nIn contrast to existing DC MG control solutions, our approach proposes a\nunified framework for co-designing the distributed controller and communication\ntopology. As the co-design process is LMI-based, it can be efficiently\nimplemented and evaluated using existing convex optimization tools. The\neffectiveness of the proposed solution is verified by simulating an islanded DC\nMG in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under different scenarios, such as load\nchanges and topological constraint changes, and then comparing the performance\nwith the droop control algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich\nchannels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate\nabundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through\nbremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called\n`secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at\nhigh-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of\nupcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate\nthe sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for\ndefiniteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the\npotential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently\nunconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV\ntelescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range,\nor GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided\nby their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and\nmethodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma\nray experiments.",

We present an analysis\nof the impact of geometric effects and scattering within dusty media on\nrecovered galaxy dust properties. We use SKIRT, a radiative transfer code, to\nsimulate observations of point sources embedded in dust clouds, as well as\nspiral and elliptical galaxies. We examine various galaxy morphologies,\ninclinations, and instrument apertures. We find that in galaxies the scattering\nof light into the line of sight and the presence of sources at different depths\nwithin the galaxy make attenuation fundamentally different from extinction. For\na medium with intrinsic extinction slope Rv=3.068, we recover effective\nattenuation slopes Rv_e ranging from 0.5 to 7, showing that the two quantities\nare not analogous, even for local resolved observations. We find that Rv_e\ngreatly depends on dust density, galaxy morphology, and inclination, the latter\nbeing the most significant. A single simulated galaxy, viewed from different\nangles, can reproduce the well-known relation between attenuation strength Av_e\nand Rv_e observed for star-forming galaxy samples. An increase in dust density\nleads to higher Rv_e across all inclinations, which, assuming a correlation\nbetween stellar mass and dust density, explains the increase in Rv_e with mass\nobserved in star-forming galaxies. However, we are unable to explain the\ndifferences in Rv_e between star-forming and quiescent high-mass galaxies. We\nconclude that highly attenuated regions of simulated face-on galaxies yield\nRv_e within 10% of the intrinsic extinction slope of the medium, allowing for\nthe distinction of different dust types. For edge-on spirals, however, the\nmedian Rv_e for low Av_e regions appears to better approximate the extinction\nslope.",

Our measurements account for possible observational and modeling\nuncertainties stemming mainly from the finite signal-to-noise ratio of the\nobserved data and thermal parameter uncertainties. We find significant\nevolution, with the best-fit $\\langle \\Gamma_{\\rm HeII} \\rangle$ and\n$\\lambda_{\\rm mfp, HeII}$ decreasing by factors of $\\sim 4.32$ and $ \\sim\n3.27$, respectively, from $z = 2.88$ to $z = 3.16$. Based on these\nmeasurements, we constrain the emissivity at the HeII ionization frequency\n($\\epsilon_{228}$) and HeII ionizing photon emission rate ($\\dot{n}$), finding\nconsistency with results from galaxy and QSO surveys. Comparison of our\nmeasured parameters with widely used uniform UVB models supports a scenario\nwhere HeII reionization is not completed before $z\\sim2.74$. Our measured\nevolution is complementary and in good agreement with recent measurements of\nthermal parameters of the IGM, suggesting a coherent picture of rather late and\nrapid HeII reionization.",

Our analysis reveals that galaxy size growth is\ntightly coupled to bursty star formation. Galaxies above the star-forming main\nsequence experience rapid central compaction during starbursts, followed by\ninside-out quenching and spatially extended star formation that leads to\nexpansion, causing oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably,\nwe find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent\nwith observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute\nthis discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase\ninterstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective\nequation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also\nfind that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power\nlaw as a function of redshift, with a break at $z\\approx6$, because the\nmajority of galaxies at $z > 6$ show rising star-formation histories, and\ntherefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that H$\\alpha$ emission is\nsystematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7,\nconsistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous\ninterpretations that link extended H$\\alpha$ sizes to inside-out growth, we\nfind that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from\nH$\\alpha$. Instead, a simple Str\\\"{o}mgren sphere argument reproduces observed\ntrends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the\nprimary driver of extended nebular emission.",

We introduce a framework to extract the collision operator\nof an arbitrary metal by combining resistivity and sound attenuation\nmeasurements with a realistic calculation of the scattering operator that\nincludes multiband and Umklapp effects.

By convolving\nanalytic halo mass accretion histories (MAHs) with models for\n$M_{\\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, we predict that halos with peak virial masses below\n$\\sim 10^8~M_{\\mathrm{\\odot}}$ can form stars before reionization through ${\\rm\nH_2}$ cooling.

When performing indirect detection\nof dark matter in objects other than the Milky Way, one should take into\naccount the contribution from Milky Way dark matter. As a result, the dark\nmatter signal observed by a detector is predicted to exhibit a two-peak\nstructure in many targets, owing to the Doppler shift, differences in radial\nvelocities and the good energy resolution. An analysis incorporating this\ntwo-peak effect was performed using the latest XRISM observation data of the\nCentaurus galaxy cluster~\\cite{XRISM:2025axf}.

By accounting for the limited\nflexibility of fully charged and discharged EVs, the eSSM more accurately\ncaptures the state transition dynamics of EVs in various states of charge\n(SOC). Comprehensive simulations show that the eSSM will provide more accurate\npredictions of the flexibility and power trajectories of aggregated EVs, and\nmore effectively tracks real-time power references compared to the conventional\nSSM method.",

We\nfurther explore the cross-correlations between price volatility and the\nmeteorological variables followed by a Granger-causal test to analyze the\ncausal effect of meteorological variables on the volatility. The Seasonal\nAuto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX)\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented as simple machine\nlearning models of price volatility with meteorological factors as exogenous\nvariables. Finally, to capture spatial dependencies in volatility across\ndistricts, we extend the analysis using a Conditional Autoregressive (CAR)\nmodel to construct monthly volatility surfaces that reflect both local price\nrisk as well as geographic dependence. We believe, this paper will illustrate\nthe usefulness of simple machine learning models in agricultural finance, and\nhelp the farmers to make informed decisions by considering climate patterns and\nmaking beneficial decisions with regard to crop rotation or allocations. In\ngeneral, incorporating meteorological factors to assess agricultural\nperformance could help to understand and reduce price volatility and possibly\nlead to economic stability.",

We consider a spherical, relativistically\nexpanding shell that radiates thermally at a single temperature in its own rest\nframe. Due to relativistic effects, including Doppler boosting, time delay, and\ntemperature evolution -- the observed temperature is smeared across different\npolar angles by approximately $\\sim10\\%$. While the observed spectrum remains\nroughly consistent with a single-temperature blackbody, neglecting relativistic\neffects leads to significant systematic inaccuracies: the inferred photospheric\nvelocity and temperature are overestimated by up to $\\sim50\\%$ for mildly\nrelativistic velocities. By applying our analytic corrections, these deviations\nare reduced to within $10\\%$, even in cases where the photosphere is receding\nand cooling is considered.

First, a non-canonical\nHamiltonian (Poisson) formulation is introduced by including the dynamics of\nthe stress tensor. This framework is developed for von-K\\'arm\\'an\nnonlinearities in beams and plates, as well as geometrically nonlinear\nelasticity with Saint-Venant material behavior. In the case of plates, both\nnegligible and non-negligible membrane inertia are considered. For the former\ncase the two-dimensional elasticity complex is leveraged to express the\ndynamics in terms of the Airy stress function. The finite element\ndiscretization employs a mixed approach, combining a conforming approximation\nfor displacement and velocity fields with a discontinuous stress tensor\nrepresentation. A staggered, linear implicit time integration scheme is\nproposed, establishing connections with existing explicit-implicit\nenergy-preserving methods. The stress degrees of freedom are statically\ncondensed, reducing the computational complexity to solving a system with a\npositive definite matrix. The integration strategy preserves energy and angular\nmomentum exactly. The methodology is validated through numerical experiments on\nthe Duffing oscillator, a von-K\\'arm\\'an beam, and a column undergoing finite\ndeformations. Comparisons with fully implicit energy-preserving method and the\nleapfrog scheme demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior\naccuracy while maintaining energy stability.

High-fidelity computational models are\noften employed to simulate plume dynamics, guiding decision-making and\nprioritizing resource deployment. However, such models can be prohibitively\nexpensive to simulate, as they require resolving turbulent flows at fine\nspatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, there are at least two distinct\ndynamical regimes of interest in the plume: (i) the initial ejection of the\nplume where turbulent mixing is generated by the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability, and (ii) the ensuing turbulent diffusion and advection which is\noften modeled by the Gaussian plume model.

In contrast to previous social-climate models that\ndiscretized opinions, we assumed opinions on climate change form a continuum,\nand were thereby able to capture more nuanced interactions. The model shows\nthat resistance to behaviour change, elevated mitigation costs, and slow\nresponse to climate events can result in a global temperature anomaly in excess\nof 2{\\deg}C. However, this outcome could be avoided by lowering mitigation\ncosts and increasing the rate of interactions between individuals with\ndiffering opinions (social learning).

It also indicates that\neven with polarized opinion, an average pro-mitigative opinion in the\npopulation can reduce emissions. Finally, our model underscores how frequent\nand unexpected social or environmental changes, such as policy changes or\nextreme weather events, can slow climate change mitigation.

To address this,\nprior research has explored strategies for Class Incremental Learning (CIL) in\nContinual Learning for Object Detection (CLOD), with most approaches focusing\non two-stage object detectors. However, existing work suggests that Learning\nwithout Forgetting (LwF) may be ineffective for one-stage anchor-free detectors\nlike YOLO due to noisy regression outputs, which risk transferring corrupted\nknowledge. In this work, we introduce YOLO LwF, a self-distillation approach\ntailored for YOLO-based continual object detection. We demonstrate that when\ncoupled with a replay memory, YOLO LwF significantly mitigates forgetting.\nCompared to previous approaches, it achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nimproving mAP by +2.1% and +2.9% on the VOC and COCO benchmarks, respectively.",

To address this problem,\nwe ask the following question: Can we improve the robustness by training on\nsynthetic data, spanning all possible attribute combinations? We first show\nthat training of conditional diffusion models on limited data lead to incorrect\nunderlying distribution. Therefore, synthetic data sampled from such models\nwill result in unfaithful samples and does not lead to improve performance of\ndownstream machine learning systems.

In this paper, we demonstrate that ODE filters, despite their\nprobabilistic nature, do not automatically solve this uncertainty propagation\nproblem. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that combines\nODE filters with numerical quadrature to properly marginalize over uncertain\nparameters, while accounting for both parameter uncertainty and numerical\nsolver uncertainty. Experiments across multiple dynamical systems demonstrate\nthat the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match reference solutions.\nNotably, we show how the numerical uncertainty from the ODE solver can help\nprevent overconfidence in the propagated uncertainty estimates, especially when\nusing larger step sizes.

In particular, angular ambiguity\nis resolved by showing an important fact that the three types of estimated\nangles (i.e., far-field, near-field, and ambiguous angles) exhibit\nsignificantly different patterns in the range-domain MUSIC spectrum.\nFurthermore, to characterize the estimation error lower-bound, we obtain a\nmatrix closed-form Cram\\'er-Rao bounds for mixed-field target localization.\nFinally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmixed-field localization method, which improves target-classification accuracy\nand achieves a lower root mean square error than various benchmark schemes.",

The Feature Retriever then incorporates knowledge on user\nsatisfaction from Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieves relevance features\nfrom utterances. Finally, the Score Analyzer evaluates strategy predictions and\nclassifies user satisfaction. Experimental results demonstrate that PRAISE\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks for the USE task.\nBeyond its superior performance, PRAISE offers additional benefits. It enhances\ninterpretability by providing instance-level explanations through effective\nalignment of utterances with strategies. Moreover, PRAISE operates more\nefficiently than existing approaches by eliminating the need for LLMs during\nthe inference phase.",

We further\ngeneralize this framework to circuits with time-varying two-qubit gates. The\nspatial arrangement of gates in the integrable circuits considered herein can\nbreak the space-reflection symmetry even when $U$ itself is symmetric. By\nanalyzing the dynamical spin susceptibility on ballistic hydrodynamic scale, we\ninvestigate how an asymmetric arrangement of gates affects the spin transport.\nWhile it induces nonzero higher odd moments in the dynamical spin\nsusceptibility, the first moment, which corresponds to a drift in the spreading\nof correlations, remains zero. We explain this within a quasiparticle picture\nwhich suggests that a nonzero drift necessitates gates acting on distinct\ndegrees of freedom.",

Our methodology\ninvolves applying an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality\nreduction and clustering, known as Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to Gaia BP/RP\n(XP) spectra. This strategy allows us to naturally separate WDMS binaries from\nsingle WDs from the detection of subtle red flux excesses in the XP spectra\nthat are indicative of low-mass MS companions. We validate our approach using\nconfirmed WDMS binaries from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, achieving a precision\nof $\\sim 90\\%$. We demonstrated that the luminosity of the faint companions in\nthe missed systems is $\\sim 50$ times lower than that of their WD primaries.\nApplying our SOM to 90,667 sources, we identify 993 WDMS candidates, 506 of\nwhich have not been previously reported in the literature. If confirmed, our\nsample will increase the known WDMS binaries by $20\\%$. Additionally, we use\nthe Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (VOSA) tool to\nrefine and parameterize a ``golden sample'' of 136 WDMS binaries through\nmulti-wavelength photometry and a two-body Spectral Energy Distribution\nfitting. These high-confidence WDMS binaries are composed by low-mass WDs\n($\\sim 0.42 M_{\\odot}$), with cool MS companions ($\\sim 2800$ K).

    "abstract": "This work aims to understand the recent experimental data from the STAR\ncollaboration on the system size dependence of directed flow splitting between\noppositely charged hadrons [arXiv:2412.18326]. Previously, we have studied the\nrole of baryon inhomogeneity on charge dependent directed flow. We now\nincorporate the effects of the electromagnetic (EM) field albeit\nperturbatively, as implemented in Ref. [arXiv:1806.05288]. This enables us to\ncompare the relative contributions between baryon inhomogeneity and EM field on\ncharge dependent directed flow. Our model calculation describes the\nexperimental data on the centrality and system size dependence of the\nmid-rapidity directed flow slope splitting, $\\Delta dv_1/dy$, between protons\nand anti-protons. Our results indicate that in central collisions, where the EM\nfield strength is negligible, the inclusion of EM field effects does not\ninfluence the splitting between protons and anti-protons. This suggests that\nthe observed system size dependence of $\\Delta dv_1/dy (p-\\bar{p})$ in central\ncollisions arises solely from enhanced baryon stopping in larger collision\nsystems. However, in semi-central and peripheral collisions, both baryon\ndiffusion and EM field effects contribute to the splitting. Furthermore, the\ncentrality dependence of $\\Delta dv_1/dy (p-\\bar{p})$ is highly sensitive to\nthe electrical conductivity of the medium, making it a potential probe for\nextracting this transport coefficient in the QCD medium through model-to-data\ncomparisons. However, achieving this requires a precise determination of the\nbackground baseline originating from baryon diffusion. Additionally, further\ninvestigation is needed to understand $\\Delta dv_1/dy$ for oppositely charged\nkaons and pions, particularly by incorporating the diffusion of other conserved\ncharges.",

Here we introduce an approach to predict heteropolymer phase\nseparation from two-chain simulations by analyzing contact maps, which capture\nhow often specific monomers from the two chains are in physical proximity.\nWhereas B22 summarizes the overall attraction between two chains, contact maps\npreserve spatial information about their interactions. To compare these\nmetrics, we train phase-separation classifiers for both a minimal heteropolymer\nmodel and a chemically specific, residue-level IDP model. Remarkably, simple\nstatistical properties of two-chain contact maps predict phase separation with\nhigh accuracy, vastly outperforming classifiers based on Rg and B22 alone. Our\nresults thus establish a transferable and computationally efficient method to\nuncover key driving forces of IDP phase behavior based on their physical\ninteractions in dilute solution.",

While DPO has\nenabled significant progress in aligning English LLMs, multilingual preference\nalignment is hampered by data scarcity. To address this, we propose a novel\napproach that $\\textit{captures}$ learned preferences from well-aligned English\nmodels by implicit rewards and $\\textit{transfers}$ them to other languages\nthrough iterative training. Specifically, we derive an implicit reward model\nfrom the logits of an English DPO-aligned model and its corresponding reference\nmodel. This reward model is then leveraged to annotate preference relations in\ncross-lingual instruction-following pairs, using English instructions to\nevaluate multilingual responses. The annotated data is subsequently used for\nmultilingual DPO fine-tuning, facilitating preference knowledge transfer from\nEnglish to other languages. Fine-tuning Llama3 for two iterations resulted in a\n12.72% average improvement in Win Rate and a 5.97% increase in Length Control\nWin Rate across all training languages on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard. Our\nfindings demonstrate that leveraging existing English-aligned models can enable\nefficient and effective multilingual preference alignment, significantly\nreducing the need for extensive multilingual preference data.

Counterintuitively, these simulators can be dramatically\nfaster than the original algorithm in getting alg to perform a single\nsuccessful run, and this is done without any knowledge about alg, its running\ntime distribution, etc.\n  For example, consider an algorithm that randomly picks some integer $t$\naccording to some distribution over the integers, and runs for $t$ seconds.\nthen with probability $1/2$ it stops, or else runs forever (i.e., a\ncatastrophe). The simulators described here, for this case, all terminate in\nconstant expected time, with exponentially decaying distribution on the running\ntime of the simulation.\n  Luby et al. studied this problem before -- and our main contribution is in\noffering several additional simulation strategies to the one they describe. In\nparticular, one of our (optimal) simulation strategies is strikingly simple:\nRandomly pick an integer $t>0$ with probability $c/t^2$ (with $c= 6/\\pi^2$).\nRun the algorithm for $t$ seconds.

    "abstract": "Blazars are interesting source candidates for astrophysical neutrino\nemission. Multi-messenger lepto-hadronic models based on proton-photon\n(p-gamma) interactions result in predictions for the neutrino spectra which are\ntypically strongly peaked at high energies. In contrast, statistical analyses\nlooking to associate blazars and neutrinos often assume a power-law spectral\nshape, putting the emphasis at lower energies. We aim to examine the impact of\nsuch spectral modelling assumptions on the associations of neutrinos with\nblazars. We use hierarchical_nu, a Bayesian framework for point source\nsearches, and incorporate the theoretical predictions for neutrino spectra\nthrough a dedicated spectral model and priors on the relevant parameters. Our\nspectral model is based on the predictions presented in Rodrigues et al. (2024)\nfor a selection of intermediate and high synchrotron peaked blazars that have\nbeen connected with IceCube neutrino alert events. We apply our model to the 10\nyears of publicly available IceCube data, focusing on the Northern hemisphere.\nOut of 29 source candidates, we find five sources, including TXS 0506+056, that\nhave an association probability greater than 0.5 to at least one event. The\np-gamma spectra typically lead to a lower overall number of associated events\ncompared to the power-law case, but retain or even enhance strong associations\nto high-energy events. Our results demonstrate that including more information\nfrom theoretical predictions can allow for more interpretable source-neutrino\nconnections.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the random vector functional link (RVFL) network has gained\nsignificant popularity in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification due to its\nsimplicity, speed, and strong generalization performance. However, despite\nthese advantages, RVFL models face several limitations, particularly in\nhandling non-linear relationships and complex data structures. The random\ninitialization of input-to-hidden weights can lead to instability, and the\nmodel struggles with determining the optimal number of hidden nodes, affecting\nits performance on more challenging datasets. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel randomized based restricted kernel machine ($R^2KM$) model that\ncombines the strehyperngths of RVFL and restricted kernel machines (RKM).\n$R^2KM$ introduces a layered structure that represents kernel methods using\nboth visible and hidden variables, analogous to the energy function in\nrestricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). This structure enables $R^2KM$ to capture\ncomplex data interactions and non-linear relationships more effectively,\nimproving both interpretability and model robustness. A key contribution of\n$R^2KM$ is the introduction of a novel conjugate feature duality based on the\nFenchel-Young inequality, which expresses the problem in terms of conjugate\ndual variables and provides an upper bound on the objective function. This\nduality enhances the model's flexibility and scalability, offering a more\nefficient and flexible solution for complex data analysis tasks. Extensive\nexperiments on hyperspectral image datasets and real-world data from the UCI\nand KEEL repositories show that $R^2KM$ outperforms baseline models,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in classification and regression tasks.",

The combined\nstructural and electronic studies reveal the formation of an edge-sharing\nequilateral triangular lattice of Sm$^{3+}$ ions in $ab$ plane. The DC, AC\nmagnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements reveal that\n$\\text{SmTa}_7\\text{O}_{19}$ does not exhibit any long-range magnetic ordering\ntransition down to 50 mK. The zero-field (ZF)-$\\mu$SR study strongly refutes\nthe long-range magnetically ordered ground state and/or any partial\nspin-freezing down to at least 30 mK. The ZF-muon-spin relaxation rate is\nweakly temperature dependent between 50 and 20 K, rapidly increases below\n$\\sim$20 K and saturates at low temperatures between 2 K and 30 mK, which has\nbeen attributed to a characteristic signature of QSL systems. Further, our\nlongitudinal-field (LF)-$\\mu$SR measurements at 0.1 K reveal a dynamic nature\nof the magnetic ground state.

The method combines K-Nearest\nNeighbor Particle Tracking Velocimetry (KNN-PTV, Tirelli et al. 2023) with\nmeshless Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (meshless POD, Tirelli et al. 2025)\nand constrained Radial Basis Function regression (c-RBFs, Sperotto et al.\n2022). The main idea is to use KNN-PTV to enhance the spatial resolution of\nflow fields by blending data from \\textit{locally similar} flow regions\navailable in the time series. This \\textit{similarity} is assessed in terms of\nstatistical coherency with leading features, identified by meshless POD\ndirectly on the scattered data without the need to first interpolate onto a\ngrid, but instead relying on RBFs to compute all the relevant inner products.\nLastly, the proposed approach uses the c-RBF on the denser scattered\ndistributions to derive an analytical representation of the flow fields that\nincorporates physical constraints. This combination is meshless because it does\nnot require the definition of a grid at any step of the calculation, thus\nproviding flexibility in handling complex geometries. The algorithm is\nvalidated on 3D measurements of a jet flow in air. The assessment covers three\nkey aspects: statistics, spectra, and modal analysis.

    "abstract": "We develop the tools to bound extreme roots of multivariate real zero\npolynomials globally. This is done through the use of a relaxation that\napproximates their rigidly convex sets. This relaxation can easily be\nconstructed using the degree $3$ truncation of the polynomial and it produces\nin this way a spectrahedron whose computation is relatively easy and whose size\nis relatively small and depending solely on the number of variables of the\npolynomial. As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general\nspectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build\nmatrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several\nconstructions that could increase the size of these matrices. These\nconstructions are based principally in two main approaches: adding information\nabout higher degree monomials or non-trivially increasing the number of\nvariables of the original polynomial. We explore these two construction first\nin a general setting and see that it is necessary to particularize to certain\nfamilies of polynomials in order to make them work. In particular, we are able\nto prove that increasing the number of variables improves the behavior of the\nrelaxation along the diagonal in the case of Eulerian polynomials. We see that\napplying the relaxation to multivariate Eulerian polynomials and then looking\nat the univariate polynomials injected in their diagonals produces an\nexponential asymptotic improvement in the bounds provided. We compare these\nbounds with other bounds that have appeared previously in the literature and\nrefine these previous bounds in order to study how close do the bounds provided\nby the relaxation are to the actual roots of the univariate Eulerian\npolynomials.",

In both instances,\nthe multistage economic MPC effectively manages uncertain demands by preventing\nconstraint violations and guides the network to its optimal cyclic operating\nconditions. The Lyapunov function remains bounded in both instances, validating\nthe robust stability of the controller.",

    "abstract": "Parameterized quantum circuits appear ubiquitously in the design of many\nquantum algorithms, such as variational quantum algorithms, where the\noptimization of parameters is crucial for algorithmic efficiency. In this work,\nwe propose an Optimal Interpolation-based Coordinate Descent (OICD) method to\nsolve the parameter optimization problem that arises in parameterized quantum\ncircuits. Our OICD method employs an interpolation technique to approximate the\ncost function of a parameterized quantum circuit, effectively recovering its\ntrigonometric characteristics, then performs an argmin update on a single\nparameter per iteration on a classical computer. We determine the optimal\ninterpolation nodes in our OICD method to mitigate the impact of statistical\nerrors from quantum measurements. Additionally, for the case of equidistant\nfrequencies -- commonly encountered when the Hermitian generators are Pauli\noperators -- we show that the optimal interpolation nodes are equidistant\nnodes, and our OICD method can simultaneously minimize the mean squared error,\nthe condition number of the interpolation matrix, and the average variance of\nderivatives of the cost function. We perform numerical simulations of our OICD\nmethod using Qiskit Aer and test its performance on the maxcut problem, the\ntransverse field Ising model, and the XXZ model. Numerical results imply that\nour OICD method is more efficient than the commonly used stochastic gradient\ndescent method and the existing random coordinate descent method.",

However, due to the unreliability of the acquisition device, the\npresence of the noise and the variations of the acquisition environments, the\nobtained features and the reference blood glucose values are highly unreliable.\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes a polynomial fitting approach to\nsmooth the obtained features or the reference blood glucose values. First, the\nblood glucose values are estimated based on the individual optimization\napproaches. Second, the absolute difference values between the estimated blood\nglucose values and the actual blood glucose values based on each optimization\napproach are computed. Third, these absolute difference values for each\noptimization approach are sorted in the ascending order. Fourth, for each\nsorted blood glucose value, the optimization method corresponding to the\nminimum absolute difference value is selected. Fifth, the accumulate\nprobability of each selected optimization method is computed. If the accumulate\nprobability of any selected optimization method at a point is greater than a\nthreshold value, then the accumulate probabilities of these three selected\noptimization methods at that point are reset to zero. A range of the sorted\nblood glucose values are defined as that with the corresponding boundaries\npoints being the previous reset point and this reset point. Hence, after\nperforming the above procedures for all the sorted reference blood glucose\nvalues in the validation set, the regions of the sorted reference blood glucose\nvalues and the corresponding optimization methods in these regions are\ndetermined.

The load flow model\nintegrates the AC grid, DC grid, and interfacing converters (IC) into a unified\nrepresentation. This work extends an existing load flow model to include the\nICs' grid-forming operation.\n  In traditional islanding control frameworks, the grid-forming converter is\ntypically interfaced with an energy storage system that can provide\nbidirectional power to maintain the power balance. The proposed framework,\nhowever, allows the ICs to operate as the grid-forming unit while being\nconnected to a DC grid rather than a single resource. This configuration allows\nfor a wider operating range and, thus, a more flexible control. Furthermore,\nthe optimal grid-aware control framework can steer the system to ensure a\nfeasible operation without any grid constraint violations before, during, and\nafter the islanding manoeuvre. The framework also guarantees smooth\ntransitions, i.e., without any significant transient behaviour, when\ntransitioning between grid-connected and islanding operations.

Indeed, these tools are frequently novel and may not\nhave been thoroughly tested. When standard benchmarks may be insufficient or\nunavailable, random test case generation offers a promising approach. To scale\nup, random testing requires comparing actual versus expected results, i.e.,\nsolving the oracle problem. To address this challenge, this work introduces a\nnovel theoretical framework based on a modular variant of Timed Automata (TA),\ncalled Tiled Timed Automata (TTA), for testing model checkers operating with\nvariations of TA, by building oracles based on Weighted Automata. The framework\nis initially applied to verify model checkers solving the emptiness problem for\nParametric TA and it is validated, in this specific scenario, by our tool,\nTABEC, which randomly generates tests predicting their expected outcome through\nautomated oracle generation. Furthermore, the general nature of TTA facilitates\nthe framework adaptation to model checkers solving other decidable problems on\nTA, as detailed for the minimum-cost reachability problem of Priced TA.",

The model is motivated by\nspecific issues in analytical chemistry, where measurement errors remain\nconstant at low concentrations but increase proportionally as concentrations\nrise. To account for this, the model permits the parameters of the calibration\ncurve, which relate instrument responses to true concentrations, to vary across\ndifferent laboratories, thereby reflecting real-world variability in\nmeasurement processes. Traditional large-sample interval estimation methods are\ninadequate for small samples, leading to the use of an alternative approach,\nnamely the fiducial approach. The calibration curve that accurately captures\nthe heteroscedastic nature of the data, results in more reliable estimates\nacross diverse laboratory conditions.

Our\ncalculations show that $N(1535)$ can be reproduced as a three-quark state\n($N(1P)$), while $N(1440)$ and $\\Lambda(1405)$ cannot be accommodated as the\nthree-quark candidates, ($N(2S)$ and $\\Lambda(1P)$), respectively. In the\nfive-quark framework, we find that the $\\Lambda K$ state for $N(1535)$ can not\nform a bound state, while in the $N\\bar{K}$ channel there will $\\Lambda(1405)$\nform a shallow bound state. Based on the complex-scaling method, we performed\ncomplete coupled-channels calculations and obtained six resonance states with\nenergies ranging from 1.8 GeV to 2.2 GeV, in addition with one bound state\nlocated around $\\Sigma \\pi$ channel. However, neither molecular candidates in\n$\\Lambda K$ channel for $N(1535)$ nor $N\\bar{K}$ for $\\Lambda(1405)$ are\nincluded in these states. This is because the strong coupling between\n$N\\bar{K}$ and $\\Sigma \\pi$ will make the $N\\bar{K}$ unbound, while the weak\ncoupling between $\\Lambda K$ and $\\Sigma K$ can not help form a stable\nstructure around $\\Lambda K$ threshold. Thus, under the quenched quark model,\nour results support $N(1535)$ as a three-quark state, while $N(1440)$ is\nneither a three-quark nor a five-quark state. In addition, we find that\nalthough $\\Lambda(1405)$ can be primarily a five-quark state, it requires a\nmixture of three-quark and five-quark components for stability.

In a generalized definition, it seeks to predict the motion for an\nisolated system composed of three point masses freely interacting under\nNewton's law of universal attraction. This proves to be analogous to a\nmultitude of interactions between celestial bodies, and thus, the problem finds\napplicability within the studies of celestial mechanics. Despite numerous\nattempts by renowned physicists to solve it throughout the last three\ncenturies, no general closed-form solutions have been reached due to its\ninherently chaotic nature for most initial conditions.

    "abstract": "The viscous flow of electrons in a narrow channel requires both strong\nelectron-electron interactions and no-slip boundary conditions. However,\nintroducing obstacles within the liquid can significantly increase flow\nresistance and, as a result, amplify the effects of viscosity. Even in samples\nwith smooth walls, the presence of an obstacle can strongly alter electron\nbehavior, leading to pronounced hydrodynamic effects. We investigated transport\nin mesoscopic samples containing a disordered array of obstacles. In contrast\nto samples without obstacles, which do not show a decrease in resistivity with\nrising temperature, samples with obstacles exhibit a significant resistivity\nreduction as temperature increases (the Gurzhi effect). By measuring the\nnegative magnetoresistance, we extracted shear viscosity and other parameters\nthrough comparison with theoretical predictions. Consequently, narrow-channel\nsamples with a disordered obstacle array provide a valuable platform for\nstudying hydrodynamic electron flow independently of boundary conditions.",

    "abstract": "Declines in vaccination coverage for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as\nmeasles and chickenpox, have enabled their surprising comebacks and pose\nsignificant public health challenges in the wake of growing vaccine hesitancy.\nVaccine opt-outs and refusals are often fueled by beliefs concerning\nperceptions of vaccine effectiveness and exaggerated risks. Here, we quantify\nthe impact of competing beliefs -- vaccine-averse versus vaccine-neutral -- on\nsocial imitation dynamics of vaccination, alongside the epidemiological\ndynamics of disease transmission. These beliefs may be pre-existing and fixed,\nor coevolving attitudes. This interplay among beliefs, behaviors, and disease\ndynamics demonstrates that individuals are not perfectly rational; rather, they\nbase their vaccine uptake decisions on beliefs, personal experiences, and\nsocial influences. We find that the presence of a small proportion of fixed\nvaccine-averse beliefs can significantly exacerbate the vaccination dilemma,\nmaking the tipping point in the hysteresis loop more sensitive to changes in\nindividuals' perceived costs of vaccination and vaccine effectiveness. However,\nin scenarios where competing beliefs spread concurrently with vaccination\nbehavior, their double-edged impact can lead to self-correction and alignment\nbetween vaccine beliefs and behaviors. The results show that coevolution of\nvaccine beliefs and behaviors makes populations more sensitive to abrupt\nchanges in perceptions of vaccine cost and effectiveness compared to scenarios\nwithout beliefs. Our work provides valuable insights into harnessing the social\ncontagion of even vaccine-neutral attitudes to overcome vaccine hesitancy.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), it poses challenges\nto ensure personalized decision-making in tasks that are not considered in\ntraining datasets. To address this issue, we propose ValuePilot, a two-phase\nvalue-driven decision-making framework comprising a dataset generation toolkit\nDGT and a decision-making module DMM trained on the generated data. DGT is\ncapable of generating scenarios based on value dimensions and closely mirroring\nreal-world tasks, with automated filtering techniques and human curation to\nensure the validity of the dataset. In the generated dataset, DMM learns to\nrecognize the inherent values of scenarios, computes action feasibility and\nnavigates the trade-offs between multiple value dimensions to make personalized\ndecisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, given human value\npreferences, our DMM most closely aligns with human decisions, outperforming\nClaude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-2-flash, Llama-3.1-405b and GPT-4o. This research is\na preliminary exploration of value-driven decision-making. We hope it will\nstimulate interest in value-driven decision-making and personalized\ndecision-making within the community.",

The framework features three states: (1) a baseline state that captures\nobserved seasonal mortality patterns, (2) an environmental shock state for heat\nwaves, and (3) a respiratory shock state that addresses mortality deviations\ncaused by strong outbreaks of respiratory diseases due to influenza and\nCOVID-19. Transition probabilities between states are modeled using\ncovariate-dependent multinomial logit functions. These functions incorporate,\namong others, lagged temperature and influenza incidence rates as predictors,\nallowing dynamic adjustments to evolving shocks. Calibrated on weekly mortality\ndata across 21 French regions and six age groups, the regime-switching\nframework accounts for spatial and demographic heterogeneity. Under various\nprojection scenarios for temperature and influenza, we quantify uncertainty in\nmortality forecasts through prediction intervals constructed using an extensive\nbootstrap approach.

Drawing natural motivations\nfrom the study of quantum phases of matter and entanglement, we systematically\ninvestigate the notion of long-range magic (LRM), defined as nonstabilizerness\nthat cannot be (approximately) erased by shallow local unitary circuits. In\ndoing so, we prove a robust generalization of the Bravyi--K\\\"onig theorem. By\nestablishing connections to the theory of fault-tolerant logical gates on\nquantum error-correcting codes, we show that certain families of topological\nstabilizer code states exhibit LRM. Then, we show that all ground states of\ntopological orders that cannot be realized by topological stabilizer codes,\nsuch as Fibonacci topological order, exhibit LRM, which yields a ``no\nlowest-energy trivial magic'' result. Building on our considerations of LRM, we\ndiscuss the classicality of short-range magic from e.g.~preparation and\nlearning perspectives, and put forward a ``no low-energy trivial magic'' (NLTM)\nconjecture that has key motivation in the quantum PCP context. We also connect\ncorrelation functions with LRM, demonstrating certain LRM state families by\ncorrelation properties.

Hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) extends this\nconcept to a three-layer hierarchical network, where clustered users\ncommunicate with the server through an intermediate layer of relays. In HSA,\nbeyond conventional server security, relay security is also enforced to ensure\nthat the relays remain oblivious to the users' inputs (an abstraction of the\nlocal models in FL). Existing study on HSA assumes that each user is associated\nwith only one relay, limiting opportunities for coding across inter-cluster\nusers to achieve efficient communication and key generation. In this paper, we\nconsider HSA with a cyclic association pattern where each user is connected to\n$B$ consecutive relays in a wrap-around manner. We propose an efficient\naggregation scheme which includes a message design for the inputs inspired by\ngradient coding-a well-known technique for efficient communication in\ndistributed computing-along with a highly non-trivial security key design.

This data encodes a full-scale\nBatalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the system, including a concise form of the\nBV master action. The important feature of (presymplectic) AKSZ models is that,\nat least at the level of equations of motion, they can be equivalently\nreformulated in the spacetime obtained by adding or eliminating contractible\ndimensions. For instance, the presymplectic AKSZ formulation of gravity can be\nlifted to the respective ``group manifold'', endowing it with the structure of\na principle bundle and the Cartan connection therein, at least locally. In\nparticular, the so-called rheonomy conditions emerge as a part of the\npresymplectic AKSZ equations of motion. The analogous considerations apply to\nsupergravity and its uplift to superspace. We also study general presymplectic\nBV-AKSZ models related by adding or removing contractible spacetime dimensions\nin order to systematically relate the spacetime and superspace formulations of\nthe same system within the AKSZ-like framework.

An LLM is used to decompose a\nsentence into simpler phrases, and then to translate each phrase with the help\nof retrieved demonstrations. Finally, the LLM is prompted to translate the\ninitial sentence with the help of the self-generated phrase-translation pairs.\nOur intuition is that this approach should improve translation because these\nshorter phrases should be intrinsically easier to translate and easier to match\nwith relevant examples. This is especially beneficial in low-resource\nscenarios, and more generally whenever the selection pool is small or out of\ndomain. We show that compositional translation boosts LLM translation\nperformance on a wide range of popular MT benchmarks, including FLORES 200,\nNTREX 128 and TICO-19.

Specifically, by combining mosaic quasiperiodic\nnext-nearest-neighbor hoppings and quasiperiodic on-site potentials, we\nrigorously demonstrate the existence of two distinct types of mobility edges:\nthose separating extended and critical states, and those separating extended\nand localized states. Using Avila's global theory, we derive exact analytical\nexpressions for these mobility edges and determine the parameter regimes where\neach type dominates. Our numerical calculations confirm these analytical\nresults through fractal dimension analysis. Furthermore, we propose an\nexperimentally feasible scheme to realize this model using Bose-Einstein\ncondensates in optical lattices with engineered momentum-state transitions. We\nalso investigate the effects of many-body interactions under mean-field\napproximation. Our work provides a fertile ground for studying the coexistence\nof different types of mobility edges in quasiperiodic systems and suggests a\nfeasible experimental platform to observe and control these transitions.",

Our closer examination reveals four key unique\nlimitations underlying this issue:(1) Positional bias--models favor earlier\nqueries in multi-query inputs but answering the wrong one in the latter (e.g.,\nGPT-4o's accuracy drops from 75.8 percent to 72.8 percent); (2) Instruction\nsensitivity--performance declines by 5.0 to 7.5 percent in the Qwen2.5 Series\nand by 5.0 percent in DeepSeek-V3 with auxiliary guidance; (3) Numerical\nfragility--value substitution sharply reduces accuracy (e.g., GPT-4o drops from\n97.5 percent to 82.5 percent, GPT-o1-mini drops from 97.5 percent to 92.5\npercent); and (4) Memory dependence--models resort to guesswork when missing\ncritical data.

Atomic-scale simulation with\nArrhenius fitting for over 100-ps trajectories reveals that increasing B-site\nionic radius ($\\text{Na}^{+} < \\text{K}^{+} < \\text{Rb}^{+}$) simultaneously\nreduces both activation energy $E_{a}$, which enhances reactivity, and\npre-exponential factor $A$ which suppresses collision probabilities for\nhydrogen transfer between site $X$ and site $A$, with sharply opposing kinetic\nconsequences. This duality well explains the peak stability and insensitivity\nin $\\text{K}^{+}$-based DAP-2, which optimally balance thermal endurance and\ncollision dissipation. For ammonium-based DAP-4, though the radius of\n$\\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$ is close to $\\text{K}^{+}$, the reactive B-site cation\ntriggers proton transfer that promotes $\\text{C-H}$ bond rupture. By linking\nstatic cation radii to dynamic $E_{a}$-ln$(A)$ coupling, we rationalize\nnon-monotonic decomposition temperatures ($\\text{K}^{+} > \\text{NH}_{4}^{+} >\n\\text{Rb}^{+} > \\text{Na}^{+}$) macroscopic stability and establishes\ncornerstones for universal energetic material design.",

Common strategies involve carefully leveraging prior\nexperiences, especially transition data collected on related tasks. Although\nmuch progress has been made for general pick-and-place manipulation, far fewer\nstudies have investigated contact-rich assembly tasks, where precise control is\nessential. We introduce SRSA (Skill Retrieval and Skill Adaptation), a novel\nframework designed to address this problem by utilizing a pre-existing skill\nlibrary containing policies for diverse assembly tasks. The challenge lies in\nidentifying which skill from the library is most relevant for fine-tuning on a\nnew task. Our key hypothesis is that skills showing higher zero-shot success\nrates on a new task are better suited for rapid and effective fine-tuning on\nthat task. To this end, we propose to predict the transfer success for all\nskills in the skill library on a novel task, and then use this prediction to\nguide the skill retrieval process. We establish a framework that jointly\ncaptures features of object geometry, physical dynamics, and expert actions to\nrepresent the tasks, allowing us to efficiently learn the transfer success\npredictor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRSA significantly\noutperforms the leading baseline. When retrieving and fine-tuning skills on\nunseen tasks, SRSA achieves a 19% relative improvement in success rate,\nexhibits 2.6x lower standard deviation across random seeds, and requires 2.4x\nfewer transition samples to reach a satisfactory success rate, compared to the\nbaseline. Furthermore, policies trained with SRSA in simulation achieve a 90%\nmean success rate when deployed in the real world. Please visit our project\nwebpage https://srsa2024.github.io/.",

We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with\nthe two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions\ndecaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous\ndecay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the\ndynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic\nand polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of\nthe interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion\ninduces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark\nmatter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit\nwith small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-\nBrown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated\ntwo-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the\ndifference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and\n\\emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The\ncase of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing\ncoupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon\ncorrelations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \\emph{may} provide\nan alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic\ncollective excitations.

Evaluating the impact of disease surveillance systems as\ntriggers for adaptive behavior and public health interventions is key to\ndesigning effective control policies.\n  We examine the multiple behavioral and epidemiological dynamics generated by\nthe feedback between disease surveillance and the intertwined dynamics of\ninformation and disease propagation. Specifically, we study the intertwined\ndynamics between: $(i)$ disease surveillance triggering health emergency\ndeclarations, $(ii)$ risk information dissemination producing decentralized\nbehavioral responses, and $(iii)$ centralized interventions. Our results show\nthat robust surveillance systems that quickly detect a disease outbreak can\ntrigger an early response from the population, leading to large epidemic sizes.\nThe key result is that the response scenarios that minimize the final epidemic\nsize are determined by the trade-off between the risk information dissemination\nand disease transmission, with the triggering effect of surveillance mediating\nthis trade-off. Finally, our results confirm that behavioral adaptation can\ncreate a hysteresis-like effect on the final epidemic size.",

    "abstract": "Quantum state tomography (QST) is a widely employed technique for\ncharacterizing the state of a quantum system. However, it is plagued by two\nfundamental challenges: computational and experimental complexity grows\nexponentially with the number of qubits, rendering experimental implementation\nand data post-processing arduous even for moderately sized systems. Here, we\nintroduce gradient-descent (GD) algorithms for the post-processing step of QST\nin discrete- and continuous-variable systems. To ensure physically valid state\nreconstruction at each iteration step of the algorithm, we use various\ndensity-matrix parameterizations: Cholesky decomposition, Stiefel manifold, and\nprojective normalization. These parameterizations have the added benefit of\nenabling a rank-controlled ansatz, which simplifies reconstruction when there\nis prior information about the system. We benchmark the performance of our\nGD-QST techniques against state-of-the-art methods, including constrained\nconvex optimization, conditional generative adversarial networks, and iterative\nmaximum likelihood estimation. Our comparison focuses on time complexity,\niteration counts, data requirements, state rank, and robustness against noise.\nWe find that rank-controlled ansatzes in our stochastic mini-batch GD-QST\nalgorithms effectively handle noisy and incomplete data sets, yielding\nsignificantly higher reconstruction fidelity than other methods. Simulations\nachieving full-rank seven-qubit QST in under three minutes on a standard\nlaptop, with 18 GB of RAM and no dedicated GPU, highlight that GD-QST is\ncomputationally more efficient and outperforms other techniques in most\nscenarios, offering a promising avenue for characterizing noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum devices.

Additionally, we explore the relationship\nbetween the Pallas family and the near-Earth object (NEO) (3200) Phaethon.

The observed Pallas family asteroids exhibit nearly\nidentical spectral profiles, suggesting a homogeneous composition of ejected\nmaterial. Small variations in spectral slopes are observed, which may result\nfrom different levels of alteration experienced by individual asteroids, with\nsome influence from variations in grain size. Most of the observed spectra of\nthe Pallas asteroids, from 0.8 to 2.2 micron, closely resemble those of the CY\nand CI meteorites. The blueness of asteroid surfaces is likely due to the\npresence of magnetite, troilite, or phyllosilicates, which are products of\naqueous alteration.

In this paper, we contradict this expectation\nby presenting a new unitary supersymmetric QFT on $dS_{4}$: the free\nsupersymmetric theory of the chiral graviton and chiral gravitino fields. By\nchiral, we mean that the corresponding field strengths are anti-self-dual, and\nthe gauge potentials are complex, each carrying a single complex propagating\ndegree of freedom. The global SUSY transformations are generated by the\nstandard Dirac Killing spinors of $dS_{4}$. The theory overcomes the known\nobstacles to unitary global SUSY on $dS_{4}$ by closing the commutator between\ntwo SUSY transformations on $so(4,2) \\oplus u(1)$ rather than the de Sitter\nalgebra $so(4,1)$. Crucially, the $so(4,2)$ symmetry is realised through\nunconventional conformal-like transformations. This free theory cannot become\ninteracting while preserving SUSY in a way that makes the spin-2 sector the\ntrue graviton sector of General Relativity, as the three-graviton coupling\ncannot be $u(1)$-invariant. We establish the unitarity of the free\nsupersymmetric theory in two complementary ways. First, by studying the action\nof the superalgebra generators on the space of physical gravitino and graviton\nmode solutions. Second, by quantising the fields and explicitly constructing\nthe complex quantum supercharges $Q_{A}$ and $Q^{A\\dagger}$, we show that the\ntrace $\\sum_{A} \\{ Q_{A}, Q^{A \\dagger} \\}$ is positive-definite.",

Our method leverages tie points obtained from aerial\ntriangulation to establish a relationship between monocular depth and metric\ndepth, thus transforming the original depth map into a metric depth map,\nenabling the generation of dense depth information and the comprehensive\nreconstruction of the scene. For the experiments, a high-overlap drone dataset\ncontaining 296 images is processed using Metashape to generate depth maps and\nDSMs as ground truth. Subsequently, we create a low-overlap dataset by\nselecting 20 images for experimental evaluation. Results demonstrate that while\nthe recovered depth maps and resulting DSMs achieve meter-level accuracy, they\nprovide significantly better completeness compared to traditional methods,\nparticularly in regions covered by single images. This study showcases the\npotential of monocular depth estimation in low-overlap aerial photogrammetry.",

To support modular reasoning\nabout concurrent (non-probabilistic) program modules, state-of-the-art program\nlogics internalize the classic notion of linearizability within the logic\nthrough the concept of logical atomicity.\n  Coneris extends this idea to probabilistic concurrent program modules. Thus\nConeris supports modular reasoning about probabilistic concurrent modules by\ncapturing a novel notion of randomized logical atomicity within the logic. To\ndo so, Coneris utilizes presampling tapes and a novel probabilistic update\nmodality to describe how state is changed probabilistically at linearization\npoints.

It is found that the hydrostatic pressure has the\nminimal effect whereas the uniaxial pressure has the highest efficiency in\ntuning magnetization and magnetic anisotropy of the MOF. First-principles\ncalculations reveal that the applied low pressures (less than 11 kbar) do not\ninduce notable lattice distortion in the framework or the superexchange path.\nInstead, the modulation of hydrogen bonds is identified as a critical factor\nfor pressure tuning of magnetization and anisotropy.

    "abstract": "We study the equivalence of families of polycyclic codes associated with\npolynomials of the form $x^n - a_{n-1}x^{n-1} - \\ldots - a_1x - a_0$ over a\nfinite field. We begin with the specific case of polycyclic codes associated\nwith a trinomial $x^n - a_{\\ell} x^{\\ell} - a_0$ (for some $0< \\ell <n$), which\nwe refer to as \\textit{$\\ell$-trinomial codes}, after which we generalize our\nresults to general polycyclic codes. We introduce an equivalence relation\ncalled \\textit{$n$-equivalence}, which extends the known notion of\n$n$-equivalence for constacyclic codes \\cite{Chen2014}. We compute the number\nof $n$-equivalence classes %, $ N_{(n,\\ell)}$, for this relation and provide\nconditions under which two families of polycyclic (or $\\ell$-trinomial) codes\nare equivalent. In particular, we prove that when $\\gcd(n, n-\\ell) = 1$, any\n$\\ell$-trinomial code family is equivalent to a trinomial code family\nassociated with the polynomial $x^n - x^{\\ell} - 1$. Finally, we focus on\n$p^{\\ell}$-trinomial codes of length $p^{\\ell+r}$, where $p$ is the\ncharacteristic of $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and $r$ an integer, and provide some examples\nas an application of the theory developed in this paper.",

This paper presents a third-order boundary discretization for\ncompact gas-kinetic scheme (GKS). Wide stencils and curved boundaries pose\nchallenges in the boundary treatment for high-order schemes, particularly for\ntemporal accuracy. By utilizing a time-dependent gas distribution function, the\nGKS simultaneously evaluates fluxes and updates flow variables at cell\ninterfaces, enabling the concurrent update of cell-averaged flow variables and\ntheir gradients within the third-order compact scheme. The proposed one-sided\ndiscretization achieves third-order spatial accuracy on boundary cells by\nutilizing updated flow variables and gradients in the discretization for\nnon-slip wall boundary conditions. High-order temporal accuracy on boundary\ncells is achieved through the GKS time-dependent flux implementation with\nmulti-stage multi-derivative methodology. Additionally, we develop exact\nno-penetration conditions for both adiabatic and isothermal wall boundaries,\nwith extensions to curved mesh geometries to fully exploit the advantages of\nhigh-order schemes. Comparative analysis between the proposed one-sided\nthird-order boundary scheme, third-order boundary scheme with ghost cells, and\nsecond-order boundary scheme demonstrates significant performance differences\nfor the third-order compact GKS.

    "abstract": "Fibre-reinforced hydrogels are promising materials for biomedical\napplications due to their strength, toughness, and tunability. However, it\nremains unclear how to design fibre-reinforced hydrogels for use in specific\napplications due to the lack of a flexible modelling framework that can predict\nand hence optimise their behaviour. In this paper, we present a microstructural\nmodel for transversely isotropic fibre-reinforced hydrogels that captures the\nspecific geometry of the fibre network. The model also accounts for slack in\nthe initial fibre network that is gradually removed upon deformation. The\nmechanical model for the fibre network is coupled to a nonlinear poroelastic\nmodel for the hydrogel matrix that accounts for osmotic stress. By comparing\nthe model predictions to data from unconfined compression experiments, we show\nthat the model can capture J-shaped stress-strain curves and time-dependent\ncreep responses. We showcase how the model can be used to guide the design of\nmaterials for artificial cartilage by exploring how to maximise interstitial\nfluid pressure. We find that fluid pressurisation can be increased by using\nstiffer fibres, removing slack from the fibre network, and reducing the Young's\nmodulus of the hydrogel matrix. Finally, a high-level and open-source Python\npackage has been developed for simulating unconfined compression experiments\nusing the model.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous experiments have been proposed and conducted to\nsearch for ultralight bosonic dark matter (ULBDM). Signals from ULBDM in such\nexperiments are characterized by extremely narrow spectral widths. A\nnear-optimal detection strategy is to divide the data based on the signal\ncoherence time and sum the power across these segments. However, the signal\ncoherence time can extend beyond a day, making it challenging to construct\ncontiguous segments of such a duration due to detector instabilities. In this\nwork, we present a novel detection statistic that can coherently extract ULBDM\nsignals from segments of arbitrary durations. Our detection statistic, which we\nrefer to as coherent SNR, is a weighed sum of data correlations, whose weights\nare determined by the expected signal correlations. We demonstrate that\ncoherent SNR achieves sensitivity independent of segment duration and surpasses\nthe performance of the conventional incoherent-sum approach, through analytical\narguments and numerical experiments.",

This has prompted exploration of alternative\napproaches such as discrete diffusion. However, masked diffusion, which has\nemerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness,\nreintroduces this inability to revise words. To overcome this, we generalize\nmasked diffusion, deriving a new family of general interpolating discrete\ndiffusion (GIDD) which offers greater flexibility in the design of the noising\nprocesses. Leveraging a novel diffusion ELBO, we achieve compute-matched\nstate-of-the-art performance in diffusion language modeling. Exploiting GIDD's\nflexibility, we explore a hybrid approach combining masking and uniform noise,\nleading to improved sample quality and unlocking the ability for the model to\ncorrect its own mistakes, an area where autoregressive models notoriously have\nstruggled.

While research in urban environments has progressed\nsignificantly using LiDARs or cameras, applications in natural forest-like\nenvironments remain largely under-explored. Furthermore, forests present\nparticular challenges due to high self-similarity and substantial variations in\nvegetation growth over time. In this work, we propose a robust LiDAR-based\nplace recognition method for natural forests, ForestLPR. We hypothesize that a\nset of cross-sectional images of the forest's geometry at different heights\ncontains the information needed to recognize revisiting a place. The\ncross-sectional images are represented by \\ac{bev} density images of horizontal\nslices of the point cloud at different heights. Our approach utilizes a visual\ntransformer as the shared backbone to produce sets of local descriptors and\nintroduces a multi-BEV interaction module to attend to information at different\nheights adaptively.

However, the\ndecoupling of model learning from local data makes FL highly vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks, where a single compromised client can poison the shared\nmodel. While recent progress has been made in backdoor detection, existing\nmethods face challenges with detection accuracy and runtime effectiveness,\nparticularly when dealing with complex model architectures. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach to detecting malicious clients in an accurate, stable,\nand efficient manner. Our method utilizes a sampling-based network\nrepresentation method to quantify dissimilarities between clients, identifying\nmodel deviations caused by backdoor injections. We also propose an iterative\nalgorithm to progressively detect and exclude malicious clients as outliers\nbased on these dissimilarity measurements. Evaluations across a range of\nbenchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in detection accuracy and defense effectiveness.

Unlike\ntraditional locomotion control approaches focusing solely on velocity tracking,\nwe pursue to balance the agility and robustness of quadruped robots on diverse\nand complex terrains. To this end, we propose an end-to-end deep reinforcement\nlearning framework for posture-aware locomotion named PALo, which manages to\nhandle simultaneous linear and angular velocity tracking and real-time\nadjustments of body height, pitch, and roll angles. In PALo, the locomotion\ncontrol problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess, and an asymmetric actor-critic architecture is adopted to overcome the\nsim-to-real challenge. Further, by incorporating customized training curricula,\nPALo achieves agile posture-aware locomotion control in simulated environments\nand successfully transfers to real-world settings without fine-tuning, allowing\nreal-time control of the quadruped robot's locomotion and body posture across\nchallenging terrains. Through in-depth experimental analysis, we identify the\nkey components of PALo that contribute to its performance, further validating\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.

Career abandonment, the process in which professionals leave the\nactivity, assuming positions in another area, among software developers\ninvolves frustration with the lost investment and emotional and financial\ncosts, even though being beneficial for the human being, depending on personal\ncontext. Previous studies have identified work-related motivators for career\nabandonment, such as the threat of obsolescence, unstable requirements, and low\ncode quality, though these factors have primarily been examined in former\ndevelopers. The relationship between these motivators and the intention to\nabandon among currently active developers remains unexplored. Goal. This\narticle investigates the relationship between key work-related motivators and\ncurrently active software developers intention to abandon their careers.\nMethod. We employed a quantitative approach, surveying 221 software developers\nto validate a theoretical model for career abandonment intention, based on an\nadaptation of the Investment Model, which incorporates satisfaction with\ntechnical aspects of the profession as well as the intention to abandon.\nFindings.

    "abstract": "Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires not only question-based\nmultimodal reasoning but also precise temporal grounding to capture subtle\ndynamics for accurate prediction. However, existing methods mainly use question\ninformation implicitly, limiting focus on question-specific details.\nFurthermore, most studies rely on uniform frame sampling, which can miss key\nquestion-relevant frames. Although recent Top-K frame selection methods aim to\naddress this, their discrete nature still overlooks fine-grained temporal\ndetails. This paper proposes QA-TIGER, a novel framework that explicitly\nincorporates question information and models continuous temporal dynamics. Our\nkey idea is to use Gaussian-based modeling to adaptively focus on both\nconsecutive and non-consecutive frames based on the question, while explicitly\ninjecting question information and applying progressive refinement. We leverage\na Mixture of Experts (MoE) to flexibly implement multiple Gaussian models,\nactivating temporal experts specifically tailored to the question. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple AVQA benchmarks show that QA-TIGER consistently\nachieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at\nhttps://aim-skku.github.io/QA-TIGER/",

Indeed, while the timing feature associated with\nthe \"lump\" seems to be present for a large part of the parameter space defined\nby the binary separation and mass ratio in circular binaries, it was recently\nproposed to form thanks to an instability occurring naturally at the edge of\naccretion discs around single black holes (SBH).

    "abstract": "Small targets are particularly difficult to detect due to their low pixel\ncount, complex backgrounds, and varying shooting angles, which make it hard for\nmodels to extract effective features. While some large-scale models offer high\naccuracy, their long inference times make them unsuitable for real-time\ndeployment on edge devices. On the other hand, models designed for low\ncomputational power often suffer from poor detection accuracy. This paper\nfocuses on small target detection and explores methods for object detection\nunder low computational constraints. Building on the YOLOv8 model, we propose a\nnew network architecture called FDM-YOLO. Our research includes the following\nkey contributions: We introduce FDM-YOLO by analyzing the output of the YOLOv8\ndetection head. We add a highresolution layer and remove the large target\ndetection layer to better handle small targets. Based on PConv, we propose a\nlightweight network structure called Fast-C2f, which is integrated into the PAN\nmodule of the model. To mitigate the accuracy loss caused by model\nlightweighting, we employ dynamic upsampling (Dysample) and a lightweight EMA\nattention mechanism.The FDM-YOLO model was validated on the Visdrone dataset,\nachieving a 38% reduction in parameter count and improving the Map0.5 score\nfrom 38.4% to 42.5%, all while maintaining nearly the same inference speed.\nThis demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in balancing accuracy and\nefficiency for edge device deployment.",

    "abstract": "Social media popularity prediction task aims to predict the popularity of\nposts on social media platforms, which has a positive driving effect on\napplication scenarios such as content optimization, digital marketing and\nonline advertising. Though many studies have made significant progress, few of\nthem pay much attention to the integration between popularity prediction with\ntemporal alignment. In this paper, with exploring YouTube's multilingual and\nmulti-modal content, we construct a new social media temporal popularity\nprediction benchmark, namely SMTPD, and suggest a baseline framework for\ntemporal popularity prediction. Through data analysis and experiments, we\nverify that temporal alignment and early popularity play crucial roles in\nsocial media popularity prediction for not only deepening the understanding of\ntemporal dynamics of popularity in social media but also offering a suggestion\nabout developing more effective prediction models in this field.

One\nof the main causes of this is the large amount of tokens needed to encode the\nvisual input, which is especially evident for multi-image multimodal tasks.\nRecent approaches to reduce visual tokens depend on the visual encoder\narchitecture, require fine-tuning the LLM to maintain the performance, and only\nconsider single-image scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ToFu,\na visual encoder-agnostic, training-free Token Fusion strategy that combines\nredundant visual tokens of LMMs for high-resolution, multi-image, tasks. The\ncore intuition behind our method is straightforward yet effective: preserve\ndistinctive tokens while combining similar ones. We achieve this by\nsequentially examining visual tokens and deciding whether to merge them with\nothers or keep them as separate entities. We validate our approach on the\nwell-established LLaVA-Interleave Bench, which covers challenging multi-image\ntasks. In addition, we push to the extreme our method by testing it on a\nnewly-created benchmark, ComPairs, focused on multi-image comparisons where a\nlarger amount of images and visual tokens are inputted to the LMMs. Our\nextensive analysis, considering several LMM architectures, demonstrates the\nbenefits of our approach both in terms of efficiency and performance gain.",

A theory assuming high-frequency shear modulus to be a major physical\nparameter controlling glass relaxation is suggested. The energy barrier for\nthese rearrangements is proportional to the shear modulus while its magnitude,\nin turn, varies due to the changes in the defect concentration (diaelastic\neffect). Both dependences lead to the occurrence of heat effects. The excess\nheat capacity calculated using experimental shear modulus data demonstrates\nvery good agreement with the experimental calorimetric data for all states of\nglasses.

Existing mapping methods often suffer from\noverconfident semantic predictions, and sparse and noisy depth sensing, leading\nto inconsistent map representations.

To enable uncertainty-calibrated evidential multi-task\nlearning, we propose a novel evidential depth loss function that jointly\noptimizes the belief strength of the depth prediction in conjunction with\nevidential segmentation loss. Building on this, we present EvidKimera, an\nuncertainty-aware semantic surface mapping framework, which uses evidential\ndepth and semantics prediction for improved 3D metric-semantic consistency. We\ntrain and evaluate EvidMTL on the NYUDepthV2 and assess its zero-shot\nperformance on ScanNetV2, demonstrating superior uncertainty estimation\ncompared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable depth\nestimation and semantic segmentation.

The standard correctness\nnotion of workflow nets is soundness, which comes in several variants. Their\ndecidability was shown decades ago, but their complexity was only identified\nrecently. In this work, we are primarily interested in two popular variants:\n$1$-soundness and generalised soundness.\n  Workflow nets have been extended with resets to model workflows that can,\ne.g., cancel actions. It has been known for a while that, for this extension,\nall variants of soundness, except possibly generalised soundness, are\nundecidable.\n  We complete the picture by showing that generalised soundness is also\nundecidable for reset workflow nets. We then blur this undecidability landscape\nby identifying a property, coined ``$1$-in-between soundness'', which lies\nbetween $1$-soundness and generalised soundness. It reveals an unusual\nnon-monotonic complexity behaviour: a decidable soundness property is in\nbetween two undecidable ones. This can be valuable in the algorithmic analysis\nof reset workflow nets, as our procedure yields an output of the form\n``$1$-sound'' or ``not generalised sound'' which is always correct.",

Furthermore, our exposure versus CPV sensitivity\nstudies indicate that the $5\\sigma$ discovery potential is reached faster using\nlight and charge calorimetry than with the traditional TDR based reconstruction\nmethods. These findings highlight the promising role of light calorimetry as a\nsimple yet effective reconstruction method, serving as a complementary approach\nto enhance the physics capabilities of DUNE.",

As one established route, Floquet engineering provides a powerful\nframework to dress electronic states with time-periodic fields, giving rise to\nquasi-stationary Floquet states. With increasing field strength,\nnon-perturbative responses of the dressed states emerge, yet their nonlinear\ndynamics remain challenging to interpret. In this work we explore the emergence\nof non-adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions among Floquet states in Cu(111) under\nintense optical fields. At increasing field strength, we observe a transition\nfrom perturbative dressing to a regime where Floquet states undergo\nnon-adiabatic tunneling, revealing a breakdown of adiabatic Floquet evolution.\nThese insights are obtained through interferometrically time-resolved\nmulti-photon photoemission spectroscopy, which serves as a sensitive probe of\ntransient Floquet state dynamics. Numerical simulations and the theory of\ninstantaneous Floquet states allow us to directly examine real-time excitation\npathways in this non-perturbative photoemission regime.

In this article,\nwe introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability,\noptimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running\nefficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov\nfinite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures\naccuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann\nsolvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and\nspherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to\nhandle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or\ncooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the\nusual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the\npropagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from\nminutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from\nHERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In\n3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by\nintroducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The\nfocus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run\nHERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D\nsupernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution.

When $A$ is Hermitian positive\ndefinite, the Lanczos method is the standard choice of Krylov method, and\ndespite being very simplistic in nature, it often outperforms other, more\nsophisticated methods. In fact, one often observes that the error of the\nLanczos method behaves almost exactly as the error of the best possible\napproximation from the Krylov space (which is in general not efficiently\ncomputable). However, theoretical guarantees for the deviation of the Lanczos\nerror from the optimal error are mostly lacking so far (except for linear\nsystems and a few other special cases).

In extreme cases where matrices are\nhighly ill-conditioned, accurately computing the full matrix itself may be\ninfeasible. This is particularly relevant when considering kernel matrices at\nscale, including the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of neural networks\ntrained on large datasets.

    "abstract": "The DreamerV3 algorithm recently obtained remarkable performance across\ndiverse environment domains by learning an accurate world model based on\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Following the success of model-based\nreinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer\narchitecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling\nproperties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world\nmodels with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention.\nHowever, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their\nimpact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm,\nstruggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work,\nwe show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches\nis insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of\nTransformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time\nhorizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE\nRepresentations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive\nCoding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the\nagent performance.

Specifically, we derive the expression of the ambiguity\nfunction and analyze the relationship between its main lobe width and the\ntransmit antenna positions. In particular, the optimal antenna distribution to\nachieve the minimum main lobe width in the angular domain is characterized. We\ndiscover that this minimum width is related to the antenna size, the antenna\nnumber, and the target angle. Meanwhile, we present lower bounds of the\nambiguity function in the Doppler and delay domains, and show that the impact\nof the antenna size on the radar performance in these two domains is very\ndifferent from that in the angular domain. Moreover, the performance\nenhancement brought by MAs exhibits a certain trade-off between the main lobe\nwidth and the side lobe peak levels. Therefore, we propose to balance between\nminimizing the side lobe levels and narrowing the main lobe of the ambiguity\nfunction by optimizing the antenna positions. To achieve this goal, we propose\na low-complexity algorithm based on the Rosen's gradient projection method, and\nshow that its performance is very close to the baseline. Simulation results are\npresented to validate the theoretical analysis on the properties of the\nambiguity function, and demonstrate that MAs can reduce the main lobe width and\nsuppress the side lobe levels of the ambiguity function, thereby enhancing\nradar performance.",

We model the cumulative magnitude distribution of the background\npopulation using a local power-law representation with slope $\\gamma(H)$, where\n$H$ is the absolute magnitude. For the largest Hildas, we find $\\gamma\\simeq\n0.5$ with large uncertainty due to the limited population.

Microscopic\ninsights into magnetism, which emerges near superconductivity, require a\nsynergistic approach that combines complementary techniques with controlled\nparameter tuning. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the\nthree-layer Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ using\nmuon-spin rotation/relaxation ($\\mu$SR), neutron powder diffraction (NPD),\nresistivity, and specific heat measurements.

NPD experiments revealed that the\nmagnetic wave vector $(0, 0.574, 0)$ remains unchanged below 130 K, indicating\nthat the transition at $T^\\ast$ corresponds to a reorientation of the Ni\nmagnetic moments within a similar magnetic structure. Comparison of the\nobserved internal magnetic fields with dipole-field calculations reveals a\nmagnetic structure consistent with an antiferromagnetically coupled SDW on the\nouter two Ni layers, with smaller moments on the inner Ni layer. The internal\nfields at muon stopping sites appeared abruptly at $T_{\\rm SDW}$, suggesting a\nfirst-order-like nature of the SDW transition, which is closely linked to the\ncharge density wave (CDW) order occurring at the same temperature ($T_{\\rm SDW}\n= T_{\\rm CDW}$). Under applied pressure, all transition temperatures, including\n$T_{\\rm SDW}$, $T^\\ast$, and $T_{\\rm CDW}$, were suppressed at a nearly uniform\nrate of $\\simeq -13$ K/GPa. This behavior contrasts with the double-layer RP\nnickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, where pressure enhances the separation of the\ndensity wave transitions.",

In this work, we introduce Refined Policy Distillation\n(RPD), a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based policy refinement method that\nbridges this performance gap through a combination of on-policy RL with\nbehavioral cloning. The core idea of RPD is to distill and refine VLAs into\ncompact, high-performing expert policies by guiding the student policy during\nRL exploration using the actions of a teacher VLA, resulting in increased\nsample efficiency and faster convergence. We complement our method by\nfine-tuned versions of Octo and OpenVLA for ManiSkill3 to evaluate RPD in\nsimulation.

Our\nexperimental results across various manipulation tasks show that RPD enables\nthe RL student to learn expert policies that outperform the VLA teacher in both\ndense and sparse reward settings, while also achieving faster convergence than\nthe RL baseline. Our approach is even robust to changes in camera perspective\nand can generalize to task variations that the underlying VLA cannot solve.

This paper investigates a rotatable\nSTAR-RIS-assisted MEC system, operated under three protocols, namely energy\nsplitting, mode switching, and time switching. The goal is to minimize energy\nconsumption for multiple moving user devices through the joint optimization of\nSTAR-RIS configurations, orientation, computation resource allocation,\ntransmission power, and task offloading strategies. Considering the mobility of\nuser devices, we model the original optimization problem as a sequential\ndecision-making process across multiple time slots.

Therefore, a\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is employed, specifically utilizing\nsoft actor-critic algorithm to train the DRL model.

(iii) Neither tracing JIT compilers,\nnor ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation alone, even with domain-specific\noptimisations, suffice for the generation of performant ISSs. Pydrofoil\ntherefore implements a hybrid approach, pairing an AOT compiler with a tracing\nJIT built on the meta-tracing PyPy framework. AOT and JIT use domain-specific\noptimisations.

In particular, strong causality is not assumed, so\npart of the problem is precisely that of recovering the manifold topology so as\nto make sense of it also in rough frameworks. After verifying that known\nstandard characterizations do not meet this requirement, we propose two\npossible formulations. The first is based solely on chronological diamonds and\nis interesting due to its analogies with the Hopf-Rinow theorem. The second\nuses only properties of the Lorentzian distance function and it is suitable for\nextension to abstract `Lorentzian metric' frameworks. It turns out to be\nequivalent to the definition of `Lorentzian metric space' proposed in our\nprevious joint work with S. Suhr, up to slightly strengthening weak\n$d$-distinction to `future or past $d$-distinction'. The role of a new property\nwhich we term `$d$-reflectivity' is also discussed. We then investigate\ncontinuity properties of the Lorentzian distance and the property of\n$d$-reflectivity in non-smooth frameworks. Finally, we establish a result of\nbroader interest: the exponential map of a smooth spray is $C^{1,1}$ (smooth\noutside the zero section). Additionally, we derive a Lorentz-Finsler version of\nthe Busemann-Mayer formula and demonstrate that, in strongly causal smooth\nFinsler spacetimes, the Finsler fundamental function can be reconstructed from\nthe distance. As a consequence, distance-preserving bijections are shown to be\nLorentz-Finsler isometries in the conventional smooth sense.",

In particular, dual affine (Hessian)\ngeometry offers a powerful unification of concepts by recasting Legendre\ntransformations as coordinate changes on a manifold endowed with a strictly\nconvex potential. This viewpoint illuminates the mathematical basis of key\nthermodynamic relations, such as the mappings between internal energy U(S,V)\nand other potentials like Helmholtz or Gibbs free energies, and connects these\nideas to the broader framework of information geometry, where dual coordinate\nsystems naturally arise.\n  In this paper, we present a concise treatment of how dual affine connections\n$(\\nabla, \\nabla^*)$ emerge from a single convex potential and are directly\nrelated through Legendre transforms. This emphasizes their physical\nsignificance and the geometric interpretation of entropy maximization. We then\nexplore an energy gap integral constructed from the cubic form of the Hessian\nmetric that measures how far a system deviates from the Levi Civita connection\na self dual connection, and discuss how quantum-scale effects may render this\ngap infinite below the Planck length. Finally, we apply these concepts to black\nhole thermodynamics, showing how quantum or measurement uncertainties in\n(T,S,F,U) can be incorporated into the Hessian framework and interpreted via\nHawking radiation in a stable black hole scenario.

However, it is unclear how the model performance varies with the\ndifferent subnetwork extractions. In this paper, we choose the representation\ndimension (or embedding dimension, model dimension, the dimension of the\nresidual stream in the relevant literature) as the entry point to this issue.\nWe investigate the linear transformations in the LLM transformer blocks and\nconsider a specific structured pruning approach, SliceGPT, to extract the\nsubnetworks of different representation dimensions. We mechanistically analyse\nthe activation flow during the model forward passes, and find the\nrepresentation dimension dominates the linear transformations, model\npredictions, and, finally, the model performance. Explicit analytical relations\nare given to calculate the pruned model performance (perplexity and accuracy)\nwithout actual evaluation, and are empirically validated with\nLlama-3-8B-Instruct and Phi-3-mini-4k-Instruct.",

    "abstract": "Despite the significant advances in domain generalized stereo matching,\nexisting methods still exhibit domain-specific preferences when transferring\nfrom synthetic to real domains, hindering their practical applications in\ncomplex and diverse scenarios. The probability distributions predicted by the\nstereo network naturally encode rich similarity and uncertainty information.\nInspired by this observation, we propose to extract these two types of dark\nknowledge from the pre-trained network to model intuitive multi-modal\nground-truth distributions for both edge and non-edge regions. To mitigate the\ninherent domain preferences of a single network, we adopt network ensemble and\nfurther distinguish between objective and biased knowledge in the Laplace\nparameter space. Finally, the objective knowledge and the original disparity\nlabels are jointly modeled as a mixture of Laplacians to provide fine-grained\nsupervision for the stereo network training. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat: (1) Our method is generic and effectively improves the generalization of\nexisting networks. (2) PCWNet with our method achieves the state-of-the-art\ngeneralization performance on both KITTI 2015 and 2012 datasets. (3) Our method\noutperforms existing methods in comprehensive ranking across four popular\nreal-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "To address the power system hardening problem, traditional approaches often\nadopt robust optimization (RO) that considers a fixed set of concerned\ncontingencies, regardless of the fact that hardening some components actually\nrenders relevant contingencies impractical. In this paper, we directly adopt a\ndynamic uncertainty set that explicitly incorporates the impact of hardening\ndecisions on the worst-case contingencies, which leads to a decision-dependent\nuncertainty (DDU) set. Then, a DDU-based robust-stochastic optimization\n(DDU-RSO) model is proposed to support the hardening decisions on distribution\nlines and distributed generators (DGs). Also, the randomness of load variations\nand available storage levels is considered through stochastic programming (SP)\nin the innermost level problem. Various corrective measures (e.g., the joint\nscheduling of DGs and energy storage) are included, coupling with a finite\nsupport of stochastic scenarios, for resilience enhancement. To relieve the\ncomputation burden of this new hardening formulation, an enhanced customization\nof parametric column-and-constraint generation (P-C&CG) algorithm is developed.\nBy leveraging the network structural information, the enhancement strategies\nbased on resilience importance indices are designed to improve the convergence\nperformance. Numerical results on 33-bus and 118-bus test distribution networks\nhave demonstrated the effectiveness of DDU-RSO aided hardening scheme.\nFurthermore, in comparison to existing solution methods, the enhanced P-C&CG\nhas achieved a superior performance by reducing the solution time by a few\norders of magnitudes.",

We consider the parametric version of nrtTA, where one parameter can\nappear in clock guards of transitions. The focus of this draft is to prove that\nthe $\\omega$-language emptiness problem for 2-clock parametric nrtTA is\ndecidable. This result can be compared with the parametric version of TA, where\nthe emptiness problem for 2-clock TA with one parameter is not known to be\ndecidable.

Super-moir\\'e materials push this requirement\nto the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a\nrequirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting\nsystems.

We demonstrate our methodology with\nsuper-moir\\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body\ninteractions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent\nsymmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a\nbillion sites.

While individual translations in such cases may not be inherently biased,\nsystematic patterns-such as consistently translating certain professions with\nspecific genders-can emerge, reflecting and perpetuating societal stereotypes.\nThis ambiguity challenges traditional instance-level single-answer evaluation\napproaches, as no single gold standard translation exists. To address this, we\nintroduce GRAPE, a probability-based metric designed to evaluate gender bias by\nanalyzing aggregated model responses. Alongside this, we present GAMBIT-MT, a\nbenchmarking dataset in English with gender-ambiguous occupational terms. Using\nGRAPE, we evaluate several MT systems and examine whether their gendered\ntranslations in Greek and French align with or diverge from societal\nstereotypes, real-world occupational gender distributions, and normative\nstandards.",

In such scenarios, standard evaluation metrics are\noften biased by the disproportionate representation of the minority class.\nConducting experiments across seven datasets, we uncovered inconsistencies in\nevaluation metrics when determining the model that outperforms others for each\nbinary classification problem. This justifies the need for a metric that\nprovides a more consistent and unbiased evaluation across unbalanced datasets,\nthereby supporting robust model selection. To mitigate this problem, we propose\na novel metric, the Unbiased Integration Coefficients (UIC), which exhibits\nsignificantly reduced bias ($p < 10^{-4}$) towards the minority class compared\nto conventional metrics. The UIC is constructed by aggregating existing metrics\nwhile penalising those more prone to imbalance. In addition, we introduce the\nIdentical Partitions for Imbalance Problems (IPIP) algorithm for imbalanced ML\nproblems, an ensemble-based approach. Our experimental results show that IPIP\noutperforms other baseline imbalance-aware approaches using Random Forest and\nLogistic Regression models in three out of seven datasets as assessed by the\nUIC metric, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing imbalanced data\nchallenges in binary classification tasks.

Objective: To develop a protocol for\ndeconstructing the complex exposure pathways linking various stressors to\nadverse outcomes and to elucidate the sequential determinants contributing to\nCVD risk in depth. Methods: In this study, we developed a Path-Lasso approach,\nrooted in Adaptive Lasso regression, to construct the network and paths to\ninterpret the determinants of CVD in an in-depth way by using data from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Univariate logistic\nregression was initially employed to screen out all potential factors of\ninfluencing CVD. Then a programmed approach, using Path-Lasso technique,\nstratified covariates and established a causal network to predict CVD risk.\nResults: Age, smoking and waist circumference were identified as the most\nsignificant predictors of CVD risk. Other factors, such as race, marital\nstatus, physical activity, cadmium exposure and diabetes acted as the\nintermediary or proximal variables. All these stressors (or nodes) formed the\nnetwork with paths (or edges to link the CVD), in which the latent layer\nvariables that causally associate to the outcome are linearly formed by the\nstressors in each layer. Discussion: The Path-Lasso approach revealed the\nepidemiological pathways, linking covariates to CVD risk, which is instrumental\nin elucidating the inter-covariate transitions of their predication to the\noutcome, and providing the hierarchal network for foundation of the assessment\nof CVD risk and the beyond.",

On the\none hand, its short-term activity show high levels of magnetic activity that\ncan affect habitability and make it difficult to detect exoplanets orbiting\naround them. But on the other hand, long-term activity studies can show whether\nthese stars exhibit cyclical behavior or not in their activity, facilitating\nthe detection of planets in those periods of low magnetic activity. Aims. The\nlong-term cyclical behavior of magnetic activity can be detected studying\nseveral spectral lines and explained by different stellar dynamo models. In\nthis work, we studied the Mount Wilson $S$-index to search for evidence of\nactivity cycles possibly driven by a solar-type dynamo. Methods. We studied a\nsample of 35 dM with spectral classes ranging from dM0 to dM6. To perform this,\nwe used 2965 spectra in the optical range to build time series with extensions\nof up to 21 years. We have analysed thesm with different time-domain techniques\nto detect cyclical patterns. In addition, we have also studied the potential\nimpact of chromospheric activity on the surface brightness. Results. Using the\ncolor index (V-Ks), we have computed the chromospheric emission levels and we\nfound that the majority of the stars in the sample have low emission levels. In\nthis work, we have detected 13 potential activity cycles with a duration\nbetween 3 and 19 years and with false alarm probabilities (FAPs) less than\n0.1%. For stars with non-cyclic behaviour, we have found that the mean value of\nthe $S$-Index varies between 0.350 and 1.765 and its mean variability and\nchromospheric emission level are around 12% and -5.110 dex, respectively.

    "abstract": "Current advanced long-context language models offer great potential for\nreal-world software engineering applications. However, progress in this\ncritical domain remains hampered by a fundamental limitation: the absence of a\nrigorous evaluation framework for long code understanding. To gap this\nobstacle, we propose a long code understanding benchmark LONGCODEU from four\naspects (8 tasks) to evaluate LCLMs' long code understanding ability required\nfor practical applications, including code unit perception, intra-code unit\nunderstanding, inter-code unit relation understanding, and long code\ndocumentation understanding. We evaluate 9 popular LCLMs on LONGCODEU (i.e., 6\ngeneral models and 3 code models). Our experimental results reveal key\nlimitations in current LCLMs' capabilities for long code understanding.\nParticularly, the performance of LCLMs drops dramatically when the long code\nlength is greater than 32K, falling far short of their claimed 128K-1M context\nwindows. In the four aspects, inter-code unit relation understanding is the\nmost challenging for LCLMs. Our study provides valuable insights for optimizing\nLCLMs and driving advancements in software engineering.",

We extract the effective\nwidth of the interface in three different structures having: no-B4C, 0.24 nm,\nand 1.2 nm of B4C deposited in between the W and the Si films.

However, expanding these\nnetworks over an extended planning horizon presents one of the most complex\nchallenges in transport science. This complexity arises from the intricate\ninteractions between infrastructure availability and usage, such as network\nspillover effects and mode choice substitutions. In this paper, we approach the\nproblem from two perspectives: direct optimization methods, which generate\nnear-optimal solutions using operations research techniques, and conceptual\nheuristics, which offer intuitive and scalable algorithms grounded in network\nscience. Specifically, we compare direct welfare optimization with an inverse\nnetwork percolation approach to planning cycle superhighway extensions in\nCopenhagen. Interestingly, while the more complex optimization models yield\nbetter overall welfare results, the improvements over simpler methods are\nsmall. More importantly, we demonstrate that the increased complexity of\nplanning approaches generally makes them more vulnerable to input uncertainty,\nreflecting the bias-variance tradeoff. This issue is particularly relevant in\nthe context of long-term planning, where conditions change during the\nimplementation of the planned infrastructure expansions. Therefore, while\nplanning bicycle infrastructure is important and renders exceptionally high\nbenefit-cost ratios, considerations of robustness and ease of implementation\nmay justify the use of more straightforward network-based methods.",

The primary obstacle is that the\nexplicit positional encodings(PE), such as RoPE, need extrapolation which\ndegrades performance when the inference resolution differs from training.

The key innovations of LEDiT are\nintroducing causal attention to implicitly impart global positional information\nto tokens, while enhancing locality to precisely distinguish adjacent tokens.\nExperiments on 256x256 and 512x512 ImageNet show that LEDiT can scale the\ninference resolution to 512x512 and 1024x1024, respectively, while achieving\nbetter image quality compared to current state-of-the-art length extrapolation\nmethods(NTK-aware, YaRN). Moreover, LEDiT achieves strong extrapolation\nperformance with just 100K steps of fine-tuning on a pretrained DiT,\ndemonstrating its potential for integration into existing text-to-image DiTs.\nProject page: https://shenzhang2145.github.io/ledit/",

We apply it\nto create a background data template for weakly-supervised searches at the LHC.\nThe method smoothly transforms sideband events to match signal region mass\ndistributions. We demonstrate the performance of TRANSIT using the LHC Olympics\nR\\&D dataset. The model captures non-linear mass correlations of features and\nproduces a template that offers a competitive anomaly sensitivity compared to\nstate-of-the-art transport-based template generators. Moreover, the\ncomputational training time required for TRANSIT is an order of magnitude lower\nthan that of competing deep learning methods. This makes it ideal for analyses\nthat iterate over many signal regions and signal models. Unlike generative\nmodels, which must learn a full probability density distribution, i.e., the\ncorrelations between all the variables, the proposed transport model only has\nto learn a smooth conditional shift of the distribution. This allows for a\nsimpler, more efficient residual architecture, enabling mass uncorrelated\nfeatures to pass the network unchanged while the mass correlated features are\nadjusted accordingly. Furthermore, we show that the latent space of the model\nprovides a set of mass decorrelated features useful for anomaly detection\nwithout background sculpting.",

This study\ninvestigates the use of a local reduction method to optimize energy efficiency\nin robotic systems without compromising performance. The approach refines\nmovement parameters, minimizing energy use while maintaining precision and\noperational reliability. A three-joint robotic arm model was tested using\nsimulation over a 30-second period for various tasks, including pick-and-place\nand trajectory-following operations. The results revealed that the local\nreduction method reduced energy consumption by up to 25% compared to\ntraditional techniques such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Genetic\nAlgorithms (GA). Unlike MPC, which requires significant computational\nresources, and GA, which has slow convergence rates, the local reduction method\ndemonstrated superior adaptability and computational efficiency in real-time\napplications. The study highlights the scalability and simplicity of the local\nreduction approach, making it an attractive option for industries seeking\nsustainable and cost-effective solutions. Additionally, this method can\nintegrate seamlessly with emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence\n(AI), further enhancing its application in dynamic and complex environments.\nThis research underscores the potential of the local reduction method as a\npractical tool for optimizing robotic arm operations, reducing energy demands,\nand contributing to sustainability in industrial automation.

A\nmathematical technique has been created to forecast the onset of surge and\ninstability in a compressor chart, drawing from the nonlinear Greitzer and\nMoore model. This approach employs the phase plane and Jacobian matrix to\nidentify both stable and unstable regions within the compressor, as well as to\ncapture the limit cycle within the unstable region. A predictive analytical\napproach for anticipating compressor surge and instability is of great\nimportance in system instrumentation and control. State space model is built up\nby nonlinear Greitzer equations. Validation from previous study about especial\ncompressor will be considered for evaluation of mathematic method. Upstream\nflow acts as a disturbance to control loop and controller cannot satisfy\ndesired requirements with flow variances, ergo it is essential that controller\nis adapted to new conditions. Since control signal is linearly related to\nsystem output, a PD controller is used to control compressor system. An\nadaptive PD controller is designed with MRAS method based on a reference model.\nAdaptive controller can stabilize compressor and increase its efficiency in the\npresence of any disturbances. Simulation results shows that an adaptive\ncontroller can provide good performance and convergence in case of speed\nchanges by adapting gain parameters, and adaptive will be compared with normal\nPID.

    "abstract": "Many less-resourced languages struggle with a lack of large, task-specific\ndatasets that are required for solving relevant tasks with modern\ntransformer-based large language models (LLMs). On the other hand, many\nlinguistic resources, such as dictionaries, are rarely used in this context\ndespite their large information contents. We show how LLMs can be used to\nextend existing language resources in less-resourced languages for two\nimportant tasks: word-sense disambiguation (WSD) and word-sense induction\n(WSI). We approach the two tasks through the related but much more accessible\nword-in-context (WiC) task where, given a pair of sentences and a target word,\na classification model is tasked with predicting whether the sense of a given\nword differs between sentences. We demonstrate that a well-trained model for\nthis task can distinguish between different word senses and can be adapted to\nsolve the WSD and WSI tasks. The advantage of using the WiC task, instead of\ndirectly predicting senses, is that the WiC task does not need pre-constructed\nsense inventories with a sufficient number of examples for each sense, which\nare rarely available in less-resourced languages. We show that sentence pairs\nfor the WiC task can be successfully generated from dictionary examples using\nLLMs. The resulting prediction models outperform existing models on WiC, WSD,\nand WSI tasks. We demonstrate our methodology on the Slovene language, where a\nmonolingual dictionary is available, but word-sense resources are tiny.",

Manual delineation of gliomas is time-consuming and\nprone to variability, motivating the use of deep learning to improve\nconsistency and alleviate clinical workload. However, existing methods often\nfail to fully exploit the information available in multi-parametric MRI\n(mp-MRI), particularly inter-slice contextual features, and typically require\nconsiderable computational resources while lacking robustness across tumor type\nvariations. We present GBT-SAM, a parameter-efficient deep learning framework\nthat adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a large-scale vision model, to\nvolumetric mp-MRI data. GBT-SAM reduces input complexity by selecting fewer\nthan 2.6\\% of slices per scan while incorporating all four MRI modalities,\npreserving essential tumor-related information with minimal cost. Furthermore,\nour model is trained by a two-step fine-tuning strategy that incorporates a\ndepth-aware module to capture inter-slice correlations and lightweight\nadaptation layers, resulting in just 6.5M trainable parameters, which is the\nlowest among SAM-based approaches. GBT-SAM achieves a Dice Score of 93.54 on\nthe BraTS Adult Glioma dataset and demonstrates robust performance on\nMeningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets.

Most tracking systems\nhave limitations such as constraining all movement to a 2D plane and they often\ntrack only one object. In this paper, we present a new modular pipeline that\ncalculates 3D trajectories of multiple objects. It is adaptable to various\nsettings where multiple time-synced and stationary cameras record moving\nobjects, using off the shelf webcams. Our pipeline was tested on the Table\nSetting Dataset, where participants are recorded with various sensors as they\nset a table with tableware objects. We need to track these manipulated objects,\nusing 6 rgb webcams. Challenges include: Detecting small objects in 9.874.699\ncamera frames, determining camera poses, discriminating between nearby and\noverlapping objects, temporary occlusions, and finally calculating a 3D\ntrajectory using the right subset of an average of 11.12.456 pixel coordinates\nper 3-minute trial. We implement a robust pipeline that results in accurate\ntrajectories with covariance of x,y,z-position as a confidence metric. It deals\ndynamically with appearing and disappearing objects, instantiating new Extended\nKalman Filters.

Optical spectroscopy of the afterglow, obtained by GTC and Keck,\nidentified the redshift of $z = 1.6734$. EP240801a exhibits a burst duration of\n148 s in X-rays and 22.3 s in gamma-rays, with X-rays leading by 80.61 s.\nSpectral lag analysis indicates the gamma-ray signal arrived 8.3 s earlier than\nthe X-rays. Joint spectral fitting of EP/WXT and Fermi/GBM data yields an\nisotropic energy $E_{\\gamma,\\rm{iso}} = (5.57^{+0.54}_{-0.50})\\times\n10^{51}\\,\\rm{erg}$, a peak energy $E_{\\rm{peak}} =\n14.90^{+7.08}_{-4.71}\\,\\rm{keV}$, a fluence ratio $\\rm\nS(25-50\\,\\rm{keV})/S(50-100\\,\\rm{keV}) = 1.67^{+0.74}_{-0.46}$, classifying\nEP240801a as an X-ray flash (XRF). The host-galaxy continuum spectrum, inferred\nusing Prospector, was used to correct its contribution for the observed\noutburst optical data. Unusual early $R$-band behavior and EP/FXT observations\nsuggest multiple components in the afterglow. Three models are considered:\ntwo-component jet model, forward-reverse shock model and forward-shock model\nwith energy injection. Both three provide reasonable explanations. The\ntwo-component jet model and the energy injection model imply a relatively small\ninitial energy and velocity of the jet in the line of sight, while the\nforward-reverse shock model remains typical. Under the two-component jet model,\nEP240801a may resemble GRB 221009A (BOAT) if the bright narrow beam is viewed\non-axis. Therefore, EP240801a can be interpreted as an off-beam (narrow) jet or\nan intrinsically weak GRB jet. Our findings provide crucial clues for\nuncovering the origin of XRFs.",

    "abstract": "This study leverages spatial machine learning (SML) to enhance the accuracy\nof Proxy Means Testing (PMT) for poverty targeting in Indonesia. Conventional\nPMT methodologies are prone to exclusion and inclusion errors due to their\ninability to account for spatial dependencies and regional heterogeneity. By\nintegrating spatial contiguity matrices, SML models mitigate these limitations,\nfacilitating a more precise identification and comparison of geographical\npoverty clusters. Utilizing household survey data from the Social Welfare\nIntegrated Data Survey (DTKS) for the periods 2016 to 2020 and 2016 to 2021,\nthis study examines spatial patterns in income distribution and delineates\npoverty clusters at both provincial and district levels. Empirical findings\nindicate that the proposed SML approach reduces exclusion errors from 28% to\n20% compared to standard machine learning models, underscoring the critical\nrole of spatial analysis in refining machine learning-based poverty targeting.\nThese results highlight the potential of SML to inform the design of more\nequitable and effective social protection policies, particularly in\ngeographically diverse contexts. Future research can explore the applicability\nof spatiotemporal models and assess the generalizability of SML approaches\nacross varying socio-economic settings.",

AI risk assessment has so far focused on measuring the\nmodels' capabilities, but the capabilities of models are only indicators of\nrisk, not measures of risk. Better modeling and quantification of AI risk\nscenarios can help bridge this disconnect and link the capabilities of LLMs to\ntangible real-world harm. This paper makes an early contribution to this field\nby demonstrating how existing AI benchmarks can be used to facilitate the\ncreation of risk estimates. We describe the results of a pilot study in which\nexperts use information from Cybench, an AI benchmark, to generate probability\nestimates.

While\nprevious research explored the features of robots that influence overall trust\nattitude, it remains unclear whether these features affect behavioral trust.\nAdditionally, there is limited investigation into which features of robots\ninfluence cognitive and emotional attitudes, and how these attitudes impact\nhumans' willingness to delegate new tasks to robots. This study examines the\ninterplay between competence, autonomy, and personality traits of robots and\ntheir impact on trust attitudes (cognitive and affective trust) and trust\nbehavior (task delegation), within the context of task-oriented Human-Robot\nInteraction. Our findings indicate that robot competence is a key determinant\nof trust, influencing cognitive, affective, and behavioral trust. In contrast,\nrobot personality traits significantly impact only affective trust without\naffecting cognitive trust or trust behavior. In addition, autonomy was found to\nmoderate the relationship between competence and cognitive trust, as well as\nbetween personality and affective trust. Finally, cognitive trust was found to\npositively influence task delegation, whereas affective trust did not show a\nsignificant effect.

The NAP formulated by\nTejeda \\& Rosswog (TR13) for Schwarzschild spacetime has been applied to the\nstandard thin accretion disk around a black hole (BH) as well as in the context\nof streamlines of noninteracting particles accreting onto a Schwarzschild BH,\nshowing good agreement with the exact relativistic solutions. As a further\napplication, here we explore the extent to which TR13 NAP could describe a\ntransonic hydrodynamical spherical accretion flow in Schwarzschild spacetime\nwithin the framework of standard Newtonian hydrodynamics. Instead of obtaining\na typical single \"saddle-type\" sonic transition, a \"saddle-spiral pair\" is\nproduced, with the inner sonic point being an (unphysical) \"spiral type\" and\nthe outer being a usual \"saddle type.\" The Bondi accretion rate at outer sonic\nradii, however, remains consistent with that of the GR case. The primary reason\nfor the deviation of our findings from the classical Bondi solution is likely\ndue to the inconsistency between the Euler-type equation in the presence of\nvelocity-dependent TR13 NAP within the standard Newtonian hydrodynamics\nframework, and the corresponding GR Euler equation, regardless of the fluid's\nenergy. Our study suggests that a (modified) hydrodynamical formalism is needed\nto effectively implement such potentials in transonic accretion studies that\nalign with the spirit of TR13-like NAP, while remaining consistent with the GR\nhydrodynamics.

    "abstract": "Computing students increasingly rely on generative AI tools for programming\nassistance, often without formal instruction or guidance. This highlights a\nneed to teach students how to effectively interact with AI models, particularly\nthrough natural language prompts, to generate and critically evaluate code for\nsolving computational tasks. To address this, we developed a novel platform for\nprompt programming that enables authentic dialogue-based interactions, supports\nproblems involving multiple interdependent functions, and offers on-request\nexecution of generated code. Data analysis from over 900 students in an\nintroductory programming course revealed high engagement, with the majority of\nprompts occurring within multi-turn dialogues. Problems with multiple\ninterdependent functions encouraged iterative refinement, with progression\ngraphs highlighting several common strategies. Students were highly selective\nabout the code they chose to test, suggesting that on-request execution of\ngenerated code promoted critical thinking. Given the growing importance of\nlearning dialogue-based programming with AI, we provide this tool as a publicly\naccessible resource, accompanied by a corpus of programming problems for\neducational use.",

    "abstract": "Satellite communication systems (SCSs) used for tactical purposes require\nrobust security and anti-jamming capabilities, making frequency hopping (FH) a\npowerful option. However, the current FH systems face challenges due to\nsignificant interference from other devices and the considerable path loss\ninherent in satellite communication. This misalignment leads to inefficient\nsynchronization, crucial for maintaining reliable communication. Traditional\nmethods, such as those employing long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, have\nmade improvements, but they still struggle in dynamic conditions of satellite\nenvironments. This paper presents a novel method for synchronizing FH signals\nin tactical SCSs by combining serial search and reinforcement learning to\nachieve coarse and fine acquisition, respectively. The mathematical analysis\nand simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the average\nnumber of hops required for synchronization by 58.17% and mean squared error\n(MSE) of the uplink hop timing estimation by 76.95%, as compared to the\nconventional serial search method. Comparing with the early late gate\nsynchronization method based on serial search and use of LSTM network, the\naverage number of hops for synchronization is reduced by 12.24% and the MSE by\n18.5%.",

    "abstract": "Agile software development is becoming increasingly popular in the aerospace\nindustry because of its capability to accommodate requirement changes. However,\nsafety-critical domains require compliance with strict regulations such as the\nDO-178C avionics standard, which demands thorough documentation. The main\nchallenge of this constraint is not the content itself, but rather the\ncomprehensive traceability from system-level requirements to all sorts of\ntesting and verification evidence, including who did what, when, and to which\nartifact. Currently, this is mostly a manual activity performed at the end of\nthe project, which blocks efforts to agilize the development of software for\naerospace applications. In this paper, we present a strategy and tools that\nsupport the generation of continuous documentation complying with DO-178C\nrequirements. By iteratively creating the DO-178C documentation associated with\neach software component and seamlessly merging it with the previously generated\ndocumentation, we open the way to truly continuous certifiable iterations, an\nevolution from the current Waterfallish industry practice. The proposed\nmechanisms and tools were co-designed and validated with aerospace industry\nprofessionals, thereby confirming its applicability and usefulness.

While the three states can\nbe interpreted as $\\Sigma_c\\bar{D}^{(*)}$ molecular states within EFT\nframeworks, this is not feasible in the single-channel OBE model with\nconsistent cutoff. In this work, the possibility to reconcile OBE model with\nEFTs by refitting the $\\rho$-, $\\omega$- and $\\sigma$-exchange interaction is\nexplored and ruled out. It is pointed out that the problem in OBE arises from\nthe strong short-range spin-dependent one-pion-exchange (OPE) interaction and\nthe fixed signs of other short-range interactions in OBE model also prevent the\ncancellation. To address this issue, the short-range subtraction strategies\nwithin the OBE model are revisited. Two subtraction schemes are explored:\nremoving the delta-function from all interactions and eliminating it only from\nthe pseudoscalar-meson-exchange component. These schemes favor different spin\nassignments for $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4440)$ and $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4457)$. Though solving\nthe problem, there is no clear dynamical picture to support the subtraction\nschemes. We propose a new quark-exchange mechanism motivated by the Pauli\nprinciple. Different from the two subtraction schemes in OBE, the\nquark-exchange mechanism offers an explanation grounded in microscopic\ndynamics. It is shown that the spin-dependent quark-exchange interaction\ncancels those from OPE. The differences in the predictions for the spin,\nisospin, and open-charm partner states of the experimental $P_{c\\bar{c}}$\nstates offer a way to distinguish between the subtracted OBE model and the OBE\nmodel with quark-exchange contributions.",

    "abstract": "A high degree of linear polarization measured in the optical emission is an\nimportant observational feature of blazars. It provides strong evidence of the\npresence of relativistic particles and magnetic field ordering in the\nnon-thermal emission regions of blazars owing to the synchrotron nature of low\nenergy radiation. Thus, the polarization studies of blazars are emerging as a\npromising approach to probe the particle acceleration and the physical\nprocesses involved in their broadband emission. In this work, we investigate\nthe behavior of the optical polarization of the blazar 1ES 1959+650 measured\nover a decade using the spectropolarimetry (SPOL) at the Steward Observatory.\nWe use measurements of the degree of linear polarization and angle of\npolarization in the wavelength range 500 - 700 nm available during the period\nOctober 1, 2008 and June 30, 2018 (MJD 54739 - 58299) from the SPOL\nobservations. Near simultaneous photometry data in the R and V bands are also\nused to study the optical emission from the source. The maximum degree of\nlinear polarization, measured as $\\sim$ 8.5$\\%$, is significantly larger than\nthe long term average value of $\\sim$ 4.6$\\%$. Analysis of the light curves\nindicates that the optical emission from the blazar 1ES 1959+650 is highly\nvariable and variability in the degree of linear polarization can be quantified\nby a fractional variability amplitude of $\\sim$ 39$\\%$ over the period of about\nten years. Long term optical emission in the R and V bands is very weakly\nanti-correlated with the degree of linear polarization. Modelling of the\npolarization due to the synchrotron emission suggests that the observed degree\nof linear polarization can be broadly reproduced by a power law distribution of\nrelativistic electrons gyrating in a spherical emission region permeated with\nchaotic and ordered magnetic fields.",

We explore the\ninterrelationships between key galaxy properties associated with star\nformation, with a particular focus on the impact of dark matter halos. Given\nthe sensitivity of atomic hydrogen (HI) to external processes, we concentrate\nexclusively on central spiral galaxies. We find that the molecular-to-atomic\ngas mass ratio ($M_{\\rm H_2}/M_{\\rm HI}$) strongly depends on stellar mass and\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR). In the star formation efficiency\n(SFE)-sSFR plane, most galaxies fall below the H$_2$ fundamental formation\nrelation (FFR), with SFE$_{\\rm HI}$ being consistently lower than SFE$_{\\rm\nH_2}$. Using the improved halo masses derived by Zhao et al.

This trend\nultimately leads to the unsustainable state where SFE$_{\\rm HI}$ exceeds\nSFE$_{\\rm H_2}$ at halo mass around $10^{12} \\hbox{$M_{\\odot}$}$.

    "abstract": "Offline optimization has recently emerged as an increasingly popular approach\nto mitigate the prohibitively expensive cost of online experimentation. The key\nidea is to learn a surrogate of the black-box function that underlines the\ntarget experiment using a static (offline) dataset of its previous input-output\nqueries. Such an approach is, however, fraught with an out-of-distribution\nissue where the learned surrogate becomes inaccurate outside the offline data\nregimes. To mitigate this, existing offline optimizers have proposed numerous\nconditioning techniques to prevent the learned surrogate from being too\nerratic. Nonetheless, such conditioning strategies are often specific to\nparticular surrogate or search models, which might not generalize to a\ndifferent model choice. This motivates us to develop a model-agnostic approach\ninstead, which incorporates a notion of model sharpness into the training loss\nof the surrogate as a regularizer. Our approach is supported by a new\ntheoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing surrogate sharpness on the\noffline dataset provably reduces its generalized sharpness on unseen data. Our\nanalysis extends existing theories from bounding generalized prediction loss\n(on unseen data) with loss sharpness to bounding the worst-case generalized\nsurrogate sharpness with its empirical estimate on training data, providing a\nnew perspective on sharpness regularization.

    "abstract": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown astounding capabilities of\ncode understanding and synthesis. In order to assess such capabilities, several\nbenchmarks have been devised (e.g., HumanEval). However, most benchmarks focus\non code synthesis from natural language instructions. Hence, such benchmarks do\nnot test for other forms of code understanding. Moreover, there have been\nconcerns about contamination and leakage. That is, benchmark problems (or\nclosely related problems) may appear in training set, strongly biasing\nbenchmark results. In this work we investigate whether large language models\ncan correctly predict runtime program behavior. To this end, we introduce\nThrowBench, a benchmark consisting of over 2,400 short user-written programs\nwritten in four different programming languages. The majority of these programs\nthrow an exception during runtime (due to a bug). LLMs are asked to predict\nwhether a presented program throws an exception and, if so, which one.\nEvaluating our benchmark on six state-of-the-art code LLMs we see modest\nperformance ranging from 19 to 38% (F1 score). Benchmarking a wider set of code\ncapabilities could improve the assessment of code LLMs and help identify weak\npoints in current models. Moreover, as ground-truth answers have been\ndetermined through program execution, leakage is not a concern. We release\nThrowBench as well as all of our results together with this work.",

By reformulating the joint optimization problem into an\nequivalent functional optimization problem for the scheduling and precoding\npolicies, we propose a GNN-based architecture consisting of two cascaded\nmodules to learn the two policies.

We classified the geophysical signals\ninto four distinct categories: oceanic, meteorological, hydrological, and solid\nEarth, focusing primarily on the first three categories in this study. In our\nexamination of oceanic processes, we identified notable mass anomalies in the\nArgentine basin, specifically within the Zapiola Rise, where persistent\nremnants of the rotating dipole-like modes are evident in the LGD post-fit\nresiduals. Our analysis extended to the Gulf of Carpentaria and Australia\nduring the 2013 Oswald cyclone, revealing significant LGD residual anomalies\nthat correlate with cyclone tracking and precipitation data. Additionally, we\ninvestigated the monsoon seasons in Bangladesh, particularly from June to\nSeptember 2007, where we observed peaks in sub-monthly variability. These\nfindings were further validated by demonstrating high spatial and temporal\ncorrelations between gridded LGD residuals and ITSG-Grace2018 daily solutions.\nGiven that these anomalies are associated with significant mass change\nphenomena, it is essential to integrate the post-fit residuals into a\nhigh-frequency mass change framework, with the purpose of providing enhanced\nspatial resolution compared to conventional Kalman-filtered methods.",

    "abstract": "In evolutionary multi-objective optimization, the indicator-based subset\nselection problem involves finding a subset of points that maximizes a given\nquality indicator. Local search is an effective approach for obtaining a\nhigh-quality subset in this problem. However, local search requires high\ncomputational cost, especially as the size of the point set and the number of\nobjectives increase. To address this issue, this paper proposes a candidate\nlist strategy for local search in the indicator-based subset selection problem.\nIn the proposed strategy, each point in a given point set has a candidate list.\nDuring search, each point is only eligible to swap with unselected points in\nits associated candidate list. This restriction drastically reduces the number\nof swaps at each iteration of local search. We consider two types of candidate\nlists: nearest neighbor and random neighbor lists. This paper investigates the\neffectiveness of the proposed candidate list strategy on various Pareto fronts.\nThe results show that the proposed strategy with the nearest neighbor list can\nsignificantly speed up local search on continuous Pareto fronts without\nsignificantly compromising the subset quality. The results also show that the\nsequential use of the two lists can address the discontinuity of Pareto fronts.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we consider a random search process with stochastic resetting\nand a partially accessible target $\\calU$. That is, when the searcher finds the\ntarget by attaching to its surface $\\partial \\calU$ it does not have immediate\naccess to the resources within the target interior. After a random waiting\ntime, the searcher either gains access to the resources within or detaches and\ncontinues its search process. We also assume that the searcher requires an\nalternating sequence of periods of bulk diffusion interspersed with local\nsurface interactions before being able to attach to the surface. The\nattachment, detachment and target entry events are the analogs of adsorption,\ndesorption and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in\nphysical chemistry. In applications to animal foraging, the resources could\nrepresent food or shelter while resetting corresponds to an animal returning to\nits home base. We begin by considering a Brownian particle on the half-line\nwith a partially accessible target at the origin $x=0$. We calculate the\nnon-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) in the case of reversible adsorption\nand obtain the corresponding first passage time (FPT) density for absorption\nwhen adsorption is only partially reversible. We then reformulate the\nstochastic process in terms of a pair of renewal equations that relate the\nprobability density and FPT density for absorption in terms of the\ncorresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations\nallow us to incorporate non-Markovian models of absorption and desorption. They\nalso provide a useful decomposition of quantities such as the mean FPT (MFPT)\nin terms of the number of desorption events and the statistics of the waiting\ntime density. Finally, we consider various extensions of the theory, including\nhigher-dimensional search processes and an encounter-based model of absorption.",

Naturally, the uncertainty type plays a crucial\nrole in developing decision-making strategies that manage complexity\neffectively. In this paper, we focus on a specific form of uncertainty known as\nepistemic ambivalence (EA), which emerges from conflicting pieces of evidence\nor contradictory experiences. It creates a delicate interplay between\nuncertainty and confidence, distinguishing it from epistemic uncertainty that\ntypically diminishes with new information. Indeed, ambivalence can persist even\nafter additional knowledge is acquired. To address this phenomenon, we propose\na novel framework, called the epistemically ambivalent Markov decision process\n(EA-MDP), aiming to understand and control EA in decision-making processes.\nThis framework incorporates the concept of a quantum state from the quantum\nmechanics formalism, and its core is to assess the probability and reward of\nevery possible outcome. We calculate the reward function using quantum\nmeasurement techniques and prove the existence of an optimal policy and an\noptimal value function in the EA-MDP framework. We also propose the\nEA-epsilon-greedy Q-learning algorithm. To evaluate the impact of EA on\ndecision-making and the expedience of our framework, we study two distinct\nexperimental setups, namely the two-state problem and the lattice problem. Our\nresults show that using our methods, the agent converges to the optimal policy\nin the presence of EA.",

Therefore, in\nthis study, we explore whether adopting comfort-orientated postural movements,\nbased on the literature, mitigates cybersickness. We conducted an exploratory\nanalysis using a cumulative link mixed model (CLMM) on secondary data from a\nVR-based postural alignment experiment. Results indicate that misalignment\nbetween trunk roll and the virtual trajectory increases the odds of reporting\nhigher cybersickness scores by 5%. Additionally, each additional minute in VR\nincreases the odds of reporting higher cybersickness scores (FMS scores) by 11%\n%, but prolonged exposure leads to a 75% % reduction in the odds of reporting\ncybersickness symptoms, suggesting adaptation effects. Individual differences\nalso play a role, with higher cybersickness susceptibility increasing the odds\nof reporting higher symptom severity by 8%. These findings indicate that\nanticipatory postural adaptation could serve as a natural mitigation strategy\nfor cybersickness.

    "abstract": "Deep learning and language models are increasingly dominating automated\nprogram repair research. While previous generate-and-validate approaches were\nable to find and use fix ingredients on a file or even project level, neural\nlanguage models are limited to the code that fits their input window. In this\nwork we investigate how important identifier ingredients are in neural program\nrepair and present ScanFix, an approach that leverages an additional scanner\nmodel to extract identifiers from a bug's file and potentially project-level\ncontext. We find that lack of knowledge of far-away identifiers is an important\ncause of failed repairs. Augmenting repair model input with scanner-extracted\nidentifiers yields relative improvements of up to 31%. However, ScanFix is\noutperformed by a model with a large input window (> 5k tokens). When passing\ningredients from the ground-truth fix, improvements are even higher. This shows\nthat, with refined extraction techniques, ingredient scanning, similar to fix\ncandidate ranking, could have the potential to become an important subtask of\nfuture automated repair systems. At the same time, it also demonstrates that\nthis idea is subject to Sutton's bitter lesson and may be rendered unnecessary\nby new code models with ever-increasing context windows.",

In this work, we\npresent the development of a Cherenkov radiation detector designed for a muon\ntomography system with high spatial resolution, employing wavelength-shifting\n(WLS) fiber readout. The detector consists of two large-area Cherenkov\nradiators, each measuring 1 m x 1 m, with each read out by WLS fibers arranged\northogonally to determine the x and y coordinates of muon hit positions. The\nsystem is modeled using the GEANT4 simulation package, and the achieved\nposition resolution is is 1.8 mm+-0.1 (FWHM). The detector is inherently\ninsensitive to natural background radiation and exhibits directional\nsensitivity, which helps prevent image blurring caused by muons scattered from\nthe Earth's surface and entering the detector from the rear.

We\nfirst investigate spherical wave propagation and various SnS characteristics\nand construct an SnS near-field channel model for XL-MIMO systems. Due to the\nlimitations of uniform array partitioning in capturing SnS, we analyze the\nadverse effects of the non-ideal array segmentation (over- and\nunder-segmentation) on CE accuracy. To counter these issues, we develop a\ndynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm\n(DHBF-PSSP), which integrates power measurements with a dynamic hybrid\nbeamforming structure to enable joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A\npower-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS) algorithm leverages the statistical\nproperties of power profiles, while subarray decoupling is achieved via a\nsubarray segmentation-based sampling method (SS-SM) under radio frequency (RF)\nchain constraints. For subarray CE, we propose a subarray segmentation-based\nassorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple\nmeasurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV).

    "abstract": "Superheated steam is widely employed in various energy systems, particularly\nin power plants, chemical industries, and other applications where\nhigh-temperature and high-pressure steam is essential for efficient energy\nconversion and process control. In these systems, regulation valves are crucial\ncomponents that control the flow of steam, adjusting its pressure and\ntemperature to ensure safe and efficient operation. Accurate understanding and\nprediction of temperature variations within regulation valves are essential for\noptimizing their performance and improving the overall system efficiency. This\nstudy investigates the temperature variations of superheated steam flowing\nthrough a regulation valve using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations\ncombined with Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) techniques. The analysis\nbegins with an examination of the internal flow field parameters, including\ntemperature and pressure, to understand the overall fluid dynamics within the\nvalve. POD is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the CFD results. Singular\nValue Decomposition (SVD) is employed to extract the dominant modes that\ncapture the key flow structures responsible for heat transfer and temperature\nfluctuations. The POD analysis reveals that the most influential modes are\nassociated with regions of high turbulence intensity and significant\ntemperature gradients, which are critical to the thermal performance of the\nsteam flow through the regulation valve. The application of POD to 3D CFD\nresults represents a novel approach, particularly for complex fluid flow models\nsuch as steam flow through regulation valves. The insights gained from this\nstudy have practical implications for the design and optimization of\ntemperature and pressure regulation valves in energy systems, providing a\ntheoretical foundation for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of these\nsystems.",

Although human perceptual and cognitive\ncapacities enable us to process and remember visual information, these\nabilities are constrained by several factors, such as limited attentional\nresources and the finite capacity of visual memory. When visual stimuli are\nprocessed by human visual system into brain signals, some information is\ninevitably lost, leading to a discrepancy known as the \\textbf{System GAP}.\nAdditionally, perceptual and cognitive dynamics, along with technical noise in\nsignal acquisition, degrade the fidelity of brain signals relative to the\nvisual stimuli, known as the \\textbf{Random GAP}. When encoded brain\nrepresentations are directly aligned with the corresponding pretrained image\nfeatures, the System GAP and Random GAP between paired data challenge the\nmodel, requiring it to bridge these gaps. However, in the context of limited\npaired data, these gaps are difficult for the model to learn, leading to\noverfitting and poor generalization to new data. To address these GAPs, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach called the \\textbf{Uncertainty-aware\nBlur Prior (UBP)}.

Synchronization errors, reliance on the Clearsky\nindex (ratio of the global horizontal irradiance to its cloud-free counterpart)\nand high sensitivity of the clearsky model to errors in aerosol optical depth\nat low solar elevation limit their added value in real-time applications. This\npaper explores the feasibility of short-term forecasting without relying on a\nclearsky model. We propose a Clearsky-Free forecasting approach using Extreme\nLearning Machine (ELM) models. ELM learns daily periodicity and local\nvariability directly from raw Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) data.

Our approach is a non-linear adaptative\nstatistical method that implicitely learns the irradiance in cloud-free\nconditions removing the need for an clear-sky model and the related operational\nissues. Deterministic and probabilistic results are compared to traditional\nbenchmarks, including ARMA with McClear-generated Clearsky data and quantile\nregression for probabilistic forecasts.

While prior work has developed efficient algorithms for the\noptimizer in special cases - such as structured auction settings or contract\ndesign - no general efficient algorithm is known.\n  In this paper, we establish a strong computational hardness result: unless\n$\\mathsf{P} = \\mathsf{NP}$, no polynomial-time optimizer can compute a\nnear-optimal strategy against a learner using a standard no-regret algorithm,\nspecifically Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU). Our result proves an\n$\\Omega(T)$ hardness bound, significantly strengthening previous work that only\nshowed an additive $\\Theta(1)$ impossibility result. Furthermore, while the\nprior hardness result focused on learners using fictitious play - an algorithm\nthat is not no-regret - we prove intractability for a widely used no-regret\nlearning algorithm. This establishes a fundamental computational barrier to\nfinding optimal strategies in general game-theoretic settings.",

Here, we investigate how membranes of two\nperovskite archetypes, antiferroelectric PbZrO3 and paraelectric SrTiO3, are\naffected by water-based etching step. Using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray\ndiffraction, we find evidence that hydrogen penetrates the perovskite\nstructure.

This confirms a conjecture by Huang, Tang, Wu, and Zhang\n(TALG 2019), stating that the primal-dual analysis could lead to a competitive\nratio that is very close to $0.696$. Our analysis involves proper\ndiscretizations of a variational problem and uses LP solver to pin down the\nnumerical number. As a bonus of our discretization approach, our competitive\nanalysis of Ranking applies to a more relaxed random arrival model. E.g., we\nshow that even when each online vertex arrives independently at an early or\nlate stage, the Ranking algorithm is at least $0.665$-competitive, beating the\n$1-1/e \\approx 0.632$ competitive ratio under the adversarial arrival model.",

To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a nonintrusive\nand privacy friendly personalized emotion recognition system, EmotionVibe,\nwhich leverages footstep induced floor vibrations for emotion recognition. The\nmain idea of EmotionVibe is that individuals' emotional states influence their\ngait patterns, subsequently affecting the floor vibrations induced by their\nfootsteps. However, there are two main research challenges: 1) the complex and\nindirect relationship between human emotions and footstep induced floor\nvibrations and 2) the large between person variations within the relationship\nbetween emotions and gait patterns. To address these challenges, we first\nempirically characterize this complex relationship and develop an emotion\nsensitive feature set including gait related and vibration related features\nfrom footstep induced floor vibrations. Furthermore, we personalize the emotion\nrecognition system for each user by calculating gait similarities between the\ntarget person (i.e., the person whose emotions we aim to recognize) and those\nin the training dataset and assigning greater weights to training people with\nsimilar gait patterns in the loss function. We evaluated our system in a\nreal-world walking experiment with 20 participants, summing up to 37,001\nfootstep samples.

But to date, an efficient\nroom-temperature Organic Spin Valve device has not been experimentally realized\ndue to the complicated spin transport at the metal-organic interfaces. These\nstudies are always challenging due to the complicated spin-polarized charge\ntransfer at the metal-organic interfaces. The present study focuses on a\ncomprehensive understanding of the interfacial properties that are essential\nfor advancing device performance and functionality. The Ferromagnetic metals\nand half-metallic electrodes such as Co, Co2FeAl, etc., and fullerene (C60)\nbilayer samples are prepared and studied via different structural and magnetic\ncharacterizations. Due to the mechanical softness of C60, deep penetration of\nferromagnetic metal atoms is observed inside the C60 film. In-situ MOKE\nmeasurements reveal the origin of the 23 {\\AA} thick magnetic dead layer at the\ninterface, which is attributed to the diffused ferromagnetic clusters\nexhibiting superparamagnetic behavior. In contrast to the inorganic substrates,\nmagnetic anisotropy tends to develop at 40 {\\AA} thick Co film deposited on C60\nwhich enhances with increasing thickness. The XRD measurements confirm the\npresence of in-plane compressive strain and texturing along the hcp (002) phase\nin the Co film. The anomaly observed in the hard axis of magnetization is due\nto high dispersion in the local magnetic anisotropy. The variation of the\nmagnetic anisotropy axis is observed in the Co2FeAlwedge deposited in the\nproximity of C60. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex\ninterplay between ferromagnetic materials and organic semiconductors offering\npotential avenues for tailoring magnetoresistance effects and fundamental\nunderstanding of organic spintronic devices.",

    "abstract": "There are many deep learning (DL) powered mobile and wearable applications\ntoday continuously and unobtrusively sensing the ambient surroundings to\nenhance all aspects of human lives.To enable robust and private mobile sensing,\nDL models are often deployed locally on resource-constrained mobile devices\nusing techniques such as model compression or offloading.However, existing\nmethods, either front-end algorithm level (i.e. DL model\ncompression/partitioning) or back-end scheduling level (i.e. operator/resource\nscheduling), cannot be locally online because they require offline retraining\nto ensure accuracy or rely on manually pre-defined strategies, struggle with\ndynamic adaptability.The primary challenge lies in feeding back runtime\nperformance from the back-end level to the front-end level optimization\ndecision. Moreover, the adaptive mobile DL model porting middleware with\ncross-level co-adaptation is less explored, particularly in mobile environments\nwith diversity and dynamics. In response, we introduce CrowdHMTware, a dynamic\ncontext-adaptive DL model deployment middleware for heterogeneous mobile\ndevices. It establishes an automated adaptation loop between cross-level\nfunctional components, i.e. elastic inference, scalable offloading, and\nmodel-adaptive engine, enhancing scalability and adaptability. Experiments with\nfour typical tasks across 15 platforms and a real-world case study demonstrate\nthat CrowdHMTware can effectively scale DL model, offloading, and engine\nactions across diverse platforms and tasks. It hides run-time system issues\nfrom developers, reducing the required developer expertise.",

This raises the following\nquestions: (1) how to regulate the sensitivity of a surrogate model; and (2)\nwhether conditioning an offline optimizer with such less sensitive surrogate\nwill lead to better optimization performance. To address these questions, we\ndevelop an optimizable sensitivity measurement for the surrogate model, which\nthen inspires a sensitivity-informed regularizer that is applicable to a wide\nrange of offline optimizers.

    "abstract": "The detection of gamma-ray signals from primordial black holes (PBHs) could\nprovide compelling evidence for their role as a dark matter candidate,\nparticularly through the observation of their Hawking radiation. Future\ngamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM, and the next-generation\ntelescopes, are poised to explore this possibility by measuring both Standard\nModel (SM) and beyond-the-SM particle emissions. A particularly promising\navenue involves production of dark photons by PBHs, which is a hypothetical\nparticle that decays into photons. In this work, we investigate the trident\ndecay of dark photons focusing on their primary emission from PBHs. We assume\nthat the dark photons produced via Hawking radiation decay into photons well\nbefore reaching Earth, thereby enhancing the detectable gamma-ray flux. The\nenergy spectrum of the photons decaying from the dark photons is distinct from\nthat of direct Hawking-radiated photons due to higher degree of freedom,\nleading to observable modifications in the gamma-ray signal. Using the\nasteroid-mass PBHs as a case study, we demonstrate that future gamma-ray\nmissions could detect dark-photon signatures and distinguish them from\nconventional Hawking radiation. This approach enables the exploration of\npreviously inaccessible parameter spaces in dark photon mass $m_{A^{\\prime}}$\nand their coupling to photons, offering a novel pathway to uncover the\nproperties of dark sectors and the nature of PBHs.",

In this\narticle, we propose a surveillance video assisted federated digital twin\n(SV-FDT) framework to empower ITSs with pedestrians and vehicles in-the-loop.\nSpecifically, SVFDT builds comprehensive pedestrian-vehicle interaction models\nby leveraging multi-source traffic surveillance videos.

We analyze key design requirements and\nchallenges and present core guidelines for SVFDT's system implementation. A\ntestbed evaluation demonstrates its effectiveness in optimizing traffic\nmanagement. Comparisons with traditional terminal-server frameworks highlight\nSV-FDT's advantages in mirroring delays, recognition accuracy, and subjective\nevaluation.

Our\nmulti-turn-to-single-turn (M2S) methods -- Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize\n-- systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn\nprompts. Despite removing iterative back-and-forth interactions, these prompts\npreserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the\nMulti-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods achieve attack success\nrates from 70.6 percent to 95.9 percent across several state-of-the-art LLMs.\nRemarkably, the single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks\nby as much as 17.5 percentage points while cutting token usage by more than\nhalf on average. Further analysis shows that embedding malicious requests in\nenumerated or code-like structures exploits ``contextual blindness'', bypassing\nboth native guardrails and external input-output filters.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to model user preferences based on historical\nbehavior sequences, which is crucial for various online platforms. Data\nsparsity remains a significant challenge in this area as most users have\nlimited interactions and many items receive little attention. To mitigate this\nissue, contrastive learning has been widely adopted. By constructing positive\nsample pairs from the data itself and maximizing their agreement in the\nembedding space,it can leverage available data more effectively. Constructing\nreasonable positive sample pairs is crucial for the success of contrastive\nlearning. However, current approaches struggle to generate reliable positive\npairs as they either rely on representations learned from inherently sparse\ncollaborative signals or use random perturbations which introduce significant\nuncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named\nSemantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL), which leverages\nsemantic information to improve the reliability of contrastive samples. SRA-CL\ncomprises two main components: (1) Cross-Sequence Contrastive Learning via User\nSemantic Retrieval, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to understand\ndiverse user preferences and retrieve semantically similar users to form\nreliable positive samples through a learnable sample synthesis method; and (2)\nIntra-Sequence Contrastive Learning via Item Semantic Retrieval, which employs\nLLMs to comprehend items and retrieve similar items to perform semantic-based\nitem substitution, thereby creating semantically consistent augmented views for\ncontrastive learning. SRA-CL is plug-and-play and can be integrated into\nstandard sequential recommendation models. Extensive experiments on four public\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed\napproach.",

Auditory attention detection\n(AAD) aims to identify the attended speaker by analyzing brain signals, such as\nelectroencephalography (EEG) data. Existing AAD algorithms often leverage deep\nlearning's powerful nonlinear modeling capabilities, few consider the neural\nmechanisms underlying auditory processing in the brain. In this paper, we\npropose SincAlignNet, a novel network based on an improved SincNet and\ncontrastive learning, designed to align audio and EEG features for auditory\nattention detection. The SincNet component simulates the brain's processing of\naudio during auditory attention, while contrastive learning guides the model to\nlearn the relationship between EEG signals and attended speech. During\ninference, we calculate the cosine similarity between EEG and audio features\nand also explore direct inference of the attended speaker using EEG data.\nCross-trial evaluations results demonstrate that SincAlignNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art AAD methods on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU,\nachieving average accuracies of 78.3% and 92.2%, respectively, with a 1-second\ndecision window.

Given a seed programming problem, \\tool employs multiple agents\nto extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating\nsemantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation\nmethods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs.\nResults show that \\tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under\ncontamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent\nand reliable evaluations.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal traversability assessment\nmethod, which aims to enable autonomous robots to effectively navigate through\ncomplex terrains. Our approach utilizes sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) to\nextract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from\npoint cloud scans. These features are then used to construct a high-resolution\nlocal traversability map. Then, we design a spatial-temporal Bayesian Gaussian\nkernel (BGK) inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores,\nintegrating historical and real-time data while considering factors such as\nslope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty metrics. GPU acceleration is applied\nin the feature extraction step, and the system achieves real-time performance.\nExtensive simulation experiments across diverse terrain scenarios demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms SOTA approaches in both accuracy and computational\nefficiency. Additionally, we develop an autonomous navigation framework\nintegrated with the traversability map and validate it with a differential\ndriven vehicle in complex outdoor environments.

Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate that our\nvariance minimization objective effectively bounds the regression error under\nmild conditions. Furthermore, extensive experiments across three pediatric age\ngroups demonstrate that Q-PART not only significantly outperforms existing\napproaches in pediatric LVEF prediction, but also exhibits strong clinical\nscreening capability with high mAUROC scores (up to 0.9747) and maintains\ngender-fair performance across all metrics, validating its robustness and\npractical utility in pediatric echocardiography analysis.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs)\nhave significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as\nsequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames\nindependently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which\nlimits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long\nvideos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken\nReduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated\ntemporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder\nleverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into\nimage tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame\ndynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only\nenhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token\nreduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal\nand spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM\nwithout sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques,\nour approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while\nimproving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over\nextended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves\nstate-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks\n(more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the\ncomputation costs by up to $8\\times$ and the decoding latency by\n2.4-2.9$\\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

However, these tasks are often complicated\nby challenges such as scale inconsistencies, symmetry, and large deformations,\nwhich can lead to ambiguous matches. Previous feature-based and\ncorrespondence-based methods typically rely on geometric or semantic features\nto generate or polish initial potential correspondences. Some methods typically\nleverage specific geometric priors, such as topological preservation, to devise\ndiverse and innovative strategies tailored to a given enhancement goal, which\ncannot be exhaustively enumerated. Additionally, many previous approaches rely\non a single-step prediction head, which can struggle with local minima in\ncomplex matching scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce an\ninnovative paradigm that leverages a diffusion model in matrix space for robust\nmatching matrix estimation. Our model treats correspondence estimation as a\ndenoising diffusion process in the matching matrix space, gradually refining\nthe intermediate matching matrix to the optimal one. Specifically, we apply the\ndiffusion model in the doubly stochastic matrix space for 3D-3D and 2D-3D\nregistration tasks. In the 2D image registration task, we deploy the diffusion\nmodel in a matrix subspace where dual-softmax projection regularization is\napplied. For all three registration tasks, we provide adaptive matching matrix\nembedding implementations tailored to the specific characteristics of each task\nwhile maintaining a consistent \"match-to-warp\" encoding pattern.

Standing in contrast\nto existing studies all focusing on spatial (or static) imprints within the\ntargeted underlying victim models, we present a fresh temporal paradigm for\nunderstanding these attacks. Of paramount discovery is that these imprints are\nencapsulated within a single loss metric, spanning universally across diverse\ntasks such as classification and regression, and modalities including image,\ntext, and audio. Recognizing the distinct nature of loss between adversarial\nand clean examples, we exploit this temporal imprint for AE detection by\nproposing TRAIT (TRaceable Adversarial temporal trajectory ImprinTs). TRAIT\noperates under minimal assumptions without prior knowledge of attacks, thereby\nframing the detection challenge as a one-class classification problem. However,\ndetecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the\nconstructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the\nabsence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by\nconverting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of\nFast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from\nthe temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across\n12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent\noutstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks,\ndatasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE\ndetection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false\nrejection rate of 1%.

Despite this\npotential, equipping SOMs with modern deep learning architectures remains\nlargely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a novel exploration on how Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) can empower each other,\naiming to bridge this critical research gap. Our findings demonstrate that\nthese architectures can synergistically enhance each other, leading to\nsignificantly improved performance in both unsupervised and supervised tasks.\nCode will be publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is an effective approach for performing radio frequency (RF)\nfingerprinting, which aims to identify the transmitter corresponding to\nreceived RF signals. However, beyond the intended receiver, malicious\neavesdroppers can also intercept signals and attempt to fingerprint\ntransmitters communicating over a wireless channel. Recent studies suggest that\ntransmitters can counter such threats by embedding deep learning-based\ntransferable adversarial attacks in their signals before transmission. In this\nwork, we develop a time-frequency-based eavesdropper architecture that is\ncapable of withstanding such transferable adversarial perturbations and thus\nable to perform effective RF fingerprinting. We theoretically demonstrate that\nadversarial perturbations injected by a transmitter are confined to specific\ntime-frequency regions that are insignificant during inference, directly\nincreasing fingerprinting accuracy on perturbed signals intercepted by the\neavesdropper. Empirical evaluations on a real-world dataset validate our\ntheoretical findings, showing that deep learning-based RF fingerprinting\neavesdroppers can achieve classification performance comparable to the intended\nreceiver, despite efforts made by the transmitter to deceive the eavesdropper.\nOur framework reveals that relying on transferable adversarial attacks may not\nbe sufficient to prevent eavesdroppers from successfully fingerprinting\ntransmissions in next-generation deep learning-based communications systems.",

However, they perform poorly on the content and\nstyle images with the same semantics, i.e., the style of the corresponding\nsemantic region of the generated stylized image is inconsistent with that of\nthe style image. We argue that the root cause lies in their failure to consider\nthe relationship between local regions and semantic regions. To address this\nissue, we propose a plug-and-play semantic continuous-sparse attention, dubbed\nSCSA, for arbitrary semantic style transfer -- each query point considers\ncertain key points in the corresponding semantic region. Specifically, semantic\ncontinuous attention ensures each query point fully attends to all the\ncontinuous key points in the same semantic region that reflect the overall\nstyle characteristics of that region; Semantic sparse attention allows each\nquery point to focus on the most similar sparse key point in the same semantic\nregion that exhibits the specific stylistic texture of that region. By\ncombining the two modules, the resulting SCSA aligns the overall style of the\ncorresponding semantic regions while transferring the vivid textures of these\nregions. Qualitative and quantitative results prove that SCSA enables\nattention-based arbitrary style transfer methods to produce high-quality\nsemantic stylized images.",

Each of the superconductors where spontaneous non-reciprocal\ncritical currents are observed have shown some evidence for such broken\nsymmetries in the normal state. The superconducting state of such materials\nhave topological edge currents, but their projected electro-magnetic part is in\ngeneral not an integer.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across tasks,\nyet they often require additional prompting techniques when facing complex\nproblems. While approaches like self-correction and response selection have\nemerged as popular solutions, recent studies have shown these methods perform\npoorly when relying on the LLM itself to provide feedback or selection\ncriteria. We argue this limitation stems from the fact that common LLM\npost-training procedures lack explicit supervision for discriminative judgment\ntasks. In this paper, we propose Generative Self-Aggregation (GSA), a novel\nprompting method that improves answer quality without requiring the model's\ndiscriminative capabilities. GSA first samples multiple diverse responses from\nthe LLM, then aggregates them to obtain an improved solution. Unlike previous\napproaches, our method does not require the LLM to correct errors or compare\nresponse quality; instead, it leverages the model's generative abilities to\nsynthesize a new response based on the context of multiple samples. While GSA\nshares similarities with the self-consistency (SC) approach for response\naggregation, SC requires specific verifiable tokens to enable majority voting.\nIn contrast, our approach is more general and can be applied to open-ended\ntasks. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that GSA effectively improves response\nquality across various tasks, including mathematical reasoning, knowledge-based\nproblems, and open-ended generation tasks such as code synthesis and\nconversational responses.",

We show the first quantitative lower bound on stabilizer\nfidelity as a function of stabilizer ranks, which reproduces the linear-by-log\nlower bound for $\\chi_{\\delta}({|{H}\\rangle^{ \\otimes n}})$, i.e, on the\napproximate stabilizer rank of $|H\\rangle^{\\otimes n}$. In fact, we show that\nthe lower bound holds even when the fidelity between the approximation and\n${|H\\rangle}^{\\otimes n}$ is exponentially small, which is currently the best\nlower bound in this regime.\n  Next, we define a new magic monotone for pure states, the Barnes Wall norm,\nand its corresponding approximate variant. We upper bound these monotones by\nthe $CS$-count of state preparation, and also by the stabilizer ranks. In\nparticular, the upper bound given by the $CS$-count is tight, in the sense that\nwe exhibit states that achieve the bound.\n  Apart from these results, we give a Fidelity Amplification algorithm, which\nprovides a trade-off between approximation error and the stabilizer rank.

In this\nwork, we present a novel method for studying these vast halos of circumgalactic\ndust: a maximum-likelihood estimator for dust-induced extinction of background\ngalaxies. This estimator can accommodate a broad range of archival photometric\ndata and can incorporate different dust reddening prescriptions, making it\napplicable to diverse galaxy types and redshifts. We apply the estimator to the\nredMaGiC catalog of luminous red galaxies, selected for their tight dispersion\nin color and well-constrained photometric redshifts, and measure the resulting\nextinction as a function of projected distance from WISExSuperCOSMOS and\nredMaGiC foreground galaxies. We detect significant dust-induced extinction\nprofiles extending to at least 1 megaparsec from galactic disks, with\nnoticeable differences between star-forming and quiescent galaxies:\nstar-forming galaxies exhibit a pronounced rise in extinction within the inner\n50 kiloparsecs and a steep decline beyond 1 megaparsec, while the quiescent\ngalaxies host little dust in the inner halo but have detectable extinction out\nto 30 megaparsecs.

    "abstract": "Goal-oriented grasping in dense clutter, a fundamental challenge in robotics,\ndemands an adaptive policy to handle occluded target objects and diverse\nconfigurations. Previous methods typically learn policies based on partially\nobservable segments of the occluded target to generate motions. However, these\npolicies often struggle to generate optimal motions due to uncertainties\nregarding the invisible portions of different occluded target objects across\nvarious scenes, resulting in low motion efficiency. To this end, we propose\nOPG-Policy, a novel framework that leverages amodal segmentation to predict\noccluded portions of the target and develop an adaptive push-grasp policy for\ncluttered scenarios where the target object is partially observed.\nSpecifically, our approach trains a dedicated amodal segmentation module for\ndiverse target objects to generate amodal masks. These masks and scene\nobservations are mapped to the future rewards of grasp and push motion\nprimitives via deep Q-learning to learn the motion critic. Afterward, the push\nand grasp motion candidates predicted by the critic, along with the relevant\ndomain knowledge, are fed into the coordinator to generate the optimal motion\nimplemented by the robot. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and\nreal-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in\ngenerating motion sequences for retrieving occluded targets, outperforming\nother baseline methods in success rate and motion efficiency.",

This study proposes a novel Vector Weighted\nAverage Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (VWAA-KELM) model to enhance energy\nconsumption prediction in cloud computing environments. By integrating a vector\nweighted average algorithm (VWAA) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM),\nthe proposed model dynamically adjusts feature weights and optimizes kernel\nfunctions, significantly improving prediction accuracy and generalization.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance of VWAA-KELM: 94.7%\nof test set prediction errors fall within [0, 50] units, with only three cases\nexceeding 100 units, indicating strong stability. The model achieves a\ncoefficient of determination (R2) of 0.987 in the training set (RMSE = 28.108,\nRPD = 8.872) and maintains excellent generalization with R2 = 0.973 in the test\nset (RMSE = 43.227, RPD = 6.202). Visual analysis confirms that predicted\nvalues closely align with actual energy consumption trends, avoiding\noverfitting while capturing nonlinear dependencies. A key innovation of this\nstudy is the introduction of adaptive feature weighting, allowing the model to\ndynamically assign importance to different input parameters, thereby enhancing\nhigh-dimensional data processing.

Recent\nstudies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code\nsnippets, showing promising results. However, these results are potentially\naffected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public\non GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023). Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs'\nstrong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere\nretrieval of ground truth from training data.\n  To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code\nsnippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. First, utilizing Thalia, a\nprogram synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for\ntype inference evaluation. On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped\nsignificantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall.\nSecond, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly\ndegraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in\nunderstanding code semantics. Third, we used delta debugging to identify the\nminimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference. While type inference\nprimarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly\ninfer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a\nreliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the\nsnippets.\n  Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from\ndata leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code\nsnippets.

Our evaluation\nwas comprised of sixty participants performing various tasks in a simulated\ncargo ship room while receiving remote guidance through one of three devices:\ntwo off-the-shelf AR-HMDs (Trimble XR10 with HoloLens 2, RealWear Navigator\n520), and a smartphone (Google Pixel 6). Several sensors were installed\nthroughout the room to obtain quantitative measures of the participants' safe\nexecution of the tasks, such as the frequency in which they hit the objects in\nthe room or stepped over simulated holes or oil spills. The results reported\nthat the Trimble XR10 led to statistically highest head-knockers and\nknee-knocker incidents compared to the Navigator 520 and the Pixel 6.\nFurthermore, the Trimble XR10 also led to significantly higher difficulties to\ncross hatch doors, lower perceived safety, comfort, perceived performance, and\nusability. Overall, participants wearing AR-HMDs failed to perceive more\nhazards, meaning that safety-preserving capabilities must be developed for\nAR-HMDs before introducing them into industrial hazardous settings confidently.",

    "abstract": "Learning the optimal policy from a random network initialization is the theme\nof deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). As the scale of DRL training increases,\ntreating DRL policy network weights as a new data modality and exploring the\npotential becomes appealing and possible. In this work, we focus on the policy\nlearning path in deep RL, represented by the trajectory of network weights of\nhistorical policies, which reflects the evolvement of the policy learning\nprocess. Taking the idea of trajectory modeling with Transformer, we propose\nTransformer as Implicit Policy Learner (TIPL), which processes policy network\nweights in an autoregressive manner. We collect the policy learning path data\nby running independent RL training trials, with which we then train our TIPL\nmodel. In the experiments, we demonstrate that TIPL is able to fit the implicit\ndynamics of policy learning and perform the optimization of policy network by\ninference.",

This\nstudy integrated network pharmacology, untargeted metabolomics, and gut\nmicrobiota analyses to investigate how JHT alleviates CSG. A rat CSG model was\nestablished and evaluated via H&E staining. We identified JHT's target profiles\nand constructed a multi-layer biomolecular network. Differential metabolites in\nplasma were determined by untargeted metabolomics, and gut microbiota\ndiversity/composition in fecal and cecal samples was assessed via 16S rRNA\nsequencing. JHT markedly reduced gastric inflammation. Network pharmacology\nhighlighted metabolic pathways, particularly lipid and nitric oxide metabolism,\nas essential to JHT's therapeutic effect. Metabolomics identified key\ndifferential metabolites including betaine (enhancing gut microbiota),\nphospholipids, and citrulline (indicating severity of CSG). Pathway enrichment\nsupported the gut microbiota's involvement. Further microbiota analysis showed\nthat JHT increased betaine abundance, improved short-chain fatty acid\nproduction, and elevated Faecalibaculum and Bifidobacterium, thereby\nalleviating gastric inflammation. In conclusion, JHT alleviates CSG via diverse\nmetabolic processes, especially lipid and energy metabolism, and influences\nmetabolites like betaine alongside gut microbes such as Faecalibaculum and\nBifidobacterium.

We\nderive the relation of narrow NODEs in approximating flows of shallow but wide\nNODEs. Due to existing results on approximation properties of shallow neural\nnetworks, this facilitates understanding which kind of flows of dynamical\nsystems can be approximated using narrow neural ODEs. While approximation\nproperties of narrow NODEs have been established in literature, the proofs\noften involve extensive constructions or require invoking deep controllability\ntheorems from control theory.

    "abstract": "Achieving high-fidelity lip-speech synchronization in audio-driven talking\nportrait synthesis remains challenging. While multi-stage pipelines or\ndiffusion models yield high-quality results, they suffer from high\ncomputational costs. Some approaches perform well on specific individuals with\nlow resources, yet still exhibit mismatched lip movements. The aforementioned\nmethods are modeled in the pixel domain. We observed that there are noticeable\ndiscrepancies in the frequency domain between the synthesized talking videos\nand natural videos. Currently, no research on talking portrait synthesis has\nconsidered this aspect. To address this, we propose a FREquency-modulated,\nhigh-fidelity, and real-time Audio-driven talKing portrait synthesis framework,\nnamed FREAK, which models talking portraits from the frequency domain\nperspective, enhancing the fidelity and naturalness of the synthesized\nportraits. FREAK introduces two novel frequency-based modules: 1) the Visual\nEncoding Frequency Modulator (VEFM) to couple multi-scale visual features in\nthe frequency domain, better preserving visual frequency information and\nreducing the gap in the frequency spectrum between synthesized and natural\nframes. and 2) the Audio Visual Frequency Modulator (AVFM) to help the model\nlearn the talking pattern in the frequency domain and improve audio-visual\nsynchronization. Additionally, we optimize the model in both pixel domain and\nfrequency domain jointly. Furthermore, FREAK supports seamless switching\nbetween one-shot and video dubbing settings, offering enhanced flexibility. Due\nto its superior performance, it can simultaneously support high-resolution\nvideo results and real-time inference.

Most existing methods for video subtitle extraction are\nbased on a multi-stage framework, handling each frame independently. They can\nhardly exploit the temporal information of videos. Although some LVLMs exhibit\nthe robust OCR capability, predicting accurate timestamps for subtitle texts is\nstill challenging. In this paper, we propose an End-to-end Video Subtitle\nExtraction method, called EVE, which consists of three modules: a vision\nencoder, an adapter module, and a large language model. To effectively compress\nthe visual tokens from the vision encoder, we propose a novel adapter\nInterleavedVT to interleave two modalities. It contains a visual compressor and\na textual region compressor. The proposed InterleavedVT exploits both the\nmerits of average pooling and Q-Former in token compression. Taking the\ntemporal information of videos into account, we introduce a sliding-window\nmechanism in the textual region compressor.

This study proposes a gradient-enhanced PINN with residual unit\n(R-gPINN) method to solve the data-driven solution and function discovery for\nvariable coefficient PDEs.

Despite its promise, FL faces several\ncritical challenges in practical applications involving edge devices, such as\ndata heterogeneity and delays stemming from communication and computation\nconstraints. This paper examines the impact of unknown causes of delay on\ntraining performance in an Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) system with\ndata heterogeneity. Initially, an asynchronous error definition is proposed,\nbased on which the solely adverse impact of data heterogeneity is theoretically\nanalyzed within the traditional Synchronous Federated Learning (SFL) framework.\nFurthermore, Asynchronous Updates with Delayed Gradients (AUDG), a conventional\nAFL scheme, is discussed. Investigation into AUDG reveals that the negative\ninfluence of data heterogeneity is correlated with delays, while a shorter\naverage delay from a specific client does not consistently enhance training\nperformance. In order to compensate for the scenarios where AUDG are not\nadapted, Pseudo-synchronous Updates by Reusing Delayed Gradients (PSURDG) is\nproposed, and its theoretical convergence is analyzed. In both AUDG and PSURDG,\nonly a random set of clients successfully transmits their updated results to\nthe central server in each iteration. The critical difference between them lies\nin whether the delayed information is reused. Finally, both schemes are\nvalidated and compared through theoretical analysis and simulations,\ndemonstrating more intuitively that discarding outdated information due to time\ndelays is not always the best approach.",

We are particularly interested in the\nregime that the Hill radius of the point mass is greater than the disk\nthickness, but the point mass is not sufficiently massive to open a ``gap\" in a\nhigh viscosity disk. This parameter regime may be seen for stellar-mass objects\nmoving within thin accretion disks of massive black holes, but less studied for\nthe planet migration scenario in protoplanetary disks.

We introduce a \"Control-Follow\" clustering strategy,\nwhich dynamically adapts to scene scale and feature distribution, avoiding\nfeature compression and significantly improving segmentation accuracy.\nAdditionally, we enrich scene representation by integrating object attributes\nand spatial relations extracted from 2D foundation models. To address\ninaccuracies in spatial relationships, we propose 3D correction modules that\nfilter implausible relations through spatial consistency verification, ensuring\nreliable scene graph construction. Extensive experiments on three datasets\ndemonstrate that GaussianGraph outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both\nsemantic segmentation and object grounding tasks, providing a robust solution\nfor complex scene understanding and interaction.",

Here, we report a major merger of at least\nfive galaxies, dubbed JWST's Quintet (JQ), at redshift 6.7, discovered in the\nJWST GOODS-South field. This system resides in a small area\n$\\sim4.5''\\times4.5''$ ($24.6\\times24.6$ pkpc$^2$), containing over 17\ngalaxy-size clumps with a total stellar mass of $10^{10}\\ M_\\odot$.

The high mass and star formation rate of the JQ galaxies are\nconsistent with the star formation history of those unexpected massive\nquiescent galaxies observed at redshift 4-5, offering a plausible evolutionary\npathway for the formation of such galaxies.

To address this challenge, tensor gauge theories have been recently\nproposed as a promising approach to describe the emergent elasticity of\ndisordered solids and predict their stress-stress correlations. In this work,\nwe revisit this problem in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids by\nemploying a canonical elasticity theory approach, supported by experimental and\nsimulation data. We demonstrate that, with respect to static stress-stress\ncorrelations, the response of a 2D disordered solid is indistinguishable from\nthat of a 2D isotropic crystalline solid and it is well predicted by vanilla\nelasticity theory.

    "abstract": "Digital versions of real-world text documents often suffer from issues like\nenvironmental corrosion of the original document, low-quality scanning, or\nhuman interference. Existing document restoration and inpainting methods\ntypically struggle with generalizing to unseen document styles and handling\nhigh-resolution images. To address these challenges, we introduce TextDoctor, a\nnovel unified document image inpainting method. Inspired by human reading\nbehavior, TextDoctor restores fundamental text elements from patches and then\napplies diffusion models to entire document images instead of training models\non specific document types. To handle varying text sizes and avoid\nout-of-memory issues, common in high-resolution documents, we propose using\nstructure pyramid prediction and patch pyramid diffusion models. These\ntechniques leverage multiscale inputs and pyramid patches to enhance the\nquality of inpainting both globally and locally. Extensive qualitative and\nquantitative experiments on seven public datasets validated that TextDoctor\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoring various types of\nhigh-resolution document images.",

    "abstract": "In traditional models of behavioral or opinion dynamics on social networks,\nresearchers suppose that all interactions occur between pairs of individuals.\nHowever, in reality, social interactions also occur in groups of three or more\nindividuals. A common way to incorporate such polyadic interactions is to study\ndynamical processes on hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, interactions can occur\nbetween any number of the individuals in a network. The Watts threshold model\n(WTM) is a well-known model of a simplistic social spreading process. Very\nrecently, Chen et al. extended the WTM from dyadic networks (i.e., graphs) to\npolyadic networks (i.e., hypergraphs). In the present paper, we extend their\ndiscrete-time model to continuous time using approximate master equations\n(AMEs). By using AMEs, we are able to model the system with very high accuracy.\nWe then reduce the high-dimensional AME system to a system of three coupled\ndifferential equations without any detectable loss of accuracy. This much\nlower-dimensional system is more computationally efficient to solve numerically\nand is also easier to interpret. We linearize the reduced AME system and\ncalculate a cascade condition, which allows us to determine when a large\nspreading event occurs. We then apply our model to a social contact network of\na French primary school and to a hypergraph of computer-science coauthorships.\nWe find that the AME system is accurate in modelling the polyadic WTM on these\nempirical networks; however, we expect that future work that incorporates\nstructural correlations between nearby nodes and groups into the model for the\ndynamics will lead to more accurate theory for real-world networks.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of traffic crash risks for individual vehicles is\nessential for enhancing vehicle safety. While significant attention has been\ngiven to traffic crash risk prediction, existing studies face two main\nchallenges: First, due to the scarcity of individual vehicle data before\ncrashes, most models rely on hypothetical scenarios deemed dangerous by\nresearchers. This raises doubts about their applicability to actual pre-crash\nconditions. Second, some crash risk prediction frameworks were learned from\ndashcam videos. Although such videos capture the pre-crash behavior of\nindividual vehicles, they often lack critical information about the movements\nof surrounding vehicles. However, the interaction between a vehicle and its\nsurrounding vehicles is highly influential in crash occurrences. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose a novel non-stationary extreme value theory (EVT),\nwhere the covariate function is optimized in a nonlinear fashion using a graph\nattention network. The EVT component incorporates the stochastic nature of\ncrashes through probability distribution, which enhances model\ninterpretability. Notably, the nonlinear covariate function enables the model\nto capture the interactive behavior between the target vehicle and its multiple\nsurrounding vehicles, facilitating crash risk prediction across different\ndriving tasks. We train and test our model using 100 sets of vehicle trajectory\ndata before real crashes, collected via drones over three years from merging\nand weaving segments. We demonstrate that our model successfully learns\nmicro-level precursors of crashes and fits a more accurate distribution with\nthe aid of the nonlinear covariate function. Our experiments on the testing\ndataset show that the proposed model outperforms existing models by providing\nmore accurate predictions for both rear-end and sideswipe crashes\nsimultaneously.",

The data sets were\nobtained from the single-dish mode observations of the Korean VLBI\nNetwork~(KVN) and the 43-GHz Very Long Baseline Array~(VLBA). We compared the\nconsistency of the measurements between milli-arcsecond and arcsecond scales.\nThe Faraday rotation measure values were obtained via two approaches, model\nfitting to a linear function in all frequency ranges, and calculation from\nadjacent frequency pairs. We found that the linear polarization angle is\npreferred to be $\\sim100^{\\circ}$ when the source is highly polarized. At\n43~GHz, we found that the polarized emission at scales of mas and arcsecond is\nconsistent when we compare its flux density and polarization angle. The ratio\nof quasi-simultaneously measured polarized flux density is $1.02\\pm0.07$, and\nthe polarization angles display similar rotation. These suggest that the\nextended jet beyond the scale of VLBA 43~GHz has a negligible convolution\neffect on the polarization angle from the KVN. We found an interesting, notable\nflaring event in the KVN single-dish data from the polarized emission in 2019\nin the frequency range of 22-129~GHz.

Based on the observed $m_{\\rm p}$ and $\\chi_{\\rm obs}$,\nand also the Faraday rotation measure, we suggest that the polarization flare\nin 2019 is attributed to the shock-shock interaction in the stationary jet\nregion.

Its X-ray spectrum is\nconsistent with a high-absorbed power-law model with N$_H \\sim 1.8 \\times\n10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $\\Gamma \\sim 1.66$. No spectral variability was observed\nas a function of time or flux. J1813 is in a quiescent state $\\sim$60\\% of the\ntime, with an upper-limit luminosity of $8 \\times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at 10\nkpc), implying an observed long-term X-ray flux variability $>$500. The optical\ncounterpart alone indicates J1813 is a HMXB. Its transient nature, duty cycle,\nthe amplitude of observed X-ray variability, the shape and luminosity of the\nX-ray flares -- and the lack of known X-ray outbursts ($>10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$)\n-- strongly support the identification of J1813 as an SFXT.",

    "abstract": "Manipulating a deformable linear object (DLO) such as wire, cable, and rope\nis a common yet challenging task due to their high degrees of freedom and\ncomplex deformation behaviors, especially in an environment with obstacles.\nExisting local control methods are efficient but prone to failure in complex\nscenarios, while precise global planners are computationally intensive and\ndifficult to deploy. This paper presents an efficient, easy-to-deploy framework\nfor collision-free DLO manipulation using mobile manipulators. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of leveraging standard planning tools for high-dimensional\nDLO manipulation without requiring custom planners or extensive data-driven\nmodels. Our approach combines an off-the-shelf global planner with a real-time\nlocal controller. The global planner approximates the DLO as a series of rigid\nlinks connected by spherical joints, enabling rapid path planning without the\nneed for problem-specific planners or large datasets. The local controller\nemploys control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce safety constraints,\nmaintain the DLO integrity, prevent overstress, and handle obstacle avoidance.\nIt compensates for modeling inaccuracies by using a state-of-the-art\nposition-based dynamics technique that approximates physical properties like\nYoung's and shear moduli. We validate our framework through extensive\nsimulations and real-world demonstrations. In complex obstacle\nscenarios-including tent pole transport, corridor navigation, and tasks\nrequiring varied stiffness-our method achieves a 100% success rate over\nthousands of trials, with significantly reduced planning times compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques. Real-world experiments include transportation of a\ntent pole and a rope using mobile manipulators. We share our ROS-based\nimplementation to facilitate adoption in various applications.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to enable models to segment\nnovel/unseen object classes using only a limited number of labeled examples.\nHowever, current FSS methods frequently struggle with generalization due to\nincomplete and biased feature representations, especially when support images\ndo not capture the full appearance variability of the target class. To improve\nthe FSS pipeline, we propose a novel framework that utilizes large language\nmodels (LLMs) to adapt general class semantic information to the query image.\nFurthermore, the framework employs dense pixel-wise matching to identify\nsimilarities between query and support images, resulting in enhanced FSS\nperformance. Inspired by reasoning-based segmentation frameworks, our method,\nnamed DSV-LFS, introduces an additional token into the LLM vocabulary, allowing\na multimodal LLM to generate a \"semantic prompt\" from class descriptions. In\nparallel, a dense matching module identifies visual similarities between the\nquery and support images, generating a \"visual prompt\". These prompts are then\njointly employed to guide the prompt-based decoder for accurate segmentation of\nthe query image.

    "abstract": "Bounds on turbulent averages in shear flows can be derived from the\nNavier-Stokes equations by a mathematical approach called the background\nmethod. Bounds that are optimal within this method can be computed at each\nReynolds number Re by numerically optimizing subject to a spectral constraint,\nwhich requires a quadratic integral to be nonnegative for all possible velocity\nfields. Past authors have eased computations by enforcing the spectral\nconstraint only for streamwise-invariant (2.5D) velocity fields, assuming this\ngives the same result as enforcing it for three-dimensional (3D) fields. Here\nwe compute optimal bounds over 2.5D fields and then verify, without doing\ncomputations over 3D fields, that the bounds indeed apply to 3D flows. One way\nis to directly check that an optimizer computed using 2.5D fields satisfies the\nspectral constraint for all 3D fields. We introduce a criterion that gives a\nsecond way, applicable to planar shear flow models with a certain symmetry,\nthat is based on a theorem of Busse (ARMA 47:28, 1972) for the energy stability\nproblem. The advantage of checking this criterion, as opposed to directly\nchecking the 3D constraint, is lower computational cost and more natural\nextrapolation to large Re. We compute optimal upper bounds on friction\ncoefficients for the wall-bounded Kolmogorov flow known as Waleffe flow, and\nfor plane Couette flow, which require lower bounds on dissipation in the first\nmodel and upper bounds in the second. For Waleffe flow, all bounds computed\nusing 2.5D fields satisfy our criterion, so they hold for 3D flows. For Couette\nflow, where bounds have previously been computed using 2.5D fields by Plasting\nand Kerswell (JFM 477:363, 2003), our criterion holds only up to moderate Re,\nbut at larger Re we directly verify the 3D spectral constraint. This supports\nthe assumption by Plasting and Kerswell that their bounds hold for 3D flows.",

Although numerous models have been used to investigate\nthe photoevaporation process, their conclusions vary, partly due to differences\nin the adopted radiation spectra of the host star in particular in the extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray bands. This study aims to construct the EUV\nand (soft) X-ray emission spectrum from pre-main-sequence stars using a\nphysics-based model. While the high-energy radiation sources of\npre-main-sequence stars include accretion shocks and magnetically heated\ncoronae, this study focuses on the latter. An MHD model capable of reproducing\nthe coronal emission of main-sequence stars is applied to a pre-main-sequence\nstar TW Hya, and its feasibility is assessed by comparing the predicted and\nobserved emission-line intensities. We find that the emission lines formed at\ncoronal temperatures ($T = 4-13 \\times 10^6$ K) are reproduced in intensity\nwithin a factor of three. Emission lines from lower-temperature ($T < 4 \\times\n10^6$ K) plasmas are systematically underestimated, with typical intensities at\n10-30% of observed values, consistent with previous findings that these\nemissions predominantly originate from accretion shocks. Emission lines emitted\nat extremely high temperatures ($T > 13 \\times 10^6$ K) account for only about\n1-10% of the observed values, likely due to the neglect of transient heating\nassociated with flares.

Our model\ngenerates global synthetic data by condensing the reliable information from\neach class representation and its structural information across clients. Using\nthese synthetic data as a training set, we alleviate the local overfitting\nproblem by adaptively generalizing the absent knowledge within each local\ndataset. This enhances the generalization capabilities of local models,\nenabling them to handle unseen data effectively. Our model outperforms\nbaselines in our proposed experimental settings, which are designed to measure\ngeneralization power to unseen data in practical scenarios.

Due\nto this complexity, none of the Franka IK solvers available in the literature\nprovide satisfactory results when used in real-world applications. Therefore,\nin this paper we introduce GeoFIK (Geometric Franka IK), an analytical IK\nsolver that allows the use of different joint variables to resolve the\nredundancy. The approach uses screw theory to describe the entire geometry of\nthe robot, allowing the computation of the Jacobian matrix prior to computation\nof joint angles. All singularities are identified and handled. As an example of\nhow the geometric elements obtained by the IK can be exploited, a solver with\nthe swivel angle as the free variable is provided.

When computational\nresources are abundant, there are a variety of methods for finding good\nhyperparameter settings, but when resources are limited the only realistic\nchoices are using standard default values of uncertain quality and provenance,\nor tuning only a couple of the most important hyperparameters via extremely\nlimited handdesigned sweeps. Extending the idea of default settings to a modest\ntuning budget, Metz et al.

However, to date, no practical\nand performant hyperparameter lists that generalize to representative deep\nlearning workloads have been demonstrated. In this paper, we present\nhyperparameter lists for NAdamW derived from extensive experiments on the\nrealistic workloads in the AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. Our\nhyperparameter lists also include values for basic regularization techniques\n(i.e. weight decay, label smoothing, and dropout). In particular, our best\nNAdamW hyperparameter list performs well on AlgoPerf held-out workloads not\nused to construct it, and represents a compelling turn-key approach to tuning\nwhen restricted to five or fewer trials.

The problem with training neural networks\non real IACT data is that these data need to be pre-labeled, whereas such\nlabeling is difficult and its results are estimates. In addition, the\ndistribution of incoming events is highly imbalanced. Firstly, there is an\nimbalance in the types of events, since the number of detected gamma quanta is\nsignificantly less than the number of protons. Secondly, the energy\ndistribution of particles of the same type is also imbalanced, since\nhigh-energy particles are extremely rare. This imbalance results in poorly\ntrained classifiers that, once trained, do not handle rare events correctly.\nUsing only conventional Monte Carlo event simulation methods to solve this\nproblem is possible, but extremely resource-intensive and time-consuming.

    "abstract": "In view of the great uncertainty of the equation of state (EOS) of\nhigh-density nuclear matter, establishing EOS-independent universal relations\nbetween global properties of neutron stars provides a practical way to\nconstrain the unobservable or difficult-to-observe properties through\nastronomical observations. It is common to construct universal relations\nbetween EOS-dependent properties (e.g., moment of inertia, tidal deformation,\netc.) or combined properties (e.g., compactness). Improving the precision of\nthe universal relations may provide stricter constraint on the properties of\nneutron star. We find that in 3-dimensional space with mass and radius as the\nbase coordinates, the points corresponding to a certain property of neutron\nstar described by different EOSs are almost located in the same surface. Thus\nthe universal relation between the property and the stellar mass-radius can be\nexpressed through describing the surface.\n  It is shown that the resulting universal relations have higher precisions. As\nan example, we construct high-precision universal relations for the moment of\ninertia, the $f$-mode frequency, and the dimensionless tidal deformation\nrespect to the mass-radius. As the observational data of neutron star mass and\nradius from NICER grows in data and accuracy, these universal relations allow\nfor more precise constraints on the unobservable or difficult-to-observe\nproperties.",

    "abstract": "This article unpacks the design choices behind longstanding and newly\nproposed computational frameworks aimed at finding common grounds across\ncollective preferences and examines their potential future impacts, both\ntechnically and normatively. It begins by situating AI-assisted preference\nelicitation within the historical role of opinion polls, emphasizing that\npreferences are shaped by the decision-making context and are seldom\nobjectively captured. With that caveat in mind, we explore AI-based democratic\ninnovations as discovery tools for fostering reasonable representations of a\ncollective will, sense-making, and agreement-seeking. At the same time, we\ncaution against dangerously misguided uses, such as enabling binding decisions,\nfostering gradual disempowerment or post-rationalizing political outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The USB protocol has become a ubiquitous standard for connecting peripherals\nto computers, making its security a critical concern. A recent research study\ndemonstrated the potential to exploit weaknesses in well-established protocols,\nsuch as PCIe, and created a side-channel for leaking sensitive information by\nleveraging congestion within shared interfaces. Drawing inspiration from that,\nthis project introduces an innovative approach to USB side-channel attacks via\ncongestion. We evaluated the susceptibility of USB devices and hubs to remote\nprofiling and side-channel attacks, identified potential weaknesses within the\nUSB standard, and highlighted the critical need for heightened security and\nprivacy in USB technology. Our findings discover vulnerabilities within the USB\nstandard, which are difficult to effectively mitigate and underscore the need\nfor enhanced security measures to protect user privacy in an era increasingly\ndependent on USB-connected devices.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning processes are challenging to analyze\ndue to their complexity and the lack of organized visualization tools. We\npresent ReasonGraph, a web-based platform for visualizing and analyzing LLM\nreasoning processes. It supports both sequential and tree-based reasoning\nmethods while integrating with major LLM providers and over fifty\nstate-of-the-art models. ReasonGraph incorporates an intuitive UI with meta\nreasoning method selection, configurable visualization parameters, and a\nmodular framework that facilitates efficient extension. Our evaluation shows\nhigh parsing reliability, efficient processing, and strong usability across\nvarious downstream applications. By providing a unified visualization\nframework, ReasonGraph reduces cognitive load in analyzing complex reasoning\npaths, improves error detection in logical processes, and enables more\neffective development of LLM-based applications. The platform is open-source,\npromoting accessibility and reproducibility in LLM reasoning analysis.",
