Motivated by issues such as data control and prior-free\nrevenue maximization, we focus on the scenario where each data point can be\nallocated to only one buyer. We show that the problem of welfare maximization\nin this setting is NP-hard even with two bidders, but design a polynomial-time\n$(1-1/e)$ approximation algorithm for any number of bidders.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) has been\ndriven by introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, where models generate\nintermediate reasoning traces before producing an answer. These traces, as in\nDeepSeek R1, are not only used to guide inference but also serve as supervision\nsignals for distillation into smaller models. A common but often implicit\nassumption is that CoT traces should be semantically meaningful and\ninterpretable to the end user. While recent research questions the need for\nsemantic nature of these traces, in this paper, we ask: ``\\textit{Must CoT\nreasoning traces be interpretable to enhance LLM task performance?}\" We\ninvestigate this question in the Open Book Question-Answering domain by\nsupervised fine-tuning LLaMA and Qwen models on four types of reasoning traces:\n(1) DeepSeek R1 traces, (2) LLM-generated summaries of R1 traces, (3)\nLLM-generated post-hoc explanations of R1 traces, and (4) algorithmically\ngenerated verifiably correct traces. To quantify the trade-off between\ninterpretability and performance, we further conduct a human-subject study with\n100 participants rating the interpretability of each trace type. Our results\nreveal a striking mismatch: while fine-tuning on R1 traces yields the strongest\nperformance, participants judged these traces to be the least interpretable.\nThese findings suggest that it is useful to decouple intermediate tokens from\nend user interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate\nidentification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical\nfor diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and\ncomputed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT),\ncontrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold\nstandard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in\nlow-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently\nthe most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and\nsimplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in\nmonitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading\nsolution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an\nopportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by\nincorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a\nseries of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict\nfollow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore,\nwe implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the\nproposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds\ncompared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract\nvessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of active matter under confinement poses significant challenges\ndue to the intricate coupling between dynamics near boundaries and those in the\nbulk. A defining feature of active matter systems is that a substantial portion\nof their dynamics takes place near confining boundaries. In our previous work,\nwe developed a kinetic framework that enables direct computation of the\nprobability distribution functions for both the position and orientation of\nactive rods. A distinguishing aspect of this approach is its explicit treatment\nof wall accumulation through the use of two coupled probability distribution\nfunctions: one describing the bulk population and the other representing rods\naccumulated at the boundary. Another novel feature is the structure of the\ngoverning equation, which is degenerate: it is second-order in one non-temporal\nvariable and first-order in another. The main focus of this paper is to\nrigorously justify this model via multi-scale analysis. We first establish\nwell-posedness of the system and then employ two distinct multi-scale\nderivations to obtain the model as a singular limit of a more classical kinetic\nsystem in the regime of vanishing translational diffusion. For analytical\nclarity, we consider the case in which active rods, once accumulated at the\nwall, remain permanently confined there. This work provides a rigorous\nmathematical foundation for reduced kinetic models of confined active matter,\nbridging microscopic dynamics and macroscopic accumulation phenomena.",

    "abstract": "The problem of local (e.g., interplanetary) Hubble expansion is studied for a\nlong time but remains a controversial subject till now; and of particular\ninterest is a plausible value of the local Hubble parameter at the scale of the\nSolar system. Here, we tried to estimate the corresponding quantity by the\nanalysis of surface temperatures on the Earth and Mars, which are formed by a\ncompetition between a variable luminosity of the Sun and increasing radii of\nthe planetary orbits. Our work employs paleochemical and paleobiological data\non the temperature of the ancient Earth, on the one hand, and geological data\non the existence of an ocean of liquid water on the ancient Mars, on the other\nhand. As follows from our analysis, the martian data impose only a weak\nconstraint on the admissible values of the Hubble parameter because of the\nunknown salinity - and, therefore, the freezing point - of the martian water.\nOn the other hand, the terrestrial data turn out to be much more valuable,\nespecially, for the Precambrian period, when temperature variation was\nsufficiently smooth and monotonic. For example, in the framework of standard\nLambdaCDM model with 70% of dark energy, contemporary value of the local Hubble\nparameter was found to be 70-90 km/s/Mpc under assumption that the Earth's\nsurface temperature in the end of Precambrian equaled 45 C. This is in\nreasonable agreement both with the intergalactic data and with an independent\nestimate of the local Hubble parameter from tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon\nsystem.",

In\nYbF, laser slowing is hindered by leaks out of the optical cycle attributed to\nlow-lying metastable electronic states arising from inner-shell excitation. We\nbring this population back into the optical cycle once it has decayed to the\nelectronic ground state using microwaves to couple the relevant rotational\nlevels. We measure the scattering rate and closure of the optical cycle as\nrepumps are added, and study the destabilzation of dark states by a magnetic\nfield and by polarization modulation, finding that both are helpful for\nmaximizing the scattering rate. Starting from a beam with a mean speed of 80\nm/s, and using frequency broadened slowing light, we reduce the mean speed of\nthe beam and produce a substantial flux in the low velocity tail of the\ndistribution. Slowing increases the fraction of molecules below 40 m/s from\n0.4(1)% to 7.0(2)%, and the fraction below 30 m/s from zero to 3.2(1)%. The\nestablishment of a nearly-closed optical cycle and the production of molecules\nat low velocity are important steps towards trapping YbF molecules for future\nmeasurements of the electron's electric dipole moment.",

The transition probability for a walk to a given vertex\ndepends on the cumulative proportion of visits by all walks that have access to\nthat vertex. Proportions are modified by multiplication by a real valued\ninteraction parameter and the addition of a parameter representing the\nintrinsic preference of the walk for the vertex. This model covers a wide range\nof interactions, including the cooperation (attraction) or competition\n(repulsion) of several walks at single vertices. We are principally concerned\nwith strong laws for the proportion of visits to each vertex by all walks. We\nprove that this measure converges almost surely towards the set of fixed points\nof the transition probabilities. Almost sure convergence to a single fixed\npoint is in fact the generic behaviour as we show this to hold for almost all\nparameter values of our model.\n  Beyond almost sure convergence, our model allows for a detailed description\nof the limiting behaviour depending on the interaction parameters and the\nsub-graph geometries. This is illustrated by several examples of the\ncompetitive version of the dynamics, including interacting walks sharing all\nthe vertices of finite complete graphs and walks confined to complete\nsub-graphs of star graphs and cycles.",

The third conjecture\nestablishes the invariance of the dynamics under positive-affine\ntransformations of the initial distribution, with a corresponding rescaling of\nall $\\epsilon$-switch values.

Traditional half-duplex architectures such as DDR5\nare ill-suited for such workloads, suffering bus turnaround penalties that\nreduce their effective bandwidth under mixed read-write patterns. Compute\nExpress Link (CXL) offers a breakthrough with its full-duplex channels, yet\nthis architectural potential remains untapped as existing software stacks are\noblivious to this capability. This paper introduces CXLAimPod, an adaptive\nscheduling framework designed to bridge this software-hardware gap through\nsystem support, including cgroup-based hints for application-aware\noptimization. Our characterization quantifies the opportunity, revealing that\nCXL systems achieve 55-61% bandwidth improvement at balanced read-write ratios\ncompared to flat DDR5 performance, demonstrating the benefits of full-duplex\narchitecture. To realize this potential, the CXLAimPod framework integrates\nmultiple scheduling strategies with a cgroup-based hint mechanism to navigate\nthe trade-offs between throughput, latency, and overhead. Implemented\nefficiently within the Linux kernel via eBPF, CXLAimPod delivers significant\nperformance improvements over default CXL configurations. Evaluation on diverse\nworkloads shows 7.4% average improvement for Redis (with up to 150% for\nspecific sequential patterns), 71.6% improvement for LLM text generation, and\n9.1% for vector databases, demon-strating that duplex-aware scheduling can\neffectively exploit CXL's architectural advantages.",

We\ndescribe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for\nrepresenting multiword expressions in English PropBank.

    "abstract": "We introduce Bayesimax theory, a paradigm for objective Bayesian analysis\nwhich selects priors by applying minimax theory to prior disclosure games. In\nthese games, the uniquely optimal strategy for a Bayesian agent upon observing\nthe data is to reveal their prior. As such, the prior chosen by minimax theory\nis, in effect, the implicit prior of minimax agents. Since minimax analysis\ndisregards prior information, this prior is arguably noninformative. We refer\nto minimax solutions of certain prior disclosure games as Bayesimax priors, and\nwe classify a statistical procedure as Bayesimax if it is a Bayes rule with\nrespect to a Bayesimax prior. Under regular conditions, if a decision rule is\nminimax, then it is a Bayes rule under priors which maximize the minimum Bayes\nrisk. We study games leveraging strictly proper scoring rules to induce\nposterior (and thereby prior) revelation. In such games, the minimum Bayes risk\nequals the conditional (generalized) entropy of the parameter given the data.\nBayesimax theory therefore prescribes conditional entropy maximization. As\nconditional entropy equals marginal entropy (prior uninformativeness) minus\nmutual information (data informativeness), Bayesimax priors effectively\nminimize total information. We provide a rigorous formulation of these ideas,\ncharacterize sufficient conditions for regularity and identifiability, and\ninvestigate asymptotics and conjugate family examples. We next describe a\ngeneric Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating conditional entropy under a given\nprior.

The contributions span both\nmethodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular\naddressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,\nspatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is\norganized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for\nobject discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned\nfrom large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly\ntrains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on\nobject detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised\ncontrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in\nremote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification\nusing both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies.

However,\nacquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to\nbypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to\nreconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require\nadditional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose\nUnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation\nand reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a\npre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D\nframe, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model\nusing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise\nepistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,\nwe incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the\ndiffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose\nestimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global\nconsistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations\nare further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent\n3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly\noutperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D\nreconstruction quality.

It focuses on the deep\ndisagreements over whether artificial general intelligence (AGI) will prove\ntransformative for human society; a question that is analytically prior to that\nof whether this transformative effect will help or harm humanity. The study\nbegins by distinguishing two fundamental camps in this debate. The first of\nthese can be identified as \"transformationalists,\" who argue that continued AI\ndevelopment will inevitably have a profound effect on society. Opposed to them\nare \"skeptics,\" a more eclectic group united by their disbelief that AI can or\nwill live up to such high expectations. Each camp admits further \"strong\" and\n\"weak\" variants depending on their tolerance for epistemic risk. These stylized\ncontrasts help to identify a set of fundamental questions that shape the camps'\nrespective interpretations of the future of AI. Three questions in particular\nare focused on: the possibility of non-biological intelligence, the appropriate\ntime frame of technological predictions, and the assumed trajectory of\ntechnological development. In highlighting these specific points of\nnon-technical disagreement, this study demonstrates the wide range of different\narguments used to justify either the transformationalist or skeptical position.\nAt the same time, it highlights the strong argumentative burden of the\ntransformationalist position, the way that belief in this position creates\ncompetitive pressures to achieve first-mover advantage, and the need to widen\nthe concept of \"expertise\" in debates surrounding the future development of AI.",

The increasing sensitivity of the detectors and the\nprospects for future detectors suggest that astrophysically motivated analyses\ninvolving multiple mechanisms may be possible. Here, we present a framework for\ncombining two simple models for GW emission - long duration continuous waves\nand short duration bursts - to derive more constraining astrophysical\nimplications than a single model would allow. The best limits arise from using\nmodels that predict a specific amount of GW emission; however, there are\nrelatively few models that make such predictions.

    "abstract": "Idealized networks of integrate-and-fire neurons with impulse-like\ninteractions obey McKean-Vlasov diffusion equations in the mean-field limit.\nThese equations are prone to blowups: for a strong enough interaction coupling,\nthe mean-field rate of interaction diverges in finite time with a finite\nfraction of neurons spiking simultaneously, thereby marking a macroscopic\nsynchronous event. Characterizing these blowup singularities analytically is\nthe key to understanding the emergence and persistence of spiking synchrony in\nmean-field neural models. Such a treatment is possible via time change\ntechniques for a Poissonian variation of the classically considered\nintegrate-and-fire dynamics. However, just as for shock solutions for nonlinear\nconservation laws, there are several admissible blowup solutions to the\ncorresponding McKean-Vlasov equations. Because of this ambiguity, it is unclear\nwhich notion of blowup solutions shall be adopted. Here, we unambiguously\ndefine physical blowup dynamics as solutions to a fixed-point problem bearing\non the time change associated to the McKean-Vlasov equation. To justify the\nphysicality of this formulation, we introduce a buffering mechanism that\nregularizes blowup dynamics, while satisfying the same conservation principles\nas the finite-dimensional particle-system dynamics. We then show that physical\nblowup dynamics are recovered from these regularized solutions in the limit of\nvanishing buffering. Our approach also shows that these physical solutions are\nunique, globally defined, and avoid the so-called eternal blowup phenomenon, as\nlong as the neurons exhibit nonzero, distributed refractory periods, a\nreasonable modeling assumption.",

We consider four-level and\nfive-level facilities (4-LFL and 5-LFL). Although the MFL has been addressed in\nthe literature in various settings, solutions to large-scale, realistic\nproblems are still lacking. This paper considers several variants of the\nvariable neighborhood descent (VND) method, including BVND, PVND, CVND, and\nUVND, for the problem. In each case, a multi-start strategy with strong\ndiversification components is provided. Extensive computational experiments are\npresented to compare methods for large-scale problems involving up to 10,000\ncustomers, 150 distribution centers, 50 warehouses, and 30 plants in the case\nof 4-LFL; and 8,000 customers, 150 distribution centers, 50 warehouses, 50\nplants, and 100 suppliers in the case of 5-LFL. Sensitivity analyses, supported\nby appropriate statistical methods, validate the effectiveness of the\nheuristics' results.",

    "abstract": "Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted\nsignificant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or\nreinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.\nHowever, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not\ncompetitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization\nbetween metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the\nlatent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For\nsuch, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a\nhierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on\nmethods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)\nheuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper\ninvestigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of\nGRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational\nexperiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node\nembedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The\nevaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of\nthe solutions according to the required time for such. According to this\nmeasure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than\nstate-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability\ntest on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further\nconfirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.",

Human labels for RR, based on\ncounting breaths, are known to be inaccurate and time consuming for medical\nstaff. Automated monitoring of RR is in place for some patients, typically\nthose in intensive care units (ICUs), but is absent for the majority of\ninpatients on standard medical wards who are still at risk for clinical\ndeterioration. This work trains a neural network (NN) to label RR from\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry waveforms, which like many biosignals, carry\nmultiple signs of respiratory variation. The NN shows high accuracy on multiple\nvalidation sets (internal and external, same and different sources of RR\nlabels), with mean absolute errors less than 1.78 breaths per minute (bpm) in\nthe worst case. The clinical utility of such a technology is exemplified by\nperforming a retrospective analysis of two patient cohorts that suffered\nadverse events including respiratory failure, showing that continuous RR\nmonitoring could reveal dynamics that strongly tracked with intubation events.\nThis work exemplifies the method of combining pre-existing telemetry monitoring\nsystems and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide accurate, automated and\nscalable patient monitoring, all of which builds towards an AI-based\nhospital-wide early warning system (EWS).",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown the use of equivalent circuit-based infeasibility\nanalysis to identify weak locations in distribution power grids. For\nthree-phase power flow problems, when the power flow solver diverges,\nthree-phase infeasibility analysis (TPIA) can converge and identify weak\nlocations. The original TPIA problem is non-convex, and local minima and saddle\npoints are possible. This can result in grid upgrades that are sub-optimal. To\naddress this issue, we reformulate the original non-convex nonlinear program\n(NLP) as an exact non-convex bilinear program (BLP). Subsequently, we apply the\nspatial branch-and-bound (SBnB) algorithm to compute a solution with near-zero\noptimality gap. To improve SBnB performance, we introduce a bound tightening\nalgorithm with variable filtering and decomposition, which tightens bounds on\nbilinear variables. We demonstrate that sequential bound tightening (SBT)\nsignificantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of Gurobi's SBnB algorithm.\nOur results show that the proposed method can solve large-scale three-phase\ninfeasibility analysis problems with >5k nodes, achieving an optimality gap of\nless than 10e-4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing the developed\npresolve routine for bounding, we can reduce the runtime of SBnB by up to 97%.",

    "abstract": "This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued\nmeaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which\noperate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which\nmeaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive\ntensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit\n\\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling\nirony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a\nsemantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical\ncomputation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward\nstability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,\ntensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a\nmodel of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,\nbut also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not\nfrom simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and\nthat this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one\ndesigned to shape language, not just predict it.",

Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the\nproduction and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit\nthe problem.

    "abstract": "The use of kernels for nonlinear prediction is widespread in machine\nlearning. They have been popularized in support vector machines and used in\nkernel ridge regression, amongst others. Kernel methods share three aspects.\nFirst, instead of the original matrix of predictor variables or features, each\nobservation is mapped into an enlarged feature space. Second, a ridge penalty\nterm is used to shrink the coefficients on the features in the enlarged feature\nspace. Third, the solution is not obtained in this enlarged feature space, but\nthrough solving a dual problem in the observation space. A major drawback in\nthe present use of kernels is that the interpretation in terms of the original\nfeatures is lost. In this paper, we argue that in the case of a wide matrix of\nfeatures, where there are more features than observations, the kernel solution\ncan be re-expressed in terms of a linear combination of the original matrix of\nfeatures and a ridge penalty that involves a special metric. Consequently, the\nexact same predicted values can be obtained as a weighted linear combination of\nthe features in the usual manner and thus can be interpreted. In the case where\nthe number of features is less than the number of observations, we discuss a\nleast-squares approximation of the kernel matrix that still allows the\ninterpretation in terms of a linear combination. It is shown that these results\nhold for any function of a linear combination that minimizes the coefficients\nand has a ridge penalty on these coefficients, such as in kernel logistic\nregression and kernel Poisson regression.

This is partly\nbecause conventional phenomenological yield criteria struggle to combine a\nhighly descriptive, flexible representation with constraints, such as\nconvexity, dictated by thermodynamic consistency. To address this gap, we\nemploy architecturally-constrained neural networks and develop two data-driven\nframeworks: (i) a hybrid model that augments the Hill yield criterion with an\nInput Convex Neural Network (ICNN) to get an anisotropic yield function\nrepresentation in the six-dimensional stress space and (ii) a\npermutation-invariant input convex neural network (PI-ICNN) that learns an\nisotropic yield function representation in the principal stress space and\nembeds anisotropy through linear stress transformations. We calibrate the\nproposed frameworks on a sparse Al-7079 extrusion experimental dataset\ncomprising 12 uniaxial samples with measured yield stresses and Lankford\nratios. To test the robustness of each framework, nine datasets were generated\nusing k-fold cross-validation. These datasets were then used to quantitatively\ncompare Hill-48, Yld2004-18p, pure ICNNs, the hybrid approach, and the PI-ICNN\nframeworks. While ICNNs and hybrid approaches can almost perfectly fit the\ntraining data, they exhibit significant over-fitting, resulting in high\nvalidation and test losses. In contrast, both PI-ICNN frameworks demonstrate\nbetter generalization capabilities, even outperforming Yld2004-18p on the\nvalidation and test data. These results demonstrate that PI-ICNNs unify\nphysics-based constraints with the flexibility of neural networks, enabling the\naccurate prediction of both yield loci and Lankford ratios from minimal data.\nThe approach opens a path toward rapid, thermodynamically consistent\nconstitutive models for advanced forming simulations and future exploration of\ncoupled hardening or microstructure-informed design.",

However, applying these methods to medical\nimaging is challenging due to the scarcity of data, given the high acquisition\ncosts and intricate data characteristics of those images, thereby limiting the\nfull potential of deep neural networks. To address the lack of data,\naugmentation techniques leverage geometry, color, and the synthesis ability of\ngenerative models (GMs). Despite previous efforts, gaps in the generation\nprocess limit the impact of data augmentation to improve understanding of\nmedical images, e.g., the highly structured nature of some domains, such as\nX-ray images, is ignored. Current GMs rely solely on the network's capacity to\nblindly synthesize augmentations that preserve semantic relationships of chest\nX-ray images, such as anatomical restrictions, representative structures, or\nstructural similarities consistent across datasets. In this paper, we introduce\na novel GM that leverages the structural resemblance of medical images by\nlearning a latent graph representation (LGR). We design an end-to-end model to\nlearn (i) a LGR that captures the intrinsic structure of X-ray images and (ii)\na graph convolutional network (GCN) that reconstructs the X-ray image from the\nLGR. We employ adversarial training to guide the generator and discriminator\nmodels in learning the distribution of the learned LGR. Using the learned GCN,\nour approach generates structure-preserving synthetic images by mapping\ngenerated LGRs to X-ray. Additionally, we evaluate the learned graph\nrepresentation for other tasks, such as X-ray image classification and\nsegmentation.

    "abstract": "Cosmic filaments are prominent structures of the matter distribution of the\nUniverse. Modern detection algorithms are an efficient way to identify\nfilaments in large-scale observational surveys of galaxies. Many of these\nmethods were originally designed to work with simulations and/or well-sampled\nspectroscopic surveys. When spectroscopic redshifts are not available, the\nfilaments of the cosmic web can be detected in projection using photometric\nredshifts in slices along the Line of Sight, which enable the exploration of\nlarger cosmic volumes. However, this comes at the expense of a lower redshift\nprecision. It is therefore crucial to assess the differences between filaments\nextracted from exact redshifts and from photometric redshifts for a specific\nsurvey. We apply this analysis to capture the uncertainties and biases of\nfilament extractions introduced by using the photometric sample of the Euclid\nWide Survey. The question that we address in this work is how can we compare\ntwo filament samples derived with redshifts of different precisions in the\nEuclid Wide Survey context. We apply the cosmic web detection algorithm\nDisPerSE, in the redshift range $0.1 \\leq z \\leq 0.5$, to the GAlaxy Evolution\nand Assembly (GAEA) simulated galaxy sample which reproduces several\ncharacteristics of the Euclid Wide Survey. We develop a method to compare\nskeletons derived from photometric redshifts to those derived from true galaxy\npositions. This method expands the commonly used measure of distance between\nfilaments to include geometrical (angles between filaments) and astrophysical\nconsiderations (galaxy mass gradients and connectivity-mass relations). We\nassess whether this approach strengthens our ability to correctly identify\nfilaments in very large surveys such as the Euclid Wide Survey. [abridged]",

    "abstract": "Magnetic field sensors with high sensitivity and spatial resolution have\nprofoundly impacted diverse applications ranging from geo-positioning and\nnavigation to medical imaging, materials science, and space exploration.\nHowever, the use of high-precision magnetometers is often limited due to their\nbulky size or low energy efficiency. In this work, we present the design,\nmodeling and an experimental demonstration of an all-optical magnetometer based\non silicon integrated photonics heterogeneously integrated with a magneto-optic\nthin film. By bonding a thin cerium-yttrium iron garnet layer onto an\nintegrated silicon photonic interferometer, small magnetic field fluctuations\ncan be detected through the non-reciprocal phase shift in the sensor. This\nstrategy enables more than 80 dB of dynamic range with better than\n40~pT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ sensitivity at room temperature. Importantly, by\nleveraging silicon photonics, the core platform is scalable through foundry\nmanufacturing, and the ultra-low power requirements enable complete system\nintegration with on-chip lasers, detectors, and quantum elements for enhanced\nsensitivity. This work provides a path to realizing a compact, scalable, room\ntemperature magnetometer based on integrated photonic systems, opening new\nopportunities for ultra-sensitive and ultra-efficient magnetic field detectors.",

While existing methods capture either aleatoric or epistemic\nuncertainty, few offer closed-form, multidimensional distributions that\npreserve spatial correlation while remaining computationally tractable. In this\nwork, we present a framework for training neural networks with a\nmultidimensional Gaussian loss, generating closed-form predictive distributions\nover outputs with non-identically distributed and heteroscedastic structure.\nOur approach captures aleatoric uncertainty by iteratively estimating the means\nand covariance matrices, and is demonstrated on a super-resolution example. We\nleverage a Fourier representation of the covariance matrix to stabilize network\ntraining and preserve spatial correlation. We introduce a novel regularization\nstrategy -- referred to as information sharing -- that interpolates between\nimage-specific and global covariance estimates, enabling convergence of the\nsuper-resolution downscaling network trained on image-specific distributional\nloss functions. This framework allows for efficient sampling, explicit\ncorrelation modeling, and extensions to more complex distribution families all\nwithout disrupting prediction performance. We demonstrate the method on a\nsurface wind speed downscaling task and discuss its broader applicability to\nuncertainty-aware prediction in scientific models.",

To complemented subsets correspond their characteristic\nfunctions, which are partial, Boolean-valued functions. Similarly, to\northocomplemented subspaces of H correspond partial projections on H. Previous\nwork of Bridges and Svozil on constructive quantum logic is an one-dimensional\napproach to the subject. The lattice-properties of the orthocomplemented\nsubspaces of a Hilbert space is a two-dimensional approach to constructive\nquantum logic, that we call complemented quantum logic. Since the negation of\nan orthocomplemented subspace is formed by swapping its components,\ncomplemented quantum logic, although constructive, is closer to classical\nquantum logic than the constructive quantum logic of Bridges and Svozil. The\nintroduction of orthocomplemented subspaces and their corresponding partial\nprojections allows a new approach to the constructive theory of Hilbert spaces.\nFor example, the partial projection operator of an orthocomplemented subspace\nand the construction of the quotient Hilbert space bypass the standard\nrestrictive hypothesis of locatedness on a subspace.

This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR\n(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a\nnovel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a\nVideo-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into\ncompact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent \"visual event sequences\"\nthrough lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal\npooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual\nevent sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,\nspecifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt\nTuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on\nthe NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods\n(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub).

We find QuAN can provide an efficient and noise-tolerant upper\nbound on the MIPT based on measurement data alone by coupling\nBorn-distribution-level (inter-trajectory) and dynamical (temporal) attention.\nIn particular, our inspection of the inter-trajectory scores of the model\ntrained with minimal sample size processing test data confirmed that QuAN paid\nspecial attention to the tail of the distribution of the Born probabilities at\nearly times. This reassuring interpretation of QuAN's learning implies the\nphase-recognition approach can meaningfully signal MIPT in an experimentally\naccessible manner. Our results lay the groundwork for observing MIPT on\nnear-term quantum hardware and highlight attention-based architectures as\npowerful tools for learning complex quantum dynamics.",

In many-body settings, one can further characterize quantum\noperations based on underlying geometrical constraints, and a natural question\nis to understand the power of resource-generating operations that preserve\nlocality. In this work, we address this question within the resource theory of\nasymmetry, which has recently found applications in the study of many-body\nsymmetry-breaking and symmetry-restoration phenomena. We consider symmetries\ncorresponding to both abelian and non-abelian compact groups with a homogeneous\naction on the space of $N$ qubits, focusing on the prototypical examples of\n$U(1)$ and $SU(2)$. We study the so-called $G$-asymmetry $\\Delta S^{G}_N$, and\npresent two main results.

We prove that, in any spatial dimension, $\\Delta S^{G}_N\\leq\n(1/2)\\Delta S^{G, \\rm max}_N[1+o(1)]$, where $\\Delta S^{G, \\rm max}_N$ is the\nmaximum value of the $G$-asymmetry in the full many-body Hilbert space.

This challenges standard formation channels such as\nclassical stellar evolution and hierarchical mergers. However, stellar rotation\nand magnetic fields, which have not been systematically incorporated in prior\nmodels, can strongly influence the BH properties. We present the first\nself-consistent simulations tracking a massive, low-metallicity helium star\nfrom helium core burning through collapse, BH formation, and post-BH formation\naccretion using 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD)\nsimulations. Starting from a $250\\,M_\\odot$ helium core, we show that collapse\nabove the pair-instability mass gap, aided by rotation and magnetic fields,\ndrives mass loss through disk winds and jet launching. This enables the\nformation of highly spinning BHs within the mass gap and reveals a BH spin-mass\ncorrelation. Strong magnetic fields extract angular momentum from the BH\nthrough magnetically driven outflows, which in turn suppress accretion,\nresulting in slowly spinning BHs within the mass gap. In contrast, stars with\nweak fields permit nearly complete collapse and spin-up of the BH to $\na\\approx1$. We show that massive low-metallicity stars with moderate magnetic\nfields naturally produce BHs whose masses and spins match those inferred for\nGW231123, and are also consistent with those of GW190521. The outflows may\nimpart a BH kick, which can induce spin-orbit misalignment and widen the\npost-collapse orbit, delaying the merger. The outflows launched during collapse\nmay power short-lived, high-luminosity jets comparable to the most energetic\n$\\gamma$-ray bursts, offering a potential observational signature of such\nevents in the early universe.",

However, their global denoising process\ninherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading\nto unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing\ninstructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by\nformulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual\ntokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the\nadherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present\nVAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as\na next-scale prediction problem.

Gas-phase abundance\nratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice\nabundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the\nimportance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger\ndifferences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or\nphysical effects, thus both factors need to be considered when interpreting the\ndata.",

In this work, we address the\nchallenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene\nimage. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a\nnovel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as\ninput, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.\nNotably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;\n(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and\nglobal scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature\nextraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of\n3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;\n(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input\nscenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our\narchitectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image\ninputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the\nefficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this\nparadigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,\npotentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks.

An\nexamination of 3I's pre-encounter kinematics shows that it is likely to be an\nobject from the galactic thick disk, and thus a remnant of the Galaxy's\n``cosmic noon'' period of intense star formation $\\sim$9 - 13 gigayears ago.\nThis kinematic assignment of 3I to the thick disk can be tested observationally\nin the transit of 3I through the solar system. Unfortunately for terrestrial\nobservers, the 3I perihelion will happen when it is on the other side of the\nSun as seen from Earth, at a solar elongation of 12.80 degrees, rendering\nobservation from Earth (or near-Earth space telescopes) hard or impossible.\nWith a retrograde orbit inclined 175.114 degrees (only 4.886 degrees from the\necliptic plane), and a trajectory passing inside the orbit of Mars, 3I will\npass relatively close to a number of already launched interplanetary\nspacecraft. We find a strong science case for observations in the periods of\nthe close approaches of the Psyche spacecraft on 2025 September 4, at 0.302 AU,\nthe martian spacecraft array on 2025 October 3, and the Juice spacecraft on\n2025 November 4. In addition, the Europa Clipper, Hera and even the more\ndistant Lucy spacecraft may pass through 3I's cometary tail in the period after\nits perihelion passage, potentially directly observing the conditions and\ncomposition there. Spacecraft observations could, to the extent they are\npossible, provide the only source of spectral and imaging data during the 3I\nperihelion passage.",

However, existing human mesh\nmodeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body\nposes and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and\nrestrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes\nthe external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal\nskeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic\ndependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct\ncontrol over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present\nATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans\ncaptured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly\ndecouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in\nthe human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,\nfine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent\nof external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by\nfitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative\nevaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture\ncomplex poses compared to linear models.",

    "abstract": "We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and\nvideo generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging\nfrom 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently\nupscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),\nimage-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,\nintegrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance\nmodality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data\nquality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually\nannotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the\nhighest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and\ninference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building\non these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving\nsuperior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,\nit ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial\nAnalysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming\nexisting open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art\ncommercial solutions. We hope this technical report will help the community\nmore efficiently train high-quality video generation models and accelerate\nprogress in video generation technologies.

While 2D melting in\nskyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in\nskyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform\nenergy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions\nin thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be\ndirectly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their\ndynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce\ngeometric confinements of varying shapes.

This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:\nprompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for\ndirect segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a\nrange of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face\nchallenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying\nspecific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we\npropose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational\npathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This\nmodel incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging\nlay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for\ndetailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to\nemphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with\nSAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating\nMolecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results\nfrom both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model\nsignificantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with\nvarying annotation quality.

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by\nknowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,\nbut their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor\nfeedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce\nDeep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for\nmedical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical\nretrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge\nsources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More\ncrutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its\nenvironment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,\nand diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from\nlarge-scale data through RL.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework\nconsistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches\nacross multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves\nsubstantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic\nbaselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks\nfor both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and\nretrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the\nuniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional\nimplementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight\nimprovements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight\ninto its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more\nreliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

    "abstract": "As Einstein's gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, it can be a good\ndescription of physics only at the scales of energy or spacetime curvature\nbelow the Planck mass. Moreover, it requires the presence of an infinite tower\nof higher-derivative corrections, as required in the framework of effective\nfield theory (EFT). Black holes, known to be vacuum solutions in Einstein's\ngravity, necessarily have singularities in the center, where both Einstein's\ngravity and low-energy EFT expansions break down. In this work, we address the\nquestion of whether, in the presence of matter, regular solutions looking like\nblack holes from outside do exist. We show that the matter distribution\nsupporting the regular black hole solution in the presence of Riemann tensor\ncube and Riemann tensor to the fourth power EFT corrections satisfies\npositivity of energy (also called weak energy condition, WEC) and null energy\ncondition (NEC) everywhere outside the horizon. Unlike the case of singular\nsolutions, the EFT description is also valid in the interior of such an object,\ngiven that the maximal curvature is bounded and does not exceed the cut-off\nscale. We found that in a wide range of parameters, WEC is satisfied inside the\nhorizon, but NEC is violated inside the horizon in all cases.",

The VibeLSD decoder is highly versatile: our numerical results show\nit outperforms all practical existing colour code decoders across various\nsyndrome extraction schemes, noise models, and error rates. By estimating qubit\nfootprints through quantum memory simulations, we show that colour codes can\noperate with overhead that is comparable to, and in some cases lower than, that\nof the surface code. This, combined with the fact that localised statistics\ndecoding is a parallel algorithm, makes VibeLSD suitable for implementation on\nspecialised hardware for real-time decoding.

Computed tomography (CT) scans were\nutilized to build a three-dimensional velocity-density model of the specimen's\nhead, parametrized on a high-resolution $1.11$ mm voxel grid.

We next focus on the toothed whale's\nability to locate sources on the median plane, where the role of anatomy is\ncrucial.

    "abstract": "This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization\nalgorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling\nbetween the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing\nthe system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on\nminimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work\ninvestigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve\ntrajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling\nmatrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling\nbehavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength\nand directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory\noptimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,\na sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the\nrequired joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly\naccounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed\nand potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the\ncontrol of free-floating SMSs.",

Furthermore, while the transverse charge\nconductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin\nconductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$\nchannels.

To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive\nmodality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,\nsystematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the\nnative EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal\nframeworks.

Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive\nAdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to\nreduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing\napproaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have\nobtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a\ncommunication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages\nTop-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up\nto 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision\nDiLoCo.

    "abstract": "In quantum information and computation, generation of entanglement through\nunitary gates remains a significant and active area of research. However, there\nare states termed as absolutely separable, from which entanglement cannot be\ncreated through any non-local unitary action. Thus, from a resource-theoretic\nperspective, non-absolutely separable states are useful as they can be turned\ninto entangled states using some appropriate unitary gates. In this work, we\npropose an efficient method to detect non-absolutely separable states. Our\napproach relies on evaluating moments that can bypass the need for full state\ntomography, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. We then present\nseveral examples in support of our detection scheme. We also address a closely\nrelated problem concerning states whose partial transpose remains positive\nunder any arbitrary non-local unitary action. Furthermore, we examine the\neffectiveness of our moment-based approach in the detection of quantum channels\nthat are not absolutely separating, which entails the detection of resource\npreserving channels. Finally, we demonstrate the operational significance of\nnon-absolutely separable states by proving that every such state can provide an\nadvantage in a quantum-channel discrimination task.",

    "abstract": "The thought experiment called Wigner's Friend has experienced a renewal of\ninterest for interrogating the meaning of intersubjectivity and objectivity in\nquantum mechanics. These new inquiries extend to investigations at the\nintersection of phenomenology and QBism. Philosopher of physics Steven French\nhas criticized QBism on the grounds that it does not give assurances that\nWigner and friend must agree on the same quantum state or the same set of facts\nin the experiment. In this paper, we draw on Wigner's Friend to argue that\nintersubjective agreement on quantum states is unnecessary. We defend the QBist\nnotion of reciprocity, treating Wigner and friend as \"peer observers\" or\nphysical systems taking mutual actions on each other. We argue that accounts of\nintersubjectivity that preserve the possibility of privileged observation,\nvantage points for solipsistic super-observers, undermine the epistemic\nbenefits we look for when we insist on intersubjectivity agreement as a\ncriterion for objectivity. In its place, the QBist notion of reciprocity leads\nto sharper characterization of what it means to objectify quantum systems with\na quantum state assignment. Drawing on phenomenological resources, we argue\nthat state assignments for quantum systems, including those for Wigner and\nfriend, are thematizations. To assign a quantum state is to thematize a\nphenomenon as a quantum system, to treat something as the sort of object to\nwhich the formalism applies. Our argument accounts for why the quantum\nformalism does not radically change in application for different systems\nbecause the systems themselves exceed their formalization.",

No improvements in the RBM\ntraining are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences\nbetween the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low\nprobability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the\nquality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training.

The feasibility of using\nQA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative\nreplay is demonstrated in this work for the first time.

First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support\nmultiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of\nheterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint\nenforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,\nreducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,\nto address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier\nfeature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple\nmappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,\nwe introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the\nterminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint\nfor the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we\npropose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which\npreserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger\npenalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively\nchallenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the\ntransonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,\nhigh-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of\nspatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent\nKolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive\naccuracy across all cases.

However, their\nsubstantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where\nfrequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the\ndominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\\% of query latency. Existing static\ncaching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by\npreloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second\nphase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high\nrecall.

GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores\nentry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that\nadaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search\nphase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,\nGoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the\nsame or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.\nExtensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations\nby 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query\nlatency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nimpressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from\nbias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language\nmodels (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic\ninformation. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'\npre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To\naddress this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt\nRouting (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for\nclasses, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the\ndynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal\nprompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions\nthrough logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,\nincluding CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves\ncomparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm\nthe effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our\ndynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible\nand efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.",

    "abstract": "Oscillometry is the standard method for non-invasive, cuff-based blood\npressure (BP) measurement, but it introduces systematic errors that may impact\nclinical accuracy. This study investigates the sources of these\nerrors--primarily the limitations of oscillometry itself and\nrespiration-induced fluctuations--using BP waveform data from the MIMIC\ndatabase. Oscillometry tends to underestimate systolic BP and overestimate\ndiastolic BP, while respiration introduces cyclical variations that further\ndegrade measurement precision. To mitigate these effects, we propose an\nestimation-theoretic framework employing least squares (LS) and maximum\nlikelihood (ML) methods for correcting both single and repeated BP\nmeasurements. LS estimation supports conventional multi-measurement averaging\nprotocols, whereas the ML approach incorporates prior knowledge of measurement\nerrors, offering improved performance.

Using\ncross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and\nphilosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim\nis that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of\nbecoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.\nTo address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian\nphilosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the\nAI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and\nindividuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the\nself-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens\npersonalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the\nrecursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by\ninfrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and\ntemporal recursion.

    "abstract": "Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,\nand disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2\nbuilding models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements\nessential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this\nlimitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and\nunderpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual\nmodeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,\nCM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models\nleveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.\nUnlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs\nwith synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map\nGenerator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured\nmodels can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase\nsegmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in\nsegmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with\nuncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research\ncontributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving\nthe way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling.

We describe how to use the same\narchitecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\\frac{1}{B}$\nwhere $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is\n$\\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in\nthe DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return,\nthen correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This\nproduces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity\nfunction expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler\nshifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely\nstudied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of\nwaveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from\nthe perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the\ndiscretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of\nthe radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity\nsurface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete\nHeisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal\nprocessing is $\\mathcal{O}\\big(B^2T^2\\big)$.

    "abstract": "Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress\nin recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,\nPause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling\nstates, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range\nof challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can\nalready noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional\nsupervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical\npoints in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes\nleads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our\nperturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success\nrate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger\nmanipulation.",

We identify characteristic features in the infrared regime that\nmay be used as a stacking-order fingerprint for the mixed stacking tetralayer\nand the trilayer polytypes caused by a strong double resonance effect. Further\nto this, we find that the tetralayers systematically produce an SHG response\nthat is significantly larger as compared to the trilayers. We then studied the\nSHG signal by the tetralayer polytypes in the terahertz regime and demonstrated\nthe signal is highly sensitive the environmental conditions. Furthermore, we\nalso find that accidental doping of graphene will strongly suppress the SHG\nsignal in this regime. The above findings emphasize the need for a spectral\napproach to the identification of stacking order by SHG. Thus, measurements at\none frequency are insufficient to confidently identify the stacking order due\nto the environmental sensitivities, since SHG can be readily induced with a\ncomparable magnitude in the centrosymmetric polytypes through external\nsymmetry-breaking.",

While large language models (LLMs)\noffer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area\nis hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.\nTo address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new\nbenchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science\ndomain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a\ntopic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited\nreferences, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers\nthat serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated\nevaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:\ninformation coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and\ncontent quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that\nsurvey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection\nframeworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the\nnecessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and\nmodels at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE",

In the large-$N$ limit these heavy operators are dual to sphere\nand AdS giant gravitons, realised holographically as D3-branes wrapping an\n$S^3$ inside either the $S^5$ or the $AdS_5$ factor of the $AdS_5 \\times S^5$\nbackground geometry. These HHLL correlators thus describe the scattering of two\ngravitons off D3-branes. In the planar limit we derive exact expressions for\nthe HHLL integrated correlators as functions of both the 't Hooft coupling and\nthe giant graviton dimension. Remarkably, despite exhibiting distinct\nperturbative expansions at weak coupling, these integrated correlators share\nthe same universal asymptotic series at strong coupling. We also demonstrate\nthat a seemingly unrelated integrated correlator in a $USp(2N)$ $\\mathcal{N}=2$\ngauge theory, holographically dual to gluon-graviton scattering off D7-branes,\nexhibits precisely the same strong coupling asymptotic series. This reveals a\nstriking universality of D-brane scattering processes. Furthermore, we compute\nthe exponentially suppressed corrections at strong coupling for all these\nobservables, showing that they are precisely the non-perturbative effects that\naccount for the differences between these integrated correlators beyond the\nuniversal asymptotic series. Finally, we comment on the resurgent properties\nand the holographic interpretation of these exponentially suppressed terms.",

Recently, several approaches have\nachieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and\nHD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale\noffline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable\ncomputational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a\nknowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models\nwith prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student\nmodel. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal\nknowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)\nparadigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with\nSD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with\nprior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge\ntransfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,\nwe introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D\nPatch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked\nSemantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive\nexperiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves\nthe student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously\naccelerating inference speed.

We propose\nTensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the\nlatent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs\nattention independently per shard, and then combines results with an\nall-reduce.

Applying simple orthogonal\ntransforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further\nmitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation.

    "abstract": "Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns\ncontinue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only\nin sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used\nmachine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve\nindividual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as\nincorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these\nmethods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees\nof fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees\nprimarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce\ndefinitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance\nindividual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a\nnovel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout\ntraining. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair\ninitialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a\nfairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model\nlearns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response\nmechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness\nguarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness\nthroughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our\napproach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and\naccurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative\napproach based on certified training (which requires neural network\nverification during training).",

The\nproposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution,\nand the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform\nconstellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points\nwithout compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since\nthe proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters,\neach associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the\nnumerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the\nconstellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation\n(PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM\nreceiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of\nOFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate\nperformance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the\nreceiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the\npresence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of\nconstellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to\nsimultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive\nwhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading\nchannels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system\nsignificantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded\nBICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading\nchannels.",

While\nnumerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular\nautomated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of\nclassification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the\nestimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes\na Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key\nscientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language\nexperience and the association between children's production and their input.\nIn both the most commonly used \\gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the\nVoice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification\nerrors can significantly distort estimates.

We further\nshow that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of\neffect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof\nsolution.

Both sources furthermore show the same quasi-periodic\nmodulation from the main and interpulse, at timescales exceeding 100 pulse\nperiods.

Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it\nfrequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly\ndiscernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for\nexperienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both\nlabeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence\nvalues. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a\ndata annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in\neach labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in\nreal-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence\nvalues during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better\nthan a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very\nconfident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates\nthe impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only\nsegmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes.

Unlike traditional ASC systems that\nrely solely on audio inputs, this challenge provides additional textual\ninformation as inputs, including the location where the audio is recorded and\nthe time of recording. In this paper, we present our proposed system for the\nASC task in the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge. Specifically, we propose a\nmultimodal network, ASCMamba, which integrates audio and textual information\nfor fine-grained acoustic scene understanding and effective multimodal ASC. The\nproposed ASCMamba employs a DenseEncoder to extract hierarchical spectral\nfeatures from spectrograms, followed by a dual-path Mamba blocks that capture\nlong-range temporal and frequency dependencies using Mamba-based state space\nmodels. In addition, we present a two-step pseudo-labeling mechanism to\ngenerate more reliable pseudo-labels. Results show that the proposed system\noutperforms all the participating teams and achieves a 6.2% improvement over\nthe baseline.

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, high-harmonic spectroscopy has been successfully\nextended to the study of ultrafast electron motion in solids, shedding light on\nfundamental processes such as Bloch oscillations and higher-order nonlinear\nphenomena. In this work, we present theoretical studies of high-harmonic\nspectroscopy applied to topological materials including higher-order ones,\nfocusing on several key observables associated with high-harmonic generation -\nnamely, helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity dependence. We extend\ncurrent all-optical measurement approaches from lower-order topological\ninsulators (LOTIs) to higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), employing\nthree distinct models: a Haldane model for Chern insulators, Kane-Mele model\nfor topological insulators, and a breathing Kagome lattice for HOTIs. This work\naims to resolve whether helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity\ndependence can reveal signatures of topological states. For the Chern\ninsulators and topological insulators, we find that these observables can\nindeed capture topological phases. In contrast, for HOTIs, no clear signatures\nof topology emerge in the harmonic spectrum, suggesting that a more careful\nanalysis is required to identify topological invariants in higher-order\ntopological insulators. In particular, for the topological semimetal phase, we\nfind a harmonic enhancement by two to three orders of magnitude in the Kagome\nlattice. Our study delineates the conditions under which high-harmonic\nspectroscopy serves as a unique tool for diagnosing topological phases,\nparticularly for those associated with topological corner states.",

Here, we analyze structural motifs in colloidal crystals and glasses\nand correlate them with the local caging potential.

Both crystalline and amorphous systems also contain large number of\nparticles belonging to stable defective motifs, which are distortions of the\nregular motifs. Under shear, large clusters of defective motifs fragment into\nsmaller ones, driving plastic deformation and the transition from a solid-like\nto a liquid-like state in amorphous suspensions. Particles that leave clusters\nof stable motifs are associated with shallower caging potentials and are more\nprone to plastic rearrangements, ultimately leading to motif disintegration\nduring shear.

    "abstract": "This work newly establishes the feasibility and practical value of a sum of\nsquares (SOS)-based stability verification procedure for applied control\nproblems utilizing neural-network-based controllers (NNCs). It successfully\nverifies closed-loop stability properties of a NNC synthesized using a\ngeneralizable procedure to imitate a robust, tube-based model predictive\ncontroller (MPC) for a two-wheeled inverted pendulum demonstrator system. This\nis achieved by first developing a state estimator and control-oriented model\nfor the two-wheeled inverted pendulum. Next, this control-oriented model is\nused to synthesize a baseline linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and a robust,\ntube-based MPC, which is computationally too demanding for real-time execution\non the demonstrator system's embedded hardware. The generalizable synthesis\nprocedure generates an NNC imitating the robust, tube-based MPC. Via an\nSOS-based stability verification procedure, a certificate of local asymptotic\nstability and a relevant inner estimate of the region of attraction (RoA) are\nobtained for the closed-loop system incorporating this NNC. Finally,\nexperimental results on the physical two-wheeled inverted pendulum demonstrate\nthat the NNC both stabilizes the system, and improves the control performance\ncompared to the baseline LQR in both regulation and reference-tracking tasks.",

In\nabout 180 hours of observation, we detected 155 bursts at 2.25~GHz above a\nfluence threshold of 0.72~Jy~ms, but none at 8.60~GHz above a fluence threshold\nof 0.27~Jy~ms. FRB~20240114A exhibited frequency-dependent activity, as\nevidenced by the non-detections in 14.3 hours of observations at 2.25~GHz prior\nto 2024 February 24, despite its reported activity below 2~GHz. In contrast to\nits low-activity state reported below 1.4~GHz between 2024 June and December,\nFRB~20240114A exhibited high activity at 2.25~GHz in 2024 July with a mean\nburst rate of $1.72^{+0.18}_{-0.16}~\\rm{hr}^{-1}$, followed by a low-activity\nstate. We also detected a short-term reactivation at 2.25~GHz around 2025\nJanuary 20, about two weeks after renewed activity was reported below 1.4~GHz\nby other telescopes. The median burst width at 2.25~GHz is 3~ms, which is\nnarrower than that at lower frequencies. The waiting time distribution peaks at\n1019~s, and burst arrivals on hourly timescales consistent with a Poisson\nprocess. The isotropic-equivalent energy of bursts spans $10^{37}\n-10^{39}$~erg. The distribution of burst energy above the completeness\nthreshold ($7.5\\times10^{37}$~erg) follows a power-law relation with an index\nof $\\gamma=-1.20\\pm0.03\\pm0.02$.

    "abstract": "Factor score estimation in small sample sizes often encounters parameter bias\nand convergence failures when constructing hierarchical national/sub-national\nindices. This paper proposes a novel method for hierarchical factor analysis\ncalled \"sequential Confirmatory Factor Analysis\". Instead of estimating\nmultiple levels of factors at the same time, this approach calculates factor\nscores sequentially from the lowest to highest levels. This sequential\nestimation keeps the original sample size in each step and also removes\ncross-level covariance estimation. Using a series of Monte Carlo simulations,\nwe isolate the difference between sequential Confirmatory Factor Analysis and\ntraditional Confirmatory Factor Analysis by comparing their resulting factor\nscores to the true latent variables under varying conditions. We also estimate\nthe WJP Rule of Law Index using traditional Confirmatory Factor Analysis,\nBayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and sequential Confirmatory Factor\nAnalysis to test performance. Our findings demonstrate that sequential\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis significantly outperforms the traditional model\nfor indices with simple/moderate complexity. Traditional Confirmatory Factor\nAnalysis performs better where the data are skewed. Where the hierarchical\nmodel becomes complex, the two methods perform similarly. Finally, sequential\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis can provide valid estimates where traditional or\nBayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis fail to converge.",

This externally imposed modulation\nleads to a reconstructed multi-band structure with flat bands emerging in\ncertain energy regions. When the chemical potential is tuned into one of these\nflat bands, the associated increase in the density of states can strongly\nenhance the superconducting critical temperature Tc compared to the homogeneous\ncase while maintaining the superfluid stiffness Ds at a sizeable value. We also\nclarify the role of the quantum geometric effect for flat bands in such\ntopologically trivial systems. While the overall paramagnetic interband\ncontribution to the stiffness is negative we identify a class of certain\ninterband scattering processes which enhance Ds and scale with the interaction,\nplaying therefore the same role as quantum geometric effects in conventional\nflat band models. The enhancement of superconductivity is found to be robust\nagainst weak to moderate disorder, suggesting that the system is not overly\nsensitive to imperfections which is an important prerequisite for experimental\nrealizations. Our results demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a\ncompelling alternative to twist-based moire systems, providing a pathway toward\ntailoring superconductivity via lithographic design.",

One particularly important aspect is the\nconfiguration of the RIS elements or reflectors. Simply stated, the objective\nof the RIS configuration is to choose the optimum phase-shift combination that\nmaximizes the channel capacity. Recently, neural networks (NNs) were proposed\nfor tackling this task and results have shown that the proposed NN promotes far\nless reconfigurations of the RIS, consequently reducing the configuration\noverhead. Beyond that, the RIS can be repurposed for tackling the Doppler shift\nin high-mobility communication systems.

However, the typical\nreflection-only constraint for RIS systems limits the spatial coverage and\nsignal amplification potential achieved by such systems. Therefore, the\nsimultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(STAR-RIS) can be employed to address these limitations by its dual\nfunctionality of transmitting and reflecting signals concurrently.

The FE model is calibrated using molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations employing the potential of Kolmogorov and Crespi. This study\nfocuses mainly on the effect of boundary conditions on sliding behavior and\nstrain transfer between layers when the substrate is subjected to uniform\nbiaxial deformations. The interlayer shearing or sliding behavior is found to\ndepend on the presence of critical parameters, namely, the applied strain to\nthe substrate and the length of the GNR. The FE results indicate that the\napplied strain transferred from the substrate to the GNR varies linearly up to\na critical value ec beyond which it decreases suddenly. Further, ec is found to\nappear beyond a critical GNR length, Le is approximately 14 nm. Furthermore, a\nlength parameter Ld is approximately 10 nm is computed, beyond which the\nsliding of GNR is dissipative. Through FE simulations, it is also found that\nfor a GNR length is greater than or equal to 17 nm, the edge pulling force\nsaturates. Our results also highlight the importance of the inertia of GNR on\nits sliding for different boundary conditions.

This approach involves calculating the probability of observed DNA\nprofiles under various scenarios, traditionally assuming a uniform genetic\nbackground for all individuals. However, this assumption is unrealistic in\npractice due to population substructure, where allele frequencies differ among\nsubpopulations. To address this, modified LR-based approaches have been\nproposed, including methods such as calculating likelihood ratios using average\nallele frequencies (LRLAF) or the maximum, minimum, and average likelihood\nratios (LRMAX, LRMIN, and LRAVG). Despite these developments, further\nadvancements are needed to improve the testing of genetic relationships in the\npresence of subpopulation structures. Results: We propose a novel LR-based\nstatistic designed to account for population substructure by incorporating a\nclassification step to address nuisance parameters. Specifically, two DNA\nprofiles with unknown subpopulation origins are simultaneously classified into\none group. Following this classification, the likelihood ratio (LRCLASS) is\napplied. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed LRCLASS statistic, when\npaired with Naive Bayes classification, exhibits higher statistical power than\nexisting methods for testing full-sibling relationships in the Thai population.\nConclusion: The proposed LRCLASS statistic enhances the power of familial DNA\nsearches by effectively addressing population substructure through a novel\nclassification-based approach.

The probability\nof a galaxy to host a BBH is related to its properties, for example stellar\nmass and star formation rate. These properties can be estimated from\nobservables, such as the luminosity in certain observation bands. We refer to\nthis description of host galaxy properties as host galaxy weighting models.\nHowever, the host galaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately\ndetermined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy\nweighting models. Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish\ndifferent host galaxy weighting models using a data driven approach. We use the\nGW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth\nobserving run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock\nspectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes\nfactors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and\nuniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting\nmodels show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case,\nand a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a\n~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of\nwell-localised events.",

Second, they lack explicit\nmodeling of class-conditional feature distributions.

For instance, electricity companies\nare interested in forecasting the total electricity demand in a specific region\nto ensure reliable grid operation and resource allocation. However, to our\nknowledge, statistical learning specifically for forecasting aggregate values\nhas not yet been well-established. In particular, the relationship between\nforecast error and the number of clusters has not been well studied, as\nclustering is usually treated as unsupervised learning. This study introduces a\nnovel forecasting method specifically focused on the aggregate values in the\nlinear regression model. We call it the Aggregate Value Regression (AVR), and\nit is constructed by combining all regression models into a single model. With\nthe AVR, we must estimate a huge number of parameters when the number of\nregression models to be combined is large, resulting in overparameterization.\nTo address the overparameterization issue, we introduce a hierarchical\nclustering technique, referred to as AVR-C (C stands for clustering). In this\napproach, several clusters of regression models are constructed, and the AVR is\nperformed within each cluster. The AVR-C introduces a novel bias-variance\ntrade-off theory under the assumption of a misspecified model. In this\nframework, the number of clusters characterizes model complexity.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the relaxation dynamics of a one-dimensional diatomic hard-point\n(DHP) gas, presenting a phase diagram that characterizes relaxation behavior\nacross the full parameter space, from near-integrable to far-from-integrable\nregimes. We analyze thermalization (local energy relaxation in nonequilibrium\nstates) and identify three universal dynamical regimes: (i) In the\nnear-integrable regime, kinetic processes dominate, local energy relaxation\ndecays exponentially, and the thermalization time $\\tau$ scales as $\\tau\n\\propto \\delta^{-2}$. (ii) In the far-from-integrable regime, hydrodynamic\neffects dominate, energy relaxation decays power-law, and thermalization time\nscales linearly with system size $N$. (iii) In the intermediate regime, the\nBogoliubov phase emerges, characterized by the transition from kinetic to\nhydrodynamic relaxation. The phase diagram also shows that hydrodynamic\nbehavior can emerge in small systems when sufficiently far from the integrable\nregime, challenging the view that such effects occur only in large systems. In\nthe thermodynamic limit, the system's relaxation depends on the order in which\nthe limits ($N \\to \\infty$ or $\\delta \\to 0$) are taken.

In order to enhance the identity unlinkability among anonymized\nutterances from the same original speaker, the targeted attack training\nstrategy is usually applied to anonymize the utterances to a common designated\nspeaker. However, this strategy may violate the privacy of the designated\nspeaker who is an actual speaker. To mitigate this risk, this paper proposes an\nany-to-any training strategy. It is accomplished by defining a batch mean loss\nto anonymize the utterances from various speakers within a training mini-batch\nto a common pseudo-speaker, which is approximated as the average speaker in the\nmini-batch. Based on this, a speaker-adversarial speech generation model is\nproposed, incorporating the supervision from both the untargeted attack and the\nany-to-any strategies. The speaker attribute perturbations are generated and\nincorporated into the original speech to produce its anonymized version. The\neffectiveness of the proposed model was justified in asynchronous voice\nanonymization through experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb datasets.\nAdditional experiments were carried out to explore the potential limitations of\nspeaker-adversarial speech in voice privacy protection.

Ensuring the physical property of the\ndenoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep\nunfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a\nphysical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks\nconvergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the\nhidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and\nmodels them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the\noptimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium\nConvolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local\nspatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global\nspatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse\ncoding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse\nrepresentation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while\nunshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral\ndetails. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is\nembedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is\nintegrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate\nthe proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and\ntransform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within\nthe framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method\nachieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

In this\nmodel, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical,\nwhile those at different distances are independent random variables (or their\nanalogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is\nalso considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are\nused to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal\nstates. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse\nparticipation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to\na qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and\ntypical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the\nmultifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be\nunderpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective\none-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson\nlocalisation. The interplay between the exponential localisation of states on\nthese chains, and the exponential growth of the number of sites with distance\nfrom the root, is the origin of the observed multifractality.",

Five key\noperational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,\npressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,\ncombining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the\n95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of\ndocumented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using\ndomain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating\nranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to\ndistinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.\nResults showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy\nacross all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging\nfaults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual\nanalyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated\nthat the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities.

    "abstract": "In response to the challenges in large-scale quantum state simulation on\nclassical computing platforms, including memory limits, frequent disk I/O, and\nhigh computational complexity, this study builds upon a previously proposed\nhierarchical storage-based quantum simulation system and introduces an\noptimization framework, the Quantum Vector Optimization Framework (QVecOpt).\nQVecOpt integrates four strategies: amplitude pairing, cache optimization,\nblock storage optimization, and parallel optimization. These collectively\nenhance state vector storage and computational scheduling. The amplitude\npairing mechanism locates relevant amplitude pairs via bitwise XOR, reducing\ntraversal complexity of single-qubit gates from $O(2^n)$ to $O(1)$. Cache\noptimization pre-allocates buffers and loads only required data, cutting disk\nI/O. Block storage optimization partitions the state vector for on-demand\nloading and local updates, reducing redundant access. Parallel optimization\ndistributes the state vector across nodes for collaborative computation,\nachieving near-linear speedup. Complexity analysis shows that, compared with\nhierarchical storage simulation, the method reduces state vector traversals for\nsingle-qubit gates from $2^n$ to 1, removing the main bottleneck. It also\nlowers computational and I/O complexity from $O(2^n)$ to $O(2^n/C)$ and\n$O(2^n/B)$. In simulations of 16-29 qubits, efficiency improves nearly tenfold,\nbreaking the memory bottleneck of existing tools and enabling high-bit quantum\ncircuit simulations beyond traditional methods. This work provides an\nefficient, scalable solution for classical simulation of large-scale quantum\ncomputation with significant academic and practical value.",

However, the high-frequency traversal characteristic of quantum\nsimulators represents an unprecedented demand in the history of IT, and\nexisting distributed technologies is unable to meet this requirement, resulting\nin a single-node bottleneck of quantum simulator. To overcome this limitation,\nthis paper introduces a novel Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum\nSimulator (DSLSQS). By leveraging an innovative distributed architecture in\nwhich multiple computational nodes share data storage directly, together with\nDe-TCP/IP networking technology, DSLSQS effectively eliminates East-West data\nflow in distributed systems.

Furthermore,\nthis paper systematically analyzes the performance and cost constraints of\ndistributed quantum simulator cluster, identifying distributed networking as\nthe primary performance bottleneck and highlighting that minimizing storage\ncosts is crucial to reducing the total cost. Finally, experimental evaluations\nwith a 27-qubit simulation confirm the successful implementation of layered\nstorage within the quantum simulator.

As concerns over data privacy and regulatory\ncompliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of\nspecific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the\nfederated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,\nintegrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely\nunexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the\nunlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this\npaper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated\nunlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the\nglobal model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we\npropose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor\nand camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated\ntraining process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage\nsamples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive\nexperiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the\neffectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated\nunlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and\nrobust federated unlearning mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to\ntheir immense size and computational requirements. Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a\nprimary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank\ncorrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual\nerror. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and\nLlama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to\n51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,\nconsistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse. CALR's success shows\nthat treating functional information loss as a learnable signal is a highly\neffective compression paradigm. This approach enables the creation of\nsignificantly smaller, more efficient LLMs, advancing their accessibility and\npractical deployment in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of\nstructures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across\na wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is\nparticularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando\n(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity\nmeasurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during\nthe measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative\nmethods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may\nnot be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require\nmanual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less\nadaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning\napproach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field\nregime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A\nphysics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both\nthe phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane\nfrom a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase\nretrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated\ntraining data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,\nas acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due\nto the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The\nalgorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging\nconditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality\nreconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at\nbeamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum\nHereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and\nabsorption information.",

While past research on equitable access has focused mainly\non form, studies of functions have been constrained by limited scale and coarse\nmeasurement. Existing efforts have partially quantified functions through\nsmall-scale surveys and movement data (e.g., GPS) or general usage records\n(e.g., CDR), but have not captured the activities and motivations underlying\npark visits. As a result, our understanding of the functional roles urban parks\nplay remains incomplete. To address this gap, we introduce a method that\nrefines mobile base station coverage using antenna azimuths, enabling clearer\ndistinction of mobile traffic within parks versus surrounding areas. Using\nParis as a case study, we analyze a large-scale set of passively collected\nper-app mobile network traffic - 492 million hourly records for 45 parks. We\ntest two hypotheses: the central-city hypothesis, which posits multifunctional\nparks emerge in dense, high-rent areas due to land scarcity; and the\nsocio-spatial hypothesis, which views parks as reflections of neighborhood\nroutines and preferences. Our analysis shows that parks have distinctive mobile\ntraffic signatures, differing from both their surroundings and from each other.\nBy clustering parks on temporal and app usage patterns, we identify three\nfunctional types - lunchbreak, cultural, and recreational - with different\nvisitation motivations. Centrally located parks (cultural and lunchbreak)\ndisplay more diverse app use and temporal variation, while suburban\n(recreational) parks reflect digital behaviors of nearby communities, with app\npreferences aligned to neighborhood income. These findings demonstrate the\nvalue of mobile traffic as a proxy for studying urban green space functions,\nwith implications for park planning, public health, and well-being.",

    "abstract": "In recent experiments, inorganic scintillators have been used to study the\ndecays of exotic nuclei, providing an alternative to silicon detectors and\nenabling measurements that were previously impossible. However, proper use of\nthese materials requires us to understand and quantify the scintillation\nprocess. In this work, we propose a framework based on that of Birks [Proc.\nPhys. Soc. A 64, 874] and Meyer and Murray [Phys. Rev. 128, 98] to model the\nlight output of inorganic scintillators in response to beams of energetic heavy\nions over a broad range of energies. Our model suggests that, for sufficiently\nheavy ions at high energies, the majority of the light output is associated\nwith the creation of delta electrons, which are induced by the passage of the\nbeam through the material. These delta electrons dramatically impact the\nresponse of detection systems when subject to ions with velocities typical of\nbeams in modern fragmentation facilities. We test the accuracy of our model\nwith data from Lutetium Yttrium Orthosilicate (LYSO:Ce), a common inorganic\nscintillator. We compare calculated light production and quenching factors with\nexperimental data for heavy ions of varying mass and energy as well as make a\nquantitative estimate of the effects of delta rays on overall light output. The\nmodel presented herein will serve as a basic framework for further studies of\nscintillator response to heavy ions. Our results are crucial in planning future\nexperiments where relativistic exotic nuclei are interacting with scintillator\ndetectors.",

The use of\nensemble simulations from numerical weather prediction models results in\nprobabilistic PV forecasts in the form of a forecast ensemble. However, weather\nforecasts often exhibit systematic errors that propagate through the model\nchain, leading to biased and/or uncalibrated PV power predictions.

SRDrone incorporates two key\ntechnical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation\nmethodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide\nexplanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on\nsingle-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.\nSecond, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification\nmodel. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained\nstrategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in\nSuccess Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment\nutilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement\nattains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within\nan industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the\ngeneral reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the\nstringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones.

Building on the single-view\nmethod ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,\nimproving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the\nproposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a\nsingle SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view\nconsistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that\nguides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added\nvia normal map integration.

Due to the near real-time response requirements of this\ntask, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed,\nsupplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However,\nthese optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect\nwhere performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied\nby degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's\nperformance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading\nindustry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the\nFill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct\na diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with\nheuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus\nwith cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call\ngraphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both\nfile-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a\ntwo-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model.\nFirst, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following\nthis, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with\npreference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code\ncompletion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and\nCoLT.

However, the vast\nmajority of CP methods assume that all units in the training data have fully\nobserved data on both the outcome and covariates of primary interest, an\nassumption that rarely holds in practice. In reality, training data are often\nmissing the outcome, a subset of covariates, or both on some units. In\naddition, time-to-event outcomes in the training set may be censored due to\ndropout or administrative end-of-follow-up. Accurately accounting for such\ncoarsened data in the training sample while fulfilling the primary objective of\nwell-calibrated conformal predictive inference, requires robustness and\nefficiency considerations. In this paper, we consider the general problem of\nobtaining distribution-free valid prediction regions for an outcome given\ncoarsened training data. Leveraging modern semiparametric theory, we achieve\nour goal by deriving the efficient influence function of the quantile of the\noutcome we aim to predict, under a given semiparametric model for the coarsened\ndata, carefully combined with a novel conformal risk control procedure. Our\nprincipled use of semiparametric theory has the key advantage of facilitating\nflexible machine learning methods such as random forests to learn the\nunderlying nuisance functions of the semiparametric model.

Specifically, we propose in-context training and\nmulti-context retrieval, which enable candidate-specific interaction between\nuser sequence and candidate item, and ensure training-serving consistency under\nthe search-based paradigm. Extensive online A/B testing conducted on a\nlarge-scale e-commerce platform demonstrates statistically significant\nimprovements, confirming the framework's effectiveness. Currently,\nLongRetriever has been fully deployed in the platform, impacting billions of\nusers.",

Existing work has proven\nthat some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations\n(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,\ncontractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved\nunder certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can\nbe dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a\nlight whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite\nunexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing\nproblems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial\nconfiguration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,\nonly provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including\nmultiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length\nof the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the\nnumber of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the\nUniversal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential\nrobots to implement a distributed counter mechanism.

Listening effort represents a significant challenge in\nspeech-hearing research, particularly for aging populations and those with\nhearing impairment. We collected 64-channel EEG data from 122 participants\nduring speech comprehension under four conditions: clean, noisy, MMSE-enhanced,\nand Transformer-enhanced speech. Statistical analyses confirmed that alpha\noscillations (8-13 Hz) exhibited significantly higher power during noisy speech\nprocessing compared to clean or enhanced conditions, confirming their validity\nas objective biomarkers of listening effort. To address the substantial\ninter-individual variability in EEG signals, EffortNet integrates three\ncomplementary learning paradigms: self-supervised learning to leverage\nunlabeled data, incremental learning for progressive adaptation to individual\ncharacteristics, and transfer learning for efficient knowledge transfer to new\nsubjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that Effort- Net achieves 80.9%\nclassification accuracy with only 40% training data from new subjects,\nsignificantly outperforming conventional CNN (62.3%) and STAnet (61.1%) models.\nThe probability-based metric derived from our model revealed that\nTransformer-enhanced speech elicited neural responses more similar to clean\nspeech than MMSEenhanced speech.

    "abstract": "Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing\ncustomer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts\nhave predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized\nadvertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant\npotential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.\nPrior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost\nrevenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of\ndeveloping intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work\nintroduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,\ndeveloped by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,\nspecifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a\ncontrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information\nNoise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant\noffers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the\nadaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the\nlatent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The\nmodel is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate\ncustomer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results\ndemonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised\nfine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives\nin advancing personalized marketing.",

    "abstract": "High-performance photonic chips provide a powerful platform for analog\ncomputing, enabling the simulation of high-dimensional physical systems using\nlow-dimensional devices with additional synthetic dimensions. The realization\nof large-scale complex simulations necessitates an architecture capable of\narbitrary coupling configurations (encompassing symmetric, asymmetric and\nlong-range coupling schemes) which is also crucial for scaling up. Previous\napproaches rely on excessive physical components to introduce asymmetric\ncoupling, however, are restricted in reconfiguring and scaling by the\nrelatively complicated structures. Here, to solve this problem, we propose a\nhybrid-frequency synthetic-dimension simulator architecture that combines both\nintra-resonant and inter-resonant frequency-lattice sites, and experimentally\ndemonstrate it using the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip.\nEmploying this hybrid programmable architecture, we are able to simulate both\nthe regular and long-range coupled forms of diverse compound-lattice models,\nsuch as the Hall ladder, Creutz ladder (symmetric) and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\n(SSH, asymmetric) model, on a single chip, simultaneously reducing the\nexperimental requirements significantly. As results, the direct readout of the\nbandstructure of the SSH model is able to be achieved, to be distinguished from\nall previous works, and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking,\ntopological flat band and Aharonov-Bohm cage effect are also observed with\nlower experimental requirements. Furthermore, applications like\npiecewise-continuous optical frequency shifting can be enabled by cascading our\ndevices. Our results offer promising insights for future large-scale complex\non-chip simulators with arbitrary couplings.",

To further enhance\nhardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with\nper-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free\nmultiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results\nshow that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,\nup to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage\ncompared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model\naccuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time\nperformance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on\ndense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely\navailable in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,\nthe Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization\nfails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,\nresulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel\nSfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs\n3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we\npropose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose\ninformation and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To\naddress the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view\nsettings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates\ncamera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent\ncontent as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we\nintroduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive\nspatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of\ngeometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,\nachieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view\nconditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method\nexhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,\nresulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.",

Despite its importance, current\nmethods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse\ncross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)\nand large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a\nnovel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves\nefficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through\na role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized\nagents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and\nRole-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through\nspecialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal\nalignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the\nLLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,\nsignificantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration\nstrategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to\ndynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.\nDeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing\ncomplexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five\npublic benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, improving ACC by 1%-57%.

    "abstract": "Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical\napplications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To\nunderstand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have\nbeen proposed to analyze $\\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers\nintroduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less\neffective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to\nlocal robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to\nleverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\\epsilon$-balls\nto reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete\nverifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of\n$\\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.\nBaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly\nconstructs mini-batches of $\\epsilon$-balls that have similar network\ncomputations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all\n$\\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\\epsilon$-ball is suspected\nas not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy\nleverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\\epsilon$-ball\nas well as the other $\\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on\nfully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10.

This performance drop limits the safe and equitable\ndeployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present\nDoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch\nnormalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain\ngeneralization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale\nfull-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly\nintroduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a\nsystematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nOur results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain\ndependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the\nsame domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain\nshift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully\nconnected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We\nfurther integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,\nyielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability.

    "abstract": "The co-evolution of structure and dynamics, known as adaptivity, is a\nfundamental property in various systems and drives diverse emergent behaviors.\nHowever, the adaptivity in previous works is primarily stemmed from pairwise\nsituations, while is insufficient to capture ubiquitous higher-order\ncharacteristics of real systems. Here, we introduce higher-order network\nadaptivity to model the co-evolution of higher-order structure and spreading\ndynamics, and theoretically analyze the thresholds and spreading sizes. Results\ndemonstrate that both pairwise-like and higher-order adaptivity consistently\nincrease spreading thresholds, but surprisingly produce completely opposing\nqualitative effects. Specifically, contrary to pairwise-like adaptivity,\nhigher-order adaptivity not only reduces or even eliminates the bistable\nregion, but also leads to shifts of phase transitions from discontinuous to\ncontinuous. These findings are validated on both synthetic and real\nhypergraphs. Our work introduces an idea of higher-order adaptivity and\nhighlights its fundamental differences from pairwise-like adaptivity, advancing\nfurther researches of adaptive higher-order systems.",

The aim of online learning from data streams is to create\nclustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based\non the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can\nresult in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.\nCommonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for\ndetermining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from\nstreaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and\ntheir high computational demands.

The aim of this work was to conduct follow-up\nradio observations to search for any exhibited radio pulsar emission from\nJ0523.5-2529. This work employs a periodicity and single burst search across 74\npercent of the system's orbital phase using a total of 34.5 hours of\nobservations. Observations were carried out using the Murriyang Telescope at\nParkes and the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Despite extensive\norbital phase coverage, no periodic or single-pulse radio emission was detected\nabove a signal-to-noise threshold of 7. A comprehensive search for radio\npulsations from J0523.5-2529 using Parkes and GBT yielded no significant\nemission, likely due to intrinsic faintness, scattering, or eclipses by the\ncompanion's outflow.

This has physical\nimplications for the behavior of the fluctuation induced forces pertinent to\nthe different ensembles. Here, {we study the Nagle-Kardar model within the\ngrand-canonical ensemble (GCE) and the canonical ensemble (CE) (with conserved\ntotal magnetization) for periodic boundary conditions (PBC)}. {We focus on two\nfluctuation-induce forces: the Casimir force (CF) in the GCE and the Helmholtz\nforce (HF) in the CE}. In the infinite system limit the model exhibits a\ncritical line, which ends at a tricritical point. Unexpectedly, the critical\nCasimir force (CCF) is \\textit{repulsive} near the critical line and\ntricritical point, decaying rapidly upon departure from those two regions and\nbecoming \\textit{attractive}. This violates the widely-accepted ``boundary\ncondition rule,'' which presumes that the CCF is attractive for equivalent\nboundary conditions (BC) and repulsive for conflicting BC. For the HF we find\nthat it also changes sign as a function of temperature and the magnetization.\nWe conclude, that CCF and HF have a behavior quite different from each other as\na function of the tunable parameters (temperature, magnetic field, or\nmagnetization) of the model. This dependence allows {for the control of the}\n\\textit{sign} of these forces, as well as their magnitude.",

In this\nstudy, we analyze NASA Deep Space Network logs to explore what strategies for\nselecting SETI targets and scheduling observations would enhance the chances of\ndetecting such networks. Analyzing Deep Space Network uplink transmission logs\nover the last 20 yr, we find that these emissions were predominantly directed\nalong the ecliptic plane, towards or directly away from the Sun, and towards\nother planets. The average duty cycle within the Earth Transit Zone is 20 times\nhigher than that across all ecliptic latitudes.

Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and\nacceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge\nfrom large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient\ninference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this\ntechnique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and\ncomputer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains\nlargely underexplored.\n  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of\nKD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD\nmethods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across\neight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three\ndownstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers\nnotable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared\nwith standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better\neffectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest\nfeature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models\nto retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters.

    "abstract": "The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by\nfragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic\ncomparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language\ndomain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model\nweights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,\nend-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides\nthe community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance\nspeech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task\ninstruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for\nstandardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release\nLLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public\ndata. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,\nreproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals\nthat while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant\ngeneralization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio\nscenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,\nLLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and\naccelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,\npretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.",

    "abstract": "Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search\nand track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent\nyears. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the\ninformation of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the\ndetection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do\nnot consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global\ntemporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant\ncomputation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a\nBidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small\ntarget Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy\nsimultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and\nglobal temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.\nSpecifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design\na Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal\ndependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global\nTemporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the\nglobal propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the\nbidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head\nfor detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the\ntraditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)\nloss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference\nspeed.",

Given a complex inner product space, we\nconstruct the space of its orthonormal bases as a discrete quotient of the\ncomplete flag manifold. We introduce a metric on this space, which corresponds\nto the \"MUBness\" distance. This allows us to describe equivalence between sets\nof mutually unbiased bases in terms of the geometry of this space. The subspace\nof bases that are unbiased with respect to the standard basis decomposes into\norbits under a certain group action, and this decomposition corresponds to the\nclassification of complex Hadamard matrices. More generally, we consider a list\nof $k$ MUBs, that one wishes to extend. The candidates are points in the\nsubspace comprising all bases which are unbiased with respect to the entire\nlist. This space also decomposes into orbits under a group action, and we prove\nthat points in distinct orbits yield inequivalent MUB lists.

We analytically derive the\nfeatures learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can\nbe used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial\ncorrelations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE\nrepresentations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond\nsecond-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE\nhyper-parameters in practice.",

Take-off\nand merging phases are critical for air corridor operations, requiring the\ncoordination of take-off aircraft and corridor traffic while ensuring safety\nand seamless transition. This paper proposes an integrated take-off management\nand trajectory optimization for merging control in UAM corridors. We first\nintroduce a novel take-off airspace design. To our knowledge, this paper is one\nof the first to propose a structured design for take-off airspace. Based on the\ntake-off airspace design, we devise a hierarchical coordinated take-off and\nmerging management (HCTMM) strategy. To be specific, the take-off airspace\ndesign can simplify aircraft dynamics and thus reduce the dimensionality of the\ntrajectory optimization problem whilst mitigating obstacle avoidance\ncomplexities. The HCTMM strategy strictly ensures safety and improves the\nefficiency of take-off and merging operations. At the tactical level, a\nscheduling algorithm coordinates aircraft take-off times and selects dynamic\nmerging points to reduce conflicts and ensure smooth take-off and merging\nprocesses. At the operational level, a trajectory optimization strategy ensures\nthat each aircraft reaches the dynamic merging point efficiently while\nsatisfying safety constraints. Simulation results show that, compared to\nrepresentative strategies with fixed or dynamic merging points, the HCTMM\nstrategy significantly improves operational efficiency and reduces\ncomputational burden, while ensuring safety under various corridor traffic\nconditions. Further results confirm the scalability of the HCTMM strategy and\nthe computational efficiency enabled by the proposed take-off airspace design.",

    "abstract": "Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token\ndistribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most\noccur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source\nof the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the\nlanguage model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and\noptimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,\nformalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce\nthis complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so\nfurther growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A\nword-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce\ncross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most\nfrequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and\noutput embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance\nreverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers\nfrom imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in\ndownstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show\nthat enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same\nfrequent-word benefit. Our results reframe \"bigger vocabularies help\" as\n\"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps,\" providing a simple,\nprincipled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics\nthat govern language-model scaling in pre-training.",

Specifically, The chain of thought (CoT) has been shown to\nimprove the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks for RS. However, due\nto the fact that LLMs often suffer from hallucination issues, there is no\nguarantee that their reasoning CoT is effective. A key challenge is to further\nenhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs through effective CoT\nreasonings. Therefore, we propose \\textbf{TrackRec}, a framework designed to\nenhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs for RS. TrackRec specifically focuses on\naccurately inferring recommendation CoT \\textbf{(RecCoT)} for user preference\nusing the knowledge from LLMs. This RecCoT can serve both as an explanation for\nthe LLM's completion of recommendation tasks and as auxiliary features to\nassist recommendation models in accomplishing recommendation tasks.

Furthermore,\nwe design alternating feedback learning mechanism that $G$ undergoes direct\npreference optimization via feedback from $V$ to produce increasingly accurate\nRecCoT aligned with $V$'s standards. Meanwhile, $V$ is fine-tuned using the\ninference feedback from $G$ to enhance its validation capabilities in alignment\nwith recommendation tasks. Through iterative alternating feedback learning\nbetween $G$ and $V$, TrackRec continuously improves the user preference\nanalysis capability of $G$ and the validation capacity of $V$.

    "abstract": "Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across\nvarious domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains\nunresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced\nRaven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for\nevaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,\nwith a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,\npattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers\non solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract\nreasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a\n``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete\ncausal chain in RPM tasks: image $\\rightarrow$ abstract attributes\n$\\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\\rightarrow$ pattern consistency\n$\\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture\nof the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the\noptimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational\nlower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,\nfails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning\nlogic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound\nsignificantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and\nmutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal\nrelationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this\npaper progressively proposes three improvement methods:",

While significant performance enhancements have been\nmade, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics\nare intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working\nconditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical\ndurability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key\nchallenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a\nscalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the\nmicrostructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks\nstacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded\ntogether by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This\ndeliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural\nstrength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT\nsynthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without\nsacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT\nexhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 40- to\n600-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles\nbefore failure. These gains stem from residual stress fields generated at the\ninterface between silica pockets and BNT bricks, which delay crack initiation.\nFurthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and\nelectromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based\npiezoelectric transducer under bending mode.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for\nenabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods\nhave been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two\nlimitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to\nthe megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or\nextensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene\nchanges after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an\nImage-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially\nenhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes\nafter archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly\nexploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared\ncodebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to\npreviously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.\nThis approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the\nkilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to\npost-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images\ncaptured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes\nare trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized\nrepresentations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We\nevaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.\nExperimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene\nchanges.

In\nhigh-throughput meta-analyses, testing a large number of PC hypotheses with\nk-family-wise error rate (k-FWER) control often suffers from low statistical\npower due to the multiplicity burden. The state-of-the-art AdaFilter-Bon\nprocedure by Wang et al. (2022, Ann.

However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,\nwith limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper\naims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret\nexisting VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool\nand design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and\nLanguage-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different\nnumbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of\nlayers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a\nfine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting\nindicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,\nforming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,\nwhile higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,\ncertain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question\nanswering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute\nminimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling\nrelies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame\nself-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational\ncost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce\nattention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work\nto systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand\nvideo content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future\nresearch.",

KGs\nare often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by\nKnowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.\nDifferent evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank\n(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC\nmodels. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing\ntheir performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform\nothers on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to\ndetermine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,\ndifferent metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where\none model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further\ncomplicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder\nholistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that\nintegrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more\nreliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we\npropose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust\nand interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across\nmultiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized\nscore ($M_i \\in [0,1]$).

A profile is an\n$\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium if no player can gain more than $\\epsilon$ by\nunilaterally deviating from their strategy. In this work, we use\n$\\epsilon$-Nash equilibria to approximate the computation of Nash equilibria.\nSpecifically, we focus on turn-based, multiplayer stochastic games played on\ngraphs, where players are restricted to stationary strategies -- strategies\nthat use randomness but not memory.\n  The problem of deciding the constrained existence of stationary Nash\nequilibria -- where each player's payoff must lie within a given interval -- is\nknown to be $\\exists\\mathbb{R}$-complete in such a setting (Hansen and\nS{\\o}lvsten, 2020). We extend this line of work to stationary $\\epsilon$-Nash\nequilibria and present an algorithm that solves the following promise problem:\ngiven a game with a Nash equilibrium satisfying the constraints, compute an\n$\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium that $\\epsilon$-satisfies those same constraints --\nsatisfies the constraints up to an $\\epsilon$ additive error. Our algorithm\nruns in FNP^NP time.\n  To achieve this, we first show that if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists,\nthen one exists where the non-zero probabilities are at least an inverse of a\ndouble-exponential in the input. We further prove that such a strategy can be\nencoded using floating-point representations, as in the work of Frederiksen and\nMiltersen (2013), which finally gives us our FNP^NP algorithm.\n  We further show that the decision version of the promise problem is NP-hard.\nFinally, we show a partial tightness result by proving a lower bound for such\ntechniques: if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists, then there must be one\nthat where the probabilities in the strategies are double-exponentially small.",

In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute\nContinuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent\nchanges in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of\nground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,\nleading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this\npaper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless\nworkflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.\nDatabelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the\nfunction state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads\nfunction states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,\nthe data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing\nstate access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,\nDatabelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state\nmanagement for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions\nare fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing\nredundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow\nefficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow\nexecution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the\nbaselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion\nreduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage\nrequests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of\nserverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D\nContinuum.",

We show that under special conditions such a system\ncan be equivalently modeled as a two-mechanical-modes optomechanical cavity in\nwhich, besides the standard radiation-pressure coupling, the cavity mode\ninteracts with the mechanical modes through the cross-Kerr (CK), a higher-order\ngeneralized CK, and a three-mode CK type of coupling. Furthermore, there is an\ninduced CK coupling between the two-mechanical modes. Assuming that the cavity\nmode is simultaneously driven by a strong control field and a weak probe field,\nwe analyze the response of the output probe field affected by the\nabove-mentioned nonlinear couplings. In particular, our results reveal that the\nhigher-order nonlinear CK and the three-mode CK couplings have remarkable\nimpact on the characteristics of the OMIT and OMIA phenomena. Moreover, we find\nthat these nonlinear couplings can give rise to the occurrence of the gain in\nthe absorption profile and contribute to the amplification of the output probe\nfield in specific frequency regions.

The\nbenchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured\nmedical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include\na text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with\nLLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character\nrecognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two\ncomplementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level\nrecall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation\nusing a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,\nand reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a\nreward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve\na mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain.

Despite their growing\nrole, few studies have systematically examined the potential biases in\nAI-driven hiring evaluation across cultures. In this study, we conduct a\nsystematic analysis of how LLMs assess job interviews across cultural and\nidentity dimensions. Using two datasets of interview transcripts, 100 from UK\nand 100 from Indian job seekers, we first examine cross-cultural differences in\nLLM-generated scores for hirability and related traits. Indian transcripts\nreceive consistently lower scores than UK transcripts, even when they were\nanonymized, with disparities linked to linguistic features such as sentence\ncomplexity and lexical diversity. We then perform controlled identity\nsubstitutions (varying names by gender, caste, and region) within the Indian\ndataset to test for name-based bias. These substitutions do not yield\nstatistically significant effects, indicating that names alone, when isolated\nfrom other contextual signals, may not influence LLM evaluations. Our findings\nunderscore the importance of evaluating both linguistic and social dimensions\nin LLM-driven evaluations and highlight the need for culturally sensitive\ndesign and accountability in AI-assisted hiring.",

To study the influence of\ndose reduction on clinical dark-field radiographs, one can simulate low-dose\nimages by virtually reducing the irradiated area. However, these simulations\ncan exhibit stripe artifacts. Purpose: Validation of the low-dose simulation\nalgorithm reported by Schick & Bast et al., PLoS ONE, 2024. Furthermore, we\nwant to demonstrate that stripe artifacts observed in simulated images at very\nlow-dose levels are introduced by limitations of the algorithm and would not\nappear in actual low-dose dark-field images. Methods: Dark-field radiographs of\nan anthropomorphic chest phantom were acquired at different tube currents\nequaling different radiation doses. Based on the measurement with a high\nradiation dose, dark-field radiographs corresponding to lower radiation doses\nwere simulated by virtually reducing the irradiated area. The simulated\nlow-dose radiographs were evaluated by a quantitative comparison of the\ndark-field signal using different regions of interests. Results: Dark-field\nradiographs acquired at one quarter of the standard dose were artifact-free.\nThe dark-field signal differed from the simulated radiographs by up to 10%.\nAlgorithm-induced stripe artifacts decrease the image quality of the simulated\nradiographs. Conclusions: Virtually reducing the irradiation area is a simple\napproach to generate low-dose radiographs based on images acquired with\nscanning-based dark-field radiography. However, as the algorithm creates stripe\nartifacts in the dark-field images, particularly at higher dose reductions,\nthat are not present in measured low-dose images, simulated images have reduced\nimage quality compared to their measured counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies\nfrom fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.\nHowever, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult\nand expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its\ntwo common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary\nlimitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly\nto collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,\npreferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior\ncontribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.\nIn this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to\nunify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled\ntrajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert\ndemonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their\nsimilarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference\nlearning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches\nstruggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning\nfrom preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage\nboth feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.",

However, current CTR\nmodels generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by\nthe scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR\npredictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the\nmodel grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this\nmodel into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into\npractice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention\nNetwork). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single\nUAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also\nmeasures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple\nperspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving\nthe way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high\nperformance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long\ninference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel\ninference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to\ntrain the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The\ndistilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the\nLightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results\nshow that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning\nthree orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled\nLightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More\nimportantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online\nservice, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average\ninference time acceptable.

Therefore, the method can, in principle, be applied to\narbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological\ndescriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming\nkinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug\ndesign, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly\nprocesses.",

To address the challenge of\nreconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot\nrepresentations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference\nconfiguration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a\nlocalization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and\nhyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete\nempirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to\nsaddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to\nunfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer\noperator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of\nstability.

More\nprecisely, for initial data close to the traveling wave solution of the\ndeterministic equation, under proper long time scaling, the solution still\nstays close to the family of traveling waves, and the interface location moves\naccording to an approximate diffusion process. There is one interesting\ndifference between our singular regime and the classical situation: even if the\nsolution and its approximate phase separation point are both well defined, the\nintended diffusion describing the movement of the canonical candidate of the\nphase point is not (even for fixed $\\eps$). Two infinite quantities arise from\nthe derivation of such an SDE, one due to singularity of the noise, and the\nother from renormalization.

The strip is assumed infinite in extent, with\nthe crack aligned along its longitudinal axis and parallel to the rotation\naxis. The governing field equations are reduced to an analytically tractable\nform by employing the Fourier transform in the spatial domain and the Laplace\ntransform in the temporal domain. The effect of a sudden application of\ntraction, represented by a Heaviside step function, is analyzed for both normal\nand shear loading conditions. The resulting boundary-value problem is addressed\nthrough the Wiener Hopf method, yielding analytical representations of the\nstress intensity factors (SIFs).

Laplace inversion is performed using the generalized Chebyshev\nLaguerre polynomial method. Numerical simulations are conducted for Uranium and\nGraphite--Epoxy, with isotropic materials considered for comparison to assess\nthe role of anisotropy. The temporal evolution of the SIFs is investigated for\nvarying material gradation parameters, rotation rates, magnetoelastic coupling,\nand initial stresses.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale\nrecommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient\ninformation interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially\naddress this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture\nuser intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into\ngenerative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance.\nHowever, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic\nrepresentations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning\npathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these\nissues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that\nconstructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a\nself-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations.\nSpecifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook\n(MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby\nconstructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance\nthe reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement\nstage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a\nMulti-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions\ntailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA\nintroduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During\ninference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed\nto discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of\nerroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy\nfor large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online\nevaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial\npractical value.",

To\naddress such issues, we propose MLLMRec, a novel MLLM-driven multimodal\nrecommendation framework with two item-item graph refinement strategies. On the\none hand, the item images are first converted into high-quality semantic\ndescriptions using an MLLM, which are then fused with the textual metadata of\nitems.

Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope\n(FAST), the world's most sensitive instrument operating in the\ndecimeter-wavelength range, we conducted a search for rotational transitions of\nlarge, quasi-symmetric PAHs.

    "abstract": "Two-sided matching, such as matching between students and schools, has been\napplied to various aspects of real life and has been the subject of much\nresearch, however, it has been plagued by the fact that efficiency and fairness\nare incompatible. In particular, Pareto efficiency and justified-envy-freeness\nare known to be incompatible even in the simplest one-to-one matching, i.e.,\nthe stable marriage problem. In previous research, the primary approach to\nimproving efficiency in matchings has been to tolerate students' envy, thereby\nrelaxing fairness constraints. In this study, we take a different approach to\nrelaxing fairness. Specifically, it focuses on addressing only the envy that\nstudents may experience or prioritize more highly and seeks matchings without\nsuch envy. More specifically, this study assumes that envy towards students who\nare not acquaintances has less impact compared to envy towards students who are\nacquaintances. Accordingly, we assume that the students know each other or not,\nrepresented by an undirected graph, and define a local envy as a justified envy\ntoward an acquaintance or a neighbor in the graph. We then propose the property\nthat there is no local envy as a new relaxed concept of fairness, called local\nenvy-freeness. We analyze whether Pareto-efficient matching can be achieved\nwhile maintaining local envy-freeness by meaningfully restricting the graph\nstructure and the school's preferences. To analyze in detail the fairness that\ncan achieve Pareto-efficient matching, we introduce a local version of the\nrelaxed fairness recently proposed by Cho et al. (AAMAS 2024), which\nparameterizes the level of local envy-freeness by nonnegative integers. We then\nclarify the level of local envy-freeness that can be achieved by\nPareto-efficient mechanisms for graphs that are ``close'' to trees and\nsingle-peaked preferences on the graphs.",

In this work, we introduce Few-Shot\nAdversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages\nthe in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\ngenerate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that\nrely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,\nFSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,\nrequiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning\nthe LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP\nsynthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly\nembed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic\ncontent. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful\nexamples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which\nenables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across\nunrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health\nMisinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that\nFSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate\ndocuments. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial\noutputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a\nrealistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also\neffectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.",

Second, behavior-aware\nfine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation\nobjectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal\nreconstruction loss.

    "abstract": "The preparation of long-range entangled (LRE) states via quantum measurements\nis a promising strategy, yet its stability against realistic, non-commuting\nmeasurement noise remains a critical open question. Here, we systematically\ninvestigate the rich phase structure emerging from a minimal model of\ncompeting, non-commuting weak measurements: nearest-neighbor Ising ($Z_iZ_j$)\nand single-qubit transverse ($X_i$) operators. We analyze three experimentally\nrelevant scenarios based on which measurement outcomes are read out: complete\nreadout, no readout, and partial readout. Using a replica mean-field theory for\nhigher dimensions, complemented by numerical simulations in one dimension, we\nderive the complete finite-time and stationary phase diagrams. Our analysis\nreveals a striking dependence on the readout protocol. Complete readout yields\na direct transition between a short-range entangled (SRE) phase and a pure LRE\nphase. No readout (pure decoherence) precludes entanglement but exhibits a\nstrong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) transition into a\nclassically ordered mixed state. Most intriguingly, partial readout\ninterpolates between these limits, featuring a mixed-state phase transition\nwhere the system can become trapped in the SWSSB phase or, for weaker\nnon-commutativity, undergo successive symmetry breaking to reach a mixed LRE\nphase. A novel technical contribution is the use of a channel-fidelity-based\npartition function that allows us to simultaneously characterize both\nentanglement and SWSSB order, revealing a deep interplay between them in the\nreplica limit. These results provide a cohesive picture for understanding\nmeasurement phase transitions, SWSSB, and mixed-state phase transitions,\noffering crucial insights for designing robust state preparation protocols on\nnoisy quantum devices.",

These\nimages encode the wavelength-dependent galaxy profile along the slit. We\nconstruct a smooth prior for the 2D galaxy profile with a Gaussian process (GP)\nbased on these reference images, and use another GP to model the correlated\ndeviations from the prior in the observed spectrum.

Most existing methods adopt a\nfirst-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are\nsupervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the\ndetection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology\nreasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision.

This allows redundant lane\npredictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many\nassignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with\nindependent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.\nExtensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is\nmodel-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology\nreasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic\ntopology performance.",

This regime exhibits complex and distinctive plasma\ndynamics due to the interplay between RF fields and the externally applied\nmagnetic field. Two prominent phenomena are observed in this regime. First, the\nplasma density profile becomes asymmetric across the discharge, deviating from\nthe typical symmetric distribution seen in unmagnetized CCPs. Second, electron\nBernstein waves (EBWs), high-frequency electrostatic waves, are excited and\npropagate within the bulk plasma, particularly along steep electron density\ngradients. As the strength of the magnetic field increases within this regime,\nthe CCP discharge undergoes a transition from a symmetric configuration to an\nasymmetric one, and then returns to a symmetric profile at higher field\nstrengths. Notably, the excitation and propagation of EBWs are strongly\ncorrelated with the presence of discharge asymmetry and localized density\ngradients. These waves play a significant role in energy transport and electron\nheating under mildly magnetized conditions. To gain deeper insight into the\nunderlying physics, detailed numerical simulations are carried out using the\nparticle-in-cell Monte Carlo collision (PIC-MCC) technique.

Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to\nconduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to\napply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of\nGA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand,\nexisting studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when\nsimultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal\nrecommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above\nchallenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework\ntailored to session-based recommendation. CAU handles the unlearning task with\na GA term on unlearning samples. Specifically, to address the first challenge,\nCAU formulates the overall optimization task as a multi-objective optimization\nproblem, where the GA term for unlearning samples is combined with retaining\nterms for preserving performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is\nsolved through seeking the Pareto-Optimal solution, which achieves effective\nunlearning with trivial sacrifice on recommendation performance. To tackle the\nsecond challenge, CAU adopts a curriculum-based sequence to conduct unlearning\non batches of unlearning samples. The key motivation is to perform unlearning\nfrom easy samples to harder ones. To this end, CAU first introduces two metrics\nto measure the unlearning difficulty, including gradient unlearning difficulty\nand embedding unlearning difficulty. Then, two strategies, hard-sampling and\nsoft-sampling, are proposed to select unlearning samples according to\ndifficulty scores.",

A vast majority of pioneer\nstudies, if not all, address this fundamental problem using the prevailing\nalternating optimization (AO) framework, where the digital beamforming (DB) and\nSIM phase shifts are optimized alternately. However, many of these approaches\nsuffer from suboptimal performance, quickly leading to performance saturation,\nwhen the number of SIM layers increases assuming the \\emph{fixed SIM\nthickness}. In this letter, we demonstrate that significant performance gains\ncan still be achieved, and such saturation does not occur with the proposed\nmethod in the considered setting. To this end, we provide practical design\nguidelines to improve AO-based optimization of digital precoders and SIM phase\nshifts. Specifically, we show that (i) optimizing the SIM phase shifts first\nyields significant performance improvements, compared to optimizing the DB\nfirst; and (ii) when applying projected gradient (PG) methods, which are\ngradually becoming more popular to optimize the phase shifts thanks to their\nscalability, we find that using an iterative PG method achieves better\nperformance than the single PG step, which is commonly used in existing\nsolutions.

Ano-NAViLa is\nbuilt on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.\nBy incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa\nenhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and\nprovides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two\nlymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization,\noutperforming competing models.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly\nvulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user\nprofiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate\nrecommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers\ntypically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft\nprofiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack\nimpact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such\nhigh-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works\nsuggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the\npoor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and\nimperceptibility under the practical setting.\n  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the\nquality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities\nof multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration\nretrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie\nICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to\ngenerate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the\nrobustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and\ncollaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve\nthe attack transferability and imperceptibility.

In the\npractice of prescriptive price optimization, the price of each item is\ntypically set within a predetermined range defined by lower and upper bounds.\nNarrow price ranges can lead to missed opportunities, while wide price ranges\nrun the risk of proposing unrealistic prices; therefore, determining profitable\nprice bounds while maintaining the reliability of the suggested prices is a\ncritical challenge that directly affects the effectiveness of prescriptive\nprice optimization. We propose two methods for estimating price bounds in\nprescriptive price optimization so that future total revenue derived from the\noptimized prices will be maximized. Our first method for price bounds\nestimation uses the bootstrap procedure to estimate confidence intervals for\noptimal prices. Our second method uses the Nelder--Mead simplex method for\nblack-box price bounds optimization that maximizes total revenue estimated\nthrough $K$-fold cross-validation. Experimental results with synthetic\nprice--demand datasets demonstrate that our methods successfully narrowed down\nthe price range while maintaining high revenues, particularly when the number\nof items was small or the demand noise level was low.

Recently, research has focused on the\ntemporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all\npossible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art\nalgorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals\nby exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time\nintervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the\ncombinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this\npaper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel\nalgorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each\nvertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of\nredundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the\nquery interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both\nthe number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the\ninterval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.\nExperimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up\nto four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art\nOTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core\nanalysis.",

In this\npaper, we propose a method of color evolution of kilonova emission to identify\nits progenitors. We assume that the energy of the kilonova is contributed from\nradioactive decay, magnetar spin-down, and pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The color\nevolution of kilonova emission associated with short GRB is significant when\nthe spectrum is thermal emission, while it tends towards a constant when the\nspectrum is non-thermal radiation. On the other hand, if the central engine is\na black hole (BH) which is promptly generated by the NS-NS merger or NS-BH\nmerger, then the kilonova is powered only by the radioactive decay. There is no\ncolor evolution at the beginning before the peak of kilonova emission, but is\nsignificantly and rapidly increasing after the peak. On the contrary, if the\ncentral engine is a magnetar or stable NS, the kilonova emission is contributed\nfrom radioactive decay, magnetar, and PWN. The color evolution after the peak\nof kilonova emission is complex behavior which depends on the rotational energy\nand spin-down time-scale of magnetar, and finally tend to a constant in the\nlate state.",

In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce\nskipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate\ndenoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the\ntraditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,\nwe demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the\nsame training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that\naccelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an\nintrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an\nenhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique\nwith DDIM.

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease\ndiagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by\nlimited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has\nemerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from\nunlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise\naugmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG\nrecordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning\nframework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to\nconstruct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired\nby the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages\nthe model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features\nthat persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate\nthat poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional\ntwo-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher\nAUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to\nfour times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock\npre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we\nachieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total\ncomputation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.\nThrough extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate\nrobustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window\ncontrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated\nECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised\nrepresentation learning in biomedical time-series data.",

    "abstract": "COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious\ncommunicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A\npandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was\nnot prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people\nworldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the\nrespiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive\nresearch, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being\nlost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying\ngasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as\nthere was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and\nventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of\nthis project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the\npatient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less\nprone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to\ngive better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a\nConvolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our\nmodel will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the\npositive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or\nunfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT\nscans in the dataset.",

Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential\nfor developing trustworthy interpretations.

Methods that do\nprovide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability\nlimitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space.

Specifically, we consider the problem of\nsynthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality\nguarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach\nbegins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as\nMulti-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of\nPareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then\nverify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,\nwhich we solve using a SAT solver.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in\ndomain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces\nexternal knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy\nretrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly\nand lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the\nlong-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful\ninternal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition\nshould be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,\nthen applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know\n(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an\ninternal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised\nfine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline\nand integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,\nand financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing\nmethods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.",

    "abstract": "Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly\nconstrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with\nsequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing\napproaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal\naxis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and\ncomputational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained\nimportance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),\nthereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model\naccuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically\nacross both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero\ninformation for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this\noversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies\nunstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically\nrestoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our\napproach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,\nmaking it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.\nBy reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer\nsequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK\nnot only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage\nby over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an\naggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less\ndegradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its\nrobustness and effectiveness.

While risk mitigation\nmeasures can reduce known threats, not all hazards can be neutralized; truly\nadaptive resilience hinges on whether organizations rapidly detect emerging\nfailures, reconcile diverse data sources, and direct interventions where they\nmatter most. We present a technology-process-people roadmap, demonstrating how\nreal-time hazard nowcasting, interoperable workflows, and empowered teams\ncollectively transform raw data into actionable insight.

Equally crucial, structured sense-making routines and\ncognitive load safeguards help humans remain effective decision-makers amid\ndata abundance.

In contrast, we\nanalyse here experimentally the impact on the self-propulsion of\ncamphor-infused agarose disks (active) of their interactions with floating\nhollow glass microspheres (passive) within an annular channel. Two distinct\nregimes are observed: a steady regime with uni-directional motion of the\nswimmer at low packing fractions (\\phi_{\\textrm{ini}} \\lesssim 0.45) and an\noscillatory regime with to-and-fro motion at higher packing fractions\n(\\phi_{\\textrm{ini}} \\gtrsim 0.45).

    "abstract": "This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system\nwith integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one\nedge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects\nand use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for\nrecognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is\nemployed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this\nsetup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in\nterms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the\nwireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp\ndistortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically\nshows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network\nresources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we\ndesign the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function\ndegradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The\nchallenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and\ncomputation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a\nlow-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control\nand the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less\nsensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained\nand vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed\nof one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.\nNumerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the\ntheoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well\ncoordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,\ncommunication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.",

    "abstract": "The conventional approach in differential privacy (DP) literature formulates\nthe privacy-utility trade-off with a \"privacy-first\" perspective: for a\npredetermined level of privacy, a certain utility is achievable. However,\npractitioners often operate under a \"utility-first\" paradigm, prioritizing a\ndesired level of utility and then determining the corresponding privacy cost.\n  Wu et al. [2019] initiated a formal study of this \"utility-first\" perspective\nby introducing ex-post DP. They demonstrated that by adding correlated Laplace\nnoise and progressively reducing it on demand, a sequence of increasingly\naccurate estimates of a private parameter can be generated, with the privacy\ncost attributed only to the least noisy iterate released. This led to a Laplace\nmechanism variant that achieves a specified utility with minimal privacy loss.\nHowever, their work, and similar findings by Whitehouse et al. [2022], are\nprimarily limited to simple mechanisms based on Laplace or Gaussian noise.\n  In this paper, we significantly generalize these results. In particular, we\nextend the work of Wu et al. [2019] and Liu and Talwar [2019] to support any\nsequence of private estimators, incurring at most a doubling of the original\nprivacy budget. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hyperparameter tuning for\nthese estimators, including the selection of an optimal privacy budget, can be\nperformed without additional privacy cost.

In this\npaper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that\nunlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and\ngeneral capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic\nunsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external\nclassifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content\ntracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful\nknowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without\ndegrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible\nforgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for\nharmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,\nLLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM\nsubstantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high\ngeneral-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as\nsupervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers\nstronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and\ngreater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general\nperformance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight\nunlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.",

It is\nalso important that the gridshell is in equilibrium mainly with axial forces\nagainst the design loads; i.e., bending deformation should be avoided. In this\nstudy, we first find a continuous shell surface where the principal curvature\nlines coincide with the principal directions of membrane forces. For this\npurpose, we utilize the L-isothermic surface, which is a kind of membrane\nO-surface. Specifically, the generalized Dupin cyclide is used as the reference\nsurface, which has an explicit form of membrane forces with a single arbitrary\nparameter against normal loads. Various force distributions are obtained as the\nparameter is adjusted without changing the surface shape. Next, the shell is\ndiscretized into a gridshell, and target axial forces are obtained from the\nsection length of the covering region of each node. The axial forces are\nadjusted by optimizing the cross-sectional radii of the beams with pipe\nsections to realize the specified target force distribution. Since the Laguerre\ntransformation preserves geometric and static properties of the L-isothermic\nsurface, the force can be adjusted by a simple process without re-optimization\nto obtain an approximate optimal solution of the gridshell after\ntransformation. The ratio of out-of-plane shear force to the normal load at the\nnode is also evaluated to investigate the effect of deformation on the force\ndistribution.",

Most existing research\nefforts are directed towards the exploration of traditional differential\nprivacy, also referred to as centralized differential privacy (CDP). It is\nimportant to note that CDP is tailored to protect the privacy of statistical\ndata at fusion center such as averages and sums rather than individual data at\nsensors, which renders it inappropriate for MSFE. Additionally, the definitions\nand assumptions of CDP are primarily applicable for large-scale systems that\nrequire statistical results mentioned above. Therefore, to address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces a more recent advancement known as\n\\emph{local differential privacy (LDP)} to enhance the privacy of MSFE. We\nprovide some rigorous definitions about LDP based on the intrinsic properties\nof MSFE rather than directly presenting the assumptions under CDP.\nSubsequently, the LDP is proved to be realized with system intrinsic\nrandomness, which is useful and has never been considered before. Furthermore,\nthe Gaussian mechanism is designed when the intrinsic randomness is\ninsufficient. The lower bound of the covariance for extra injected Gaussian\nnoises is determined by integrating system information with privacy budgets.\nMoreover, the optimal fusion estimators under intrinsic and extra disturbances\nare respectively designed in the linear minimum variance sense.

When the localized heating\nis located in the upper chromosphere, the cold in-situ plasmas are heated to\ncoronal temperatures, then evaporated to the corona, and finally condensate to\nform a prominence.

When the localized heating is located in the lower chromosphere, the\nenhanced in-situ pressure would push the cold plasmas in the upper chromosphere\nto the corona directly, which is manifested as the direct injection model.\nWhile the idea was confirmed by the one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations,\nthe heating was imposed ad hoc. In order to simulate the localized heating more\nself-consistently, we perform two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations\nin this paper, where the localized heating is naturally realized by magnetic\nreconnection at different heights.

This\nseems to be the reason why the best previous key-recovery attack is on 6-round\n\\textsc{Ascon}, while for Keccak keyed modes (Keccak-MAC and Keyak) the\nattacked round is no less than 7-round.\n  In this paper, we generalize the conditional cube attack proposed by Huang\n\\emph{et~al.}, and find new cubes depending on some key bit conditions for\n5/6-round reduced \\textsc{Ascon}, and translate the previous theoretic 6-round\nattack with $2^{66}$ time complexity to a practical one with $2^{40}$ time\ncomplexity. Moreover, we propose the first 7-round key-recovery attack on\n\\textsc{Ascon}. By introducing \\emph{the cube-like key-subset technique}, we\ndivide the full key space into many subsets according to different key\nconditions. For each key subset, we launch the cube tester to determine if the\nkey falls into it. Finally, we recover the full key space by testing all the\nkey subsets. The total time complexity is about $2^{103.9}$. In addition, for a\nweak-key subset, whose size is $2^{117}$, the attack is more efficient and\ncosts only $2^{77}$ time complexity. Those attacks do not threaten the full\nround (12 rounds) \\textsc{Ascon}.",

To address this, this paper proposes MeSS\n(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent\noutdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While\nimage and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth\nmaps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective\nviews, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion\nmodels excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but\noften struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with\nrendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to\nguarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned\nresults when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach\nenhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The\npipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically\nconsistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we\npropagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and\nthird, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)\nusing the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh\nsurface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment\nand generation quality.

    "abstract": "As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor\nspecifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.\nUnlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program\nstate, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important\nresult of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer\ninference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for\nergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes\nprogram behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably\ndivergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics\nwith inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without\nintroducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,\nuntyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based\nimperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference\nrules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is\nequivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This\nsimple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which\nsacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global\nstate, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring\nhigh-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep\nlearning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct\nHR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown\npromising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that\nare often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for\npaired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover\nfine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,\nwe propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D\nX-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the\nabundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D\nX-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It\nselects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR\nprojections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These\nprojections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT\nvolume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows\nnegative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual\nlearning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing\nhigh-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that\nour method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.",

Existing research offers\ncontradictory claims: some suggest that cousin marriage improves women's\nposition within the household, while others argue it limits their freedoms and\neconomic opportunities. Using data from 15,068 married women in the Pakistan\nDemographic and Health Survey 2017-18, this study provides new quantitative\nevidence. Results indicate a modest negative association between cousin\nmarriage and women's participation in paid work, alongside a stronger link to\nhome-based and unpaid labor. Women in cousin marriages do not appear to gain\nhousehold status relative to those in non-cousin marriages and are more likely\nto justify spousal violence, reflecting entrenched patriarchal norms. These\nfindings suggest that cousin marriage may reinforce traditional gender roles\nand constrain women's economic and social autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and\ntransmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral\ncharacteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In\nparticular the logistic map $f_\\lambda =\\lambda x\\left( 1-x\\right) $ has been\nemployed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For\n$\\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are\nconsidered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This\nassumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order\nstatistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$\nare derived. It is shown that for $\\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is\nuncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR)\ndigital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is\nshown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR\nDAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme\nis derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The\nanalytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.",

Abell 665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock\n($M \\sim 3$) and provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization\ntimescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale.\nUnderstanding this timescale is crucial for determining how energy from the\nmerger is distributed between thermal and non-thermal particle populations.\nUsing $\\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature\ndistribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an\ninstant, collisionless model where ions and electrons are immediately heated at\nthe shock front, and (2) a collisional model where electrons are initially\nadiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the\nions over $\\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed equilibration\nmodel, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium\nwith the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0\n\\pm 3.4) \\times 10^8$ yrs. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate\nthat the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($M = 2.8 \\pm\n0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past\nstudies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing\nhow thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with\nimplications for galaxy cluster evolution, large scale structure formation, and\ncosmology.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad\napplications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning\nperformance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning\napproaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability\nof LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their\neffectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,\nvanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and\nincorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model\ncollapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,\nexisting SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially\nleading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of\npotential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated\nCoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \\TheName{}, to enhance the\nreasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.\nSpecifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this\nrepresentation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning\nprocess. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but\nalso stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional\nunsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth\nanalysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two\ndatasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \\TheName{} in terms of\nrobustness, performance (up to 10.15\\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\\%).
