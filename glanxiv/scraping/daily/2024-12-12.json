    "abstract": "The currently leading artificial neural network models of the visual ventral\nstream - which are derived from a combination of performance optimization and\nrobustification methods - have demonstrated a remarkable degree of behavioral\nalignment with humans on visual categorization tasks. We show that image\nperturbations generated by these models can enhance the ability of humans to\naccurately report the ground truth class. Furthermore, we find that the same\nmodels can also be used out-of-the-box to predict the proportion of correct\nhuman responses to individual images, providing a simple, human-aligned\nestimator of the relative difficulty of each image. Motivated by these\nobservations, we propose to augment visual learning in humans in a way that\nimproves human categorization accuracy at test time. Our learning augmentation\napproach consists of (i) selecting images based on their model-estimated\nrecognition difficulty, and (ii) applying image perturbations that aid\nrecognition for novice learners. We find that combining these model-based\nstrategies leads to categorization accuracy gains of 33-72% relative to control\nsubjects without these interventions, on unmodified, randomly selected held-out\ntest images. Beyond the accuracy gain, the training time for the augmented\nlearning group was also shortened by 20-23%, despite both groups completing the\nsame number of training trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in\na fine-grained categorization task with natural images, as well as two tasks in\nclinically relevant image domains - histology and dermoscopy - where visual\nlearning is notoriously challenging. To the best of our knowledge, our work is\nthe first application of artificial neural networks to increase visual learning\nperformance in humans by enhancing category-specific image features.",

    "abstract": "The focus of education is increasingly set on learners' ability to regulate\ntheir own learning within technology-enhanced learning environments (TELs).\nPrior research has shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) leads to better\nlearning performance. However, many learners struggle to self-regulate their\nlearning productively, as they typically need to navigate a myriad of\ncognitive, metacognitive, and motivational processes that SRL demands. To\naddress these challenges, the FLoRA engine is developed to assist students,\nworkers, and professionals in improving their SRL skills and becoming\nproductive lifelong learners. FLoRA incorporates several learning tools that\nare grounded in SRL theory and enhanced with learning analytics (LA), aimed at\nimproving learners' mastery of different SRL skills. The engine tracks\nlearners' SRL behaviours during a learning task and provides automated\nscaffolding to help learners effectively regulate their learning. The main\ncontributions of FLoRA include (1) creating instrumentation tools that\nunobtrusively collect intensively sampled, fine-grained, and temporally ordered\ntrace data about learners' learning actions, (2) building a trace parser that\nuses LA and related analytical technique (e.g., process mining) to model and\nunderstand learners' SRL processes, and (3) providing a scaffolding module that\npresents analytics-based adaptive, personalised scaffolds based on students'\nlearning progress.

A CPP device is utilized to generate either a\ncorona discharge (Pz-CD) or a dielectric barrier discharge (Pz-DBD) for in\nvitro experiments. Notably, Pz-CD can deliver more power than Pz-DBD, although\nboth sources produce significant levels of reactive species in plasma and\nliquid phases. This work shows that CPP causes a gradient increase in medium\ntemperature from the center towards the edges of the culture well, especially\nfor longer treatment times. Although Pz-CD heats more significantly, it cools\nquickly after plasma extinction. When applied to human CCA cells, CPP shows\nimmediate and long-term effects, more localized for Pz-CD, while more uniform\nfor Pz-DBD. Immediate effects result also in actin cytoskeleton remodeling\nwithout alteration of the cell membrane permeability. Long-term effects of CPP,\nalthough the antioxidant system is engaged, include activation of the DNA\ndamage response pathway leading to cell death.

Pre-germinative\ntreatment consists of priming the seeds with a dry atmospheric plasma (DAP)\ngenerated by a dielectric barrier device (DBD), characterized by minimal\nradiative emission, low electrical power (4 W) and high emissions of O, OH and\nNO radicals. Post-germinative treatment, known as plasma-activated water (PAW),\nuses a single-pin electrode device (SPED) to generate a DC discharge that\nfeatures a power of 126 W and produces large amounts of OH radicals. The\nresulting PAW, after 5 minutes of SPED treatment, induces a slight\nacidification and increased concentrations of nitrate ions (from 24 to 250\nmg/L), nitrite ions (from less than 0.1 to 56.1 mg/L) and hydrogen peroxide\n(from 0.3 to 18.5 mg/L). Results indicate that DAP applied on maize seeds for\n20 min boosts their germination rate up to 90% (versus only 65% for untreated\nseeds) while reducing the median germination time by 37.5%. Then, seedling\ngrowth monitoring is achieved on control, DAP, PAW and DAP+PAW groups to assess\nstem length, hypocotyl length, leaf count, collar diameter and fresh/dry mass.\nThe DAP+PAW group shows the most robust growth, demonstrating a synergistic\neffect of the combined treatments, particularly with significantly longer stem\nlengths. Additionally, physiological analyses of seedling leaves indicate a\ndecrease in chlorophyll content despite enhanced growth, while fluorescence\nmicroscopy reveals a reduction in stomatal density in leaves treated with DAP\nand PAW, especially in the combined treatment group, potentially impacting\nphotosynthetic efficiency and water regulation.",

We also present carefully validated evaluation measures and\npropose an effective model architecture that can tackle our benchmark. Project\npage: https://ali2500.github.io/vicas-project/",

    "abstract": "We explore the problem of sampling graph signals in scenarios where the graph\nstructure is not predefined and must be inferred from data. In this scenario,\nexisting approaches rely on a two-step process, where a graph is learned first,\nfollowed by sampling. More generally, graph learning and graph signal sampling\nhave been studied as two independent problems in the literature. This work\nprovides a foundational step towards jointly optimizing the graph structure and\nsampling set. Our main contribution, Vertex Importance Sampling (VIS), is to\nshow that the sampling set can be effectively determined from the vertex\nimportance (node weights) obtained from graph learning. We further propose\nVertex Importance Sampling with Repulsion (VISR), a greedy algorithm where\nspatially -separated \"important\" nodes are selected to ensure better\nreconstruction. Empirical results on simulated data show that sampling using\nVIS and VISR leads to competitive reconstruction performance and lower\ncomplexity than the conventional two-step approach of graph learning followed\nby graph sampling.",

For example, it exhibits the non-Hermitian skin\neffect -- its eigenmodes are exponentially localized to the edges of the chain\n-- even when the system is Hermitian. Such non-Hermitian effects originate from\nthe fact that the dynamics of bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians is governed by a\nnon-Hermitian matrix. In the topological phase of the model, the modes conspire\nto lead to phase-dependent and directional exponential amplification of a\nclassical drive. In this work, we study the robustness of this topological\namplification to on-site dissipations. We examine the effect of uniform and\nnon-uniform losses under various configurations. We find a remarkable\nresilience to dissipation in some configurations, while in others the\ndissipation causes a topological phase transition which eliminates the\nexponential amplification. In particular, when the dissipation is placed on\nevery other site, the system remains topological and the exponential\namplification persists even for very large loss rates which exceed the system's\nnon-Hermitian gap. On the other hand, we find that dividing the chain into unit\ncells of an odd number of sites and placing dissipation on the first site leads\nto a topological phase transition at a certain critical value of the\ndissipation. Our work thus provides insights into the robustness against losses\nof the topological amplification of non-Hermitian systems and sets explicit\nlimits on the bosonic Kitaev chain's ability to act as a multimode quantum\nsensor in realistic lossy scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural domains are being transformed by recent advances in AI and\ncomputer vision that support quantitative visual evaluation. Using aerial and\nground imaging over a time series, we develop a framework for characterizing\nthe ripening process of cranberry crops, a crucial component for precision\nagriculture tasks such as comparing crop breeds (high-throughput phenotyping)\nand detecting disease. Using drone imaging, we capture images from 20 waypoints\nacross multiple bogs, and using ground-based imaging (hand-held camera), we\nimage same bog patch using fixed fiducial markers. Both imaging methods are\nrepeated to gather a multi-week time series spanning the entire growing season.\nAerial imaging provides multiple samples to compute a distribution of albedo\nvalues. Ground imaging enables tracking of individual berries for a detailed\nview of berry appearance changes. Using vision transformers (ViT) for feature\ndetection after segmentation, we extract a high dimensional feature descriptor\nof berry appearance. Interpretability of appearance is critical for plant\nbiologists and cranberry growers to support crop breeding decisions (e.g.\\\ncomparison of berry varieties from breeding programs). For interpretability, we\ncreate a 2D manifold of cranberry appearance by using a UMAP dimensionality\nreduction on ViT features. This projection enables quantification of ripening\npaths and a useful metric of ripening rate. We demonstrate the comparison of\nfour cranberry varieties based on our ripening assessments. This work is the\nfirst of its kind and has future impact for cranberries and for other crops\nincluding wine grapes, olives, blueberries, and maize. Aerial and ground\ndatasets are made publicly available.",

This compound is also known for\nexhibiting bulk superconductivity below 1.4 K at ambient pressure. In this\nwork, we report on the effects of Rh substitution in\nSr(Ni$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ on the structural and superconducting properties.\nWe studied the variation of the nearest P-P distances as a function of the Rh\nfraction at room temperature, as well as its temperature dependence for\nselected compositions. We find that increasing the Rh fraction leads to a\ndecrease in the transition temperature between the ucT and tcO states, until a\nfull suppression of the tcO state for $x\\geq 0.166$. The superconducting\ntransition first remains nearly insensitive to the Rh fraction, and then it\nincreases to 2.3 K after the tcO state is fully suppressed. These results are\nsummarized in a phase diagram, built upon the characterization by energy\ndispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, resistance, magnetization and\nspecific heat measurements done on crystalline samples with varying Rh content.\nThe relationship between band structure, crystal structure and\nsuperconductivity is discussed based on previously reported band structure\ncalculations on SrRh$_2$P$_2$. Moreover, the effect of Rh fraction on the\nstress-induced structural transitions is also addressed by means of\nstrain-stress studies done by uniaxial compression of single-crystalline\nmicropillars of Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_2$P$_2$.",

In this work, we study the effects\nof strain on higher winding number Weyl semimetals and show that strain is not\na pseudo-gauge field for any winding number larger than one. We focus on the\ndouble-Weyl semimetal as an illustrative example to show that the application\nof strain splits the higher winding number Weyl nodes and produces an\nanisotropic Fermi surface. Specifically, the Fermi surface of the double-Weyl\nsemimetal acquires nematic order. By extending chiral kinetic theory for such\nnematic fields, we determine the effective gauge fields acting on the system\nand show how strain induces anisotropy and affects the geometry of the\nsemi-classical phase space of the double-Weyl semimetal. Further, the\nstrain-induced deformation of the Weyl nodes results in transport signatures\nrelated to the covariant coupling of the strain tensor to the geometric tensor\nassociated with the Weyl nodes giving rise to strain-dependent dissipative\ncorrections to the longitudinal as well as the Hall conductance. Thus, by\nextension, we show that in multi-Weyl semimetals, strain produces geometric\nsignatures rather than topological signatures.

The learned score\nfunction enables their generalization capabilities, but how the learned score\nrelates to the score of the underlying data manifold remains largely unclear.\nHere, we aim to elucidate this relationship by comparing learned neural scores\nto the scores of two kinds of analytically tractable distributions: Gaussians\nand Gaussian mixtures. The simplicity of the Gaussian model makes it\ntheoretically attractive, and we show that it admits a closed-form solution and\npredicts many qualitative aspects of sample generation dynamics. We claim that\nthe learned neural score is dominated by its linear (Gaussian) approximation\nfor moderate to high noise scales, and supply both theoretical and empirical\narguments to support this claim. Moreover, the Gaussian approximation\nempirically works for a larger range of noise scales than naive theory suggests\nit should, and is preferentially learned early in training. At smaller noise\nscales, we observe that learned scores are better described by a coarse-grained\n(Gaussian mixture) approximation of training data than by the score of the\ntraining distribution, a finding consistent with generalization. Our findings\nenable us to precisely predict the initial phase of trained models' sampling\ntrajectories through their Gaussian approximations. We show that this allows\nthe skipping of the first 15-30% of sampling steps while maintaining high\nsample quality (with a near state-of-the-art FID score of 1.93 on CIFAR-10\nunconditional generation).

A plethora of papers and\nbenchmarks have been introduced to evaluate if current models have been able to\ndevelop this key ability of social intelligence. However, all rely on limited\ndatasets with simple patterns that can potentially lead to problematic blind\nspots in evaluation and an overestimation of model capabilities.

Our\napproach leverages an A* search over a custom domain-specific language to\nproduce complex story structures and novel, diverse, yet plausible scenarios to\nstress test the limits of LLMs. Our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art\nLLMs, such as Llama-3.1-70B and GPT-4o, show accuracies as low as 0% and 9% on\nExploreToM-generated data, highlighting the need for more robust theory of mind\nevaluation. As our generations are a conceptual superset of prior work,\nfine-tuning on our data yields a 27-point accuracy improvement on the classic\nToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019).

Transfer\nefficiency was examined for isolated laser pulses as well as for series of\noverlapping pulses and single layer transfer was confirmed.

For global alignment, parallelized Inter-Agent Gaussian\nConsensus, which asynchronously aligns and optimizes local maps by regularizing\nmulti-agent Gaussian splats, seamlessly integrates them into a high-fidelity 3D\nmodel.

Many existing approaches to\nautomating prompt engineering rely exclusively on textual feedback, refining\nprompts based solely on inference errors identified by large, computationally\nexpensive LLMs. Unfortunately, smaller models struggle to generate high-quality\nfeedback, resulting in complete dependence on large LLM judgment. Moreover,\nthese methods fail to leverage more direct and finer-grained information, such\nas gradients, due to operating purely in text space. To this end, we introduce\nGReaTer, a novel prompt optimization technique that directly incorporates\ngradient information over task-specific reasoning. By utilizing task loss\ngradients, GReaTer enables self-optimization of prompts for open-source,\nlightweight language models without the need for costly closed-source LLMs.\nThis allows high-performance prompt optimization without dependence on massive\nLLMs, closing the gap between smaller models and the sophisticated reasoning\noften needed for prompt refinement. Extensive evaluations across diverse\nreasoning tasks including BBH, GSM8k, and FOLIO demonstrate that GReaTer\nconsistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods,\neven those reliant on powerful LLMs. Additionally, GReaTer-optimized prompts\nfrequently exhibit better transferability and, in some cases, boost task\nperformance to levels comparable to or surpassing those achieved by larger\nlanguage models, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt optimization guided\nby gradients over reasoning.

    "abstract": "The Rashomon effect presents a significant challenge in model selection. It\noccurs when multiple models achieve similar performance on a dataset but\nproduce different predictions, resulting in predictive multiplicity. This is\nespecially problematic in high-stakes environments, where arbitrary model\noutcomes can have serious consequences. Traditional model selection methods\nprioritize accuracy and fail to address this issue. Factors such as class\nimbalance and irrelevant variables further complicate the situation, making it\nharder for models to provide trustworthy predictions. Data-centric AI\napproaches can mitigate these problems by prioritizing data optimization,\nparticularly through preprocessing techniques. However, recent studies suggest\npreprocessing methods may inadvertently inflate predictive multiplicity. This\npaper investigates how data preprocessing techniques like balancing and\nfiltering methods impact predictive multiplicity and model stability,\nconsidering the complexity of the data. We conduct the experiments on 21\nreal-world datasets, applying various balancing and filtering techniques, and\nassess the level of predictive multiplicity introduced by these methods by\nleveraging the Rashomon effect. Additionally, we examine how filtering\ntechniques reduce redundancy and enhance model generalization. The findings\nprovide insights into the relationship between balancing methods, data\ncomplexity, and predictive multiplicity, demonstrating how data-centric AI\nstrategies can improve model performance.",

Today the public core faces many challenges to\nuniform, global reachability: firewalls and access control lists, commercial\ndisputes that stretch for days or years, and government-mandated sanctions. We\ndefine two algorithms to detect partial connectivity: Taitao detects peninsulas\nof persistent, partial connectivity, and Chiloe detects islands, when one or\nmore computers are partitioned from the public core. These new algorithms apply\nto existing data collected by multiple long-lived measurement studies. We\nevaluate these algorithms with rigorous measurements from two platforms:\nTrinocular, where 6 locations observe 5M networks frequently, RIPE Atlas, where\n10k locations scan the DNS root frequently, and validate adding a third: CAIDA\nArk, where 171 locations traceroute to millions of networks daily. Root causes\nsuggest that most peninsula events (45%) are routing transients, but most\npeninsula-time (90%) is due to long-lived events (7%). We show that the concept\nof peninsulas and islands can improve existing measurement systems. They\nidentify measurement error and persistent problems in RIPE's DNSmon that are\n$5\\times$ to $9.7\\times$ larger than the operationally important changes of\ninterest.

A comprehensive hardware design space exploration\nusing 22nm commercial technology demonstrates DiP's scalability advantages,\nachieving up to a 2.02x improvement in energy efficiency per area.

However, while image generation models can produce visually\ndiverse images, single-modality data enhancement techniques still fail to\ncapture the comprehensive knowledge provided by different modalities.\nAdditionally, we note that the performance of TPT-based methods drops\nsignificantly when the number of augmented images is limited, which is not\nunusual given the computational expense of generative augmentation. To address\nthese issues, we introduce IT3A, a novel test-time adaptation method that\nutilizes a pre-trained generative model for multi-modal augmentation of each\ntest sample from unknown new domains. By combining augmented data from\npre-trained vision and language models, we enhance the ability of the model to\nadapt to unknown new test data. Additionally, to ensure that key semantics are\naccurately retained when generating various visual and text enhancements, we\nemploy cosine similarity filtering between the logits of the enhanced images\nand text with the original test data. This process allows us to filter out some\nspurious augmentation and inadequate combinations. To leverage the diverse\nenhancements provided by the generation model across different modals, we have\nreplaced prompt tuning with an adapter for greater flexibility in utilizing\ntext templates. Our experiments on the test datasets with distribution shifts\nand domain gaps show that in a zero-shot setting, IT3A outperforms\nstate-of-the-art test-time prompt tuning methods with a 5.50% increase in\naccuracy.",

Using global numerical\nsimulations in spherical geometry, we have investigated here the interplay\nbetween rotating convection and a melting boundary. To do so, we have\nimplemented and validated a phase field formulation in the open-source code\n\\texttt{MagIC}. We have conducted a parameter study varying the influence of\nrotation, the vigour of the convective forcing and the melting temperature. We\nhave evidenced different regimes akin to those already found in previous\nmonophasic models in which the mean axisymmetric ice crust transits from\npole-ward thinning to equator-ward thinning with the increase of the rotational\nconstraint on the flow. The derivation of a perturbative model of heat\nconduction in the ice layer enabled us to relate those mean topographic changes\nto the underlying latitudinal heat flux variations at the top of the ocean. The\nphase change has also been found to yield the formation of sizeable\nnon-axisymmetric topography at the solid-liquid interface with a typical size\nclose to that of the convective columns. We have shown that the typical\nevolution timescale of the interface increases linearly with the\ncrest-to-trough amplitude and quadratically with the mean melt radius. In the\ncase of the largest topographic changes, the convective flows become quasi\nlocked in the topography due to the constructive coupling between convection\nand ice melting.

    "abstract": "Plant breeding programs require assessments of days to maturity for accurate\nselection and placement of entries in appropriate tests. In the early stages of\nthe breeding pipeline, soybean breeding programs assign relative maturity\nratings to experimental varieties that indicate their suitable maturity zones.\nTraditionally, the estimation of maturity value for breeding varieties has\ninvolved breeders manually inspecting fields and assessing maturity value\nvisually. This approach relies heavily on rater judgment, making it subjective\nand time-consuming. This study aimed to develop a machine-learning model for\nevaluating soybean maturity using UAV-based time-series imagery. Images were\ncaptured at three-day intervals, beginning as the earliest varieties started\nmaturing and continuing until the last varieties fully matured. The data\ncollected for this experiment consisted of 22,043 plots collected across three\nyears (2021 to 2023) and represent relative maturity groups 1.6 - 3.9. We\nutilized contour plot images extracted from the time-series UAV RGB imagery as\ninput for a neural network model. This contour plot approach encoded the\ntemporal and spatial variation within each plot into a single image. A deep\nlearning model was trained to utilize this contour plot to predict maturity\nratings. This model significantly improves accuracy and robustness, achieving\nup to 85% accuracy. We also evaluate the model's accuracy as we reduce the\nnumber of time points, quantifying the trade-off between temporal resolution\nand maturity prediction. The predictive model offers a scalable, objective, and\nefficient means of assessing crop maturity, enabling phenomics and ML\napproaches to reduce the reliance on manual inspection and subjective\nassessment. This approach enables the automatic prediction of relative maturity\nratings in a breeding program, saving time and resources.",

Deep hash models are easily\ninfluenced by adversarial examples, which can be leveraged to protect private\nimages from malicious retrieval. The existing adversarial example methods\nagainst deep hash models focus on universality and transferability, lacking the\nresearch on its robustness in online social networks (OSNs), which leads to\ntheir failure in anti-retrieval after post-processing. Therefore, we provide\nthe first in-depth discussion on robustness adversarial perturbation in\nuniversal transferable anti-facial retrieval and propose Three-in-One\nAdversarial Perturbation (TOAP). Specifically, we construct a local and global\nCompression Generator (CG) to simulate complex post-processing scenarios, which\ncan be used to mitigate perturbation. Then, we propose robust optimization\nobjectives based on the discovery of the variation patterns of model's\ndistribution after post-processing, and generate adversarial examples using\nthese objectives and meta-learning. Finally, we iteratively optimize\nperturbation by alternately generating adversarial examples and fine-tuning the\nCG, balancing the performance of perturbation while enhancing CG's ability to\nmitigate them. Numerous experiments demonstrate that, in addition to its\nadvantages in universality and transferability, TOAP significantly outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods in multiple robustness metrics. It further\nimproves universality and transferability by 5% to 28%, and achieves up to\nabout 33% significant improvement in several simulated post-processing\nscenarios as well as mainstream OSNs, demonstrating that TOAP can effectively\nprotect private images from malicious retrieval in real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the ill-posed inverse rendering problem in 3D reconstruction with a\nNeural Radiance Field (NeRF) approach informed by Physics-Based Rendering (PBR)\ntheory, named PBR-NeRF. Our method addresses a key limitation in most NeRF and\n3D Gaussian Splatting approaches: they estimate view-dependent appearance\nwithout modeling scene materials and illumination. To address this limitation,\nwe present an inverse rendering (IR) model capable of jointly estimating scene\ngeometry, materials, and illumination. Our model builds upon recent NeRF-based\nIR approaches, but crucially introduces two novel physics-based priors that\nbetter constrain the IR estimation. Our priors are rigorously formulated as\nintuitive loss terms and achieve state-of-the-art material estimation without\ncompromising novel view synthesis quality. Our method is easily adaptable to\nother inverse rendering and 3D reconstruction frameworks that require material\nestimation. We demonstrate the importance of extending current neural rendering\napproaches to fully model scene properties beyond geometry and view-dependent\nappearance.

Our generic framework\nencompasses different ultraviolet scenarios similar to KSVZ, DFSZ and flavorful\naxions etc. Starting from the effective Lagrangian written at the high scale,\nwe compute the anomalous dimension matrix, taking into account all one-loop and\nrelevant two-loop contributions. The latter is most important for the KSVZ and\nheavy QCD axion scenarios. We recognized that such two-loop diagrams can have\nboth ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) divergences. We show explicitly that UV\ndivergences cancel by inserting appropriate counterterms, which are new\noperators involving the axion field and required to be present at the UV\nitself, to renormalize the theory. On the other hand, the cancellation of IR\ndivergences is subtle and demonstrated through matching with the effective\ntheory at the electroweak scale. We also utilize chiral perturbation theory and\nvector meson dominance framework to compute the decay and branching fractions\nof the ALP pertaining to our framework. We find that for KSVZ-like scenario,\naxion decay constant, $f_a \\lesssim 1$ TeV can be ruled out. The bound becomes\nstronger for the DFSZ and Flaxion-like models, reaching upto $10^4$ TeV and\n$10^6$ TeV, respectively.

In this picture, while the Higgs itself is a\nfundamental field, it controls the strength of the non-perturbative\ninteractions that give rise to its potential. We examine a simple setup in\nwhich this instanton contribution is augmented by a quartic term, which is\nsufficient for a realistic electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. The minimum\nof the potential is given by the Lambert $W_0$ function, with these\nassumptions. We discuss the predictions of this model and how it may be tested\nthrough measurements of the Higgs self coupling. Given the connection with\nnon-trivial dynamics, one may also consider the prospects of accessing hidden\nsector states at colliders; this seems to be typically challenging in our\nsetup. Symmetry restoration in the early Universe in this scenario is briefly\nexamined. We also comment on the possible connection of our general setup with\nrecent work on the physics of field space end points.",

To address this limitation, we\nextend the framework of spread complexity beyond bosonic systems to include\nfermionic and supercoherent states. This offers a gateway to compute spread\ncomplexity analytically for any semiclassical system governed by a Hamiltonian\nassociated with a Lie (super)algebra. This requires extending the Krylov chain\nto a Krylov path in a higher-dimensional lattice. A detailed analysis of\nsupercoherent states within the super Heisenberg-Weyl and OSp$(2|1)$ algebras\nelucidates distinct contributions from bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom\nto the complexity. This generalisation allows us to access the semiclassical\nregime of the planar limit of the holographic correspondence. We then compute\nthe spread complexity of large charge superstring states on the gravity side,\nwhich are equivalent to the dual gauge states. The resulting complexity leads\nto Krylov paths capturing the geometry in which the string propagates.",

    "abstract": "Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically\ntrained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and\nconstrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have\nexplored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential\nhigher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these\nmethods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive\npatterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency\ninformation when the model generates visual content exceeding its training\nresolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the\naccumulated errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose FreeScale, a\ntuning-free inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation\nvia scale fusion. Specifically, FreeScale processes information from different\nreceptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components.\nExtensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the\ncapabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video\nmodels.

Conventional tuning-free methods mostly encode multiple reference\nimages by averaging their image embeddings as the injection condition, but such\nan image-independent operation cannot perform interaction among images to\ncapture consistent visual elements within multiple references. Although the\ntuning-based Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively extract consistent\nelements within multiple images through the training process, it necessitates\nspecific finetuning for each distinct image group. This paper introduces\nEasyRef, a novel plug-and-play adaptation method that enables diffusion models\nto be conditioned on multiple reference images and the text prompt. To\neffectively exploit consistent visual elements within multiple images, we\nleverage the multi-image comprehension and instruction-following capabilities\nof the multimodal large language model (MLLM), prompting it to capture\nconsistent visual elements based on the instruction. Besides, injecting the\nMLLM's representations into the diffusion process through adapters can easily\ngeneralize to unseen domains, mining the consistent visual elements within\nunseen data. To mitigate computational costs and enhance fine-grained detail\npreservation, we introduce an efficient reference aggregation strategy and a\nprogressive training scheme.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been extended to understand both\nimages and videos. Visual token compression is leveraged to reduce the\nconsiderable token length of visual inputs. To meet the needs of different\ntasks, existing high-performance models usually process images and videos\nseparately with different token compression strategies, limiting the\ncapabilities of combining images and videos. To this end, we extend each image\ninto a \"static\" video and introduce a unified token compression strategy called\nProgressive Visual Token Compression (PVC), where the tokens of each frame are\nprogressively encoded and adaptively compressed to supplement the information\nnot extracted from previous frames. Video tokens are efficiently compressed\nwith exploiting the inherent temporal redundancy. Images are repeated as static\nvideos, and the spatial details can be gradually supplemented in multiple\nframes. PVC unifies the token compressing of images and videos. With a limited\nnumber of tokens per frame (64 tokens by default), spatial details and temporal\nchanges can still be preserved. Experiments show that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various video understanding benchmarks,\nincluding long video tasks and fine-grained short video tasks. Meanwhile, our\nunified token compression strategy incurs no performance loss on image\nbenchmarks, particularly in detail-sensitive tasks.",

Recent dynamic view synthesis methods\nleverage powerful 4D representations, like feature grids or point cloud\nsequences, to achieve high-quality rendering results. However, they are\ntypically limited to short (1~2s) video clips and often suffer from large\nmemory footprints when dealing with longer videos. To solve this issue, we\npropose a novel 4D representation, named Temporal Gaussian Hierarchy, to\ncompactly model long volumetric videos. Our key observation is that there are\ngenerally various degrees of temporal redundancy in dynamic scenes, which\nconsist of areas changing at different speeds. Motivated by this, our approach\nbuilds a multi-level hierarchy of 4D Gaussian primitives, where each level\nseparately describes scene regions with different degrees of content change,\nand adaptively shares Gaussian primitives to represent unchanged scene content\nover different temporal segments, thus effectively reducing the number of\nGaussian primitives. In addition, the tree-like structure of the Gaussian\nhierarchy allows us to efficiently represent the scene at a particular moment\nwith a subset of Gaussian primitives, leading to nearly constant GPU memory\nusage during the training or rendering regardless of the video length.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nalternative methods in terms of training cost, rendering speed, and storage\nusage. To our knowledge, this work is the first approach capable of efficiently\nhandling minutes of volumetric video data while maintaining state-of-the-art\nrendering quality.

    "abstract": "Given that visual foundation models (VFMs) are trained on extensive datasets\nbut often limited to 2D images, a natural question arises: how well do they\nunderstand the 3D world? With the differences in architecture and training\nprotocols (i.e., objectives, proxy tasks), a unified framework to fairly and\ncomprehensively probe their 3D awareness is urgently needed. Existing works on\n3D probing suggest single-view 2.5D estimation (e.g., depth and normal) or\ntwo-view sparse 2D correspondence (e.g., matching and tracking). Unfortunately,\nthese tasks ignore texture awareness, and require 3D data as ground-truth,\nwhich limits the scale and diversity of their evaluation set. To address these\nissues, we introduce Feat2GS, which readout 3D Gaussians attributes from VFM\nfeatures extracted from unposed images. This allows us to probe 3D awareness\nfor geometry and texture via novel view synthesis, without requiring 3D data.\nAdditionally, the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry\n($\\boldsymbol{x}, \\alpha, \\Sigma$) and texture ($\\boldsymbol{c}$) - enables\nseparate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS, we conduct\nextensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs, and\ninvestigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM. Building on these\nfindings, we develop several variants that achieve state-of-the-art across\ndiverse datasets.

Importantly, this bottleneck ratio involves not only the probabilities\nof the relevant subspaces, but also the size of off-diagonal matrix elements\nbetween them.

However, leveraging these priors\neffectively faces three key challenges: (1) degradation in quality across large\ncamera motions, (2) difficulties in achieving precise camera control, and (3)\ngeometric distortions inherent to the diffusion process that damage 3D\nconsistency. We address these challenges by proposing LiftImage3D, a framework\nthat effectively releases LVDMs' generative priors while ensuring 3D\nconsistency. Specifically, we design an articulated trajectory strategy to\ngenerate video frames, which decomposes video sequences with large camera\nmotions into ones with controllable small motions. Then we use robust neural\nmatching models, i.e. MASt3R, to calibrate the camera poses of generated frames\nand produce corresponding point clouds. Finally, we propose a distortion-aware\n3D Gaussian splatting representation, which can learn independent distortions\nbetween frames and output undistorted canonical Gaussians. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LiftImage3D achieves state-of-the-art performance\non two challenging datasets, i.e. LLFF, DL3DV, and Tanks and Temples, and\ngeneralizes well to diverse in-the-wild images, from cartoon illustrations to\ncomplex real-world scenes.",

Recent\nadvancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant\nstrides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and\nsimultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely\nunexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence\narchitecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate\nresponses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving.\nFurthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical\nfor long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and\ninefficient. Therefore, rather than relying on a single foundation model to\nperform all functions, this project draws inspiration from the concept of the\nSpecialized Generalist AI and introduces disentangled streaming perception,\nreasoning, and memory mechanisms, enabling real-time interaction with streaming\nvideo and audio input. The proposed framework InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive\n(IXC2.5-OL) consists of three key modules: (1) Streaming Perception Module:\nProcesses multimodal information in real-time, storing key details in memory\nand triggering reasoning in response to user queries. (2) Multi-modal Long\nMemory Module: Integrates short-term and long-term memory, compressing\nshort-term memories into long-term ones for efficient retrieval and improved\naccuracy. (3) Reasoning Module: Responds to queries and executes reasoning\ntasks, coordinating with the perception and memory modules. This project\nsimulates human-like cognition, enabling multimodal large language models to\nprovide continuous and adaptive service over time.",

The depth of the PRIMER near-IR imaging allows us\nto confirm the double Schechter function shape of the quiescent GSMF out to\n$z\\simeq2.0$, via a clear detection of the upturn at\n$\\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\\star}/ M_{\\odot}) \\leq 10$ thought to be induced by\nenvironmental quenching.

We find that low-mass quiescent galaxies have more\ndisk-like morphologies (based on S\\'ersic index, Gini coefficient and $M_{20}$\nmetrics) and follow a shallower size-mass relation than their high-mass\ncounterparts. Indeed, the slope of the size-mass relation followed by low-mass\nquiescent galaxies is indistinguishable from that followed by star-forming\ngalaxies, albeit with a lower normalization. Moreover, within the errors, the\nevolution in the median size of low-mass quiescent galaxies is\nindistinguishable from that followed by star-forming galaxies\n($R_{e}\\propto(1+z)^{-0.25\\pm0.03})$, and significantly less rapid than that\ndisplayed by high-mass quiescent galaxies ($R_{e}\\propto (1+z)^{-1.14\\pm\n0.03})$. Overall, our results are consistent with low and high-mass quiescent\ngalaxies following different quenching pathways. The evolution of low-mass\nquiescent galaxies is qualitatively consistent with the expectations of\nexternal/environmental quenching (e.g. ram-pressure stripping). In contrast,\nthe evolution of high-mass quiescent galaxies is consistent with internal/mass\nquenching (e.g. AGN feedback) followed by size growth driven by minor mergers.",

To that end, we propose OLA-VLM, the first approach\ndistilling knowledge into the LLM's hidden representations from a set of target\nvisual representations. Firstly, we formulate the objective during the\npretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual\nembedding and next text-token prediction. Secondly, we investigate MLLMs\ntrained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive\ncorrelation between the quality of visual representations within these models\nand their downstream performance. Moreover, upon probing our OLA-VLM, we\nobserve improved representation quality owing to the embedding optimization.\nThirdly, we demonstrate that our OLA-VLM outperforms the single and\nmulti-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly\nfeeding the corresponding features to the LLM. Particularly, OLA-VLM boosts\nperformance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a\nnotable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.

However, their inherent non-linearity presents significant challenges\nfor effective planning. Current planning methods, often dependent on extensive\nsampling or local gradient descent, struggle with long-horizon motion planning\ntasks involving complex contact events. In this paper, we present a\nGPU-accelerated branch-and-bound (BaB) framework for motion planning in\nmanipulation tasks that require trajectory optimization over neural dynamics\nmodels. Our approach employs a specialized branching heuristics to divide the\nsearch space into subdomains, and applies a modified bound propagation method,\ninspired by the state-of-the-art neural network verifier alpha-beta-CROWN, to\nefficiently estimate objective bounds within these subdomains. The branching\nprocess guides planning effectively, while the bounding process strategically\nreduces the search space. Our framework achieves superior planning performance,\ngenerating high-quality state-action trajectories and surpassing existing\nmethods in challenging, contact-rich manipulation tasks such as non-prehensile\nplanar pushing with obstacles, object sorting, and rope routing in both\nsimulated and real-world settings. Furthermore, our framework supports various\nneural network architectures, ranging from simple multilayer perceptrons to\nadvanced graph neural dynamics models, and scales efficiently with different\nmodel sizes.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, weather forecasts are commonly generated by ensemble forecasts\nbased on multiple runs of numerical weather prediction models. However, such\nforecasts are usually miscalibrated and/or biased, thus require statistical\npostprocessing. Non-homogeneous regression models, such as the ensemble model\noutput statistics are frequently applied to correct these forecasts.\nNonetheless, these methods often rely on the assumption of an unimodal\nparametric distribution, leading to improved, but sometimes not fully\ncalibrated forecasts. To address this issue, a mixture regression model is\npresented, where the ensemble forecasts of each exchangeable group are linked\nto only one mixture component and mixture weight, called mixture of model\noutput statistics (MIXMOS). In order to remove location specific effects and to\nuse a longer training data, the standardized anomalies of the response and the\nensemble forecasts are employed for the mixture of standardized anomaly model\noutput statistics (MIXSAMOS). As carefully selected covariates, e.g. from\ndifferent weather variables, can enhance model performance, the non-cyclic\ngradient-boosting algorithm for mixture regression models is introduced.\nFurthermore, MIXSAMOS is extended by this gradient-boosting algorithm\n(MIXSAMOS-GB) providing an automatic variable selection. The novel mixture\nregression models substantially outperform state-of-the-art postprocessing\nmodels in a case study for 2m surface temperature forecasts in Germany.",

While\nsome long video datasets do exist, they can often be solved by powerful image\nmodels applied per frame (and often to very few frames) in a video, and are\nusually manually annotated at high cost. In order to mitigate both these\nproblems, we propose a scalable dataset creation pipeline which leverages large\nmodels (VLMs and LLMs), to automatically generate dense, time-aligned video\ncaptions, as well as tough question answer decoy sets for video segments (up to\n15 minutes in length).

    "abstract": "Optimizing the input probability distribution of a discrete-time channel is a\nstandard step in the information-theoretic analysis of digital communication\nsystems. Nevertheless, many practical communication systems transmit uniformly\nand independently distributed symbols drawn from regular constellation sets.\nThe introduction of the probabilistic amplitude shaping architecture has\nrenewed interest in using optimized probability distributions, i.e.,\nprobabilistic shaping. Traditionally, probabilistic shaping has been employed\nto reduce the transmit power required for a given information rate over\nadditive noise channels. While this translates into substantive performance\ngains for optical fiber communication systems, the interaction of shaping and\nfiber nonlinearity has posed intriguing questions. At first glance,\nprobabilistic shaping seems to exacerbate nonlinear interference noise (NLIN)\ndue to larger higher-order standardized moments. Therefore, the optimization of\nshaping distributions must differ from those used for linear channels.\nSecondly, finite-length effects related to the memory of the nonlinear fiber\nchannel have been observed. This suggests that the marginal input-symbol\ndistribution is not the only consideration. This paper provides a\ntutorial-style discussion of probabilistic shaping for optical fiber\ncommunication. Since the distinguishing property of the channel is the\nsignal-dependent NLIN, we speak of probabilistic shaping for nonlinearity\ntolerance. Our analysis builds on the first-order time-domain perturbation\napproximation of the nonlinear fiber channel and revisits the notion of linear\nand nonlinear shaping gain. We largely focus on probabilistic amplitude shaping\nwith popular shaping methods. The concept of shaping via sequence selection is\ngiven special consideration, as it inherently optimizes a multivariate\ndistribution for shaped constellations.",

    "abstract": "The conventional way of generating optical waveforms relies on the in-phase\nand quadrature (IQ) modulation of a continuous wave (CW) laser tone. In this\ncase, the bandwidth of the resulting optical waveform is limited by the\nunderlying electronic components, in particular by the digital-to-analog\nconverters (DACs) generating the drive signals for the IQ modulator. This\nbandwidth bottleneck can be overcome by using a concept known as optical\narbitrary waveform generation (OAWG), where multiple IQ modulators and DACs are\noperated in parallel to first synthesize individual spectral slices, which are\nsubsequently combined to form a single ultra-broadband arbitrary optical\nwaveform. However, targeted synthesis of arbitrary optical waveforms from\nmultiple spectral slices has so far been hampered by difficulties to maintain\nthe correct optical phase relationship between the slices. In this paper, we\npropose and demonstrate spectrally sliced OAWG with active phase stabilization,\nwhich permits targeted synthesis of truly arbitrary optical waveforms. We\ndemonstrate the viability of the scheme by synthesizing optical waveforms with\nrecord-high bandwidths of up to 325 GHz from four individually generated\noptical tributaries. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we use the OAWG system\nto generate 32QAM data signals at symbol rates of up to 320 GBd, which we\ntransmit over 87 km of single-mode fiber and receive by a two-channel\nnon-sliced optical arbitrary waveform measurement (OAWM) system, achieving\nexcellent signal quality.

Despite prior theoretical studies\nexploring the benefits of knowledge distillation, an important question remains\nunanswered: why does soft-label training from the teacher require significantly\nfewer neurons than directly training a small neural network with hard labels?\nTo address this, we first present motivating experimental results using simple\nneural network models on a binary classification problem. These results\ndemonstrate that soft-label training consistently outperforms hard-label\ntraining in accuracy, with the performance gap becoming more pronounced as the\ndataset becomes increasingly difficult to classify. We then substantiate these\nobservations with a theoretical contribution based on two-layer neural network\nmodels. Specifically, we show that soft-label training using gradient descent\nrequires only $O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2 \\epsilon}\\right)$ neurons to achieve a\nclassification loss averaged over epochs smaller than some $\\epsilon > 0$,\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the separation margin of the limiting kernel.

This study\ninvestigates homogeneity bias-the tendency to portray groups as more uniform\nthan they are-within Black Americans, examining how perceived racial\nphenotypicality influences VLMs' outputs. Using computer-generated images that\nsystematically vary in phenotypicality, we prompted VLMs to generate stories\nabout these individuals and measured text similarity to assess content\nhomogeneity. Our findings reveal three key patterns: First, VLMs generate\nsignificantly more homogeneous stories about Black individuals with higher\nphenotypicality compared to those with lower phenotypicality. Second, stories\nabout Black women consistently display greater homogeneity than those about\nBlack men across all models tested. Third, in two of three VLMs, this\nhomogeneity bias is primarily driven by a pronounced interaction where\nphenotypicality strongly influences content variation for Black women but has\nminimal impact for Black men.

We develop two specialized\nvariants--for object-centric and scene-level reconstruction--trained on\ncomprehensive datasets. Remarkably, FreeSplatter outperforms several\npose-dependent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) by a notable margin while\nachieving comparable or even better pose estimation accuracy compared to\nstate-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction approach MASt3R in challenging\nbenchmarks. Beyond technical benchmarks, FreeSplatter streamlines\ntext/image-to-3D content creation pipelines, eliminating the complexity of\ncamera pose management while delivering exceptional visual fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying the uncertainty in the factual parametric knowledge of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), especially in a black-box setting, poses a significant\nchallenge. Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through\nevaluating self-consistency in responses to the original query, do not always\ncapture true uncertainty. Models might respond consistently to the origin query\nwith a wrong answer, yet respond correctly to varied questions from different\nperspectives about the same query, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method, DiverseAgentEntropy, for evaluating a model's uncertainty using\nmulti-agent interaction under the assumption that if a model is certain, it\nshould consistently recall the answer to the original query across a diverse\ncollection of questions about the same original query. We further implement an\nabstention policy to withhold responses when uncertainty is high. Our method\noffers a more accurate prediction of the model's reliability and further\ndetects hallucinations, outperforming other self-consistency-based methods.\nAdditionally, it demonstrates that existing models often fail to consistently\nretrieve the correct answer to the same query under diverse varied questions\neven when knowing the correct answer.",

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks can exhibit asymmetric temperature variations due to\nphenomena such as shadows cast by the inner disk or localized heating by young\nplanets. We investigate the disk features induced by these asymmetric\ntemperature variations. We find that spirals are initially excited, then break\ninto two and reconnect to form rings. By carrying out linear analyses, we first\nstudy the spiral launching mechanism, and find that the effects of azimuthal\ntemperature variations share similarities with effects of external potentials.\nSpecifically, rotating temperature variations launch steady spiral structures\nat Lindblad resonances, which corotate with the temperature patterns. When the\ncooling time exceeds the orbital period, these spiral structures are\nsignificantly weakened, and a checkerboard pattern may appear. A temperature\nvariation of about 10\\% can induce spirals with order unity density\nperturbations, comparable to those generated by a thermal mass planet. We then\nstudy ring formation and find it is related to the coupling between azimuthal\ntemperature variations and spirals outside the resonances. Such coupling leads\nto a radially varying angular momentum flux, which produces anomalous\nwave-driven accretion and forms dense rings separated by the wavelength of the\nwaves. Finally, we speculate that spirals induced by temperature variations may\ncontribute to disk accretion through non-linear wave steepening and\ndissipation. Overall, considering that irradiation determines the temperature\nstructure of protoplanetary disks, the change of irradiation both spatially\nor/and temporarily may produce observable effects in protoplanetary disks,\nespecially spirals and rings in outer disks beyond tens of AU.",

Introduced by Fox, Roughgarden, Seshadhri, Wei and\nWein [ICALP 2018, SICOMP 2020], this definition is an abstraction of the\ntriadic closure property exhibited by many real-world social networks, namely,\nfriends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Social networks, however, are\noften temporal rather than static -- the connections change over a period of\ntime. And hence temporal graphs, rather than static graphs, are often better\nsuited to model social networks. Motivated by this, we introduce a definition\nof temporal c-closed graphs, in which if two vertices u and v have at least c\ncommon neighbors during a short interval of time, then u and v are adjacent to\neach other around that time. Our pilot experiments show that several real-world\ntemporal networks are c-closed for rather small values of c. We also study the\ncomputational problems of enumerating maximal cliques and similar dense\nsubgraphs in temporal c-closed graphs; a clique in a temporal graph is a\nsubgraph that lasts for a certain period of time, during which every possible\nedge in the subgraph becomes active often enough, and other dense subgraphs are\ndefined similarly. We bound the number of such maximal dense subgraphs in a\ntemporal c-closed graph that evolves slowly, and thus show that the\ncorresponding enumeration problems admit efficient algorithms; by slow\nevolution, we mean that between consecutive time-steps, the local change in\nadjacencies remains small. Our work also adds to a growing body of literature\non defining suitable structural parameters for temporal graphs that can be\nleveraged to design efficient algorithms.",

This approach enables precise control\nover the magnitude, frequency, and timing of when rapid outflow events occur.\nWe demonstrate that this method can reproduce the established result of core\nformation for systems that undergo multiple episodes of bursty outflows.

The cable industry proposed a\nframework called Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) to diagnose the cable\nnetworks. However, there is little public knowledge or systematic study on how\nto use these data to detect and localize cable network problems. Existing tools\nin the public domain have prohibitive high false-positive rates. In this paper,\nwe propose CableMon, the first public-domain system that applies machine\nlearning techniques to PNM data to improve the reliability of cable broadband\nnetworks. CableMon tackles two key challenges faced by cable ISPs: accurately\ndetecting failures, and distinguishing whether a failure occurs within a\nnetwork or at a subscriber's premise. CableMon uses statistical models to\ngenerate features from time series data and uses customer trouble tickets as\nhints to infer abnormal/failure thresholds for these generated features.\nFurther, CableMon employs an unsupervised learning model to group cable devices\nsharing similar anomalous patterns and effectively identify impairments that\noccur inside a cable network and impairments occur at a subscriber's premise,\nas these two different faults require different types of technical personnel to\nrepair them. We use eight months of PNM data and customer trouble tickets from\nan ISP and experimental deployment to evaluate CableMon's performance.

While previous studies\nhave identified specific regions involved in emotion processing, a holistic\nnetwork approach may provide deeper insights. We use Structural Balance Theory\nto investigate the stability and triadic structures of signed brain networks\nduring resting state and emotional processing, specifically in response to\nfear-related stimuli. We hypothesized that imbalanced triadic interactions\nwould be more prevalent during emotional processing, especially in response to\nfear-related stimuli, potentially reflecting the brain's adaptation to\nemotional challenges. By analyzing fMRI data from 138 healthy, right-handed\nparticipants, we found that emotional processing was marked by an increase in\npositive connections and a decrease in negative connections compared to the\nresting state. Our findings clearly show that balanced triads significantly\ndecreased while imbalanced triads increased, indicating a shift toward\ninstability in the brain's functional network during emotional processing.\nAdditionally, the number of influential hubs was significantly lower during\nfear processing than in neutral conditions, suggesting a more centralized\nnetwork and higher levels of network energy. These findings reveal the brain's\nremarkable adaptive capacity during emotional processing, demonstrating how\nnetwork stability dynamically shifts through changes in balanced and imbalanced\ntriads, hub tendencies, and energy dynamics. Our research illuminates a complex\nmechanism by which the brain flexibly reconfigures its functional network in\nresponse to emotional stimuli with potential implications for understanding\nemotional resilience and neurological disorders.",

Moreover, the atomic displacements in the trimerized\nstate further produce a local electric polarization whose sign depends on\nwhether the clock variable is even or odd. These induced electric dipoles,\nwhich can be modeled by emergent Ising degrees of freedom, interact with each\nother via long-range dipolar interactions. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations\nare carried out to investigate low temperature phases resulting from the\ncompeting interactions. Upon lowering temperature, the system undergoes two\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, characteristic of the\nstandard six-state clock model in two dimensions. The dipolar interaction\nbetween emergent Ising spins induces a first-order transition into a ground\nstate characterized by a three-fold degenerate stripe order. The intermediate\nphase between the discontinuous and the second BKT transition corresponds to a\nmaze-like hexagonal liquid with short-range stripe ordering.

In the standard flux tube model\nmade of a straight cylindrical tube, these modes can be classified according to\ntheir azimuthal wavenumber, $m$. Sausage $m=0$ modes produce periodic expansion\nand contraction of the tube cross section and are observed during solar flares.\nKink $m=1$ modes laterally displace the tube axis and are related to, for\nexample, post-flare global transverse oscillations of coronal loops. Fluting $m\n\\geq 2$ modes produce disturbances that are mainly confined to the tube\nboundary, but their observation remains elusive to date. We use 3D ideal MHD\nnumerical simulations to investigate the nonlinear evolution of fluting modes\nin coronal flux tubes with transversely nonuniform boundaries. The simulations\nshow that fluting modes are short-lived as coherent, collective motions of the\nflux tube. Owing to the process of resonant absorption, fluting oscillations\nbecome overdamped modes in tubes with wide enough nonuniform boundaries. During\nthe nonlinear evolution, shear flows drive the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at\nthe tube boundary, which further disrupts the coherent fluting oscillation. For\nlarge-enough oscillation amplitudes, baroclinic instabilities of\nRayleigh-Taylor type are also present at locations in the boundary where the\nplasma acceleration is normal to the boundary. The evolution of the\ninstabilities drives turbulence in the flux tube, which may inhibit the\nresonant damping. However, the oscillations remain strongly damped even in this\ncase. As a result of the combination of the strong damping and the induced\ninstabilities, it is unlikely that coronal flux tubes can support fluting modes\nas sufficiently enduring coherent oscillations.",

To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion\nmodels, we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh, garment mesh, as well as hair\nstrands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the\navatar given a pose sequence, we first apply physics simulators onto the\ngarment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians\nthrough carefully designed mechanisms for each body part. As a result, our\nsynthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our method is the first to produce highly realistic,\nfully simulation-ready 3D avatars, surpassing the capabilities of current\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "Aligning AI systems with human preferences typically suffers from the\ninfamous reward hacking problem, where optimization of an imperfect reward\nmodel leads to undesired behaviors. In this paper, we investigate reward\nhacking in offline preference optimization, which aims to improve an initial\nmodel using a preference dataset. We identify two types of reward hacking\nstemming from statistical fluctuations in the dataset: Type I Reward Hacking\ndue to subpar choices appearing more favorable, and Type II Reward Hacking due\nto decent choices appearing less favorable. We prove that many (mainstream or\ntheoretical) preference optimization methods suffer from both types of reward\nhacking. To mitigate Type I Reward Hacking, we propose POWER, a new preference\noptimization method that combines Guiasu's weighted entropy with a robust\nreward maximization objective. POWER enjoys finite-sample guarantees under\ngeneral function approximation, competing with the best covered policy in the\ndata. To mitigate Type II Reward Hacking, we analyze the learning dynamics of\npreference optimization and develop a novel technique that dynamically updates\npreference labels toward certain \"stationary labels\", resulting in diminishing\ngradients for untrustworthy samples. Empirically, POWER with dynamic labels\n(POWER-DL) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on alignment\nbenchmarks, achieving improvements of up to 13.0 points on AlpacaEval 2.0 and\n11.5 points on Arena-Hard over DPO, while also improving or maintaining\nperformance on downstream tasks such as mathematical reasoning. Strong\ntheoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrate the promise of\nPOWER-DL in mitigating reward hacking.",

We compare C4PM with a\ntwo-parameter spectral distance method using data from two buoys moored 13 km\napart in deep water. Although both methods produce negligible bias and high\ncorrelation, C4PM demonstrates superior performance by preventing the\noccurrence of outliers and achieving a lower root mean square error across all\nparameters.

On the other hand,\nnumerical works suggest that there exist naked singularity spacetimes with\ndiscrete self-similarity arising from smooth initial data. In this paper, we\nrevisit part (i) of the problem and we construct exterior-naked singularity\nregions with discretely self-similar profiles which are smooth on the past cone\nof the singularity. We show that the scalar field remains uniformly bounded,\nbut the singularity is characterized by the infinite oscillations of the scalar\nfield and the mass aspect ratio.

However, modern training paradigms, especially for foundation\nmodels using stochastic algorithms and multi-stage curricula, are sensitive to\ndata ordering, thus violating this assumption. This mismatch renders influence\nfunctions inadequate for answering a critical question in machine learning: How\ncan we capture the dependence of data influence on the optimization trajectory\nduring training? To address this gap, we formalize the concept of\ntrajectory-specific leave-one-out (LOO) influence, which quantifies the impact\nof removing a data point from a specific iteration during training, accounting\nfor the exact sequence of data encountered and the model's optimization\ntrajectory. However, exactly evaluating the trajectory-specific LOO presents a\nsignificant computational challenge. To address this, we propose data value\nembedding, a novel technique enabling efficient approximation of\ntrajectory-specific LOO. Specifically, we compute a training data embedding\nthat encapsulates the cumulative interactions between data and the evolving\nmodel parameters. The LOO can then be efficiently approximated through a simple\ndot-product between the data value embedding and the gradient of the given test\ndata. As data value embedding captures training data ordering, it offers\nvaluable insights into model training dynamics. In particular, we uncover\ndistinct phases of data influence, revealing that data points in the early and\nlate stages of training exert a greater impact on the final model. These\ninsights translate into actionable strategies for managing the computational\noverhead of data selection by strategically timing the selection process,\npotentially opening new avenues in data curation research.",

    "abstract": "Trailing-edge (TE) noise is the main contributor to the acoustic signature of\nflows over airfoils. It originates from the interaction of turbulent structures\nin the airfoil boundary layer with the TE. This study experimentally identifies\nthe flow structures responsible for TE noise by decomposing the data into\nspanwise modes and examining the impact of spanwise coherent structures on\nsound emission. We analyse a NACA0012 airfoil at moderate Reynolds numbers,\nensuring broadband TE noise, and use synchronous measurements of surface and\nfar-field acoustic pressure fluctuations with custom spanwise microphone\narrays. Our results demonstrate the key role of coherent structures with large\nspanwise wavelengths in generating broadband TE noise. Spanwise modal\ndecomposition of the acoustic field shows that only waves with spanwise\nwavenumbers below the acoustic wavenumber contribute to the radiated acoustic\nspectrum, consistent with theoretical scattering conditions. Moreover, a strong\ncorrelation is found between spanwise-coherent (zero wavenumber) flow\nstructures and radiated acoustics. At frequencies corresponding to peak TE\nnoise emission, the turbulent structures responsible for radiation exhibit\nstrikingly large spanwise wavelengths, exceeding $60\\%$ of the airfoil chord\nlength. These findings have implications for numerical and experimental TE\nnoise analysis and flow control. The correlation between spectrally decomposed\nturbulent fluctuations and TE noise paves the way for future aeroacoustic\nmodelling through linearized mean field analysis.

Three distinct subgap DoS peaks are resolved\nfor the copper oxide TFT and are best ascribed to copper vacancies,\noxygen-on-copper antisites, and oxygen interstitials. For tin oxide TFTs, five\nsubgap DoS peaks are observed and are similarly linked to tin vacancies, oxygen\nvacancies, and oxygen interstitials.

However, these\ntechniques depend on a threshold parameter which value is chosen without\nphysical justification, usually relying on a user visual impression, thus\nlimiting the universality of results. In this paper we focus on the V-web\nmethod. Our aim is to find a physical motivation for deriving an universal\nthreshold that can be applied across different cosmic scales and epochs. V-web\nclassify the large-scale structure using the eigenvalues of the velocity shear\ntensor. Using a set of gravity-only simulations we introduce a normalization\nthat incorporates the standard deviation of the velocity divergence field,\nisolating the beyond Gaussian evolution of cosmic web elements. In the\nZeldovich's approximation, the probability presence of each cosmic web element\nremains constant at a threshold equal to 0. For the first time, we reveal that\nthis behavior also holds in the non-linear regime for a normalized positive\n'constant volume threshold' that depends on both the redshift and the applied\nsmoothing scale. The conservation of volume fractions is valid for the studied\nredshifts between 0 and 2, regardless of cosmic variance, and is most precise\nfor intermediate smoothing scales around 3 Mpc/h. The properties of the cosmic\nweb derived using this approach in the V-web align with expectations from other\nmethods, including visual impressions. We provide a general fit formula to\ncompute the constant volume threshold for any standard cosmological simulation,\nregardless of its specific properties.",

We also\nexplore a dynamic visual token compression architecture that strikes a balance\nbetween computational efficiency and performance. Our proposed \\model{}\nachieves state-of-the-art results across various video tasks and shows\nimpressive generalization, setting new baselines in multi-image understanding.\nNotably, \\model{} delivers an absolute improvement of 2.7\\% over\nLLaVA-OneVision on VideoMME and 10.7\\% on MuirBench.

The platform also defines ten categories of tools for\nagent-driven task solving and evaluates seven leading LLMs, revealing that\nwhile models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet can achieve a 67.1% task completion rate in\nroutine settings, they still struggle with complex task understanding and tool\ncoordination, limiting their capacity to serve as the central core of automated\nradiology systems. By incorporating four advanced prompt engineering\nstrategies--where prompt-backpropagation and multi-agent collaboration\ncontributed 16.8% and 30.7% improvements, respectively--the performance for\ncomplex tasks was enhanced by 48.2% overall. Furthermore, automated tool\nbuilding was explored to improve robustness, achieving a 65.4% success rate,\nthereby offering promising insights for the future integration of fully\nautomated radiology applications into clinical practice.

In this work, we introduce\na new analytical technique to design couplers with larger sections and improved\nperformance. We do this by employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based\nsolver. By defining a likelihood function based on S-parameter equations and\nincorporating physical priors, we derive optimized impedance values that\nenhance bandwidth beyond what is reported in the literature.

The chromaticity of the primary\nbeam is one such complicated systematic, which can leak the power of spectrally\nsmooth foregrounds beyond the ideal horizon limits due to the complex spatial\nand spectral structures of the sidelobes and the mainlobe. This paper studies\nthe chromaticity of the HIRAX Stokes I primary beam and its effects on accurate\nmeasurements of the 21cm power spectrum. To investigate the effect of\nchromaticity in the 21cm power spectrum, we present a physically motivated beam\nmodeling technique, which uses a flexible basis derived from traditional optics\nthat can account for higher-order radial and azimuthal structures in the\nprimary beam. We investigate the impact of imperfect knowledge of the mainlobe\nand sidelobes chromaticity in the power spectrum space by subtracting a simple\nforeground model in simulated snapshot visibilities to recover the\nH$\\textsc{i}$ power spectrum.

These baryonic effects can potentially bias the analyses\nof several cosmological probes, such as weak gravitational lensing. In this\nwork, we study the gas density and velocity fields of the FLAMINGO simulations\nand compare them with their gravity-only predictions. We find that, while the\ngas velocities do not differ from those of dark matter on large scales, the gas\nmass power spectrum is suppressed by up to $\\approx 8\\%$ relative to matter,\neven on gigaparsec scales. This is a consequence of star formation depleting\ngas in the densest and most clustered regions of the universe. On smaller\nscales, $k>0.1 \\, h / \\rm Mpc$, the power suppression for both gas densities\nand velocities is more significant and correlates with the strength of the\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The impact of feedback can be\nunderstood in terms of outflows, identified as gas bubbles with positive radial\nvelocities ejected from the central galaxy. With increasing feedback strength,\nthe outflowing gas has higher velocities, and it reaches scales as large as\n$10$ times the virial radius of the halo, redistributing the gas and slowing\nits average infall velocity. Interestingly, different implementations of AGN\nfeedback leave distinct features in these outflows in terms of their radial and\nangular profiles and their dependence on halo mass.

    "abstract": "Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is critical for harnessing the potential of\nnear-term quantum devices. Particularly, QEM protocols can be designed based on\nmachine learning, where the mapping between noisy computational outputs and\nideal ones can be learned on a training set consisting of Clifford circuits or\nnear-Clifford circuits that contain only a limited number of non-Clifford\ngates. This learned mapping is then applied to noisy target circuits to\nestimate the ideal computational output. In this work, we propose a\nlearning-based error mitigation framework called Clifford Perturbation Data\nRegression (CPDR), which constructs training sets by Clifford circuits with\nsmall perturbations. Specifically, these circuits are parameterized quantum\ncircuits, where the rotation angles of the gates are restricted to a narrow\nrange, ensuring that the gates remain close to Clifford gates. This design\nenables the efficient simulation of the training circuits using the Sparse\nPauli Dynamics method. As a result, CPDR is able to utilize training sets with\na better diversity to train the model, compared with previous learning-based\nQEM models that construct training sets with only Clifford or near-Clifford\ncircuits. Numerical simulations on small-scale Ising model circuits demonstrate\nthat the performance of CPDR dramatically outperforms that of existing methods\nsuch as Zero-Noise Extrapolation and learning-based Probabilistic Error\nCancellation. Furthermore, using the experimental data from IBM's 127-qubit\nEagle processor, our findings suggest that CPDR demonstrates improved accuracy\ncompared to the original mitigation results reported in [Nature 618, 500\n(2023)].",

The benchmark boosted dark matter model\nfeatures a multi-particle dark sector with a U(1)$'$ gauge boson, the dark\nphoton. The kinetic mixing of the dark photon with the Standard Model photon\nallows for a portal between the dark sector and the visible sector. The\ninelastic boosted dark matter interaction occurs when a dark matter particle\ninelastically scatters with an electron in the ICARUS detector, producing an\noutgoing, heavier dark sector state which subsequently decays back down to the\ndark matter particle, emitting a dark photon. The dark photon subsequently\ncouples to a Standard Model photon through kinetic mixing. The Standard Model\nphoton then converts to an electron-positron pair in the detector. This\ninteraction process provides a distinct experimental signature which consists\nof a recoil electron from the primary interaction and an associated\nelectron-positron pair from the secondary vertex. After analyzing 4,134\ntriggered events, the search results in zero observed events.

However, the critical current density, Jc, of present Nb3Sn conductors\ndeclines swiftly above 12-15T. State-of-the-art Ta- and Ti-doped strands\nexhibit upper critical field, Hc2, values of 24-26.5T (4.2K) and do not reach\nthe FCC target Jc, which serves as the present stretch target for Nb3Sn\ndevelopment. As recently demonstrated, to meet this goal requires enhanced\nvortex pinning but an independent and supplementary approach is to\nsignificantly enhance Hc2. In this study, we have arc-melted multiple Nb alloys\nwith added Hf, Zr, Ta and Ti and drawn them successfully into monofilament\nwires to investigate the possibilities of Hc2 enhancement through alloying.\nHc2(T) was measured for all samples in fields up to 16T and some up to 31T. We\nhave found that all alloys show good agreement with the standard Werthamer,\nHelfand, and Hohenberg (WHH) fitting procedure without the need to adjust the\nparamagnetic limitation parameter (alpha) and spin-orbit scattering parameter\n(lambda_so). The evaluation of dHc2/dT near Tc, which is proportional to the\nelectronic specific heat coefficient (gamma) and the normal state resistivity\n(rho_n), allows a better understanding of the induced disorder introduced by\nalloying in the A15 phase.

This trend underscores the need for an algorithm to extract\nkey video information efficiently. Despite significant advancements in\nhighlight detection, moment retrieval, and video summarization, current\napproaches primarily focus on selecting specific time intervals, often\noverlooking the relevance between segments and the potential for segment\narranging. In this paper, we introduce a novel task called Video Trimming (VT),\nwhich focuses on detecting wasted footage, selecting valuable segments, and\ncomposing them into a final video with a coherent story. To address this task,\nwe propose Agent-based Video Trimming (AVT), structured into three phases:\nVideo Structuring, Clip Filtering, and Story Composition. Specifically, we\nemploy a Video Captioning Agent to convert video slices into structured textual\ndescriptions, a Filtering Module to dynamically discard low-quality footage\nbased on the structured information of each clip, and a Video Arrangement Agent\nto select and compile valid clips into a coherent final narrative. For\nevaluation, we develop a Video Evaluation Agent to assess trimmed videos,\nconducting assessments in parallel with human evaluations. Additionally, we\ncurate a new benchmark dataset for video trimming using raw user videos from\nthe internet. As a result, AVT received more favorable evaluations in user\nstudies and demonstrated superior mAP and precision on the YouTube Highlights,\nTVSum, and our own dataset for the highlight detection task.

However, previous omni-models have insufficiently explored\nspeech, neglecting its integration with multi-modality. We introduce Lyra, an\nefficient MLLM that enhances multimodal abilities, including advanced\nlong-speech comprehension, sound understanding, cross-modality efficiency, and\nseamless speech interaction. To achieve efficiency and speech-centric\ncapabilities, Lyra employs three strategies: (1) leveraging existing\nopen-source large models and a proposed multi-modality LoRA to reduce training\ncosts and data requirements; (2) using a latent multi-modality regularizer and\nextractor to strengthen the relationship between speech and other modalities,\nthereby enhancing model performance; and (3) constructing a high-quality,\nextensive dataset that includes 1.5M multi-modal (language, vision, audio) data\nsamples and 12K long speech samples, enabling Lyra to handle complex long\nspeech inputs and achieve more robust omni-cognition. Compared to other\nomni-methods, Lyra achieves state-of-the-art performance on various\nvision-language, vision-speech, and speech-language benchmarks, while also\nusing fewer computational resources and less training data.",

Inference-time methods\nto boost LLM performance, such as prompting methods to invoke certain reasoning\npathways in responses, have been shown effective in past works, though they\nlargely rely on sequential queries. The ensemble method, which consists of\nmultiple constituent models running in parallel, is a promising approach to\nachieving better inference-time performance, especially given recent\ndevelopments that enabled significant speed-ups in LLM batch inference. In this\nwork, we propose a novel, training-free LLM ensemble framework where a single\nLLM model is fed an optimized, diverse set of prompts in parallel, effectively\nproducing an ensemble at inference time to achieve performance improvement in\nreasoning tasks.

Key findings include a significant enhancement in pure electric\nmode efficiency, achieving an extended full-electric range of approximately 84\nkilometers on an 80% utilization of a 20-kWh battery pack. During the WLTC\ndriving cycle, the control system reduced fuel consumption to 2.86 L/100km,\nrepresenting a 20% reduction in gasoline-equivalent fuel consumption.\nEvaluations of vehicle performance at discrete driving speeds, highlighted\neffective energy management, with the vehicle battery charging at lower speeds\nand discharging at higher speeds, showing optimized energy recovery and\nconsumption strategies. Initial battery charge levels notably influenced\nvehicle performance. A 90% initial charge enabled prolonged all-electric\noperation, minimizing fuel consumption to 2 L/100km less than that of the base\ncontrol system. Real-world driving pattern analysis revealed significant\nvariations, with shorter, slower cycles requiring lower fuel consumption due to\nprioritized electric propulsion, while longer, faster cycles increased internal\ncombustion engine usage.

Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory\nholds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and\nreveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely\ncharacterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in\nthe mean-field regime.\n  Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically\nintractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent\ninference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad\nclass of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution\ncan be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization\nerror of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates\nfor inference of the unknown signal.

    "abstract": "In this work, we extend the study of the interplay between scaling symmetries\nand statistics to one-dimensional fluids by studying the Calogero model in a\nharmonic trap modulated through time. The latter harbors an interpretation in\nterms of free particles imbued with exclusion statistics and is an example of a\nscale invariant fluid in one-dimension displaying $\\mathrm{SO(2,1)}$ dynamical\nsymmetry preserved by harmonic traps. Taking advantage of the dynamical\nsymmetry, two experimentally relevant drive protocols spanning both quasistatic\nand nonadiabatic regimes are investigated and universal signatures of the\ninteractions and exclusion statistics are uncovered in the ground-state echo\namplitude and closely related ground-state fidelity. In particular, under both\nperiodic modulation and slow drive through the gapless point of the trap\nfrequency, enhanced interactions and exclusion are shown to favor the\nproliferation of defects and to hinder their annihilation, which leads to a\nuniversal decrease of ground-state fidelities and echo amplitudes. We also show\nthat increasing exclusion sparks a sharp suppression of the likelihood of\nintermediate echoes beyond those imposed by the commensurability of a periodic\ndrive and the natural frequency of the trap.",

Uncollided particles are described using a ray tracer,\nfacilitating the inclusion of boundary conditions and straggling, whereas\ncollided particles are represented using a moment method combined with the\ndynamical low-rank approximation. Here the energy is treated as a pseudo-time\nand a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt the rank in\nenergy. We can reproduce the results of a full-rank reference code at a much\nlower rank and thus computational cost and memory usage.

Our study delves\ninto the application of cutting-edge transfer learning models for the early\ndetection of CKD. Leveraging a comprehensive and publicly available dataset, we\nmeticulously evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art models,\nincluding EfficientNetV2, InceptionNetV2, MobileNetV2, and the Vision\nTransformer (ViT) technique. Remarkably, our analysis demonstrates superior\naccuracy rates, surpassing the 90% threshold with MobileNetV2 and achieving\n91.5% accuracy with ViT. Moreover, to enhance predictive capabilities further,\nwe integrate these individual methodologies through ensemble modeling,\nresulting in our ensemble model exhibiting a remarkable 96% accuracy in the\nearly detection of CKD. This significant advancement holds immense promise for\nimproving clinical outcomes and underscores the critical role of machine\nlearning in addressing complex medical challenges.",

However, there is no first-principles theory for 1-electron-2-phonon\ninteractions, which occur in anharmonic materials with significant\nelectron-phonon interaction such as halide perovskites and quantum\nparaelectrics.

By processing the audio signal into a\nmelspectrogram, using MobileNet V2 to extract deep features, and combining it\nwith the MFCA module to weight different frequency channels in the audio\nsignal, this method can effectively capture the fine-grained frequency domain\nfeatures in the audio signal and enhance the Classification capability of fake\naudios.

    "abstract": "In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and\ncapture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of\nvariational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors\nself-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market\nconditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of\nindividual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values\nsimplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships\nand dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack\ndiversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading\nperiods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model\nbased on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which\nextracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses\nand aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and\nrepresents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks\ncluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which\nhelps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in\nfinancial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we\napply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock\ndatasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks.

However,\nthese methods either require numerous sampling steps to generate high-quality\nimages, resulting in significant computational overhead, or rely on common\nmodel distillation, which usually imposes a fixed fidelity-realism trade-off\nand thus lacks flexibility. In this paper, we introduce OFTSR, a novel\nflow-based framework for one-step image super-resolution that can produce\noutputs with tunable levels of fidelity and realism. Our approach first trains\na conditional flow-based super-resolution model to serve as a teacher model. We\nthen distill this teacher model by applying a specialized constraint.\nSpecifically, we force the predictions from our one-step student model for same\ninput to lie on the same sampling ODE trajectory of the teacher model. This\nalignment ensures that the student model's single-step predictions from initial\nstates match the teacher's predictions from a closer intermediate state.\nThrough extensive experiments on datasets including FFHQ (256$\\times$256),\nDIV2K, and ImageNet (256$\\times$256), we demonstrate that OFTSR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for one-step image super-resolution, while having\nthe ability to flexibly tune the fidelity-realism trade-off.

    "abstract": "Electron-phonon interactions in solids are crucial for understanding many\ninteresting phenomena, such as conventional superconductivity,\ntemperature-dependent band-gap renormalization, and polarons. For harmonic\nmaterials, the linear interaction of one electron with one phonon is sufficient\nto quantitatively describe these properties. However, in anharmonic materials\nsuch as quantum paraelectrics, halide perovskites, and high-pressure hydrides,\nthe nonlinear electron-phonon interactions may play an important role.\nCurrently, the only available Hamiltonians for nonlinear electron-phonon\ninteraction are model Hamiltonians, written in terms of phenomenological\nparameters. Here, we present a microscopic theory for long-range nonlinear\nelectron-phonon interactions, which can be combined with first-principles\ncalculations. We provide a semi-analytical expression for the long-range part\nof the 1-electron-2-phonon matrix element. We show that in contrast to the\nlong-range 1-electron-1-phonon interaction, the continuum approximation is not\nsufficient and the entire phonon dispersion must be taken into account.\nAdditionally, we show that the quasiparticle energies can be written in terms\nof a 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function. To demonstrate the method, we\ncalculate the 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function for LiF and KTaO$_3$ from\nfirst principles.

    "abstract": "Massive stars are key contributors to the chemodynamical evolution of\ngalaxies and the Universe. Despite their significance, discrepancies between\nobservational data and theoretical models of massive stars challenge our\nunderstanding of these objects. A major uncertainty is the overdensity of\nB-type supergiants (BSGs) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, where models\npredict the end of the main sequence phase (or TAMS). Is uncertain whether the\nTAMS needs to be redefined or if the overdensity results from overlapping\npopulations following different evolutionary paths. Conceived as direct\ndescendants of O-type stars, BSGs may include stars not only evolving in the\nmain sequence but also returning from a post-red supergiant phase. A\nrepresentative fraction of massive stars are predicted to be products of binary\ninteraction, creating additional evolutionary channels. In addition, some\nfundamental properties of BSGs such as the spin- and mass-loss rates are not as\nwell constrained as in O-type stars, having a significant impact on massive\nstar evolution. To overcome this situation, statistically significant\nspectroscopic samples offer a unique opportunity to study the physical and\nchemical properties of BSGs. Moreover, the advent of space astrometry and\nphotometry missions such as Gaia and TESS has brought a new era for studying\nadditional properties in detail. This thesis comprises the study of 1000\nGalactic blue supergiants (O- and B-type) combining multi-epoch high-resolution\nspectroscopic data from the IACOB project and the ESO archive with Gaia\ndistances and TESS photometry, becoming the largest holistic empirical study of\nthe physical, chemical, and pulsational properties of these objects performed\nto date. All these properties gathered into a unique volume-limited sample\nallowed to provide an empirical reassessment of the main properties of BSGs and\ninvestigate their intricate nature.",

This study\nidentifies two key challenges when using PINN to solve general solid mechanics\nproblems. These challenges become evident when comparing the limitations of\nPINN with the well-established numerical methods commonly used in solid\nmechanics, such as the finite element method (FEM). Specifically: a) PINN\nmodels generate solutions over an infinite domain, which conflicts with the\nfinite boundaries typical of most solid structures; and b) the solution space\nutilised by PINN is Euclidean, which is inadequate for addressing the complex\ngeometries often present in solid structures.\n  This work presents a PINN architecture for general solid mechanics problems,\nreferred to as the Finite-PINN model. The model is designed to effectively\ntackle two key challenges, while retaining as much of the original PINN\nframework as possible. To this end, the Finite-PINN incorporates finite\ngeometric encoding into the neural network inputs, thereby transforming the\nsolution space from a conventional Euclidean space into a hybrid\nEuclidean-topological space. The model is comprehensively trained using both\nstrong-form and weak-form loss formulations, enabling its application to a wide\nrange of forward and inverse problems in solid mechanics. For forward problems,\nthe Finite-PINN model efficiently approximates solutions to solid mechanics\nproblems when the geometric information of a given structure has been\npreprocessed. For inverse problems, it effectively reconstructs full-field\nsolutions from very sparse observations by embedding both physical laws and\ngeometric information within its architecture.",

However, the total stellar mass formed in the\nstarburst often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow's launch occurs in\ntwo stages. Initially, continuous SNe explosions form small bubbles, merging\ninto a super bubble foam composed of warm/hot gas and high-density cool\nfilaments.

Our simulations reveal that cool filaments within the ISM can survive\nfrom the stellar feedback, then were entrained into the outflow and stretched\nto hundreds pc in length. While the mass loading factor of the well-developed\noutflow is comparable to M82, the cool gas mass outflow rate is often lower,\nand its velocity is slower than the estimated value in M82 by $\\sim60\\%$. Warm\nand hot gas are $\\sim25\\%$ slower. SN feedback acts as the primary driver of\nthe outflow, while gas return significantly influences the starburst and\noutflow.

These indexes\nsupport both exact and approximate similarity search, with approximate search\nproviding high-quality results within milliseconds, which makes it very\nattractive for certain modern applications. Reducing the pre-processing (i.e.,\nindex building) time and improving the accuracy of search results are two major\nchallenges. DSTree and the iSAX index family are state-of-the-art solutions for\nthis problem. However, DSTree suffers from long index building times, while\niSAX suffers from low search accuracy. In this paper, we identify two problems\nof the iSAX index family that adversely affect the overall performance. First,\nwe observe the presence of a proximity-compactness trade-off related to the\nindex structure design (i.e., the node fanout degree), significantly limiting\nthe efficiency and accuracy of the resulting index. Second, a skewed data\ndistribution will negatively affect the performance of iSAX. To overcome these\nproblems, we propose Dumpy, an index that employs a novel multi-ary data\nstructure with an adaptive node splitting algorithm and an efficient building\nworkflow. Furthermore, we devise Dumpy-Fuzzy as a variant of Dumpy which\nfurther improves search accuracy by proper duplication of series. To fully\nleverage the potential of modern hardware including multicore CPUs and Solid\nState Drives (SSDs), we parallelize Dumpy to DumpyOS with sophisticated\nindexing and pruning-based querying algorithms.

The epithelial monolayer is a simple, minimal, tissue model that is\noften used to gain understanding of mechanical behavior at the cellular or\nmulti-cellular scale. Here we investigate how the elastic modulus of Madin\nDarby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells depends on their packing density. Rather than\nmeasuring elasticity at the sub-cellular scale with local probes, we\ncharacterize the monolayer at the multi-cellular scale, as one would a thin\nslab of elastic material. We use a micro-indentation system to apply gentle\nforces to the apical side of MDCK monolayers, applying a normal force to\napproximately 100 cells in each experiment. In low-density confluent\nmonolayers, we find that the elastic modulus decreases with increasing cell\ndensity. At high densities, the modulus appears to plateau. This finding will\nhelp guide our understanding of known collective behaviors in epithelial\nmonolayers and other tissues where variations in cell packing density are\ncorrelated with cell motion.",

    "abstract": "Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continually acquire\nknowledge of new classes without forgetting old ones. Despite Pre-trained\nModels (PTMs) have shown excellent performance in CIL, catastrophic forgetting\nstill occurs as the model learns new concepts. Existing work seeks to utilize\nlightweight components to adjust the PTM, while the forgetting phenomenon still\ncomes from {\\em parameter and retrieval} levels. Specifically, iterative\nupdates of the model result in parameter drift, while mistakenly retrieving\nirrelevant modules leads to the mismatch during inference. To this end, we\npropose MOdel Surgery (MOS) to rescue the model from forgetting previous\nknowledge. By training task-specific adapters, we continually adjust the PTM to\ndownstream tasks. To mitigate parameter-level forgetting, we present an adapter\nmerging approach to learn task-specific adapters, which aims to bridge the gap\nbetween different components while reserve task-specific information. Besides,\nto address retrieval-level forgetting, we introduce a training-free\nself-refined adapter retrieval mechanism during inference, which leverages the\nmodel's inherent ability for better adapter retrieval. By jointly rectifying\nthe model with those steps, MOS can robustly resist catastrophic forgetting in\nthe learning process. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets\nvalidate MOS's state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/sun-hailong/AAAI25-MOS",

First, to address the problem of large-scale\ndata requirements, the dissertation presents a novel Fairness Domain Adaptation\napproach derived from two major novel research findings of Bijective Maximum\nLikelihood and Fairness Adaptation Learning. Second, to enable the capability\nof open-world modeling of vision learning, this dissertation presents a novel\nOpen-world Fairness Continual Learning Framework. The success of this research\ndirection is the result of two research lines, i.e., Fairness Continual\nLearning and Open-world Continual Learning. Third, since visual data are often\ncaptured from multiple camera views, robust vision learning methods should be\ncapable of modeling invariant features across views. To achieve this desired\ngoal, the research in this thesis will present a novel Geometry-based\nCross-view Adaptation framework to learn robust feature representations across\nviews. Finally, with the recent increase in large-scale videos and multimodal\ndata, understanding the feature representations and improving the robustness of\nlarge-scale visual foundation models is critical. Therefore, this thesis will\npresent novel Transformer-based approaches to improve the robust feature\nrepresentations against multimodal and temporal data. Then, a novel Domain\nGeneralization Approach will be presented to improve the robustness of visual\nfoundation models. The research's theoretical analysis and experimental results\nhave shown the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, demonstrating their\nsuperior performance compared to prior studies.

This limits their accuracy, as they do not\naccount for the substantial uncertainties inherent in AECOM projects. These\nuncertainties are particularly pronounced in geotechnical design and\nconstruction.

To ensure that site-specific conditions are accurately\nreflected as additional information is obtained, the PDT leverages Bayesian\nmethods for model updating.

    "abstract": "Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are advanced sensors capable of\ndetecting individual photons and recording their arrival times with picosecond\nresolution using time-correlated Single-Photon Counting detection techniques.\nThey are used in various applications, such as LiDAR, and can capture\nhigh-speed sequences of binary single-photon images, offering great potential\nfor reconstructing 3D environments with high motion dynamics. To complement\nsingle-photon data, they are often paired with conventional passive cameras,\nwhich capture high-resolution (HR) intensity images at a lower frame rate.\nHowever, 3D reconstruction from SPAD data faces challenges. Aggregating\nmultiple binary measurements improves precision and reduces noise but can cause\nmotion blur in dynamic scenes. Additionally, SPAD arrays often have lower\nresolution than passive cameras. To address these issues, we propose a novel\ncomputational imaging algorithm to improve the 3D reconstruction of moving\nscenes from SPAD data by addressing the motion blur and increasing the native\nspatial resolution. We adopt a plug-and-play approach within an optimization\nscheme alternating between guided video super-resolution of the 3D scene, and\nprecise image realignment using optical flow. Experiments on synthetic data\nshow significantly improved image resolutions across various signal-to-noise\nratios and photon levels. We validate our method using real-world SPAD\nmeasurements on three practical situations with dynamic objects. First on\nfast-moving scenes in laboratory conditions at short range; second very low\nresolution imaging of people with a consumer-grade SPAD sensor from\nSTMicroelectronics; and finally, HR imaging of people walking outdoors in\ndaylight at a range of 325 meters under eye-safe illumination conditions using\na short-wave infrared SPAD camera. These results demonstrate the robustness and\nversatility of our approach.",

    "abstract": "The detection of water molecules within the atmosphere of Jupiter, first by\nthe Galileo Atmospheric Probe, and later by the Juno spacecraft, has given rise\nto the question of whether those molecules are sourced endogenously or\nexogenously. One hypothesis is that the ablation of meteoroids deposited the\nnecessary oxygen into the atmosphere, which was subsequently used in chemical\nprocesses to form water. This paper aims to evaluate this hypothesis by\nsimulating the ablation of carbonaceous objects entering the planet's\natmosphere to determine the possible rates of oxygen delivery and the most\nlikely altitude for such delivery within the Jovian atmosphere. We estimate\nthat carbonaceous meteoroids have the potential to deliver $\\sim 1.4 \\times\n10^7 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over a billion years. We further estimate that\nmost of the ablation is expected to occur in the stratosphere, or 450-400 km\nabove the region of 1 bar of atmospheric pressure. In comparison,\nInterplanetary Dust Particles (IDPs) are estimated to deliver roughly $\\sim\n10^2 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over the same period.",

The model comprises a symmetry-invariant quantum\nneural network and a conventional neural network and is able to provide\naccurate predictions with only a few training data points. The proposed\nprocedure is fully NISQ compatible. This is achieved by using a quantum circuit\nthat requires a number of parameters linearly proportional to the number of\nmolecular orbitals, along with a parameterized measurement observable, thereby\nreducing the number of necessary measurements. We benchmark the algorithm on\nthree different molecules with three different system sizes: $H_2$ with four\norbitals, LiH with five orbitals, and $H_4$ with six orbitals. For these\nmolecules, we predict the excited state transition energies and transition\ndipole moments.

The decay $D^0 \\rightarrow\n\\pi^+\\pi^-e^+e^-$ is observed for the first time when requiring that the two\nelectrons are consistent with coming from the decay of a $\\phi$ or\n$\\rho^0/\\omega$ meson. The corresponding branching fractions are measured\nrelative to the $D^0 \\rightarrow K^-\\pi^-[e^+e^-]_{\\rho^0/\\omega}$ decay, where\nthe two electrons are consistent with coming from the decay of a $\\rho^0$ or\n$\\omega$ meson. No evidence is found for the $D^0 \\rightarrow K^+K^-e^+e^-$\ndecay and world-best limits are set on its branching fraction. The results are\ncompared to, and found to be consistent with, the branching fractions of the\n$D^0 \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $D^0 \\rightarrow K^+K^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$\ndecays recently measured by LHCb and confirm lepton universality at the current\nprecision.",

In response, an increasing number of\nstudies from the research community aim to explore the technical foundations\nunderlying these powerful reasoning systems. Building on these prior efforts,\nthis paper presents a reproduction report on implementing o1-like reasoning\nsystems. We introduce an ``imitate, explore, and self-improve'' framework,\ndenoted as \\textbf{STILL-2}, as our primary technical approach to train the\nreasoning model. In the initial phase, we use distilled long-form thought data\nto fine-tune the reasoning model, enabling it to invoke a slow-thinking mode.\nThe model is then encouraged to explore challenging problems by generating\nmultiple rollouts, which can result in increasingly more high-quality\ntrajectories that lead to correct answers. Furthermore, the model undergoes\nself-improvement by iteratively refining its training dataset. To verify the\neffectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive experiments on three\nchallenging benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nachieves competitive performance compared to industry-level reasoning systems\non these benchmarks.",

High-dimensional analyses are typically\nassumed to be desirable, if not required, to prevent losing important\ninformation. But to what extent such high-dimensionality is really\nneeded/beneficial often remains unclear. Here we challenge such a fundamental\ngeneral problem. As a representative case of a system with internal dynamical\ncomplexity, we study atomistic molecular dynamics trajectories of liquid water\nand ice coexisting in dynamical equilibrium at the solid/liquid transition\ntemperature. To attain an intrinsically high-dimensional analysis, we use as an\nexample the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor, obtaining a\nlarge dataset containing 2.56e6 576-dimensional SOAP vectors that we analyze in\nvarious ways. Our results demonstrate how the time-series data contained in one\nsingle SOAP dimension accounting only <0.001% of the total dataset's variance\n(neglected and discarded in typical variance-based dimensionality-reduction\napproaches) allows resolving a remarkable amount of information,\nclassifying/discriminating the bulk of water and ice phases, as well as two\nsolid-interface and liquid-interface layers as four statistically distinct\ndynamical molecular environments. Adding more dimensions to this one is found\nnot only ineffective but even detrimental to the analysis due to recurrent\nnegligible-information/non-negligible-noise additions and \"frustrated\ninformation\" phenomena leading to information loss. Such effects are proven\ngeneral and are observed also in completely different systems and descriptors'\ncombinations. This shows how high-dimensional analyses are not necessarily\nbetter than low-dimensional ones to elucidate the internal complexity of\nphysical/chemical systems, especially when these are characterized by\nnon-negligible internal noise.",

    "abstract": "Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due\nto resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of\nthis information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows\nmodels to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective\nresolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not\nideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned\ncompression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality;\nthus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders\nreduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to\nsignificant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC\n(Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines\nlinear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders.\nWaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck\nbetween an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics,\nWaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion\nmodels. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent\nhigh-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB\nimages and stereo audio.

Rather than a straightforward application of SDC with mBUG,\nwe propose two aspects to improve computational efficiency.

Deep surrogate models have emerged as purely data-driven approaches\nthat learn direct mappings from simulation conditions to solutions based on\neither simulation or experimental data. Here, we consider modeling of\nincompressible flows over solid objects, wherein geometric structures are a key\nfactor in determining aerodynamics. To effectively incorporate geometries, we\npropose a message passing scheme that efficiently and expressively integrates\nthe airfoil shape with the mesh representation. Under this framework, we first\nobtain a representation of the geometry in the form of a latent graph on the\nairfoil surface. We subsequently propagate this representation to all\ncollocation points through message passing on a directed, bipartite graph. We\ndemonstrate that this framework supports efficient training by downsampling the\nsolution mesh while avoiding distribution shifts at test time when evaluated on\nthe full mesh. To enable our model to be able to distinguish between distinct\nspatial regimes of dynamics relative to the airfoil, we represent mesh points\nin both a leading edge and trailing edge coordinate system. We further enhance\nthe expressiveness of our coordinate system representations by embedding our\nhybrid Polar-Cartesian coordinates using sinusoidal and spherical harmonics\nbases.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing reasoning capabilities in\nlarge language models (LLMs) by leveraging iterative reasoning and\nfeedback-driven methodologies. Building on the limitations identified in the\nSimpleBench benchmark, a dataset designed to evaluate logical coherence and\nreal-world reasoning, we propose a multi-step prompting strategy coupled with\nglobal consistency checks to improve model accuracy and robustness. Through\ncomparative analysis of state-of-the-art models, including Claude 3 Opus,\nClaude 3.5, GPT- 4o, and o1-preview, we demonstrate that iterative reasoning\nsignificantly enhances model performance, with improvements observed in both\nstandard accuracy metrics (AVG@5) and a newly introduced metric, Extreme\nAveraging (EAG@5). Our results reveal model-specific strengths: Claude excels\nin maintaining logical consistency, while GPT-4o exhibits exploratory\ncreativity but struggles with ambiguous prompts. By analyzing case studies and\nidentifying gaps in spatial and temporal reasoning, we highlight areas for\nfurther refinement. The findings underscore the potential of structured\nreasoning frameworks to address inherent model limitations, irrespective of\npretraining methodologies. This study lays the groundwork for integrating\ndynamic feedback mechanisms, adaptive restart strategies, and diverse\nevaluation metrics to advance LLM reasoning capabilities across complex and\nmulti-domain problem spaces.",

A previous study of this alignment allowed the\nidentification of the same density enhancement (with a time scale of\n$\\sim$1.5~h), and substructures ($\\sim$20-30~min timescale), passing first by\nPSP, and then SolO after a $\\sim 138$~h propagation time in the inner\nheliosphere. We show here that this structure belongs to the large scale\nheliospheric magnetic sector boundary. In this region, the density is dominated\nby radial gradients, whereas the magnetic field reversal is consistent with\nlongitudinal gradients in the Carrington reference frame. We estimate the\ndensity structure radial size to remain of the order L$_R \\sim 10^6$~km, while\nits longitudinal and latitudinal sizes, are estimated to expand from\nL$_{\\varphi, \\theta} \\sim 10^4$-$10^5$~km in the high solar corona, to\nL$_{\\varphi, \\theta} \\sim 10^5$-$10^6$~km at PSP, and L$_{\\varphi, \\theta} \\sim\n10^6$-$10^7$~km at SolO. This implies a strong evolution of the structure's\naspect ratio during the propagation, due to the plasma's nearly spherical\nexpansion. The structure's shape is therefore inferred to evolve from elongated\nin the radial direction at $\\sim$2-3 solar radii (high corona), to sizes of\nnearly the same order in all directions at PSP, and then becoming elongated in\nthe directions transverse to the radial at SolO. Measurements are not\nconcordant with local reconnection of open solar wind field lines, so we\npropose that the structure has been generated through interchange reconnection\nnear the tip of a coronal streamer.",

The corresponding expressions of Hamiltonian density\nand single-nucleon potential are derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation\nunder general nonequilibrium conditions. The inclusion of the higher-order\nderivative terms provides additional higher-order momentum dependence for the\nsingle-nucleon potential, and in particular, we find that the N5LO\nsingle-nucleon potential with momentum dependent terms up to $p^{10}$ can give\na nice description for the empirical nucleon optical potential up to energy of\n$2$ GeV. At the same time, the density-dependent terms in the extended Skyrme\neffective interaction are extended correspondingly in the spirit of the Fermi\nmomentum expansion, which allows highly flexible variation of density behavior\nfor both the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and the symmetry\nenergy. Based on the Skyrme pseudopotential up to N3LO, N4LO and N5LO, we\nconstruct a series of interactions with the nucleon optical potential having\ndifferent high-momentum behaviors and with the symmetry potentials featuring\ndifferent linear isospin-splitting coefficients for nucleon effective mass, by\nwhich we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Furthermore,\nwithin the lattice BUU transport model, some benchmark simulations with\nselected interactions are performed for the Au+Au collisions at a beam energy\nof $1.23$ GeV/nucleon, and the predicted collective flows for protons are found\nto nicely agree with the data measured by HADES collaboration.",

The\nexperimental results indicate that UFO effectively enhances video generation\nquality and demonstrates its superiority in public video generation benchmarks.\nThe code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/UFO.",

The lowest-order constrained variational method is applied\nto calculate the thermodynamic and electrical properties of the valence\nelectrons. We examine 9900 different distributions of CeH9 molecules separately\nfor finding a second-order phase transition with maximized critical\ntemperature. The novelty of the present work is the prediction of a\nsuperconductivity transition at Tc = 198.61 K for a specific distribution of\nCeH9 molecules with applying no external pressure on the exterior surfaces of\nthe graphene sheets. Notably, this critical temperature is approximately 65 K\nhigher than that observed in cuprate materials (HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+{\\delta}), which\nare known for their high Tc values at room pressure. It is interesting that in\nthis particular case, the distribution periodicity of CeH9 molecules bears the\nclosest resemblance to the periodicity of the graphene corrugations among all\n9900 examined cases. Computing the energy gap of the valence electrons reveals\nthat this critical behavior corresponds to an unconventional superconductivity\nphase transition exhibiting a high critical current density on the order of 107\nA/cm2",

    "abstract": "Multiphase flows, characterized by the presence of particles, bubbles, or\ndroplets dispersed within a fluid, are ubiquitous in natural and industrial\nprocesses. Studying densely dispersed flows in 4D (3D + time) at very small\nscales without introducing perturbations is challenging, but crucial to\nunderstand their macroscopic behavior. The penetration power of X-rays and the\nflux provided by advanced X-ray sources, such as synchrotron-radiation\nfacilities, offer an opportunity to address this need. However, current X-ray\nmethods at these facilities require the rotation of the sample to obtain 4D\ninformation, thus disturbing the flow. Here, we demonstrate the potential of\nusing X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), a novel technique to temporally\nresolve any dense particle suspension flows in 4D, while eliminating the need\nof sample rotation. By acquiring images of a microparticle-seeded flow from\nmultiple viewing directions simultaneously, we can determine their\ninstantaneous three-dimensional positions, both when flowing in a simple liquid\nand a highly dense and opaque complex fluid (e.g. blood). Along with the recent\nprogress in AI-supported 4D reconstruction from sparse projections, this\napproach creates new opportunities for high-speed rotation-free 4D\nmicrotomography, opening a new spatiotemporal frontier. With XMPI, it is now\nfeasible to track the movement of individual microparticles within dense\nsuspensions, extending even to the chaotic realms of turbulent flows.",

Although solar\ndynamo theories have progressively become more sophisticated, the details as to\nhow the dynamo sustains magnetic fields are still subject of research.\nObserving the magnetic fields of Sun-like stars are useful to contextualise the\nsolar dynamo. The BCool survey studies the evolution of surface magnetic fields\nto understand how dynamo-generated processes are influenced by key ingredients,\nlike mass and rotation. Here, we focus on six Sun-like stars with mass between\n1.02 and 1.06 MSun and with 3.5-21 d rotation period. We analysed\nhigh-resolution spectropolarimetric data collected with ESPaDOnS, Narval and\nNeo-Narval. We measured the longitudinal magnetic field from least-squares\ndeconvolution line profiles and inspected its long-term behaviour with a\nLomb-Scargle periodogram and a Gaussian process. We applied Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging to reconstruct the large-scale magnetic field geometry at the stellar\nsurface for different epochs. Two stars, namely HD 9986 and HD 56124 (Prot ~ 20\nd) exhibit repeating polarity reversals of the radial or toroidal field\ncomponent on time scales of 5 to 6 yr. HD 73350 (Prot = 12 d) has one polarity\nreversal of the toroidal component and HD 76151 (Prot=17 d) may have short-term\nevolution (2.5 yr) modulated by the long-term (16 yr) chromospheric cycle. HD\n166435 and HD 175726 (Prot =3-5 d), manifest complex magnetic fields without\ncyclic evolution. Our findings indicate the potential dependence of the\nmagnetic cycles nature with stellar rotation period. For the two stars with\nlikely cycles, the polarity reversal time scale seems to decrease with\ndecreasing rotation period or Rossby number. These results represent important\nobservational constraints for dynamo models of solar-like stars.",

    "abstract": "We study a class of prediction problems in which relatively few observations\nhave associated responses, but all observations include both standard\ncovariates as well as additional \"helper\" covariates. While the end goal is to\nmake high-quality predictions using only the standard covariates, helper\ncovariates can be exploited during training to improve prediction. Helper\ncovariates arise in many applications, including forecasting in time series;\nincorporation of biased or mis-calibrated predictions from foundation models;\nand sharing information in transfer learning. We propose \"prediction aided by\nsurrogate training\" ($\\texttt{PAST}$), a class of methods that exploit labeled\ndata to construct a response estimator based on both the standard and helper\ncovariates; and then use the full dataset with pseudo-responses to train a\npredictor based only on standard covariates. We establish guarantees on the\nprediction error of this procedure, with the response estimator allowed to be\nconstructed in an arbitrary way, and the final predictor fit by empirical risk\nminimization over an arbitrary function class. These upper bounds involve the\nrisk associated with the oracle data set (all responses available), plus an\noverhead that measures the accuracy of the pseudo-responses. This theory\ncharacterizes both regimes in which $\\texttt{PAST}$ accuracy is comparable to\nthe oracle accuracy, as well as more challenging regimes where it behaves\npoorly. We demonstrate its empirical performance across a range of\napplications, including forecasting of societal ills over time with future\ncovariates as helpers; prediction of cardiovascular risk after heart attacks\nwith prescription data as helpers; and diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-rays\nusing machine-generated predictions as helpers.",

Thereby, we develop the GUI agent model\nFalcon-UI, which is initially pretrained on Insight-UI Dataset and subsequently\nfine-tuned on Android and Web GUI datasets, including AITW, AITZ, Android\nControl, and Mind2Web. With 7 billion parameters, Falcon-UI achieves accuracy\ncomparable to the 72 billion-parameter Qwen2VL on AITZ, validating the\nalignment between GUI context comprehension and agent performance.

The magnetar model well regenerates the\nbolometric light curves of all the SESNe in the sample and constrains numerous\nphysical parameters, including magnetar's initial spin period ($P_\\textrm{i}$)\nand magnetic field ($B$), explosion energy of supernova ($E_\\textrm{exp}$),\nprogenitor radius ($R_\\textrm{p}$), etc. Within the sample, the superluminous\nSNe 2010kd and 2020ank exhibit the lowest $B$ and $P_\\textrm{i}$ values, while\nthe relativistic Ic broad-line SN 2012ap shows the highest values for both\nparameters. The explosion energy for all SESNe in the sample (except SN\n2019cad), exceeding $\\gtrsim$2 $\\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg, indicates there is a\npossibility of a jittering jet explosion mechanism driving these events.\nAdditionally, a correlation analysis identifies linear dependencies among\nparameters derived from light curve analysis, revealing positive correlations\nbetween rise and decay times, $P_\\textrm{i}$ and $B$, $P_\\textrm{i}$ and\n$R_\\textrm{p}$, and $E_\\textrm{exp}$ and $R_\\textrm{p}$, as well as strong\nanti-correlations of $P_\\textrm{i}$ and $B$ with the peak luminosity.

In this paper, we model the dependency\nrelations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM),\nbuilt using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM\nvisual encoder.

Due to the limited control signals provided by\nsparse guidance (e.g., skeleton pose), recent works have attempted to introduce\nadditional dense conditions (e.g., depth map) to ensure motion alignment.\nHowever, such strict dense guidance impairs the quality of the generated video\nwhen the body shape of the reference character differs significantly from that\nof the driving video. In this paper, we present DisPose to mine more\ngeneralizable and effective control signals without additional dense input,\nwhich disentangles the sparse skeleton pose in human image animation into\nmotion field guidance and keypoint correspondence. Specifically, we generate a\ndense motion field from a sparse motion field and the reference image, which\nprovides region-level dense guidance while maintaining the generalization of\nthe sparse pose control. We also extract diffusion features corresponding to\npose keypoints from the reference image, and then these point features are\ntransferred to the target pose to provide distinct identity information. To\nseamlessly integrate into existing models, we propose a plug-and-play hybrid\nControlNet that improves the quality and consistency of generated videos while\nfreezing the existing model parameters.

    "abstract": "Human cultural complexity did not arise in a vacuum. Scholars in the\nhumanities and social sciences have long debated how ecological factors, such\nas climate and resource availability, enabled early hunter-gatherers to\nallocate time and energy beyond basic subsistence tasks. This paper presents a\nformal, interdisciplinary approach that integrates theoretical modeling with\ncomputational methods to examine whether conditions that allow lower spoilage\nof stored food, often associated with colder climates and abundant large fauna,\ncould indirectly foster the emergence of cultural complexity. Our contribution\nis twofold. First, we propose a mathematical framework that relates spoilage\nrates, yield levels, resource management skills, and cultural activities. Under\nthis framework, we prove that lower spoilage and adequate yields reduce the\nfrequency of hunting, thus freeing substantial time for cultural pursuits.\nSecond, we implement a reinforcement learning simulation, inspired by\nengineering optimization techniques, to validate the theoretical predictions.\nBy training agents in different $(Y,p)$ environments, where $Y$ is yield and\n$p$ is the probability of daily spoilage, we observe patterns consistent with\nthe theoretical model: stable conditions with lower spoilage strongly correlate\nwith increased cultural complexity. While we do not claim to replicate\nprehistoric social realities directly, our results suggest that ecologically\nstable niches provided a milieu in which cultural forms could germinate and\nevolve. This study, therefore, offers an integrative perspective that unites\nhumanistic inquiries into the origins of culture with the formal rigor and\nexploratory power of computational modeling.",

The sceptical\np-value was recently presented as an alternative method for the statistical\nassessment of the replicability of study results. Methods: We review the\nstatistical properties of the sceptical p-value and compare those to the\ntwo-trials rule. We extend the methodology to non-inferiority trials and\ndescribe how to invert the sceptical p-value to obtain confidence intervals. We\nillustrate the performance of the different methods using real-world evidence\nemulations of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) conducted within the RCT\nDUPLICATE initiative. Results: The sceptical p-value depends not only on the\ntwo p-values, but also on sample size and effect size of the two studies. It\ncan be calibrated to have the same Type-I error rate as the two-trials rule,\nbut has larger power to detect an existing effect. In the application to the\nresults from the RCT DUPLICATE initiative, the sceptical p- value leads to\nqualitatively similar results than the two-trials rule, but tends to show more\nevidence for treatment effects compared to the two-trials rule.

Physics-driven (PD) network models have gained\nprominence for this task by integrating data-consistency mechanisms with\nlearned priors, enabling improved performance over purely data-driven\napproaches. However, reconstruction quality still hinges on the network's\nability to disentangle artifacts from true anatomical signals-both of which\nexhibit complex, multi-scale contextual structure. Convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) capture local correlations but often struggle with non-local\ndependencies. While transformers aim to alleviate this limitation, practical\nimplementations involve design compromises to reduce computational cost by\nbalancing local and non-local sensitivity, occasionally resulting in\nperformance comparable to CNNs. To address these challenges, we propose\nMambaRoll, a novel physics-driven autoregressive state space model (SSM) for\nhigh-fidelity and efficient image reconstruction. MambaRoll employs an unrolled\narchitecture where each cascade autoregressively predicts finer-scale feature\nmaps conditioned on coarser-scale representations, enabling consistent\nmulti-scale context propagation. Each stage is built on a hierarchy of\nscale-specific PD-SSM modules that capture spatial dependencies while enforcing\ndata consistency through residual correction. To further improve scale-aware\nlearning, we introduce a Deep Multi-Scale Decoding (DMSD) loss, which provides\nsupervision at intermediate spatial scales in alignment with the autoregressive\ndesign. Demonstrations on accelerated MRI and sparse-view CT reconstructions\nshow that MambaRoll consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-,\ntransformer-, and SSM-based methods.",

In this study, we propose a\ncomputer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for knee osteoporosis, combining transfer\nlearning with stacked feature enhancement deep learning blocks. Initially, knee\nX-ray images are preprocessed, and features are extracted using a pre-trained\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN).

MaxPooling layers down-sample the features,\nretaining the most important spatial information. This sequential processing\nenables the model to capture complex, high-level features related to bone\nstructure, joint deformation, and osteoporotic markers. The enhanced features\nare passed through a classification module to differentiate between healthy and\nosteoporotic knee conditions.

This approach neglects the\ninherent continuous sequential nature of time series, leading to a fundamental\nmisalignment between diffusion mechanisms and the TSF objective, thereby\nseverely impairing performance. To bridge this misalignment, and inspired by\nthe classic Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) theory, which views time\nseries as continuous sequential progressions evolving from previous data\npoints, we propose a novel Auto-Regressive Moving Diffusion (ARMD) model to\nfirst achieve the continuous sequential diffusion-based TSF. Unlike previous\nmethods that start from white Gaussian noise, our model employs chain-based\ndiffusion with priors, accurately modeling the evolution of time series and\nleveraging intermediate state information to improve forecasting accuracy and\nstability. Specifically, our approach reinterprets the diffusion process by\nconsidering future series as the initial state and historical series as the\nfinal state, with intermediate series generated using a sliding-based technique\nduring the forward process. This design aligns the diffusion model's sampling\nprocedure with the forecasting objective, resulting in an unconditional,\ncontinuous sequential diffusion TSF model.

Accompanying\nthe results is an R program that offers the bias correction tool.\n  The second topic is a multivariate model for trait evolution which is based\non an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type stochastic process, often used for studying trait\nadaptation, co-evolution, allometry or trade-offs. Alongside the description of\nthe model and presentation of its most important features we present an R\nprogram estimating the model's parameters. To the best of our knowledge our\nprogram is the first program that allows for nearly all combinations of key\nmodel parameters providing the biologist with a flexible tool for studying\nmultiple interacting traits in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck framework. There are\nnumerous packages available that include the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process but\ntheir multivariate capabilities seem limited.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in image restoration increasingly employ conditional\nlatent diffusion models (CLDMs). While these models have demonstrated notable\nperformance improvements in recent years, this work questions their suitability\nfor IR tasks. CLDMs excel in capturing high-level semantic correlations, making\nthem effective for tasks like text-to-image generation with spatial\nconditioning. However, in IR, where the goal is to enhance image perceptual\nquality, these models face difficulty of modeling the relationship between\ndegraded images and ground truth images using a low-level representation. To\nsupport our claims, we compare state-of-the-art CLDMs with traditional image\nrestoration models through extensive experiments. Results reveal that despite\nthe scaling advantages of CLDMs, they suffer from high distortion and semantic\ndeviation, especially in cases with minimal degradation, where traditional\nmethods outperform them. Additionally, we perform empirical studies to examine\nthe impact of various CLDM design elements on their restoration performance. We\nhope this finding inspires a reexamination of current CLDM-based IR solutions,\nopening up more opportunities in this field.",

    "abstract": "The advent of stereoscopic videos has opened new horizons in multimedia,\nparticularly in extended reality (XR) and virtual reality (VR) applications,\nwhere immersive content captivates audiences across various platforms. Despite\nits growing popularity, producing stereoscopic videos remains challenging due\nto the technical complexities involved in generating stereo parallax. This\nrefers to the positional differences of objects viewed from two distinct\nperspectives and is crucial for creating depth perception. This complex process\nposes significant challenges for creators aiming to deliver convincing and\nengaging presentations. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the\nText-driven Stereoscopic Video Generation (T-SVG) system. This innovative,\nmodel-agnostic, zero-shot approach streamlines video generation by using text\nprompts to create reference videos. These videos are transformed into 3D point\ncloud sequences, which are rendered from two perspectives with subtle parallax\ndifferences, achieving a natural stereoscopic effect. T-SVG represents a\nsignificant advancement in stereoscopic content creation by integrating\nstate-of-the-art, training-free techniques in text-to-video generation, depth\nestimation, and video inpainting. Its flexible architecture ensures high\nefficiency and user-friendliness, allowing seamless updates with newer models\nwithout retraining. By simplifying the production pipeline, T-SVG makes\nstereoscopic video generation accessible to a broader audience, demonstrating\nits potential to revolutionize the field.",

Analyzing a smooth approximation of the model, we show that the\nlearning dynamics exhibit steady-states corresponding to smooth Valuation\nEquilibria (Jehiel and Samet, 2007). We demonstrate the existence of multiple\nequilibria in decision trees with generic payoffs and establish the local\nasymptotic stability of pure equilibria when they occur.

Additionally, we\ndesign an MSF module to integrate the different frequency features decoupled by\nthe FAM module, and further mitigate the impact of inter-domain variance on the\nmodel's segmentation performance.

Over the years, researchers\nproposed many algorithms to aid neural network understanding and provide\nadditional information to the human expert. One of the most popular methods\nbeing Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). This method assigns local\nrelevance based on the pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers.

Numerous metrics have been proposed,\neach assessing an individual property of attribution methods such as\nfaithfulness, robustness or localization. Unfortunately, no single metric is\ndeemed optimal for every case, and researchers often use several metrics to\ntest the quality of the attribution maps.

The source function has been almost\nalways assumed to be Gaussian, but lately it is experimentally found that\nL\\'evy-stable distributions provide a much more acceptable description. This\npaper focuses on the source shape that is reconstructed in a femtoscopic\nmeasurement, in particular, the event-by-event geometry as well as the\ndeviation from spherical symmetry of the source in the EPOS simulation. Such an\ninvestigation tests some scenarios of the appearance of non-Gaussian source\nfunctions. We find that in such a realistic simulation, non-Gaussian sources\nindeed appear, even in a three-dimensional setting and without event averaging.\nHowever, our reconstructed L\\'evy exponent (responsible for the long-range\nbehavior of the source) is systematically larger than that observed in\nexperiment; a discrepancy that might hint at further significance of this\nexponent.",

    "abstract": "Continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) has recently emerged to adapt a\npre-trained source model to continuously evolving target distributions, which\naccommodates the dynamic nature of real-world environments. To mitigate the\nrisk of catastrophic forgetting in CTTA, existing methods typically incorporate\nexplicit regularization terms to constrain the variation of model parameters.\nHowever, they cannot fundamentally resolve catastrophic forgetting because they\nrely on a single shared model to adapt across all target domains, which\ninevitably leads to severe inter-domain interference. In this paper, we\nintroduce learnable domain-specific prompts that guide the model to adapt to\ncorresponding target domains, thereby partially disentangling the parameter\nspace of different domains. In the absence of domain identity for target\nsamples, we propose a novel dynamic Prompt AllocatIon aNd Tuning (PAINT)\nmethod, which utilizes a query mechanism to dynamically determine whether the\ncurrent samples come from a known domain or an unexplored one. For known\ndomains, the corresponding domain-specific prompt is directly selected, while\nfor previously unseen domains, a new prompt is allocated. Prompt tuning is\nsubsequently performed using mutual information maximization along with\nstructural regularization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our PAINT method for CTTA. We have released\nour code at https://github.com/Cadezzyr/PAINT.",

During this period,\n2-5 cm and potentially as large as $\\sim$8 cm diameter hail was reported over\nthese locations of Bulacan. For this purpose, the combination of HIMAWARI-8\nAHI, PLDN and its flash counts, and meteorological indices; synoptic,\nthermodynamic, and kinematic indices, calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis are\nutilized to understand the nature of the hail event. In the morning, the\npre-convective environment was comprised by a warm inversion layer that\ninhibited storm initiation, until the arrival of ample moisture and convective\nheating in the afternoon. By the afternoon, model sounding analysis revealed\nthat the environment transitioned into uncapped profile with steep low-level\nlapse rate owing to warm, moist south-westerly wind flow from the Manila Bay in\nthe lower troposphere and north-easterlies aloft crossing the SMMR induced by a\nweak low-pressure system located in the eastern Philippine Sea, with minimal\nturning on the wind profile. This promoted low-level convergence within the\narea of interest and build up of instability. The updraft associated with\nconvectively unstable atmosphere, sufficient cloud-layer bulk shear, and storm\nnudging at its maturing phase countered entrainment-driven dilution and aided\nthe growth of ice crystals by rapid collection of supercooled cloud liquid\nparticles, which ultimately led to formation of hailstones.",

This model incorporates\nreal-world constraints like vehicle capacity, fuel demands at each station, and\nroad network distances. The paper outlines the design of SA-based CVRP model\nfor fuel delivery. We detail the objective function (minimizing distance) and\nthe SA's exploration mechanism for generating candidate solutions. To assess\nits effectiveness, the proposed approach undergoes computational tests in\nPoland's gas station network serviced by the Samat transportation company. We\ncompare the performance of our SA-based CVRP model with the conventional Mixed\nInteger Programming model for CVRP powered by Gurobi. The results aim to\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SA-based heuristic in finding\nefficient routes for fuel deliveries.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes small and efficient machine learning models (TinyML) for\nresource-constrained edge devices, specifically for on-device indoor\nlocalisation. Typical approaches for indoor localisation rely on centralised\nremote processing of data transmitted from lower powered devices such as\nwearables. However, there are several benefits for moving this to the edge\ndevice itself, including increased battery life, enhanced privacy, reduced\nlatency and lowered operational costs, all of which are key for common\napplications such as health monitoring. The work focuses on model compression\ntechniques, including quantization and knowledge distillation, to significantly\nreduce the model size while maintaining high predictive performance. We base\nour work on a large state-of-the-art transformer-based model and seek to deploy\nit within low-power MCUs. We also propose a state-space-based architecture\nusing Mamba as a more compact alternative to the transformer. Our results show\nthat the quantized transformer model performs well within a 64 KB RAM\nconstraint, achieving an effective balance between model size and localisation\nprecision. Additionally, the compact Mamba model has strong performance under\neven tighter constraints, such as a 32 KB of RAM, without the need for model\ncompression, making it a viable option for more resource-limited environments.\nWe demonstrate that, through our framework, it is feasible to deploy advanced\nindoor localisation models onto low-power MCUs with restricted memory\nlimitations. The application of these TinyML models in healthcare has the\npotential to revolutionize patient monitoring by providing accurate, real-time\nlocation data while minimizing power consumption, increasing data privacy,\nimproving latency and reducing infrastructure costs.",

    "abstract": "We consider laminar forced convection in a shrouded longitudinal-fin heat\nsink (LFHS) with tip clearance, as described by the pioneering study of\nSparrow, Baliga and Patankar [1978, J. Heat Trans, 100(4)]. The base of the\nLFHS is isothermal but the fins, while thin, are not isothermal, i.e., the\nconjugate heat transfer problem is of interest. Whereas Sparrow et al. solved\nthe fully developed flow and thermal problems numerically for a range of\ngeometries and fin conductivities, we consider here the physically realistic\nasymptotic limit where the fins are closely spaced, i.e. the spacing is small\nrelative to their height and the clearance above them. The flow problem in this\nlimit was considered by Miyoshi et al. [2024, J. Fluid Mech, 991, A2], and here\nwe consider the corresponding thermal problem. Using matched asymptotic\nexpansions, we find explicit solutions for the temperature field (in both the\nfluid and fins) and conjugate Nusselt numbers (local and average). The\nstructure of the asymptotic solutions provides insight into the results of\nSparrow et al.: the flow is highest in the gap above the fins, hence heat\ntransfer predominantly occurs close to the fin tips. The new formulas are\ncompared to numerical solutions and are found to be accurate for practical\nLFHSs. Significantly, existing analytical results for ducts are for boundaries\nthat are either wholly isothermal, wholly isoflux or with one of these\nconditions on each wall. Consequently, this study provides the first analytical\nresults for conjugate Nusselt numbers for flow through ducts.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved\nnotable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an\nintelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs\npredominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to\ntextual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility\nof usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large\nlanguage model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses\npixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering\n(VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form\nshapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmulti-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases\nfor a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed\nby fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask\nlearning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to\nthat of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we\nintroduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA),\nwhich comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question\nanswering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that\nMedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual\nlanguage tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel\ngrounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of\n19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric.

The first region, the \"linear-like mode,\" emerges from\nthe nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area\nof the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized \"bullet mode,\"\nexhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a\ndecrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental\ndata obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO,\nand the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.",

The parametric dependence of the\nprocess on the plasma $\\beta$ and the background magnetic shear is studied, and\nthe process is broken down at a fundamental level, allowing to clearly identify\nits causes and dynamics. The formation of magnetic-island-like structures at\nthe spatial scale of the unstable modes is observed quite early in the\nnon-linear phase of the simulation for most cases studied, as the unstable\nmodes change their structure from interchange-like to tearing-like. This is\nfollowed by a slow coalescence process that evolves these magnetic structures\ntowards larger and larger scales, adding to the large-scale tearing-like modes\nthat already form by direct coupling of neighbouring unstable modes, but remain\nsub-dominant without the contribution from the smaller scales through\ncoalescence. The presence of the cubic non-linearities retained in the model is\nessential in the dynamics of this process. The zonal fields are key actors of\nthe overall process, acting as mediators between the competitive mechanisms\nfrom which Turbulence Driven Magnetic Islands can develop. The zonal current is\nfound to slow down the formation of large-scale magnetic islands, acting as an\ninhibitor, while the zonal flow is needed to allow the system to transfer\nenergy to the larger scales, acting as a catalyst for the island formation\nprocess.",

We investigated the irradiation of\nmethanol ice particles as they migrate through the protosolar nebula.

However, such high-dimensional\nstates are vulnerable to disruption by complex disordered media, presenting\nsignificant challenges in practical applications. Spatially-entangled photons\nare conventionally generated using a nonlinear crystal via spontaneous\nparametric down conversion (SPDC). While the effect of disorder on spatially\nentangled photons in the near field of the crystal is well understood, the\nimpact of disorder in the far field is more complex. In this work, we present a\nsystematic study of the randomization of two-photon correlations caused by\narbitrary phase distortions in the far field by breaking it down into odd and\neven parity components. First, we theoretically show that the two-photon field\nis only sensitive to the even-parity part of the phase distortion. In follow-up\nexperiments, we employ a deformable mirror to implement random phase\ndistortions, separating the contributions of odd and even parity phases using\nZernike polynomials. The experimental results are in agreements with the\ntheoretical predictions. Subsequently, we perform numerical simulations to show\nthat these results extend to stronger degrees of disorder. Our key finding is\nthat, since two-photon correlations are only affected by the even-parity\ncomponent of phase modulations, the number of independent adaptive optics\nelements required for optimizing the correlation can be effectively halved,\noffering a significant practical advantage in managing disorder in quantum\nsystems.",

The laser-target\ninteraction was characterized, as well as emissions of energetic ions, X-ray\nand neutrons recorded, all showing good laser-to-target coupling efficiency.\nMoreover, we demonstrated the simultaneous fielding of F1 with the auxiliary\n0.5 PW F2 beam of Apollon, enabling dual beam operation. The present\ncommissioning will be followed in 2025 by a further commissioning stage of F1\nat the 8 PW level, en route to the final 10 PW goal.",

A key parameter for\npredicting these relics is the bubble wall velocity, whose computation relies\non solving the Boltzmann equations of the various species along the bubble\nprofile.

In this work we solve this issue by including\nthe spatial dependence of the background into the fluid Ansatz.

We recalculate the different contributions to the\ncounter-pressure of the plasma on the expanding wall, and discuss their\nrelative importance. The Standard Model with a low cutoff is chosen as\nbenchmark model and the results are shown for different values of the cutoff\nscale $\\Lambda$.

To treat such a\nsystem one needs to incorporate the memory effects to the Langevin equation.\nThe resulting equation formulated by Kubo, known as the Generalized Langevin\nequation (GLE), has been instrumental to describe the transport of particles in\ninhomogeneous or viscoelastic environments.

However, subradiance holds significant potential\nas valuable quantum resources that exploit long-lived and large-scale\nentanglement, which is a key for advancing quantum information technologies.\nHere, we demonstrate a long-lived subradiant state among multiple quantum\nemitters coupled to a directional low Q cavity. In a tailored photonic\nenvironment with balanced cavity dissipation, emitter-field coupling strength,\nand incoherent pumping, two coupled quantum dots exhibit a steady-state\npopulation in a subradiant state with highly negative cooperativity. As an\nimportant hallmark of a subradiant state, the system shows large photon\nbunching (g^((2))(0)>>2) and suppressed single-photon decay. In addition,\ncontrolling the excitation wavelength provides a useful tool for manipulating\ndephasing and the number of coupled emitters, which leads to significant\nchanges in photon statistics. Our approach to inducing cavity-mediated\nsubradiance paves the way for creating and harnessing quantum correlations in\nquantum emitters via a long-lived entangled quantum state, essential for\nquantum storage and metrology.",

Current work primarily applies supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) to adapt the model for recommendation tasks.

To\naddress this, researchers recently introduced Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO), which explicitly aligns LLMs with user preferences using offline\npreference ranking data. However, we found that DPO inherently biases the model\ntowards a few items, exacerbating the filter bubble issue and ultimately\ndegrading user experience.\n  In this paper, we propose SPRec, a novel self-play framework designed to\nmitigate over-recommendation and improve fairness without requiring additional\ndata or manual intervention. In each self-play iteration, the model undergoes\nan SFT step followed by a DPO step, treating offline interaction data as\npositive samples and the predicted outputs from the previous iteration as\nnegative samples. This effectively re-weights the DPO loss function using the\nmodel's logits, adaptively suppressing biased items.

The framework employs a\ndata-driven pipeline based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma and conformal\nprediction for application in building climate control. The proposed DAD-DPC\nframework was validated through four building cases using the high-fidelity\nBOPTEST simulation platform and an occupied campus building, Polydome. DAD-DPC\nsuccessfully regulated the average comfort violations to meet pre-defined\nbounds. Notably, the 5%-violation DAD-DPC setup achieved\n30.1%/11.2%/27.1%/20.5% energy savings compared to default controllers across\nfour cases. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in\nbalancing energy consumption and comfort violations, offering a practical\nsolution for building climate control applications.",

Recently, large language models (LLMs)-based AI agents\nhave made significant progress, enabling them to achieve human-like\nintelligence across various tasks. However, real human societies are often\ndynamic and complex, involving numerous individuals engaging in multimodal\ninteractions. In this paper, taking e-commerce scenarios as an example, we\npresent LMAgent, a very large-scale and multimodal agents society based on\nmultimodal LLMs. In LMAgent, besides freely chatting with friends, the agents\ncan autonomously browse, purchase, and review products, even perform live\nstreaming e-commerce. To simulate this complex system, we introduce a\nself-consistency prompting mechanism to augment agents' multimodal\ncapabilities, resulting in significantly improved decision-making performance\nover the existing multi-agent system. Moreover, we propose a fast memory\nmechanism combined with the small-world model to enhance system efficiency,\nwhich supports more than 10,000 agent simulations in a society. Experiments on\nagents' behavior show that these agents achieve comparable performance to\nhumans in behavioral indicators. Furthermore, compared with the existing\nLLMs-based multi-agent system, more different and valuable phenomena are\nexhibited, such as herd behavior, which demonstrates the potential of LMAgent\nin credible large-scale social behavior simulations.",

One common\napproach involves two steps: first, an inference step that estimates\nconditional average treatment effects (CATEs), and second, an optimization step\nthat ranks entities based on their CATE values and assigns treatment to the top\nk within a given budget. While uplift modeling typically focuses on binary\ntreatments, many real-world applications are characterized by continuous-valued\ntreatments, i.e., a treatment dose. This paper presents a predict-then-optimize\nframework to allow for continuous treatments in uplift modeling. First, in the\ninference step, conditional average dose responses (CADRs) are estimated from\ndata using causal machine learning techniques. Second, in the optimization\nstep, we frame the assignment task of continuous treatments as a\ndose-allocation problem and solve it using integer linear programming (ILP).\nThis approach allows decision-makers to efficiently and effectively allocate\ntreatment doses while balancing resource availability, with the possibility of\nadding extra constraints like fairness considerations or adapting the objective\nfunction to take into account instance-dependent costs and benefits to maximize\nutility. The experiments compare several CADR estimators and illustrate the\ntrade-offs between policy value and fairness, as well as the impact of an\nadapted objective function.

Specifically considering the linear form\n$f\\left(R,T_{ab}T^{ab}\\right)=R+\\gamma T_{ab}T^{ab}$, we demonstrate the\nexistence of numerous wormhole solutions, wherein the matter fields satisfy all\nenergy conditions, these being the null, weak, strong, and dominant energy\nconditions. Remarkably, these solutions do not require fine-tuning of the free\nparameters inherent to the model. Given the complicated nature of the field\nequations, we develop an analytical recursive algorithm to derive these\nsolutions. One limitation is that these solutions lack natural localization,\nnecessitating then a matching with an external vacuum spacetime. To address\nthis, we derive the junction conditions for the theory, establishing that any\nmatching between two spacetimes must be smooth, i.e. without the presence of\nthin-shells at the boundary. Ultimately, applying these junction conditions\nallows us to match the interior wormhole spacetime with an exterior vacuum\ndescribed by the Schwarzschild solution.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nnovel paradigm that models and rehearses the distribution of the old domains to\nenhance knowledge consolidation during the new data learning, possessing a\nstrong anti-forgetting capacity without storing any exemplars. Specifically, we\nintroduce an exemplar-free LReID method called Distribution Rehearsing via\nAdaptive Style Kernel Learning (DASK).

Establishing interoperability among various systems and\napplications is crucial, with the European Interoperability Framework (EIF)\nemphasizing the need for patient-centric access and control of healthcare data.\nIn this paper, we propose an integrated ontological model, the Common Semantic\nData Model for Social Determinants of Health (CSSDH), by combining ISO/DIS\n13940:2024 ContSys with WHO Social Determinants of Health. CSSDH aims to\nachieve interoperability within the Continuity of Care Network.",

We propose and analyze a quantum approximation algorithm which we\ncall the Hamiltonian Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (HamQAOA),\nwhich builds on the well-known scheme for combinatorial optimization and is\nsuitable for implementations on near-term hardware. We establish rigorous\nperformance guarantees of the HamQAOA for QMC on high-girth regular graphs, and\nour result provides bounds on the ground energy density for quantum Heisenberg\nspin glasses in the infinite size limit that improve with depth. Furthermore,\nwe develop heuristic strategies with which to efficiently obtain good HamQAOA\nparameters. Through numerical simulations, we show that the HamQAOA empirically\noutperforms prior algorithms on a wide variety of QMC instances. In particular,\nour results indicate that the linear-depth HamQAOA can deterministically\nprepare exact ground states of 1-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin\nchains described by the Bethe ansatz, in contrast to the exponential depths\nrequired in previous protocols for preparing Bethe states.",

Furthermore, these methods primarily concentrate on learning a global\nrepresentation for recognition and retrieval tasks, while overlooking the rich\nand detailed local representations that are crucial for dense prediction tasks.\nTo alleviate these issues, we introduce a Unified Skeleton-based Dense\nRepresentation Learning framework based on feature decorrelation, called USDRL,\nwhich employs feature decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance\ndomains in a multi-grained manner to reduce redundancy among dimensions of the\nrepresentations to maximize information extraction from features.

In\nthe Manakov model the correlated pulse pairs can be generated using splitting\nof a second-order soliton and inelastic collision of two fundamental solitons.\nThe interpulse correlations depends on the modulation period of the fiber\ndispersion. In the model of the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations the\ncorrelated pulse pair can be produced using pulse splitting due to polarization\nmode dispersion. The pulses have orthogonal polarization states. This allows\nthe pulses to be separated into two different channels using a polarization\nbeam splitter.

Next, it is shown\nthat the result can be used to rewrite the SVD of a matrix inner product\n$\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}$, utilizing the eigenstructures of $\\mathbf{X}$ and\n$\\mathbf{Y}$. Finally, it is shown how this can be generalized to express the\nSVD of a sum of arbitrary matrices $\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{G}$ in\nterms of the SVDs of the summands.

To address this issue, we\npropose a novel TAL method with Cross Layer Task Decoupling and Refinement\n(CLTDR).

Previous\nwork proposes classifying images based on manually defined rules or ground\ntruth labels for viewpoints, followed by descriptor training based on the\nclassification results. However, not all datasets have ground truth labels of\nviewpoints and manually defined rules may be suboptimal, leading to degraded\ndescriptor performance.To address these challenges, we introduce the mutual\nlearning of viewpoint self-classification and VPR.

The dataset is\npartitioned in an unsupervised manner while simultaneously training a\ndescriptor extractor for place recognition.

A plain reverse process requires no\nadditional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times\nfaster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models,\nreducing computational burdens in training as well. Experiments demonstrated\nthat RAD provides state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, on the FFHQ, LSUN Bedroom, and ImageNet datasets.",

    "abstract": "Class imbalance would lead to biased classifiers that favor the majority\nclass and disadvantage the minority class. Unfortunately, from a practical\nperspective, the minority class is of importance in many real-life\napplications. Hybrid sampling methods address this by oversampling the minority\nclass to increase the number of its instances, followed by undersampling to\nremove low-quality instances. However, most existing sampling methods face\ndifficulties in generating diverse high-quality instances and often fail to\nremove noise or low-quality instances on a larger scale effectively. This paper\ntherefore proposes an evolutionary multi-granularity hybrid sampling method,\ncalled EvoSampling. During the oversampling process, genetic programming (GP)\nis used with multi-task learning to effectively and efficiently generate\ndiverse high-quality instances. During the undersampling process, we develop a\ngranular ball-based undersampling method that removes noise in a multi-granular\nfashion, thereby enhancing data quality. Experiments on 20 imbalanced datasets\ndemonstrate that EvoSampling effectively enhances the performance of various\nclassification algorithms by providing better datasets than existing sampling\nmethods. Besides, ablation studies further indicate that allowing knowledge\ntransfer accelerates the GP's evolutionary learning process.",

In this paper, our objective\nis to spotlight emotion-relevant attributes of audio and visual modalities to\nfacilitate multimodal fusion in the context of nuanced emotional shifts in\nvisual-audio scenarios. To this end, we introduce DEVA, a progressive fusion\nframework founded on textual sentiment descriptions aimed at accentuating\nemotional features of visual-audio content. DEVA employs an Emotional\nDescription Generator (EDG) to transmute raw audio and visual data into\ntextualized sentiment descriptions, thereby amplifying their emotional\ncharacteristics. These descriptions are then integrated with the source data to\nyield richer, enhanced features. Furthermore, DEVA incorporates the Text-guided\nProgressive Fusion Module (TPF), leveraging varying levels of text as a core\nmodality guide. This module progressively fuses visual-audio minor modalities\nto alleviate disparities between text and visual-audio modalities. Experimental\nresults on widely used sentiment analysis benchmark datasets, including MOSI,\nMOSEI, and CH-SIMS, underscore significant enhancements compared to\nstate-of-the-art models.

However, existing physics-based\ninteraction systems for 3DGS can only perform simple and non-realistic\nsimulations or demand extensive user input for complex scenes, primarily due to\nthe absence of scene understanding. In this paper, we propose LIVE-GS, a highly\nrealistic interactive VR system powered by LLM. After object-aware GS\nreconstruction, we prompt GPT-4o to analyze the physical properties of objects\nin the scene, which are used to guide physical simulations consistent with real\nphenomena. We also design a GPT-assisted GS inpainting module to fill the\nunseen area covered by manipulative objects. To perform a precise segmentation\nof Gaussian kernels, we propose a feature-mask segmentation strategy. To enable\nrich interaction, we further propose a computationally efficient physical\nsimulation framework through an PBD-based unified interpolation method,\nsupporting various physical forms such as rigid body, soft body, and granular\nmaterials. Our experimental results show that with the help of LLM's\nunderstanding and enhancement of scenes, our VR system can support complex and\nrealistic interactions without additional manual design and annotation.",

We have applied this method to the semidetached high-mass X-ray\nbinary (HMXB) M33 X-7 in order to provide a direct comparison to recent\nobservations of an RLO candidate system at two overflow states of overfilling\nfactors f = 1.01 and f = 1.1. We found extreme overflow ( f = 1.1) to exhibit\nentirely conservative unstable mass transfer (MT), with tidal stream density\nand deflected angle comparable to predictions. The f = 1.01 case differed in\nstream geometry, accretion disk size, and efficiency, demonstrating\nnon-conservative stable MT through a ballistic uniform-width stream. The\nnon-conservative and stable nature of the f = 1.01 case MT also suggests that\nexisting assumptions of semi-detached binaries undergoing RLO may\nmischaracterize the parameter space of stability for the L1 flow. We also\nconducted a piecewise evolution of M33 X-7 across nearly the entirety of RLO\nphase from onset to runaway unstable MT.

We also present novel relations for binary separation, mass\nratio, L1 mass transfer rate, and Roche timescale as they vary with respect to\nthe overfilling factor. These provide constraints on the threshold for the\nonset of unstable MT which ultimately led in our system to exponentially faster\nMT evolution.

Partial Least Squares (PLS)\nregression is the premier tool for building such models in analytical\nchemistry, yet it does not inherently provide privacy guarantees, leaving\nsensitive (training) data vulnerable to privacy attacks. To address this gap,\nwe propose an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private PLS (edPLS)\nalgorithm, which integrates well-studied and theoretically motivated Gaussian\nnoise-adding mechanisms into the PLS algorithm to ensure the privacy of the\ndata underlying the model. Our approach involves adding carefully calibrated\nGaussian noise to the outputs of four key functions in the PLS algorithm: the\nweights, scores, $X$-loadings, and $Y$-loadings. The noise variance is\ndetermined based on the global sensitivity of each function, ensuring that the\nprivacy loss is controlled according to the $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differential\nprivacy framework. Specifically, we derive the sensitivity bounds for each\nfunction and use these bounds to calibrate the noise added to the model\ncomponents. Experimental results demonstrate that edPLS effectively renders\nprivacy attacks, aimed at recovering unique sources of variability in the\ntraining data, ineffective. Application of edPLS to the NIR corn benchmark\ndataset shows that the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) remains\ncompetitive even at strong privacy levels (i.e., $\\epsilon=1$), given proper\npre-processing of the corresponding spectra. These findings highlight the\npractical utility of edPLS in creating privacy-preserving multivariate\ncalibrations and for the analysis of their privacy-utility trade-offs.",

The recent discovery of biskyrmions and skyrmions in the globally\ncentrosymmetric crystals has raised debate about the role of the DMI in causing\nthe spin textures, since DMI vanishes in such crystal structures. Theoretical\nstudies, on the other hand, suggest non-vanishing DMI even if there is local\ninversion symmetry breaking in an otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystal\nstructure. Motivated by such theoretical predictions, we present here the\nresults of a systematic crystal structure study of two skyrmion-hosting\nNi2In-type centrosymmetric hexagonal compounds, MnNiGa and MnPtGa, using the\natomic pair distribution function (PDF) technique. Our result provides\ninformation about structural correlations in the short-range (SR), medium-range\n(MR) and long-range (LR) regimes simultaneously. The analysis of the\nexperimental PDFs, obtained from high flux, high energy and high-Q synchrotron\nx-ray powder diffraction patterns, reveal that the local SR structure of both\nMnNiGa and MnPtGa compounds corresponds to the noncentrosymmetric trigonal\nspace group P3m1, while the structure in the MR+LR regimes remains hexagonal in\nthe centrosymmetric P63/mmc space group. These findings are also supported by\ntheoretical DFT calculations. Our results in conjunction with the previous\ntheoretical predictions, provide a rationale for the genesis of skyrmions in\ncentrosymmetric materials in terms of non-vanishing DMI due to local inversion\nsymmetry breaking.

Using this framework, we developed a taxonomy comprising 68 types of\ndark patterns, each annotated in detail to illustrate its impact on users,\npotential scenarios, and real-world examples, validated through industry\nsurveys. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of current detection tools\nand assessed the completeness of available datasets. Our findings indicate\nthat, among the 8 detection tools studied, only 31 types of dark patterns are\nidentifiable, resulting in a coverage rate of just 45.5%. Similarly, our\nanalysis of four datasets, encompassing 5,561 instances, reveals coverage of\nonly 30 types of dark patterns, with an overall coverage rate of 44%. Based on\nthe available datasets, we standardized classifications and merged datasets to\nform a unified image dataset and a unified text dataset. These results\nhighlight significant room for improvement in the field of dark pattern\ndetection. This research not only deepens our understanding of dark pattern\nclassification and detection tools but also offers valuable insights for future\nresearch and practice in this domain.",

While a significant amount of research has focused on\nreducing computational overhead by utilizing hardware accelerators like GPUs\nand FPGAs, there has been relatively little emphasis on addressing HE memory\noverhead.

We studied the quasinormal frequencies and\ndeduced that an increase in the value of the quintessence parameter $c$\ndissipates the oscillatory behavior and thus slow down the decay of\nperturbations. The greybody factors are highly dependent on the multipole\nmoment $l$ and BH parameters, with a larger $q$ hindering the transmission and\nsmaller $\\alpha_0$ making the barrier steeper. The deflection angle of weak\nlensing under thin lens approximation, monotonically decreases as the value of\nimpact parameter $b$ increases, and is visibly affected by the parameter $c$,\nand that $\\alpha_0$ and $q$ has very minimal effect. Lastly, we investigated\nthe chaos bound behaviour of photon trajectories in the near-horizon\nneighbourhood, which indicates that it is satisfied for bigger circular photon\norbits but broken for smaller ones, with high-angular-momentum photons being\nchaotic. This violation of the bound points towards the role of quintessence in\nmodifying the thermodynamic features of the BH, with possible adjustments to\nthe standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.",

The Chemical Evolution of\nR-process Elements in Stars (CERES) project aims to provide a homogeneous\nanalysis of a sample of metal-poor stars ( [Fe/H]\\<-1.5) to improve our\nunderstanding of the nucleosynthesis of neutron capture elements, in particular\nthe r-process elements, in the early Galaxy. Our data consist of a sample of\nhigh resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio UVES spectra. The chemical\nabundances were derived through spectrum synthesis, using the same model\natmospheres and stellar parameters as derived in the first paper of the CERES\nseries. We measured chemical abundances or upper limits of seven heavy neutron\ncapture elements (Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu) for a sample of 52 metal-poor\ngiant stars. We estimated through the mean shift clustering algorithm that at\nBa/H =-2.4 and Fe/H =-2.4 a variation in the trend of X/Ba with X=La,Nd,Sm,Eu,\nversus Ba/H occurs. This result suggests that, for Ba/H $\\<$$-2.4$, Ba\nnucleosynthesis in the Milky Way halo is primarily due to the $r$-process,\nwhile for Ba/H \\<-2.4 the effect of the s-process contribution begins to be\nvisible. In our sample, stars with Ba/Eu compatible with a Solar System pure\nr-process value (hereafter, r-pure) do not show any particular trend compared\nto other stars, suggesting r-pure stars may form in similar environments to\nstars with less pure r-process enrichments. Homogeneous investigations of high\nresolution and signal-to-noise ratio spectra are crucial for studying the heavy\nelements formation, as they provide abundances that can be used to test\nnucleosynthesis models as well as Galactic chemical evolution models.",

These models incorporate the implicit assumption, that the\nstay time in each disease state follows an exponential distribution. However, a\nsubstantial number of epidemiological, data-based studies indicate that this\nassumption is not plausible. One method to alleviate this limitation is to\nemploy the Linear Chain Trick (LCT) for ODE systems, which realizes the use of\nErlang distributed stay times. As indicated by data, this approach allows for\nmore realistic models while maintaining the advantages of using ODEs.\n  In this work, we propose an advanced LCT SECIR-type model incorporating eight\ninfection states with demographic stratification. We review key properties of\nthe corresponding LCT model and demonstrate that predictions derived from a\nsimple ODE-based model can be significantly distorted, potentially leading to\nwrong political decisions. Our findings demonstrate that the influence of\ndistribution assumptions on the behavior at change points and on the prediction\nof epidemic peaks is substantial, while the assumption has no effect on the\nfinal size of the epidemic. With respect to prior findings in literature, we\ndemonstrate that the influence of the number of subcompartments on the timing\nand size of the epidemic peak is nontrivial and that a general statement cannot\nbe obtained. We, then, show how these age-resolved LCT SECIR-type models\ncapture the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany in 2020. Eventually, we study the\nimplications on the time-to-solution for different LCT models using fixed and\nadaptive step-size Runge-Kutta methods and provide computational performance\nfor these models in the MEmilio software framework, also using distributed\nmemory parallelism to speed up ensemble runs.",

The experiment is to be located in\nthe forward direction of the incoming low-energy proton beam at CiADS,\nleveraging the strong forward boost of the produced particles at the beam dump\nin general. The space between the dump and the detector is largely available,\nallowing for installation of veto materials and hence low levels of background\nevents. We elaborate on the detector setup, and choose dark photon as a\nbenchmark model for sensitivity study. We restrict ourselves to the signature\nof an electron-positron pair, and find that with 5 years' operation, unique,\ncurrently unexcluded parts of the parameter space for $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV\ndark-photon masses and $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-9}\\text{--}10^{-8})$ kinetic mixing\ncan be probed at the CiADS-BDE. Furthermore, considering that there is no need\nto set up a proton beam specifically for this experiment and that the detector\nsystem requires minimal instrumentation, the experiment is supposed to be\nrelatively cost-effective. Therefore, we intend this work to promote studies on\nthe sensitivity reach of the proposed experiment to additional LLP scenarios,\nand in the end, the realization of the experiment. Incidentally, we study the\nsensitivity of the same BDE setups at the High Intensity Heavy-ion Accelerator\nFacility (HIAF), presently under construction near the CiADS program site, and\nconclude that HIAF-BDE could probe new parameter regions, too.",

Most AL methods employ warm-start\napproaches, which rely on sufficient labeled data to train a well-calibrated\nmodel that can assess the uncertainty and diversity of unlabeled data. However,\nwhen assembling a dataset, labeled data are often scarce initially, leading to\na cold-start problem.

Our research addresses these\nissues by developing a two-stage method for Multi-Modal Cold-Start Active\nLearning (MMCSAL).\n  Firstly, we observe the modality gap, a significant distance between the\ncentroids of representations from different modalities, when only using\ncross-modal pairing information as self-supervision signals. This modality gap\naffects data selection process, as we calculate both uni-modal and cross-modal\ndistances. To address this, we introduce uni-modal prototypes to bridge the\nmodality gap. Secondly, conventional AL methods often falter in multimodal\nscenarios where alignment between modalities is overlooked. Therefore, we\npropose enhancing cross-modal alignment through regularization, thereby\nimproving the quality of selected multimodal data pairs in AL. Finally, our\nexperiments demonstrate MMCSAL's efficacy in selecting multimodal data pairs\nacross three multimodal datasets.",

    "abstract": "Query answering over data with dependencies plays a central role in most\napplications of dependencies. The problem is commonly solved by using a\nsuitable variant of the chase algorithm to compute a universal model of the\ndependencies and the data and thus explicate all knowledge implicit in the\ndependencies. After this preprocessing step, an arbitrary conjunctive query\nover the dependencies and the data can be answered by evaluating it the\ncomputed universal model. If, however, the query to be answered is fixed and\nknown in advance, computing the universal model is often inefficient as many\ninferences made during this process can be irrelevant to a given query. In such\ncases, a goal-driven approach, which avoids drawing unnecessary inferences,\npromises to be more efficient and thus preferable in practice.\n  In this paper we present what we believe to be the first technique for\ngoal-driven query answering over first- and second-order dependencies with\nequality reasoning. Our technique transforms the input dependencies so that\napplying the chase to the output avoids many inferences that are irrelevant to\nthe query. The transformation proceeds in several steps, which comprise the\nfollowing three novel techniques. First, we present a variant of the\nsingularisation technique by Marnette [60] that is applicable to second-order\ndependencies and that corrects an incompleteness of a related formulation by\nten Cate et al. [74]. Second, we present a relevance analysis technique that\ncan eliminate from the input dependencies that provably do not contribute to\nquery answers. Third, we present a variant of the magic sets algorithm [19]\nthat can handle second-order dependencies with equality reasoning. We also\npresent the results of an extensive empirical evaluation, which show that\ngoal-driven query answering can be orders of magnitude faster than computing\nthe full universal model.",

    "abstract": "Stasis is a unique cosmological phenomenon in which the abundances of\ndifferent energy components in the universe (such as matter, radiation, and\nvacuum energy) each remain fixed even though they scale differently under\ncosmological expansion. Moreover, extended epochs exhibiting stasis are\ngenerally cosmological attractors in many BSM settings and thus arise naturally\nand without fine-tuning. To date, stasis has been found within a number of very\ndifferent BSM cosmologies. In some cases, stasis emerges from theories that\ncontain large towers of decaying states (such as theories in extra dimensions\nor string theory). By contrast, in other cases, no towers of states are needed,\nand stasis instead emerges due to thermal effects involving particle\nannihilation rather than decay. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the\nenergy flows in all of these theories during stasis, and find that these\ntheories all share a common energy-flow structure which in some sense lies\nbetween particle decay and particle annihilation. This structure has been\nhidden until now but ultimately lies at the root of the stasis phenomenon, with\nall of the previous stases appearing as different manifestations of this common\nunderlying structure. This insight not only allows us to understand the\nemergence of stasis in each of these different scenarios, but also provides an\nimportant guide for the potential future discovery of stasis in additional\ncosmological systems.",

It ensures accurate message decoding, even under malicious\nattacks, by combining the low-frequency components of the 3D wavelet domain\nwith the RGB features of the video. Additionally, our approach minimizes video\nquality degradation by embedding watermark messages in layers with minimal\nimpact on visual appearance using an importance-based weight modulation\nstrategy. We optimize both the watermark decoder and the latent decoder of\ndiffusion model, effectively balancing the trade-off between visual quality and\nbit accuracy.

For\nin-distribution forget data -- data similar to the retain set -- we show that a\nsurprisingly simple and general procedure, empirical risk minimization with\noutput perturbation, achieves tight unlearning-utility-complexity trade-offs,\naddressing a previous theoretical gap on the separation from unlearning \"for\nfree\" via differential privacy, which inherently facilitates the removal of\nsuch data. However, such techniques fail with out-of-distribution forget data\n-- data significantly different from the retain set -- where unlearning time\ncomplexity can exceed that of retraining, even for a single sample. To address\nthis, we propose a new robust and noisy gradient descent variant that provably\namortizes unlearning time complexity without compromising utility.",

Concept drift, the phenomenon that the\nunderlying distribution changes over time poses a significant challenge. Yet,\ndespite high practical relevance, there is little to no foundational theory for\nlearning in the drifting setup comparable to classical statistical learning\ntheory in the offline setting. This can be attributed to the lack of an\nunderlying object comparable to a probability distribution as in the classical\nsetup. While there exist approaches to transfer ideas to the streaming setup,\nthese start from a data perspective rather than an algorithmic one. In this\nwork, we suggest a new model of data over time that is aimed at the algorithm's\nperspective. Instead of defining the setup using time points, we utilize a\nwindow-based approach that resembles the inner workings of most stream learning\nalgorithms.

    "abstract": "In science and engineering, machine learning techniques are increasingly\nsuccessful in physical systems modeling (predicting future states of physical\nsystems). Effectively integrating PDE loss as a constraint of system transition\ncan improve the model's prediction by overcoming generalization issues due to\ndata scarcity, especially when data acquisition is costly. However, in many\nreal-world scenarios, due to sensor limitations, the data we can obtain is\noften only partial observation, making the calculation of PDE loss seem to be\ninfeasible, as the PDE loss heavily relies on high-resolution states. We\ncarefully study this problem and propose a novel framework named Re-enable PDE\nLoss under Partial Observation (RPLPO). The key idea is that although enabling\nPDE loss to constrain system transition solely is infeasible, we can re-enable\nPDE loss by reconstructing the learnable high-resolution state and constraining\nsystem transition simultaneously. Specifically, RPLPO combines an encoding\nmodule for reconstructing learnable high-resolution states with a transition\nmodule for predicting future states. The two modules are jointly trained by\ndata and PDE loss. We conduct experiments in various physical systems to\ndemonstrate that RPLPO has significant improvement in generalization, even when\nobservation is sparse, irregular, noisy, and PDE is inaccurate.",

Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing\nnetworks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral\nstream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative\nhypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial\nlatents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are\nrepresentations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to\ncategorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets\ngenerated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We\nfound that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural\nalignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the\nspatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural\nalignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but\nnot identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle\nlayers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by\nnon-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the\nimplicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial\nlatents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream.\nThus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object\ncategorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of\ncomparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the\nventral stream.",

Specifically, we\ninitially employ a shared refiner to estimate the residual flows, enabling both\nLTR supervision and HTR inference. Subsequently, we introduce regional noise to\nsimulate the residual patterns of intermediate flows, facilitating the\nadaptation from LTR supervision to HTR inference. Additionally, we show that\nthe noise-based strategy supports in-domain self-supervised training.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy in both LTR and HTR metrics, highlighting its\neffectiveness and superiority.",

    "abstract": "One of the many measures of the non-equilibrium nature of a system is the\nexistence of a non-zero steady state current which is especially relevant for\nmany biological systems. To this end, we study the non-equilibrium dynamics of\na particle moving in a tilted colored noise ratchet in two different\nsituations. In the first, the colored noise variable is reset to a specific\nvalue every time the particle transitions from one well to another in the\nratchet. Contrary to intuition, we find that the current magnitude decreases as\nthe correlation time of the noise increases, and increases monotonically with\nnoise strength. The average displacement of the particle is against the tilt,\nwhich implies that the particle performs work. We then consider a variation of\nthe same problem in which the colored noise process is allowed to evolve freely\nwithout any resetting at the transitions. Again, the average displacement is\nagainst the potential. However, the current magnitude increases with the\ncorrelation time, and there is an optimal noise strength that maximizes the\ncurrent magnitude. Finally, we provide quantitative arguments to explain these\nfindings and their relevance to active biological matter such as tissues.",

Shocks propagating\ninto magnetized MCs can be classified into \"jump\" J-shock and \"continuous\"\nC-shock. The molecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas behind J-shock\nis still not well understood, which will provide a comprehensive view of the\nchemical feedback of SNRs and the chemical effects of J-shock. We conducted a\nW-band (71.4-89.7 GHz) observation toward a re-formed molecular clump behind a\nJ-shock induced by SNR W51C with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope to study the\nmolecular chemistry in the re-formed molecular gas. Based on the local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption, we estimate the column densities of\nHCO+, HCN, C2H and o-c-C3H2, and derive the maps of their abundance ratios with\nCO. The gas density is constrained by non-LTE analysis of the HCO+ J=1-0 line.\nWe obtain the following abundance ratios: $N({\\rm HCO^+})/N({\\rm CO})\\sim\n(1.0\\text{--}4.0)\\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\\rm HCN})/N({\\rm CO})\\sim\n(1.8\\text{--}5.3)\\times 10^{-4}$, $N({\\rm C_2H})/N({\\rm CO})\\sim\n(1.6\\text{--}5.0)\\times 10^{-3}$, and $N({o\\text{-}c\\text{-}{\\rm\nC_3H_2}})/N({\\rm CO})\\sim (1.2\\text{--}7.9)\\times 10^{-4}$.

The detailed shape of the emission spectrum around the\n$\\sim$ MeV peak places important constraints on acceleration and radiation\nmechanisms in the blazar jet and may not be the simple broken power law\nobtained by extrapolating from the observed X-ray and GeV gamma-ray spectra. In\nparticular, state-of-the-art simulations of particle acceleration by shocks\nshow that a significant fraction (possibly up to $\\approx 90\\%$) of the\navailable energy may go into bulk, quasi-thermal heating of the plasma crossing\nthe shock rather than producing a non-thermal power law tail. Other ``gentler\"\nbut possibly more pervasive acceleration mechanisms such as shear acceleration\nat the jet boundary may result in a further build-up of the low-energy ($\\gamma\n\\lesssim 10^{2}$) electron/positron population in the jet. As already discussed\nfor the case of gamma-ray bursts, the presence of a low-energy, Maxwellian-like\n``bump'' in the jet particle energy distribution can strongly affect the\nspectrum of the emitted radiation, e.g., producing an excess over the emission\nexpected from a power-law extrapolation of a blazar's GeV-TeV spectrum. We\nexplore the potential detectability of the spectral component ascribable to a\nhot, quasi-thermal population of electrons in the high-energy emission of\nflat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ). We show that for typical FSRQ physical\nparameters, the expected spectral signature is located at $\\sim$ MeV energies.\nFor the brightest Fermi FSRQ sources, the presence of such a component will be\nconstrained by the upcoming MeV Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI)\nsatellite.",

While diffusional exchanges have traditionally been\ndifficult to map, recent advances in nanotechnology enable precise probing of\nexchange fluxes with the medium at single-cell resolution. Here we introduce a\ntiling-based method to reconstruct the dynamic unfolding of exchange networks\nfrom flux data, subsequently applying it to an experimental mammalian\nco-culture system where lactate exchanges affect the acidification of the\nenvironment. We observe that the network, which initially exhibits a dense\nmatrix of exchanges, progressively breaks up into small disconnected clusters\nof cells. To explain this behaviour, we develop a two-parameter Maximum-Entropy\nmulticellular metabolic model that incorporates diffusion-driven exchanges\nthrough a set of global constraints that couple cellular behaviors. The model\npredicts a transition from a densely interconnected network to a sparse,\nmotif-dominated state as glucose and oxygen consumption levels shift. We\ncharacterize such a crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in\nthe cluster-size distribution at the critical transition, and analytically, by\ncomputing the critical line through a mean-field approximation based on\npercolation theory. By comparing empirical data with theoretical predictions,\nwe find that populations evolve towards the sparse phase by remaining near the\ncrossover point between these two regimes.

Despite their success, SSL\nmodels often struggle to generate effective representations for unseen-domain\ndata. To address this issue, research on unsupervised domain generalization\n(UDG), which aims to develop SSL models that can generate domain-irrelevant\nfeatures, has been conducted. Most UDG approaches utilize contrastive learning\nwith InfoNCE to generate representations, and perform feature alignment based\non strong assumptions to generalize domain-irrelevant common features from\nmulti-source domains. However, existing methods that rely on instance\ndiscrimination tasks are not effective at extracting domain-irrelevant common\nfeatures. This leads to the suppression of domain-irrelevant common features\nand the amplification of domain-relevant features, thereby hindering domain\ngeneralization. Furthermore, strong assumptions underlying feature alignment\ncan lead to biased feature learning, reducing the diversity of common features.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach, DomCLP, Domain-wise Contrastive\nLearning with Prototype Mixup. We explore how InfoNCE suppresses\ndomain-irrelevant common features and amplifies domain-relevant features.

    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) aims to transfer knowledge from seen\nsource domains to unseen target domains, which is crucial for evaluating the\ngeneralization and robustness of models. Recent studies focus on utilizing\nvisual styles to bridge the domain gap between different domains. However, the\nserious dilemma of gradient instability and local optimization problem occurs\nin those style-based CD-FSL methods. This paper addresses these issues and\nproposes a novel crop-global style perturbation method, called\n\\underline{\\textbf{S}}elf-\\underline{\\textbf{V}}ersatility\n\\underline{\\textbf{A}}dversarial \\underline{\\textbf{S}}tyle\n\\underline{\\textbf{P}}erturbation (\\textbf{SVasP}), which enhances the gradient\nstability and escapes from poor sharp minima jointly. Specifically, SVasP\nsimulates more diverse potential target domain adversarial styles via\ndiversifying input patterns and aggregating localized crop style gradients, to\nserve as global style perturbation stabilizers within one image, a concept we\nrefer to as self-versatility. Then a novel objective function is proposed to\nmaximize visual discrepancy while maintaining semantic consistency between\nglobal, crop, and adversarial features. Having the stabilized global style\nperturbation in the training phase, one can obtain a flattened minima in the\nloss landscape, boosting the transferability of the model to the target\ndomains. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nour method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "We employ accurate density functional theory calculations to examine the\nelectronic structure of three Ni/SrO$_2$ nanostructures containing\nsingle-layer, bilayer and four-layer Ni nanosheets. The single Ni layer\ninteracts strongly with the topmost oxygen layer at the Ni/SrO$_2$ interface,\nresulting in significant surface reconstruction and strong hybridisation\nbetween the O $2p$ and Ni $3d$ states. For the bilayer Ni, the layer facing the\ninterface also strongly interacts with the O. However, the second layer retains\nits geometry. For the four-layer system, none of the Ni layers interacted\nstrongly with O. According to the electronic population analysis, in the\nthinnest nanosheets, the strong hybridisation with oxygen pulls Ni's $3d$\nstates away from the Fermi level deeper into the valence band. In these cases,\nNi's electronic population that is labile for catalysis in the vicinity of the\nFermi level was as little as half of the bilayer nanosheet. Such reduction in\nthe labile $3d$ population has a detrimental effect on Ni's catalytic\nperformance in de-hydrogenating formic acid. Our results demonstrate that there\nis an optimum dimension for Ni nanoparticles below or above which the catalytic\nperformance deteriorates. Consequently, reducing the Ni dimension to maximise\nthe surface in the hope of better catalytic yield might not be the best\nstrategy as detrimental $p$-$d$ hybridisation takes hold.

In the\npresent study, we provide broad-band X-ray light curve (LC) predictions for SNe\nIbn/Icn.

However,\nmulti-kernel clustering tends to learn an optimal kernel and then perform\neigenvalue decomposition on it, which leads to high computational complexity.\nMatrix factorization-based multi-view clustering methods impose orthogonal\nconstraints on individual views. This overly emphasizes the accuracy of\nclustering structures within single views and restricts the learning of\nindividual views.

It removes the orthogonal constraints on individual views and\nimposes orthogonal constraints on the consensus matrix, resulting in an\naccurate final clustering structure. Ultimately, the method is unified into a\nsimple form of multi-kernel clustering, but avoids learning an optimal kernel,\nthus reducing the time complexity.

For theoretical models, we select\nseven representative models, including the original HDE (OHDE) model, Ricci HDE\n(RDE) model, generalized Ricci HDE (GRDE) model, interacting HDE (IHDE1 and\nIHDE2) models, Tsallis HDE (THDE) model, and Barrow HDE (BHDE) model.

    "abstract": "In its initial form, the expensive son hypothesis postulates that sons from\nmale-biased sexually dimorphic species require more food during growth than\ndaughters, which ultimately incur fitness costs for mothers predominantly\nproducing and rearing sons. We first dissect the evolutionary framework in\nwhich the expensive son hypothesis is rooted, and we provide a critical\nreappraisal of its differences from other evolutionary theories proposed in the\nfield of sex allocation. Then, we synthesize the current (and absence of)\nsupport for the costs of producing and rearing sons on maternal fitness\ncomponents (future reproduction and survival). Regarding the consequences in\nterms of future reproduction, we highlight that species with pronounced sexual\nsize dimorphism display a higher cost of sons than of daughters on subsequent\nreproductive performance, at least in mammals. However, in most studies, the\nrelative fitness costs of producing and rearing sons and daughters can be due\nto sex-biased maternal allocation strategies rather than differences in\nenergetic demands of offspring, which constitutes an alternative mechanism to\nthe expensive son hypothesis stricto sensu. We observe that empirical studies\ninvestigating the differential costs of sons and daughters on maternal survival\nin non-human animals remain rare, especially for long-term survival. Indeed,\nmost studies have investigated the influence of offspring sex (or litter sex\nratio) at year $T$ on survival at year $T+1$, and they rarely provide a support\nto the expensive son hypothesis. On the contrary, in humans, most studies have\nfocused on the relationship between proportion of sons and maternal lifespan,\nbut these results are inconsistent. Our study highlights new avenues for future\nresearch that should provide a comprehensive view of the expensive son\nhypothesis, by notably disentangling the effects of offspring behaviour from\nthe effect of sex-specific maternal allocation. Moreover, we emphasize that\nfuture studies should also embrace the mechanistic side of the expensive son\nhypothesis, largely neglected so far, by deciphering the physiological pathways\nlinking son's production to maternal health and fitness.",

Instead of relying on standard non-convex optimization\ntechniques, the optimal policy within the set can be approximated as the\nsolution of a low-dimensional linear program whose dimension scales linearly\nwith the number of components in each mixture. The proposed method generalizes\nnaturally to more general classes of dynamical systems, such as controllable\nlinear time-varying systems, enabling efficient solutions to multi-marginal\nmomentum SB between GMMs, a challenging distribution interpolation problem. We\nshowcase the potential of this approach in low-to-moderate dimensional problems\nsuch as image-to-image translation in the latent space of an autoencoder,\nlearning of cellular dynamics using multi-marginal momentum SB problems, and\nvarious other examples. We also test our approach on an Entropic Optimal\nTransport (EOT) benchmark problem and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in cases where the boundary distributions are mixture models while\nrequiring virtually no training.",

However, such a complex\nprocess requires cross-domain knowledge of hardware and software and hence\noften necessitates direct developer involvement, making it labor-intensive,\ntime-consuming, and error-prone. To address this challenge, this paper\nintroduces EmbedGenius, the first fully automated software development platform\nfor general-purpose embedded IoT systems. The key idea is to leverage the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedded system expertise\nto automate the hardware-in-the-loop development process. The main methods\ninclude a component-aware library resolution method for addressing hardware\ndependencies, a library knowledge generation method that injects utility domain\nknowledge into LLMs, and an auto-programming method that ensures successful\ndeployment. We evaluate EmbedGenius's performance across 71 modules and four\nmainstream embedded development platforms with over 350 IoT tasks. Experimental\nresults show that EmbedGenius can generate codes with an accuracy of 95.7% and\ncomplete tasks with a success rate of 86.5%, surpassing human-in-the-loop\nbaselines by 15.6%--37.7% and 25.5%--53.4%, respectively.

In\naddition to the change in the direction of shear coupling, a linear\nrelationship between the rate and the transition point during shear coupling\nmigration was discovered.

    "abstract": "Implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) presents significant challenges due to the\nabsence of salient cue words. Previous methods have struggled with insufficient\ndata and limited reasoning capabilities to infer underlying opinions.\nIntegrating multi-task learning (MTL) with large language models (LLMs) offers\nthe potential to enable models of varying sizes to reliably perceive and\nrecognize genuine opinions in ISA. However, existing MTL approaches are\nconstrained by two sources of uncertainty: data-level uncertainty, arising from\nhallucination problems in LLM-generated contextual information, and task-level\nuncertainty, stemming from the varying capacities of models to process\ncontextual information. To handle these uncertainties, we introduce MT-ISA, a\nnovel MTL framework that enhances ISA by leveraging the generation and\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs through automatic MTL. Specifically, MT-ISA\nconstructs auxiliary tasks using generative LLMs to supplement sentiment\nelements and incorporates automatic MTL to fully exploit auxiliary data. We\nintroduce data-level and task-level automatic weight learning (AWL), which\ndynamically identifies relationships and prioritizes more reliable data and\ncritical tasks, enabling models of varying sizes to adaptively learn\nfine-grained weights based on their reasoning capabilities. We investigate\nthree strategies for data-level AWL, while also introducing homoscedastic\nuncertainty for task-level AWL. Extensive experiments reveal that models of\nvarying sizes achieve an optimal balance between primary prediction and\nauxiliary tasks in MT-ISA. This underscores the effectiveness and adaptability\nof our approach.",

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (re-ID) via 3D skeleton data is a challenging task\nwith significant value in many scenarios. Existing skeleton-based methods\ntypically assume virtual motion relations between all joints, and adopt average\njoint or sequence representations for learning. However, they rarely explore\nkey body structure and motion such as gait to focus on more important body\njoints or limbs, while lacking the ability to fully mine valuable\nspatial-temporal sub-patterns of skeletons to enhance model learning. This\npaper presents a generic Motif guided graph transformer with Combinatorial\nskeleton prototype learning (MoCos) that exploits structure-specific and\ngait-related body relations as well as combinatorial features of skeleton\ngraphs to learn effective skeleton representations for person re-ID. In\nparticular, motivated by the locality within joints' structure and the\nbody-component collaboration in gait, we first propose the motif guided graph\ntransformer (MGT) that incorporates hierarchical structural motifs and gait\ncollaborative motifs, which simultaneously focuses on multi-order local joint\ncorrelations and key cooperative body parts to enhance skeleton relation\nlearning. Then, we devise the combinatorial skeleton prototype learning (CSP)\nthat leverages random spatial-temporal combinations of joint nodes and skeleton\ngraphs to generate diverse sub-skeleton and sub-tracklet representations, which\nare contrasted with the most representative features (prototypes) of each\nidentity to learn class-related semantics and discriminative skeleton\nrepresentations.

We demonstrate the feasibility of inferring\nstellar ages from Gaia's RVS spectra and the BP/RP (XP) spectrophotometric\ndata, specifically for red giant branch and high-mass red clump stars. We\nsuccessfully train two machine learning models, dubbed SIDRA: Stellar age\nInference Derived from Gaia spectRA to predict the age. The SIDRA-RVS model\nuses the RVS spectra and SIDRA-XP the stellar parameters obtained from the XP\nspectra by Fallows and Sanders 2024. Both models use BINGO, an APOGEE-derived\nstellar age from Ciuca et al. 2021 as the training data. SIDRA-RVS estimates\nages of stars whose age is around $\\tau_\\mathrm{BINGO}=10$ Gyr with a standard\ndeviation of residuals of $\\sim$ 0.12 dex in the unseen test dataset, while\nSIDRA-XP achieves higher precision with residuals $\\sim$ 0.064 dex for stars\naround $\\tau_\\mathrm{BINGO}=10$ Gyr. Since SIDRA-XP outperforms SIDRA-RVS, we\napply SIDRA-XP to analyse the ages for 2,218,154 stars.

Here, we realize\nwidth-independent and robust MMI waveguides. Our principle is based on the\nunique properties of multilayer graphene lattices. By properly modulating the\nboundary potential, this Dirac-type material supports anomalous bulk states\nwith uniform wavefunctions independent of the sample size. Benefited from such\nan anomaly, the bulk states in a waveguide formed by multiple layers of\ngraphene ribbons exhibit width-independent MMI.

By precisely modulating their\nboundaries, the anomalous bulk states and correspondingly the width-independent\nMMI are achieved. Our experimental measurements show that the input wave energy\ntravelling through the MMI waveguide can be split into two outputs with a\nfrequency-tunable ratio, and due to the width-independent characteristic, the\nsplitter is robust to geometric perturbations. We further demonstrate stable\nMMI across multiple interconnects with stepped widths, allowing for high power\ncapacity while maintaining high coupling efficiency.

In an earlier work, some of us showed that\nhomogeneous flavor instabilities also obey a Nyquist criterion, inspired by\nplasma physics. This condition, while more restrictive than the angular\ncrossing, is only sufficient if the unstable branch of the dispersion relation\nis bounded by critical points that both lie under the light cone (points with\nsubluminal phase velocity). While the lepton-number angle distribution, assumed\nto be axially symmetric, easily allows one to determine the real-valued branch\nof the dispersion relation and to recognize if instead superluminal critical\npoints exist, this graphical method does not translate into a simple\ninstability condition.

To address this, a novel patch-based diffusion model is proposed,\nspecifically engineered to capture fine-grained local information.

Combinational equivalence checking (CEC)\nplays an essential role in ensuring the correctness of design optimization. The\nmost prevalent CEC algorithms are based on SAT sweeping, which utilizes SAT to\nprove the equivalence of the internal node pairs in topological order, and the\nequivalent nodes are merged. Datapath circuits usually contain equivalent pairs\nfor which the transitive fan-in cones are small but have a high XOR chain\ndensity, and proving such node pairs is very difficult for SAT solvers. An\nexact probability-based simulation (EPS) is suitable for verifying such pairs,\nwhile this method is not suitable for pairs with many primary inputs due to the\nmemory cost. We first reduce the memory cost of EPS and integrate it to improve\nthe SAT sweeping method. Considering the complementary abilities of SAT and\nEPS, we design an engine selection heuristic to dynamically choose SAT or EPS\nin the sweeping process, according to XOR chain density. Our method is further\nimproved by reducing unnecessary engine calls by detecting regularity.\nFurthermore, we parallelized the SAT and EPS engines of HybridCEC, leading to\nthe parallel CEC prover. Experiments on a benchmark suite from industrial\ndatapath circuits show that our method is much faster than the state-of-the-art\nCEC tool namely ABC &cec on nearly all instances, and is more than 100x faster\non 30% of the instances, 1000x faster on 12% of the instances.

Stable\nelimination is guaranteed if there exists a scale such that the reproduction\nnumber among regions of that scale is less than $1$, even if the basic\nreproduction number $R_0$ is greater than $1$.

In-memory computing (IMC) offers a promising solution by\naddressing the von Neumann bottleneck inherent in traditional deep learning\naccelerators, significantly reducing energy consumption. However, the analog\nnature of IMC introduces hardware nonidealities that degrade model performance\nand reliability. This paper presents a novel approach to directly train\nphysical models of IMC, formulated as ordinary-differential-equation\n(ODE)-based physical neural networks (PNNs). To enable the training of\nlarge-scale networks, we propose a technique called differentiable spike-time\ndiscretization (DSTD), which reduces the computational cost of ODE-based PNNs\nby up to 20 times in speed and 100 times in memory. We demonstrate that such\nlarge-scale networks enhance the learning performance by exploiting hardware\nnonidealities on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The proposed bottom-up methodology is\nvalidated through the post-layout SPICE simulations on the IMC circuit with\nnonideal characteristics using the sky130 process.

Operator learning is an emerging field for solving these\nequations by using a neural network to learn a map between infinite dimensional\ninput and output function spaces. These neural operators are trained using a\ncombination of data (observations or simulations) and PDE-residuals\n(physics-loss). A major drawback of existing neural approaches is the\nrequirement to retrain with new initial/boundary conditions, and the necessity\nfor a large amount of simulation data for training. We develop a\nphysics-informed transformer neural operator (named PINTO) that efficiently\ngeneralizes to unseen initial and boundary conditions, trained in a\nsimulation-free setting using only physics loss. The main innovation lies in\nour new iterative kernel integral operator units, implemented using\ncross-attention, to transform the PDE solution's domain points into an\ninitial/boundary condition-aware representation vector, enabling efficient\nlearning of the solution function for new scenarios. The PINTO architecture is\napplied to simulate the solutions of important equations used in engineering\napplications: advection, Burgers, and steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes\nequations (three flow scenarios). For these five test cases, we show that the\nrelative errors during testing under challenging conditions of unseen\ninitial/boundary conditions are only one-fifth to one-third of other leading\nphysics informed operator learning methods.

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable the direct\ncontrol of external devices through the imagined movements of various body\nparts. Unlike previous systems that used fixed-length EEG trials for MI\ndecoding, asynchronous BCIs aim to detect the user's MI without explicit\ntriggers. They are challenging to implement, because the algorithm needs to\nfirst distinguish between resting-states and MI trials, and then classify the\nMI trials into the correct task, all without any triggers. This paper proposes\na sliding window prescreening and classification (SWPC) approach for MI-based\nasynchronous BCIs, which consists of two modules: a prescreening module to\nscreen MI trials out of the resting-state, and a classification module for MI\nclassification. Both modules are trained with supervised learning followed by\nself-supervised learning, which refines the feature extractors. Within-subject\nand cross-subject asynchronous MI classifications on four different EEG\ndatasets validated the effectiveness of SWPC, i.e., it always achieved the\nhighest average classification accuracy, and outperformed the best\nstate-of-the-art baseline on each dataset by about 2%.",

Then we assign radio continuum flux densities to\ngalaxies based on their SFRs and the probability of hosting a radio-AGN of\nspecific 1.4 GHz luminosity. We also apply special treatments to reproduce the\nclustering signal of radio AGNs.Our empirical model successfully recovers the\nobserved 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of both AGN and SFG\npopulations, as well as the differential number counts at various radio bands.\nThe uniqueness of this approach also allows us to directly link radio flux\ndensities of galaxies to other properties, including redshifts, stellar masses,\nand magnitudes at various photometric bands.

    "abstract": "We study the intrinsic and extrinsic torsions (defined by analogy with the\nintrinsic and extrinsic curvatures) of the spatial sections of torsional\nspacetimes. We consider two possibilities. First, that the intrinsic torsion\nmight prove to be directly observable. Second, that it is not observable,\nhaving been ``inflated away'' in the early Universe. We argue that, even in\nthis second case, the extrinsic torsion may grow during the inflationary era\nand be non-negligible at reheating and thereafter. Even if the spatial\nintrinsic curvature and torsion are too small to be detected directly, then,\nthe extrinsic torsion might not be. We point out that, if its presence is not\nrecognised, the extrinsic torsion could lead to anomalies in the theoretical\nestimate of the Hubble parameter -- $\\,$ a result with obvious potential\napplications. We stress that extrinsic torsion is by far the most natural way\nto produce such anomalies, simply because it mixes naturally with the Hubble\nparameter; that is, the second fundamental form of a spacelike section depends\non a sum of two terms, one determined by the Hubble parameter, the other by the\nextrinsic torsion.",

The existing methods have two primary deficiencies: (1) They\nstruggle to simultaneously hold audio-visual sync and achieve clear\npronunciation; (2) They lack the capacity to express user-defined emotions. To\naddress these problems, we propose EmoDubber, an emotion-controllable dubbing\narchitecture that allows users to specify emotion type and emotional intensity\nwhile satisfying high-quality lip sync and pronunciation. Specifically, we\nfirst design Lip-related Prosody Aligning (LPA), which focuses on learning the\ninherent consistency between lip motion and prosody variation by duration level\ncontrastive learning to incorporate reasonable alignment. Then, we design\nPronunciation Enhancing (PE) strategy to fuse the video-level phoneme sequences\nby efficient conformer to improve speech intelligibility. Next, the speaker\nidentity adapting module aims to decode acoustics prior and inject the speaker\nstyle embedding. After that, the proposed Flow-based User Emotion Controlling\n(FUEC) is used to synthesize waveform by flow matching prediction network\nconditioned on acoustics prior. In this process, the FUEC determines the\ngradient direction and guidance scale based on the user's emotion instructions\nby the positive and negative guidance mechanism, which focuses on amplifying\nthe desired emotion while suppressing others.

We propose a\nlattice model of glass called the facilitated random walk (FRW). Each particle\nperforms continuous time random walk in the presence of its own random local\nkinetic constraints. The particles do not interact energetically. Instead, they\ninteract kinetically with a hopping rate resampling rule under which motions of\na particle can randomly perturb the local kinetic constraints of other\nparticles. This dynamic interaction is reversible, following a rate restoration\nrule. A step-by-step reversal of the particle motions exactly restore the\nprevious constraints, modeling randomness quenched in the configuration space\nof glass. The model exhibits stretched exponential relaxation and dynamical\nheterogeneity typical of glasses. Despite the lack of explicit facilitation\nrule, the FRW shows facilitation behaviors closely analogous to those of the\nkinetically constrained models (KCM). The FRW is a coarse-grained version of\nthe distinguishable particle lattice model (DPLM) and this exemplifies that\ncompatible defect and atomistic models can complement each other on the study\nof glass.",

Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nCLEAR achieves a 2.3 dB gain on peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) over the\nexisting state-of-the-art method, DeepJSCC-V. Furthermore, the results verify\nthat CLEAR is robust against varying channel conditions, particularly in\nscenarios characterized by high Doppler shifts and strong phase noise.",

Existing methods frequently encounter difficulties maintaining facial\ncoherence due to misalignments between facial landmarks extracted from driving\nvideos that provide head pose and expression cues and the facial geometry of\nthe reference images. To address this limitation, we introduce the Facial\nLandmarks Transformation (FLT) method, which leverages a 3D Morphable Model to\naddress this limitation. FLT converts 2D landmarks into a 3D face model,\nadjusts the 3D face model to align with the reference identity, and then\ntransforms them back into 2D landmarks to guide the image-to-video generation\nprocess. This approach ensures accurate alignment with the reference facial\ngeometry, enhancing the consistency between generated videos and reference\nimages. Experimental results demonstrate that FLT effectively preserves facial\nidentity, significantly improving pose-guided character animation models.",

While Motor Imagery (MI) offers an intuitive\napproach to BCI control, its practical implementation is often limited by the\nrequirement for expensive devices, extensive training data, and complex\nalgorithms, leading to user fatigue and reduced accessibility. In this paper,\nwe demonstrate that effective MI-BCI control of a mobile robot in real-world\nsettings can be achieved using a fine-tuned Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a\nsliding window, eliminating the need for complex feature extractions for\nreal-time robot control. The fine-tuning process optimizes the convolutional\nand attention layers of the DNN to adapt to each user's daily MI data streams,\nreducing training data by 70% and minimizing user fatigue from extended data\ncollection. Using a low-cost (~$3k), 16-channel, non-invasive, open-source\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) device, four users teleoperated a quadruped robot\nover three days. The system achieved 78% accuracy on a single-day validation\ndataset and maintained a 75% validation accuracy over three days without\nextensive retraining from day-to-day. For real-world robot command\nclassification, we achieved an average of 62% accuracy. By providing empirical\nevidence that MI-BCI systems can maintain performance over multiple days with\nreduced training data to DNN and a low-cost EEG device, our work enhances the\npracticality and accessibility of BCI technology.

Two key\nchallenges in knowledge transfer arise: 1) \\textit{how much} knowledge of\nfacial expression data should be transferred and 2) \\textit{how to} effectively\nleverage transferred knowledge for the deception classification model during\ninference. Specifically, the optimal relation mapping between facial expression\nclasses and deception samples is firstly quantified using proposed H-OTKT\nmodule and then transfers knowledge from the facial expression dataset to\ndeception samples. Moreover, a correlation prototype within another proposed\nmodule SRKB is well designed to retain the invariant correlations between\nfacial expression classes and deception classes through momentum updating.\nDuring inference, the transferred knowledge is fine-tuned with the correlation\nprototype using a sample-specific re-weighting strategy. Experimental results\non two deception detection datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our\nproposed method.

By\nstrategically placing the belt at different layers of the neural network, we\ncan achieve linear or nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction, and by choosing\nthe appropriate transformation families, we can achieve dimension reduction for\nthe conditional distribution or the conditional mean. Moreover, thanks to the\nadvantage of the neural network, the method is very fast to compute, overcoming\na computation bottleneck of the traditional sufficient dimension reduction\nestimators, which involves the inversion of a matrix of dimension either p or\nn.

Changes in the fermion determinant that would suppress some gauge\nfields in the background magnetic field are neglected, leaving improbable gauge\nfields that generate large additive mass renormalisations which manifest as\nsignificant outliers in correlation-function distributions. An algorithm for\nthe systematic identification and removal of these exceptional configurations\nis described.

The heavier mass of\nthe strange quark protects the hyperon correlation functions to some extent.\nHowever, these also benefit from the removal of exceptional configurations.

Our approach harnesses both thermodiffusion and\nphotovoltaic effects to effectively transform waste heat and solar energy into\nelectrical power. Utilizing a top-evaporating surface paired with a bottom\nsilicon-dielectric (core-shell) nanopillar array separated by a liquid layer,\nwe demonstrate significant enhancements in power output under external heating\nand solar illumination. Our findings reveal that in addition to the movement of\na polar solvent (like water and ethanol) and ions in a narrow, partially wetted\ntop electrode region, thermally and light-assisted ion migration from the\nbottom to the top electrode plays a pivotal role in electricity generation.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained Vision Mamba (Vim) models have demonstrated exceptional\nperformance across various computer vision tasks in a computationally efficient\nmanner, attributed to their unique design of selective state space models. To\nfurther extend their applicability to diverse downstream vision tasks, Vim\nmodels can be adapted using the efficient fine-tuning technique known as visual\nprompting. However, existing visual prompting methods are predominantly\ntailored for Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models that leverage global\nattention, neglecting the distinctive sequential token-wise compression and\npropagation characteristics of Vim. Specifically, existing prompt tokens\nprefixed to the sequence are insufficient to effectively activate the input and\nforget gates across the entire sequence, hindering the extraction and\npropagation of discriminative information. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce a novel Selective Visual Prompting (SVP) method specifically for the\nefficient fine-tuning of Vim. To prevent the loss of discriminative information\nduring state space propagation, SVP employs lightweight selective prompters for\ntoken-wise prompt generation, ensuring adaptive activation of the update and\nforget gates within Mamba blocks to promote discriminative information\npropagation. Moreover, considering that Vim propagates both shared cross-layer\ninformation and specific inner-layer information, we further refine SVP with a\ndual-path structure: Cross-Prompting and Inner-Prompting. Cross-Prompting\nutilizes shared parameters across layers, while Inner-Prompting employs\ndistinct parameters, promoting the propagation of both shared and specific\ninformation, respectively. Extensive experimental results on various\nlarge-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed SVP significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose MoSLD, a\nmixture-of-shared-LoRAs model with a dropout strategy.

    "abstract": "Deep clustering is an emerging topic in deep learning where traditional\nclustering is performed in deep learning feature space. However, clustering and\ndeep learning are often mutually exclusive. In the autoencoder based deep\nclustering, the challenge is how to jointly optimize both clustering and\ndimension reduction together, so that the weights in the hidden layers are not\nonly guided by reconstruction loss, but also by a loss function associated with\nclustering. The current state-of-the-art has two fundamental flaws. First, they\nrely on the mathematical convenience of Kullback-Leibler divergence for the\nclustering loss function but the former is asymmetric. Secondly, they assume\nthe prior knowledge on the number of clusters is always available for their\ndataset of interest. This paper tries to improve on these problems. In the\nfirst problem, we use a Jensen-Shannon divergence to overcome the asymmetric\nissue, specifically using a closed form variant. Next, we introduce an infinite\ncluster representation using Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model for joint\nclustering and model selection in the latent space which we called deep model\nselection. The number of clusters in the latent space are not fixed but instead\nvary accordingly as they gradually approach the optimal number during training.\nThus, prior knowledge is not required. We evaluate our proposed deep model\nselection method with traditional model selection on large class number\ndatasets such as MIT67 and CIFAR100 and also compare with both traditional\nvariational Bayes model and deep clustering method with convincing results.",

    "abstract": "Recently, prompt tuning methods for pre-trained models have demonstrated\npromising performance in Class Incremental Learning (CIL). These methods\ntypically involve learning task-specific prompts and predicting the task ID to\nselect the appropriate prompts for inference. However, inaccurate task ID\npredictions can cause severe inconsistencies between the prompts used during\ntraining and inference, leading to knowledge forgetting and performance\ndegradation. Additionally, existing prompt tuning methods rely solely on the\npre-trained model to predict task IDs, without fully leveraging the knowledge\nembedded in the learned prompt parameters, resulting in inferior prediction\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose a novel Cyclic Prompt\nAggregation (CAPrompt) method that eliminates the dependency on task ID\nprediction by cyclically aggregating the knowledge from different prompts.\nSpecifically, rather than predicting task IDs, we introduce an innovative\nprompt aggregation strategy during both training and inference to overcome\nprompt inconsistency by utilizing a weighted sum of different prompts. Thorough\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that under concave conditions, the aggregated\nprompt achieves lower error compared to selecting a single task-specific\nprompt. Consequently, we incorporate a concave constraint and a linear\nconstraint to guide prompt learning, ensuring compliance with the concave\ncondition requirement. Furthermore, to fully exploit the prompts and achieve\nmore accurate prompt weights, we develop a cyclic weight prediction strategy.\nThis strategy begins with equal weights for each task and automatically adjusts\nthem to more appropriate values in a cyclical manner. Experiments on various\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed CAPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods by 2%-3%.

    "abstract": "In this paper we accomplish three things: (i) We discover the geometric\n(true) regularity of affine connections, their essential (highest possible)\nregularity, a geometric property independent of starting atlas. (ii) We give a\ncheckable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether or not\nconnections are at their essential regularity, based on the relative regularity\nof the connection and its Riemann curvature. (iii) We introduce a computable\nprocedure for lifting any $L^p$ affine connection in an atlas ($p>n$), to a new\natlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. To accomplish\nthis, we prove that the RT-equations, originally designed by the authors to\nlocally lift the regularity of singular connections by just one derivative,\nsurprisingly, also induce an implicit hidden regularization of the Riemann\ncurvature tensor, together with a global regularization of transition maps\nbetween regularizing coordinate charts. From this we deduce a multi-step\nregularization of the connection, and construct a new atlas in which the\nconnection exhibits its essential regularity. The present paper is a\nculmination of the theory of the RT-equations which provides a definitive\ntheory for determining whether or not singularities in an $L^p$ affine\nconnection ($p>n$) are essential or removable by coordinate transformation,\ntogether with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to\ntheir essential regularity, both locally and globally. This includes GR shock\nwave singularities and cusp singularities (continuous metrics with infinite\ngradients), both obstacles to numerical simulation.

    "abstract": "Background. The excess mortality rate in Aotearoa New Zealand during the\nCovid-19 pandemic is frequently estimated to be among the lowest in the world.\nHowever, to facilitate international comparisons, many of the methods that have\nbeen used to estimate excess mortality do not use age-stratified data on deaths\nand population size, which may compromise their accuracy.\n  Methods. We used a quasi-Poisson regression model for monthly all-cause\ndeaths among New Zealand residents, controlling for age, sex and seasonality.\nWe fitted the model to deaths data for 2014-19. We estimated monthly excess\nmortality for 2020-23 as the difference between actual deaths and projected\ndeaths according to the model. We conducted sensitivity analysis on the length\nof the pre-pandemic period used to fit the model. We benchmarked our results\nagainst a simple linear regression on the standardised annual mortality rate.\n  Results. We estimated cumulative excess mortality in New Zealand in 2020-23\nwas 1040 (95% confidence interval [-1134, 2927]), equivalent to 0.7% [-0.8%,\n2.0%] of expected mortality. Excess mortality was negative in 2020-21. The\nmagnitude, timing and age-distribution of the positive excess mortality in\n2022-23 were closely matched with confirmed Covid-19 deaths.\n  Conclusions. Negative excess mortality in 2020-21 reflects very low levels of\nCovid-19 and major reductions in seasonal respiratory diseases during this\nperiod. In 2022-23, Covid-19 deaths were the main contributor to excess\nmortality and there was little or no net non-Covid-19 excess. Overall, New\nZealand experienced one of the lowest rates of pandemic excess mortality in the\nworld.",

We illustrate\nthis measure of the value a component model adds to an ensemble in the presence\nof other models using US COVID-19 death forecasts. This study offers valuable\ninsight into individual models' unique features within an ensemble, which\nstandard accuracy metrics alone cannot reveal.",

    "abstract": "Modern cloud computing workloads are composed of multiresource jobs that\nrequire a variety of computational resources in order to run, such as CPU\ncores, memory, disk space, or hardware accelerators. A single cloud server can\ntypically run many multiresource jobs in parallel, but only if the server has\nsufficient resources to satisfy the demands of every job. A scheduling policy\nmust therefore select sets of multiresource jobs to run in parallel in order to\nminimize the mean response time across jobs -- the average time from when a job\narrives to the system until it is completed. Unfortunately, achieving low\nresponse times by selecting sets of jobs that fully utilize the available\nserver resources has proven to be a difficult problem.\n  In this paper, we develop and analyze a new class of policies for scheduling\nmultiresource jobs, called Markovian Service Rate (MSR) policies. While prior\nscheduling policies for multiresource jobs are either highly complex to analyze\nor hard to implement, our MSR policies are simple to implement and are amenable\nto response time analysis. We show that the class of MSR policies is\nthroughput-optimal in that we can use an MSR policy to stabilize the system\nwhenever it is possible to do so. We also derive bounds on the mean response\ntime under an MSR algorithm that are tight up to an additive constant. These\nbounds can be applied to systems with different preemption behaviors, such as\nfully preemptive systems, non-preemptive systems, and systems that allow\npreemption with setup times. We show how our theoretical results can be used to\nselect a good MSR policy as a function of the system arrival rates, job service\nrequirements, the server's resource capacities, and the resource demands of the\njobs.",

However, this often entails a more\ncomplex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts\nbetween objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and\ncomputational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective\nGoal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically\nlearning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL\nextends the conventional GCSL method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining\ngoals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. It benefits\nfrom naturally eliminating the need for complex architectures and optimization\nconstraints. Moreover, MOGCSL effectively filters out uninformative or noisy\ninstances that fail to achieve desirable long-term rewards across multiple\nobjectives. We also introduces a novel goal-selection algorithm for MOGCSL to\nmodel and identify \"high\" achievable goals for inference.\n  While MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action\nprediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context,\nany viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large\namounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space.

    "abstract": "Automatic Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is an important topic for\nalleviating the substantial workload of radiologists. Existing RRG approaches\nrely on supervised regression based on different architectures or additional\nknowledge injection,while the generated report may not align optimally with\nradiologists' preferences. Especially, since the preferences of radiologists\nare inherently heterogeneous and multidimensional, e.g., some may prioritize\nreport fluency, while others emphasize clinical accuracy. To address this\nproblem,we propose a new RRG method via Multi-objective Preference Optimization\n(MPO) to align the pre-trained RRG model with multiple human preferences, which\ncan be formulated by multi-dimensional reward functions and optimized by\nmulti-objective reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we use a preference\nvector to represent the weight of preferences and use it as a condition for the\nRRG model. Then, a linearly weighed reward is obtained via a dot product\nbetween the preference vector and multi-dimensional reward. Next,the RRG model\nis optimized to align with the preference vector by optimizing such a reward\nvia RL. In the training stage,we randomly sample diverse preference vectors\nfrom the preference space and align the model by optimizing the weighted\nmulti-objective rewards, which leads to an optimal policy on the entire\npreference space. When inference,our model can generate reports aligned with\nspecific preferences without further fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on two\npublic datasets show the proposed method can generate reports that cater to\ndifferent preferences in a single model and achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

However, manual\nanalysis of these IEDs, which appear as epileptic spikes, from the large amount\nof MEG/EEG data is labor intensive and requires high expertise. Although\nautomated methods have been developed to address this challenge, current\napproaches fail to fully emulate clinical experts' diagnostic intelligence in\ntwo key aspects: (1) their analysis on the input signals is limited to short\ntemporal windows matching individual spike durations, missing the extended\ncontextual patterns clinicians use to assess significance; and (2) they fail to\nadequately capture the dipole patterns with simultaneous positive-negative\npotential distributions across adjacent sensors that serve as clinicians' key\ndiagnostic criterion for IED identification. To bridge this artificial-human\nintelligence gap, we propose a novel deep learning framework LV-CadeNet that\nintegrates two key innovations: (1) a Long-View morphological feature\nrepresentation that mimics expert clinicians' comprehensive assessment of both\nlocal spike characteristics and long-view contextual information, and (2) a\nhierarchical Encoder-Decoder NETwork that employs Convolution-Attention blocks\nfor multi-scale spatiotemporal feature learning with progressive abstraction.\nExtensive evaluations confirm the superior performance of LV-CadeNet, which\noutperforms six state-of-the-art methods in EEG spike classification on TUEV,\nthe largest public EEG spike dataset.

Unlike previous\nworks in wideband DoA estimation and detection, where the signals were modeled\nin the time-frequency domain, we directly model the time-domain representation\nand treat the non-causal part of the source signal as latent variables.\nFurthermore, our Bayesian model allows for closed-form marginalization of the\nlatent source signals by leveraging conjugacy. To further speed up computation,\nwe exploit the sparse ``stripe matrix structure'' of the considered system,\nwhich stems from the circulant matrix representation of linear time-invariant\n(LTI) systems. This drastically reduces the time complexity of computing the\nlikelihood from $\\mathcal{O}(N^3 k^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N k^3)$, where $N$ is\nthe number of samples received by the array and $k$ is the number of sources.\nThese computational improvements allow for efficient posterior inference\nthrough reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC). We use the\nnon-reversible extension of RJMCMC (NRJMCMC), which often achieves lower\nautocorrelation and faster convergence than the conventional reversible\nvariant. Detection, estimation, and reconstruction of the latent source signals\ncan then all be performed in a fully Bayesian manner through the samples drawn\nusing NRJMCMC. We evaluate the detection performance of the procedure by\ncomparing against generalized likelihood ratio testing (GLRT) and information\ncriteria.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing low-energy (O(1keV)) nuclear recoils near the detector\nthreshold is one of the major challenges for large direct dark matter\ndetectors. To that end, we have successfully used a Yttrium-Beryllium\nphotoneutron source that emits 152 keV neutrons for the calibration of the\nlight and charge yields of the XENONnT experiment for the first time. After\ndata selection, we accumulated 474 events from 183 hours of exposure with this\nsource. The expected background was $55 \\pm 12$ accidental coincidence events,\nestimated using a dedicated 152 hour background calibration run with a\nYttrium-PVC gamma-only source and data-driven modeling. From these\ncalibrations, we extracted the light yield and charge yield for liquid xenon at\nour field strength of 23 V/cm between 0.5 keV$_{\\rm NR}$ and 5.0 keV$_{\\rm NR}$\n(nuclear recoil energy in keV). This calibration is crucial for accurately\nmeasuring the solar $^8$B neutrino coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering\nand searching for light dark matter particles with masses below 12 GeV/c$^2$.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has given\nrise to diverse training paradigms to learn the policies of each agent in the\nmulti-agent system. The paradigms of decentralized training and execution\n(DTDE) and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) have been\nproposed and widely applied. However, as the number of agents increases, the\ninherent limitations of these frameworks significantly degrade the performance\nmetrics, such as win rate, total reward, etc. To reduce the influence of the\nincreasing number of agents on the performance metrics, we propose a novel\ntraining paradigm of grouped training decentralized execution (GTDE). This\nframework eliminates the need for a centralized module and relies solely on\nlocal information, effectively meeting the training requirements of large-scale\nmulti-agent systems. Specifically, we first introduce an adaptive grouping\nmodule, which divides each agent into different groups based on their\nobservation history. To implement end-to-end training, GTDE uses Gumbel-Sigmoid\nfor efficient point-to-point sampling on the grouping distribution while\nensuring gradient backpropagation. To adapt to the uncertainty in the number of\nmembers in a group, two methods are used to implement a group information\naggregation module that merges member information within the group. Empirical\nresults show that in a cooperative environment with 495 agents, GTDE increased\nthe total reward by an average of 382\\% compared to the baseline. In a\ncompetitive environment with 64 agents, GTDE achieved a 100\\% win rate against\nthe baseline.",

As a geometric method based on the\nsimplest dynamics, it is independent of empirical calibration and the\nsystematics caused by model selections can be tested using nearby binaries with\nknown distances.

Based on\nthis equivalence, we provide a representation of the dominated Dirichlet form\nusing the bivariate Revuz measure associated with the killing transformation\nand further characterize the sandwiched Dirichlet form within the broader\nDirichlet form framework. In particular, our findings apply to the\ncharacterization of operators sandwiched between the Dirichlet Laplacian and\nthe Neumann Laplacian.

    "abstract": "EL CVn-type systems represent a rare evolutionary stage in binary star\nevolution, providing ideal laboratories for investigating stable mass transfer\nprocesses and the formation of extremely low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs). The\nTransiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has delivered an extensive\ncollection of high-precision time-domain photometric data, which is invaluable\nfor studying EL CVn binaries. In this study, we identified 29 EL CVn systems\nfrom the TESS eclipsing binary catalogs (sectors 1-65), 11 of which are newly\ndiscovered. These systems consist of smaller, hotter pre-He white dwarfs and\nA/F main-sequence stars. The orbital periods of these binaries range from 0.64\nto 2.5 days. Utilizing TESS light curves, Gaia distances, and multi-band\nphotometric data (e.g., GALEX, 2MASS, WISE, SkyMapper), we modeled the light\ncurves and spectral energy distributions to derive system parameters, including\neffective temperatures, masses, and radii. These systems were then compared\nwith the white dwarf mass-period relation and the evolutionary tracks of ELM\nWDs. The comparison reveals that these binaries are consistent with the\nexpected mass-period relation for white dwarfs and align well with the\nevolutionary tracks on the Teff-logg diagram for ELM WDs. This result suggests\nthat these EL CVn systems likely formed through stable mass transfer processes.\nWe provide a catalog of complete parameters for 29 EL CVn systems identified\nfrom the TESS survey. This catalog will serve as an essential resource for\nstudying binary mass transfer, white dwarf formation, and pulsation phenomena\nin EL CVn-type systems.",

To generate samples, they numerically\nintegrate Hamiltonian or Langevin dynamics. This numerical integration\nintroduces an asymptotic bias in Monte Carlo estimators of expectation values,\nwhich can be eliminated by adjusting the dynamics with a Metropolis-Hastings\n(MH) proposal step. Alternatively, one can trade bias for variance by avoiding\nMH, and select an integration step size that ensures sufficiently small\nasymptotic bias, relative to the variance inherent in a finite set of samples.\nSuch unadjusted methods often significantly outperform their adjusted\ncounterparts in high-dimensional problems where sampling would otherwise be\nprohibitively expensive, yet are rarely used in statistical applications due to\nthe absence of an automated way of choosing a step size. We propose just such\nan automatic tuning scheme that takes a user-provided asymptotic bias tolerance\nand selects a step size that ensures it. The key to the method is a\nrelationship we establish between the energy error in the integration and\nasymptotic bias. For Gaussians, we show that this procedure rigorously bounds\nthe asymptotic bias. We then numerically show that the procedure works beyond\nGaussians, on typical Bayesian problems. To demonstrate the practicality of the\nproposed scheme, we provide a comprehensive comparison of adjusted and\nunadjusted samplers, showing that with our tuning scheme, the unadjusted\nmethods achieve close to optimal performance and significantly and consistently\noutperform their adjusted counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Many existing approaches to generalizing statistical inference amidst\ndistribution shift operate under the covariate shift assumption, which posits\nthat the conditional distribution of unobserved variables given observable ones\nis invariant across populations. However, recent empirical investigations have\ndemonstrated that adjusting for shift in observed variables (covariate shift)\nis often insufficient for generalization. In other words, covariate shift does\nnot typically ``explain away'' the distribution shift between settings. As\nsuch, addressing the unknown yet non-negligible shift in the unobserved\nvariables given observed ones (conditional shift) is crucial for generalizable\ninference.\n  In this paper, we present a series of empirical evidence from two large-scale\nmulti-site replication studies to support a new role of covariate shift in\n``predicting'' the strength of the unknown conditional shift. Analyzing 680\nstudies across 65 sites, we find that even though the conditional shift is\nnon-negligible, its strength can often be bounded by that of the observable\ncovariate shift. However, this pattern only emerges when the two sources of\nshifts are quantified by our proposed standardized, ``pivotal'' measures. We\nthen interpret this phenomenon by connecting it to similar patterns that can be\ntheoretically derived from a random distribution shift model. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that exploiting the predictive role of covariate shift leads to\nreliable and efficient uncertainty quantification for target estimates in\ngeneralization tasks with partially observed data. Overall, our empirical and\ntheoretical analyses suggest a new way to approach the problem of\ndistributional shift, generalizability, and external validity.",

We confirm a\npseudo-direct- to direct-gap transition under $\\sim 2$\\% [0001] uniaxial\ntension, which can enhance $B$ by up to three orders of magnitude, making it\ncomparable to that of InAs. Beyond quantifying strong enhancement of $B$ via\nstrain engineering, our analysis suggests the dominance of additional, as-yet\nunquantified recombination mechanisms in this nascent material.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic prediction of stochastic dynamical systems (SDSs) aims to\naccurately predict the conditional probability distributions of future states.\nHowever, accurate probabilistic predictions tightly hinge on accurate\ndistributional information from a nominal model, which is hardly available in\npractice. To address this issue, we propose a novel functional-maximin-based\ndistributionally robust probabilistic prediction (DRPP) framework. In this\nframework, one can design probabilistic predictors that have worst-case\nperformance guarantees over a pre-defined ambiguity set of SDSs. Nevertheless,\nDRPP requires optimizing over the function space of probability distributions,\nwhich is generally intractable. We develop a methodology that equivalently\ntransforms the original maximin in function spaces into convex-nonconcave\nminimax in Euclidean spaces. Although it remains intractable to seek a global\noptimal solution, two suboptimal solutions are derived. By relaxing the inner\nconstraints, we obtain a suboptimal predictor called Noise-DRPP. Relaxing the\nouter constraints yields another suboptimal predictor, Eig-DRPP. More\nimportantly, we establish an explicit upper bound on the optimality gap between\nEig-DRPP and the global optimal predictor. Utilizing the theoretical results\nobtained from solving the two suboptimal predictors, we synthesize practical\nrules to judge whether the pre-defined ambiguity set is too large or small.\nFinally, we conduct elaborate numerical simulations to compare the performance\nof different predictors under different SDSs.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents OG-RAG, an Ontology-Grounded Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration method designed to enhance LLM-generated responses by anchoring\nretrieval processes in domain-specific ontologies. While LLMs are widely used\nfor tasks like question answering and search, they struggle to adapt to\nspecialized knowledge, such as industrial workflows or knowledge work, without\nexpensive fine-tuning or sub-optimal retrieval methods. Existing\nretrieval-augmented models, such as RAG, offer improvements but fail to account\nfor structured domain knowledge, leading to suboptimal context generation.\nOntologies, which conceptually organize domain knowledge by defining entities\nand their interrelationships, offer a structured representation to address this\ngap. OG-RAG constructs a hypergraph representation of domain documents, where\neach hyperedge encapsulates clusters of factual knowledge grounded using\ndomain-specific ontology. An optimization algorithm then retrieves the minimal\nset of hyperedges that constructs a precise, conceptually grounded context for\nthe LLM. This method enables efficient retrieval while preserving the complex\nrelationships between entities. OG-RAG applies to domains where fact-based\nreasoning is essential, particularly in tasks that require workflows or\ndecision-making steps to follow predefined rules and procedures. These include\nindustrial workflows in healthcare, legal, and agricultural sectors, as well as\nknowledge-driven tasks such as news journalism, investigative research,\nconsulting and more. Our evaluations demonstrate that OG-RAG increases the\nrecall of accurate facts by 55% and improves response correctness by 40% across\nfour different LLMs. Additionally, OG-RAG enables 30% faster attribution of\nresponses to context and boosts fact-based reasoning accuracy by 27% compared\nto baseline methods.",

The velocity of the such states traveling along the edge of the\ntopological insulator is typically determined by their Bloch momentum. In\ncontrast, here, using valley Hall edge states forming at the domain wall\nbetween two honeycomb lattices with broken inversion symmetry, we show that by\nimposing Airy envelope on them one can construct edge states which, on the one\nhand, exhibit \\textit{self-acceleration} along the boundary of the insulator\ndespite their fixed Bloch momentum and, on the other hand, \\textit{do not\ndiffract} along the boundary despite the presence of localized features in\ntheir shapes. We construct both linear and nonlinear self-accelerating edge\nstates, and show that nonlinearity considerably affects their envelopes. Such\nself-accelerating edge states exhibit self-healing properties typical for\nnondiffracting beams.

    "abstract": "We examine the effects of electromagnetic field non-linearities in $3$\nspace-time dimensions. We focus on how these non-linearities influence\npermittivity and susceptibility. This, in turn, leads to changes in the\nrefractive index through the use of the dispersion relation in the context of\nmassless and massive non-linear electrodynamics. We also verify that, by\ninspecting the model addressed in the frequency/wave vector space, we identify\nthe characteristics of a non-local material in the behavior of the vacuum,\nwhich exhibits a spatially-dispersive profile. Furthermore, it is important to\nhighlight that the cause of this phenomenon is the de Broglie-Proca mass term.\nWe subsequently investigate the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a moving\ncharged particle interacting with a medium for massless and massive non-linear\nelectrodynamics. Our findings indicate that the radiation is driven by the\nmedium through which the particle travels, similar to what is observed in the\nCherenkov effect.",

We focus on Mg II emission from galaxies and their outskirts to\nexplore the cold gas within galaxies and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We\nmodel Mg II spectra for 167 individual galaxies and stacked data for different\nstellar mass bins. The Mg II spectrum and surface brightness vary significantly\nwith stellar mass. In low-mass galaxies ($M_*/M_\\odot<10^9$), Mg II emission is\nobserved in both core ($R_{\\rm p}<$ 10 kpc) and halo regions (10 kpc $<R_{\\rm\np}<$ 30 kpc), while in higher mass galaxies ($M_*/M_\\odot>10^{10}$), strong\ncore absorption and more extended halo emission are prominent. This indicates\nthat more massive galaxies have more cold gas. Radiative transfer modeling\nallows us to investigate key parameters such as the Mg II column density\n$N_{\\rm MgII}$ and the outflow velocity $v_{\\rm exp}$. We identify a negative\ncorrelation between $N_{\\rm MgII}$ and $v_{\\rm exp}$. Since higher stellar mass\ngalaxies exhibit a higher $N_{\\rm MgII}$ and lower $v_{\\rm exp}$, this suggests\nan abundance of slowly moving cold gas in massive galaxies. In addition, the\nfitting results of halo spectra indicate the presence of intrinsic Mg II\nabsorption and strong anisotropy of the cold gas distribution around massive\ngalaxies. This study is not only a proof-of-concept of modeling spatially\nvarying Mg II spectra but also enhances our understanding of the CGM and\nprovides insights into the mass-dependent properties of cold gas in and around\ngalaxies.",

By employing\nan exponential coupling function and a scalar potential with dual asymptotic\nplateaus, our model naturally transitions from inflationary dynamics at small\nfield values to a quintessence-like behavior at large field values. We derive\nthe inflationary predictions for the spectral index ($n_s$) and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in agreement with current observational\nconstraints. For late-time acceleration, the model produces a viable dark\nenergy component with an equation of state $w_\\phi$ approaching $-1$ but\nretaining a measurable deviation that could serve as an observational\nsignature.

    "abstract": "Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, host a supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nat the center. These SMBHs can be observed out to high redshifts (z>=6) if the\naccretion rate is sufficiently large. However, we do not fully understand the\nmechanism through which these black holes form at early times. The heavy (or\ndirect collapse) seeding mechanism has emerged as a probable contender in which\nthe core of an atomic cooling halo directly collapses into a dense stellar\ncluster that could host supermassive stars that proceed to form a BH seed of\nmass ~10^5 M_sun. We use the Renaissance simulations to investigate the\nproperties of 35 DCBH candidate host halos at z=15-24 and compare them to\nnon-candidate halos. We aim to understand what features differentiate halos\ncapable of hosting a DCBH from the general halo population with the use of\nstatistical analysis and machine learning methods. We examine 18 halo, central,\nand environmental properties. We find that DCBH candidacy is more dependent on\na halo's core internal properties than on exterior factors such as Lyman-Werner\nflux and distance to closest galaxy; our analysis selects density and radial\nmass influx as the most important features (outside candidacy establishing\nfeatures). Our results concur with the recent suggestion that DCBH host halos\nneither need to lie within a \"Goldilocks zone\" nor have a significant amount of\nLyman-Werner flux to suppress cooling. This paper presents insight to the\ndynamics possibly occurring in potential DCBH host halos and seeks to provide\nguidance to DCBH subgrid formation models.",

Spatial point pattern modeling can be\nused to partition multiplex tissue images according to these regimes. To this\nend, we propose a two-stage approach: first, local intensities and pair\ncorrelation functions are estimated from the spatial point pattern of cells\nwithin each image, and the pair correlation functions are reduced in dimension\nvia spectral decomposition of the covariance function. Second, the estimates\nare clustered in a Bayesian hierarchical model with spatially-dependent cluster\nlabels. The clusters correspond to regimes of interest that are present across\nsubjects; the cluster labels segment the spatial point patterns according to\nthose regimes.
