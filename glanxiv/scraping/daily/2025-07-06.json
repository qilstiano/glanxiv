Recent works\n\\cite{AG2023,ABCGZ2023,G2025} have shown that if a constant fraction of the\ncolor classes are non-star, then the rainbow girth is $O(\\log n)$. In this\nnote, we extend these results, and we show that even a small fraction of\nnon-star color classes suffices to ensure logarithmic rainbow girth. We also\nprove that the logarithmic bound is of the right order of magnitude. Moreover,\nwe determine the threshold fraction between the types of color classes at which\nthe rainbow girth transitions from linear to logarithmic.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) is a key alloying element that enhances the performance of\nFe-Ni-Cr austenitic stainless steels, improving austenite stability, corrosion\nresistance, and yield strength. However, the role of N in modifying chemical\nordering, particularly short-range order (SRO) and long-range order (LRO), is\ncomplex due to the multi-sublattice nature and magnetic interactions in these\nalloys. In this work, we combine first-principles calculations with the spin\ncluster expansion (spin CE) method to systematically investigate the effects of\nN on chemical ordering in Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Our atomistic models confirm a\nstrong affinity between N and Cr, which drives the formation of N-Cr SRO and,\nat higher N concentrations, stabilizes M4N-type ordered phases (M = metal).\nMonte Carlo simulations reveal that low N concentrations promote local N-Cr or\nN-N SRO, while increasing N content leads to the emergence of Cr-and N-rich LRO\nstructures. We also show that the presence of N suppresses intrinsic Fe-Cr and\nNi-Cr SRO by competing with these interactions, particularly at high\nconcentrations. The impact of Cr content on ordering diminishes as N approaches\nits solubility limit. These findings are consistent with experimental\nobservations in high-N austenitic steels. Finally, we discuss the influence of\nkinetic and magnetic effects on SRO evolution in high-N alloys. This study\nprovides a comprehensive framework for understanding N-driven chemical ordering\nand offers insights into microstructural changes during nitriding processes.",

Kopelowitz and\nKrauthgamer [CPM2016] showed upper bound tradeoffs and conditional lower bounds\ntradeoffs for the snippets problem, by utilizing connections between the\nsnippets problem and the problem of constructing a color distance oracle (CDO),\nwhich is a data structure that preprocess a set of points with associated\ncolors so that given two colors $c$ and $c'$ one can quickly find the (distance\nbetween the) closest pair of points with colors $c$ and $c'$. However, the\nexisting upper bound and lower bound curves are not tight.\n  Inspired by recent advances by Kopelowitz and Vassilevska-Williams\n[ICALP2020] regarding Set-disjointness data structures, we introduce new\nconditionally optimal algorithms for $(1+\\varepsilon)$ approximation versions\nof the snippets problem and the CDO problem, by applying fast matrix\nmultiplication. For example, for CDO on $n$ points in an array with\npreprocessing time $\\tilde{O}(n^a)$ and query time $\\tilde{O}(n^b)$, assuming\nthat $\\omega=2$ (where $\\omega$ is the exponent of $n$ in the runtime of the\nfastest matrix multiplication algorithm on two squared matrices of size\n$n\\times n$), we show that approximate CDO can be solved with the following\ntradeoff\n  $$ a + 2b = 2 \\text{ if } 0 \\leq b \\leq \\frac1 3$$ $$ 2a + b = 3 \\text{ if }\n\\frac13\\leq b \\leq 1.$$\n  Moreover, we prove that for exact CDO on points in an array, the algorithm of\nKopelowitz and Krauthgamer [CPM2016], is essentially optimal assuming that the\nstrong APSP hypothesis holds for randomized algorithms.

However, recent experiments suggest that stabilized fracture of\ncathode active materials in liquid electrolytes can increase electrochemically\nactive surfaces, shorten diffusion pathway, enhance (de)lithiation and improve\noverall capacity. To decipher the fundamental couplings between electrolyte\nwetting and fracture evolution and evaluate their influences on macroscopic\nbattery performance, we conducted an integrated experiment-simulation study on\n$\\alpha$-V2O5 single crystals and polycrystalline NCM as model cathode\nmaterials. Despite synthesis challenges, single-crystal $\\alpha$-V2O5 offers\nclearer fundamental insights than polycrystalline counterparts with\ngrain-boundary complexities. Fracture patterns and lithiation heterogeneities\non the samples were mapped using advanced scanning techniques after chemical\n(de)lithiation cycles, exhibiting excellent agreements with simulations by the\ndeveloped multiphysics model. Results reveal a mutually reinforcing interplay\nbetween wetting and fracture: (i) electrolyte infiltration at fracture surfaces\nenhances (de)lithiation and compositional heterogeneity; (ii) wetting\ninfluences fracture dynamics, including fracture modes, propagation distance\nand directionality. The validated modelling framework is further applied to\nsimulations on polycrystalline NCM particles under constant-current\n(dis)charging, highlighting the critical role of wetting in promoting fracture\nand improving overall capacity.

As we show this class of models describe both inflation and the\ndark energy era in a viable way compatible with the Planck constraints on\ninflation and the cosmological parameters. Regarding the inflationary era, the\nexponentially deformed $R^2$ model also yields a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term\nwhich remarkably does not affect the dynamics and the inflationary evolution is\nidentical to that of an $R^2$ model. The dark energy era is also found to be\nviable and mimics the $\\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. More importantly, this\nclass of $F(R)$ gravity exponential $R^2$ deformations also has an important\ncharacteristic, and specifically it yields total equation of state oscillations\ndeeply in the matter domination era, for redshifts $z\\sim 3400$, so near the\nmatter-radiation equality. These total equation of state deformations at such a\nlarge redshift may directly affect the energy spectrum of the primordial\ngravitational waves. Indeed as we show, the effect is measurable and it leads\nto an enhancement of the tensor perturbations energy spectrum for low\nfrequencies probed by the future LiteBIRD mission.

    "abstract": "Base station (BS) association and beam selection in multi-cell drone corridor\nnetworks present unique challenges due to the high altitude, mobility and\nthree-dimensional movement of drones. These factors lead to frequent handovers\nand complex beam alignment issues, especially in environments with dense BS\ndeployments and varying signal conditions. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a channel-twin (CT) enabled resource-allocation framework for\ndrone-corridor communications, where the CT constitutes the radio-channel\ncomponent of a broader digital-twin (DT) environment. The CT supplies\nhigh-fidelity channel-state information (CSI), which drives a two-stage\noptimization procedure. In Stage 1, array-level beamforming weights at each BS\nare selected to maximize antenna gain. In Stage 2, the framework jointly\noptimizes drone-BS-beam associations at discrete corridor way-points to\nmaximize end-to-end throughput. Simulation results confirm that the CT-driven\nstrategy delivers significant throughput gains over baseline methods across\ndiverse operating scenarios, validating the effectiveness of integrating\nprecise digital-twin channel models with cross-layer resource optimization.",

This corner\ncontribution has been proposed as an \"entanglement susceptibility\", a useful\ntool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length\ncritical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner\ncontribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner\ncontribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different\nin each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a\nspecial case of skeletal entanglement.

However, many real-world systems\ndisplay intrinsic randomness, requiring stochastic simulators whose outputs are\nrandom variables. This inherent variability must be accounted for in\nreliability analysis. While Monte Carlo methods can handle this, their high\ncomputational cost is often prohibitive. To address this, stochastic emulators\nhave emerged as efficient surrogate models capable of capturing the random\nresponse of simulators at reduced cost. Although promising, current methods\nstill require large training sets to produce accurate reliability estimates,\nwhich limits their practicality for expensive simulations. This work introduces\nan active learning framework to further reduce the computational burden of\nreliability analysis using stochastic emulators. We focus on stochastic\npolynomial chaos expansions (SPCE) and propose a novel learning function that\ntargets regions of high predictive uncertainty relevant to failure probability\nestimation. To quantify this uncertainty, we exploit the asymptotic normality\nof the maximum likelihood estimator. The resulting method, named active\nlearning stochastic polynomial chaos expansions (AL-SPCE), is applied to three\ntest cases. Results demonstrate that AL-SPCE maintains high accuracy in\nreliability estimates while significantly improving efficiency compared to\nconventional surrogate-based methods and direct Monte Carlo simulation.

    "abstract": "The temporal interpolation task for 4D medical imaging, plays a crucial role\nin clinical practice of respiratory motion modeling. Following the simplified\nlinear-motion hypothesis, existing approaches adopt optical flow-based models\nto interpolate intermediate frames. However, realistic respiratory motions\nshould be nonlinear and quasi-periodic with specific frequencies. Intuited by\nthis property, we resolve the temporal interpolation task from the frequency\nperspective, and propose a Fourier basis-guided Diffusion model, termed\nFB-Diff. Specifically, due to the regular motion discipline of respiration,\nphysiological motion priors are introduced to describe general characteristics\nof temporal data distributions. Then a Fourier motion operator is elaborately\ndevised to extract Fourier bases by incorporating physiological motion priors\nand case-specific spectral information in the feature space of Variational\nAutoencoder. Well-learned Fourier bases can better simulate respiratory motions\nwith motion patterns of specific frequencies. Conditioned on starting and\nending frames, the diffusion model further leverages well-learned Fourier bases\nvia the basis interaction operator, which promotes the temporal interpolation\ntask in a generative manner. Extensive results demonstrate that FB-Diff\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) perceptual performance with better temporal\nconsistency while maintaining promising reconstruction metrics.

There, the signals can be detected, and an image of the\ninternal structure can be reconstructed from the measured signals. The amount\nof information about the interior of the sample that can be obtained from the\ndetected signals at the sample surface is significantly influenced by the\npropagation from the internal structure to the surface. In the real world, all\nsignal propagation is more or less irreversible. The entropy generated during\npropagation corresponds to the loss of information.\n  In an idealized model, such propagating waves, called virtual waves, are\ndescribed by the wave equation. They remain valid solutions of this equation\nwhen the direction of time is reversed, thus exhibiting reversibility and\nshowing no entropy production and therefore no loss of information during\npropagation.\n  We have used the locally computed virtual waves from the measured diffusive\nsurface signals for image reconstruction using established time-of-flight\nmethods from ultrasound or RADAR imaging.

In this paper verbal expressions are converted into\nnumerical scales for a subjective problem instance. The main motivation for our\nresearch was that verbal values in decision tasks are often mechanically\nconverted into numbers, which thus typically do not fully represent the\nrespondent's true evaluation. In our experiment, we conducted a color selection\ntest with 462 subjects by testing six colors (red, green, blue, magenta,\nturquoise, yellow) defined from the Color Namer database on color-calibrated\ntablets in ISO standardized sensory test booths of a sensory laboratory. The\ncolors were evaluated both in a pairwise comparison matrix (indirect ranking\nwith four-item verbal category scale) and on a direct scoring basis. We\ndetermined scales that provide the closest results on average and individually\nto the direct scoring, based on the eigenvector and the logarithmic least\nsquares methods. All results show that the difference between verbal\nexpressions is much smaller than the one used by most of the common numerical\nscales. The respondents' inconsistency was also analyzed, even with a repeated\nquestion regarding their preference between a given pair of colors. It is shown\nthat most decision makers answer fairly similarly for the second time, but\nthere can be significant (even ordinal) differences. The respondents whose\nanswers are further from the original tend to be more inconsistent in general.",

We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference\n(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about\nsensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of\ndocument privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that\nsensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be\nreliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This\nis controlled by a parameter $\\epsilon$: $\\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while\nhigher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion\nworks as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,\n(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so\nthat the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the\nbaseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed.

The physical origin of these ''extended velocity features'' (EVFs) is\nstill debated, although a connection with the ''dust lanes'' of the Galactic\nbar has been hypothesised. In this paper, we search for analogous features in\nthe dust lanes of nearby barred galaxies using the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) survey.\nWe aim to confirm existence of EVFs in other galaxies and to take advantage of\nthe external perspective to gain insight into their origin. We study a sample\nof 29 barred galaxies and find that 34% contain one or more EVFs, while the\nremaining lack obvious signs of EVFs. Upon analysing the physical properties of\nthe EVFs, we find they possess large virial parameters, ranging from few\nhundreds to several thousand, indicating that they are strongly\nout-of-equilibrium. The most likely explanation for their origin is extreme\ncloud-cloud collisions with relative velocities in excess of 100km/s in highly\nnon-circular flow driven by the bar. This interpretation is consistent with\nprevious high-resolution observations in Milky Way. Further corroboration of\nthis interpretation comes from the inspection of high-sensitivity infrared\nobservations from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury Survey that reveals streams of gas\nthat appear to be hitting the dust lanes at locations where EVFs are found.

However, real-world data collection is often biased toward\ncommon scenes and objects, leaving novel cases underrepresented. This imbalance\nhinders model generalization and compromises safety. The core issue is the\ncurse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard\nlogging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of\nredundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to\nbiased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused\non object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.\nThe method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel\ndynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and\ncovariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those\nwith redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training\ndataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher\nredundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more\naggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random\nsampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and\nunpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment\nwith 32 frames per second and is constant over time.

    "abstract": "Optimal transitional mechanisms are analysed for an incompressible shear\nlayer developing over a short, pressure gradient-induced laminar separation\nbubble (LSB) with peak reversed flow of 2%. Although the bubble remains\nglobally stable, the shear layer destabilises due to the amplification of\nexternal time- and spanwise-periodic disturbances. Using linear resolvent\nanalysis (RA), we demonstrate that the pressure gradient modifies boundary\nlayer receptivity, shifting from Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves and streaks\nin a zero pressure gradient (ZPG) environment to Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) and\ncentrifugal instabilities in the presence of the LSB. To characterise the\nnon-linear evolution of these disturbances, we employ the Harmonic-Balanced\nNavier-Stokes (HBNS) framework, solving the Navier-Stokes equations in spectral\nspace with a finite number of Fourier harmonics. Additionally, adjoint\noptimisation is incorporated to identify forcing disturbances that maximise the\nmean skin friction drag, conveniently chosen as the cost function for the\noptimisation problem since it is commonly observed to increase in the\ntransitional stage. Compared to attached boundary layers, this transition\nscenario exhibits both similarities and differences. While oblique T-S\ninstability is replaced by oblique K-H instability, both induce streamwise\nrotational forcing through the quadratic non-linearity of the N-S equations.\nHowever, in separated boundary layers, centrifugal instability first generates\nstrong streamwise vortices due to multiple centrifugal resolvent modes, which\nthen develop into streaks via lift-up. Finally, we show that the progressive\ndistortion and disintegration of K-H rollers, driven by streamwise vortices,\nlead to the breakdown of large coherent structures.",

However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in\nshort-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence\nof image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided\ntrajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon\nmanipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art\nvision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise,\nmanageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based\ntrajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial\nconditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and\nsubstantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned\nDiffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration\ndata and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation\nexperimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms\nclassical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success\nrate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in\nperformance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or\naltered environments.

Comparisons\nwith GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,\nparticularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings\nindicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,\nit is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful\nbenchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural\nimprovements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.",

PSR~B0656+14, known for its sporadic and\nsometimes intense pulses, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate such\nbehaviour at low radio frequencies. This study aims to characterize the single\npulse behaviour of PSR~B0656+14 using low-frequency observations at 110-190 MHz\nfrom the Irish LOFAR station. Single-pulse extraction is performed, and\nindividual pulse DMs are estimated to probe pulse-to-pulse dispersion\nvariability. We also perform a wait-time analysis to understand the statistical\nnature of pulse occurrence, and estimate the spectral index from\nfrequency-resolved flux density measurements. The pulse energy distribution is\nmodelled using a combination of log-normal and power-law components. A total of\n41 pulses were detected in a 5-hour observation, allowing a wait-time\ndistribution analysis which is well-modelled by an exponential function,\nindicative of a Poisson process. Profile stability analysis indicates that a\nsignificant number of pulses are required to reach a stable average profile,\nunusual compared to many other pulsars. The single-pulse spectral index varies\nsignificantly from pulse to pulse, with a mean value of $\\alpha = -0.5$ and a\nstandard deviation of $\\Delta\\alpha=1.3$. The pulse energy distribution shows a\nhybrid behaviour, consistent of a log-normal distribution and a power-law tail.\nOur results confirm that PSR~B0656+14 exhibits highly variable, memory-less\nemission at low frequencies, with characteristics that resemble those seen in\nsome rotating radio transients (RRATs). If such variability proves to be\nwidespread among pulsars, population synthesis models and survey yield\npredictions would need to incorporate this currently overlooked feature to\nensure accuracy.",

In contrast to the classical\napproach of Ginzburg and Zhelezniakov (1958) after which beam-excited Langmuir\nwaves in a two-step process are converted in electromagnetic radiation, any\ninstability is suppressed by selecting a low strahl velocity. Rather electric\nfield oscillations at the electron plasma frequency are triggered by the\ninitially non-compensated current of the strahl. The arising electromagnetic\nfields exhibit amplitude oscillations which are caused by the superposition of\nthe two wave modes of mixed polarisation at the point of mode coupling.

We introduce a block model for constructing\nBSTs by embedding internal BSTs into the nodes of an external BST -- a\nstructure motivated by parallel data architectures -- corresponding to\ncomposite permutations formed via Kronecker or wreath products. Extending\nDevroye's result that the height $h_n$ of a random BST satisfies $h_n / \\log n\n\\to c^* \\approx 4.311$, we show that block BSTs with $nm$ nodes and fixed\nexternal size $m$ satisfy $h_{n,m} / \\log n \\to c^* + h_m$ in distribution. We\nthen study butterfly trees: BSTs generated from permutations built using\niterated Kronecker or wreath products. For simple butterfly trees (from\niterated Kronecker products of $S_2$), we give a full distributional\ndescription showing polynomial height growth: $\\mathbb{E}\nh_n^{\\operatorname{B}} = \\Theta(N^\\alpha)$ with $\\alpha = \\log_2(3/2) \\approx\n0.58496$.

This issue underscores the importance of visual localization\ntechniques in scenarios where GNSS signals are unreliable. This paper proposes\nU-ViLAR, a novel uncertainty-aware visual localization framework designed to\naddress these challenges while enabling adaptive localization using\nhigh-definition (HD) maps or navigation maps. Specifically, our method first\nextracts features from the input visual data and maps them into Bird's-Eye-View\n(BEV) space to enhance spatial consistency with the map input. Subsequently, we\nintroduce: a) Perceptual Uncertainty-guided Association, which mitigates errors\ncaused by perception uncertainty, and b) Localization Uncertainty-guided\nRegistration, which reduces errors introduced by localization uncertainty. By\neffectively balancing the coarse-grained large-scale localization capability of\nassociation with the fine-grained precise localization capability of\nregistration, our approach achieves robust and accurate localization.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple localization tasks.

We reproduce the basic solutions of FLRW cosmology, black\nhole solutions, Lense-Thirring effect, and gravitational waves. The speed of\ngravitational waves is modified in comparison to the speed of light. A certain\nlimit of our theory corresponds to the lowest-order Carroll gravity. Hence, our\ntheory is a different UV completion of Carroll gravity, compared to the usual\nexpansion of a small speed of light. Carroll gravity limit also has an enhanced\nsymmetry, making the reduced or vanishing extrinsic curvature technically\nnatural. Although the intrinsic curvature and its modification may depend on\nthe foliation, we use the covariant formalism and show that such a foliation\nalways exists. Perhaps the most important outcome is that in the non-minimal\ncoupling approach, the intrinsic curvature appearing in Einstein's field\nequations can defer from the one appearing in the geodesic equation potentially\nleading to important observational consequences.",

In contrast to the classical approach\nof Ginzburg and Zhelezniakov (1958) after which beam-excited Langmuir waves in\na two-step process are converted in electromagnetic radiation, the presented\nmechanism works without any instability and wave coalescence. Rather the\nelectric field oscillations at the electron plasma frequency can be triggered\nby different realisations of the driving current, e.g. by the (uncompensated)\nnet current of the strahl at t=0 in a core-strahl plasma or by given current\nvariations which may represent different situations in space, as shocks,\nmagnetic switch-backs etc.. A linearized system of equations is used to\ndescribe the mode coupling occurring at oblique propagation between the mostly\nelectrostatic Langmuir wave and the adjacent electromagnetic left-hand\npolarized (L) wave. The simplicity of the fluid model allows without great\neffort the parameters of the current profiles to be varied and thus to simulate\na wide range of possible experimental conditions. Measurements of Langmuir\nwaves, type III radiation and whistler waves on board various satellites in the\nsolar wind, and in particular some of the recent results of the Parker Solar\nProbe are interpreted in the light of the theoretical model presented.

In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables\nthat influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves\nindicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,\nnormalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic\nuncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method\nregards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that\nreflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate\nthat NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and\ninterpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,\nuncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in\ndomains such as healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The next generation of cosmology surveys will probe the matter distribution\nof the universe to unparalleled precision. To match this level of precision in\ncosmological parameter estimation, we need to use information at small scales\nof $\\sim$ 1 Mpc, which requires an accurate model of baryonic feedback. In this\npaper, we employ the Dark Matter + Baryon (DMB) model, a flexible halo model\nthat is well-fit to various hydrodynamical simulations, to extract information\non baryonic feedback from galaxy cluster observables. Using a sample of thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) selected galaxy clusters from the Atacama Cosmology\nTelescope (ACT) - with masses calibrated via weak lensing from the Dark Energy\nSurvey (DES) - we develop a robust end-to-end pipeline that directly models the\ncalibrated observables. Our analysis demonstrates that the tSZ Y-M relation can\nconstrain several DMB model parameters, providing key insights into baryonic\nfeedback effects on cosmic shear at the several percent level. We find a\npreference for intermediate to strong levels of feedback, which is both\nconsistent with several hydrodynamic simulations and competitive with similar\nanalyses performed on complementary probes. Finally, we discuss the\nimplications of our results in the context of current and upcoming cosmic shear\nsurveys.",

    "abstract": "In the classical \\emph{survivable-network-design problem} (SNDP), we are\ngiven an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, non-negative edge costs, and some\n$(s_i,t_i,r_i)$ tuples, where $s_i,t_i\\in V$ and $r_i\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+$. We seek\na minimum-cost subset $H \\subseteq E$ such that each $s_i$-$t_i$ pair remains\nconnected even if any $r_i-1$ edges fail. It is well-known that SNDP can be\nequivalently modeled using a weakly-supermodular \\emph{cut-requirement\nfunction} $f$, where we seek a minimum-cost edge-set containing at least $f(S)$\nedges across every cut $S \\subseteq V$.\n  Recently, Dinitz et al. proposed a variant of SNDP that enforces a\n\\emph{relative} level of fault tolerance with respect to $G$, where the goal is\nto find a solution $H$ that is at least as fault-tolerant as $G$ itself. They\nformalize this in terms of paths and fault-sets, which gives rise to\n\\emph{path-relative SNDP}. Along these lines, we introduce a new model of\nrelative network design, called \\emph{cut-relative SNDP} (CR-SNDP), where the\ngoal is to select a minimum-cost subset of edges that satisfies the given\n(weakly-supermodular) cut-requirement function to the maximum extent possible,\ni.e., by picking $\\min\\{f(S),|\\delta_G(S)|\\}$ edges across every cut\n$S\\subseteq V$.\n  Unlike SNDP, the cut-relative and path-relative versions of SNDP are not\nequivalent. The resulting cut-requirement function for CR-SNDP (as also\npath-relative SNDP) is not weakly supermodular, and extreme-point solutions to\nthe natural LP-relaxation need not correspond to a laminar family of tight cut\nconstraints. Consequently, standard techniques cannot be used directly to\ndesign approximation algorithms for this problem. We develop a \\emph{novel\ndecomposition technique} to circumvent this difficulty and use it to give a\n\\emph{tight $2$-approximation algorithm for CR-SNDP}. We also show new hardness\nresults for these relative-SNDP problems.",

To this end, we\nintroduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework\nfor few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use\nshallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,\nmodality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are\ninjected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and\nbetter capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we\nincorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to\naggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a\ncross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image\nand text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle\nsarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's\nsuperior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.\nFurther cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across\ndomains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "A quantum key distribution network enables pairs of users to generate\nindependent secret keys by leveraging the principles of quantum physics. For\nend-to-end secure communication, a user pair's secret key must remain secure\nagainst any third parties, including both external eavesdroppers and other\nnetwork users. However, isolating a given user pair from the remaining users\nwhile maintaining a high key rate is challenging when all users are\nintrinsically coupled and correlated, particularly in continuous-variable\nnetworks. This results in either a low key rate, or incomplete end-to-end\nsecurity. Here, we introduce a multi-user security framework, offering a\ngeneral and comprehensive end-to-end key rate formula, against the\ncollaboration of the other network users and eavesdropper. Building on this\nframework, we propose a multi-user protocol that achieves the theoretical upper\nlimit in all practical deployments within a 100 km range. Applied to a\nthree-node network, it achieves an Mbps-level per-user key rate and an overall\nnetwork key rate reaching 90\\% of the upper limit. The proposed solution\nsupports scalable implementations using telecom-compatible components, while\nthe method for obtaining the accessible information in the network is broadly\napplicable and can be extended to various multipartite quantum information\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "In an increasingly interconnected world, protecting electronic devices has\ngrown more crucial because of the dangers of data extraction, reverse\nengineering, and hardware tampering. Producing chips in a third-party\nmanufacturing company can let hackers change the design. As the Internet of\nThings (IoT) proliferates, physical attacks happen more, and conventional\ncryptography techniques do not function well. In this paper, we investigate the\ndesign and assessment of PUFs using the Stanford Memristor Model, utilizing its\nrandom filament evolution to improve security. The system was built using 45nm\nCMOS technology. A comparison is made between CMOS-based and memristor-based\nArbiter PUFs, evaluating their performance under temperature, voltage, and\nprocess variations. Intra- and inter-hamming distances are employed by Monte\nCarlo simulations to estimate uniqueness and reliability. The results show that\nmemristor-based PUFs offer better reliability than CMOS-based designs, though\nuniqueness needs further improvement. Furthermore, this study sheds light on\nthe reasonableness of memristor-based PUFs for secure applications in hardware\nsecurity.",

    "abstract": "We study the homological properties of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ over a field\n$k$ of positive characteristic $p$, focusing on their interplay with the\nrepresentation theory of quotients of group algebras of symmetric groups via\nSchur-Weyl duality. Schur-Weyl duality establishes that the centraliser\nalgebra, $\\Lambda(p, 2p)$, of the tensor space $(k^p)^{\\otimes 2p}$ (as a\nmodule over $S(p, 2p)$) is a quotient of the group algebra of the symmetric\ngroup. In this paper, we prove that Schur-Weyl duality between $S(p, 2p)$ and\n$\\Lambda(p, 2p)$ is an instance of an Auslander-type correspondence.\n  We compute the global dimension of Schur algebras $S(p, 2p)$ and their\nrelative dominant dimension with respect to the tensor space $(k^p)^{\\otimes\n2p}$. In particular, we show that the pair $(S(p, 2p), (k^p)^{\\otimes 2p})$\nforms a relative $4(p-1)$-Auslander pair in the sense of Cruz and Psaroudakis,\nthereby connecting Schur algebras with higher homological algebra. Moreover, we\ndetermine the Hemmer-Nakano dimension associated with the quasi-hereditary\ncover of $\\Lambda(p, 2p)$ that arises from Schur-Weyl duality. As an\napplication, we show that the direct sum of some Young modules over $\\Lambda(p,\n2p)$ is a full tilting module when $p>2$.",

    "abstract": "The most celebrated and extensively studied model of distributed computing is\nthe {\\em message-passing model,} in which each vertex/node of the (distributed\nnetwork) graph corresponds to a static computational device that communicates\nwith other devices through passing messages. In this paper, we consider the\n{\\em agentic model} of distributed computing which extends the message-passing\nmodel in a new direction. In the agentic model, computational devices are\nmodeled as relocatable or mobile computational devices (called agents in this\npaper), i.e., each vertex/node of the graph serves as a container for the\ndevices, and hence communicating with another device requires relocating to the\nsame node. We study two fundamental graph level tasks, leader election, and\nminimum spanning tree, in the agentic model, which will enhance our\nunderstanding of distributed computation across paradigms. The objective is to\nminimize both time and memory complexities. Following the literature, we\nconsider the synchronous setting in which each agent performs its operations\nsynchronously with others, and hence the time complexity can be measured in\nrounds. In this paper, we present two deterministic algorithms for leader\nelection: one for the case of $k<n$ and another for the case of $k=n$,\nminimizing both time and memory complexities, where $k$ and $n$, respectively,\nare the number of agents and number of nodes of the graph. Using these leader\nelection results, we develop deterministic algorithms for agents to construct a\nminimum spanning tree of the graph, minimizing both time and memory\ncomplexities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of\ndistributed graph level tasks in the agentic model with $k\\leq n$. Previous\nstudies only considered the case of $k=n$.",

Understanding sarcastic image-text posts\noften requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or\ncommonsense reasoning.

To address this, we propose \\textbf{MiDRE}\n(\\textbf{Mi}xture of \\textbf{D}ual \\textbf{R}easoning \\textbf{E}xperts), which\nintegrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the\nimage-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured\nrationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language\nModel. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,\nselecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark\ndatasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines.

    "abstract": "Differentially private (DP) optimization has been widely adopted as a\nstandard approach to provide rigorous privacy guarantees for training datasets.\nDP auditing verifies whether a model trained with DP optimization satisfies its\nclaimed privacy level by estimating empirical privacy lower bounds through\nhypothesis testing. Recent O(1) frameworks improve auditing efficiency by\nchecking the membership status of multiple audit samples in a single run,\nrather than checking individual samples across multiple runs. However, we\nreveal that there is no free lunch for this improved efficiency: data\ndependency and an implicit conflict between auditing and utility impair the\ntightness of the auditing results. Addressing these challenges, our key\ninsights include reducing data dependency through uncorrelated data and\nresolving the auditing-utility conflict by decoupling the criteria for\neffective auditing and separating objectives for utility and auditing. We first\npropose a unified framework, UniAud, for data-independent auditing that\nmaximizes auditing power through a novel uncorrelated canary construction and a\nself-comparison framework. We then extend this framework as UniAud++ for\ndata-dependent auditing, optimizing the auditing and utility trade-off through\nmulti-task learning with separate objectives for auditing and training.\nExperimental results validate that our black-box O(1) framework matches the\nstate-of-the-art auditing results of O(T) auditing with thousands of runs,\ndemonstrating the best efficiency-auditing trade-off across vision and language\ntasks. Additionally, our framework provides meaningful auditing with only\nslight utility degradation compared to standard DP training, showing the\noptimal utility-auditing trade-off and the benefit of requiring no extra\ntraining for auditing.",

Second,\nwe sparse the intermediate feature of the binarized decoder by masking\nhomogeneous parts, allowing the decoder to focus on representation with diverse\ndetails while alleviating the computation burden for efficient inference.\nFurthermore, we construct a localized binarization-aware mimicking framework\nwith the information-guided strategy, prompting matting-related representation\nin full-precision counterparts to be accurately and fully utilized.\nComprehensive experiments show that the proposed BiVM surpasses alternative\nbinarized video matting networks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nbinarization methods, by a substantial margin. Moreover, our BiVM achieves\nsignificant savings of 14.3x and 21.6x in computation and storage costs,\nrespectively. We also evaluate BiVM on ARM CPU hardware.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized\nfine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to\ndomain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data\nowners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to\naddress these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the\noriginal model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,\nthe existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack\ntheoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on\ngradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem\nthrough the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies\ncompression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving\nthe gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both\nin terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a\ntheoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution\nfor offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques\nto ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high\ncomputational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,\nparticularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA\n(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses\nEvolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for\ngradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable\nproperties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to\nsparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially\nwhen starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the\nneed for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler\nand more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a\nchallenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we\npropose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the\ndimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our\napproach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based\nmetrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient\nthan gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our\nfindings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based\nalignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.",

Recent advances in robotic reinforcement\nlearning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in\nreal-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world\nfaces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and\nsignificant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a\nsafe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection,\nwhile the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated\nusing real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a\nnovel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and\nreal-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we\nfirst pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment,\nwhich then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values\nusing extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived\nfrom pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from\nthe pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation\ntasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly\nimproves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates.

However, although the electrical conductivity of\nsoil is low, it is not negligible and depends on factors such as soil type and\nsalinity. Moreover, the magnetic permeability of soil varies with its iron\ncontent and is often described as uncooperative. Depending on the ground\nconditions, these soil's properties can influence the induced voltages in the\nmeasurement coils of metal detectors and becomes of increasing importance as\nthe frequency of the exciting current source is increased. In this work, we\ndevelop a new asymptotic expansion for the perturbed magnetic field due to the\npresence of a highly conducting magnetic buried object as its size tends to\nzero, which takes account of the ground conditions. The leading order term of\nthis expansion can be expressed in terms of a complex symmetric rank-2 magnetic\npolarizability tensor, which characterises the object, can assist in its\nidentification, and we provide conditions under which this tensor's\ncoefficients can be computed independently of the ground conditions.

We adopt a\ncategory-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a\ncommuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three\njoys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a\nUQ mechanism, that is, its cardinal UQ capabilities are a structural feature of\nthe method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges the Bayesian, frequentist,\nand imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning.\nFinally, we show that a CPR is the image of a covariant functor. This\nobservation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added\nlocally does not break the global coverage guarantee.",

We\nalso model the interior structure of these planets to infer their possible\ncompositions. Additionally, under the assumption that these exoplanets can\naccrete a gaseous layer, we model the envelope fraction of the habitable\nexoplanets. With an Earth-like rocky composition, LHS 1140 b and TOI-1452 b can\nhold onto negligible amount of their initial gas layer. However, sustaining a\nsufficient amount of atmosphere over time, the planets LP 791-18 c, LTT 3780 c\nand K2-18 b are likely to be water worlds. The models suggest a water rich\ncomposition for TOI-1266 c without any significant amount of atmosphere.\nModeling interior compositions and atmospheric escape scenarios allow us to\nassess the potential habitability of these planets by evaluating the likelihood\nof surface liquid water and the retention of stable atmospheres.",

Classical\nalgorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret\nbound of ${O}(\\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\\log T)$. In\nthis paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum\ncomputing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via\nquantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent\nregret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms.

This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of\nthe problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time\ncomplexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts.

    "abstract": "In recent years, cities have increasingly reduced speed limits from 50 km/h\nto 30 km/h to enhance road safety, reduce noise pollution, and promote\nsustainable modes of transportation. However, achieving compliance with these\nnew limits remains a key challenge for urban planners. This study investigates\ndrivers' compliance with the 30 km/h speed limit in Milan and examines how\nstreet characteristics influence driving behavior. Our findings suggest that\nthe mere introduction of lower speed limits is not sufficient to reduce driving\nspeeds effectively, highlighting the need to understand how street design can\nimprove speed limit adherence. To comprehend this relationship, we apply\ncomputer vision-based semantic segmentation models to Google Street View\nimages. A large-scale analysis reveals that narrower streets and densely built\nenvironments are associated with lower speeds, whereas roads with greater\nvisibility and larger sky views encourage faster driving. To evaluate the\ninfluence of the local context on speeding behaviour, we apply the developed\nmethodological framework to two additional cities: Amsterdam, which, similar to\nMilan, is a historic European city not originally developed for cars, and\nDubai, which instead has developed in recent decades with a more car-centric\ndesign. The results of the analyses largely confirm the findings obtained in\nMilan, which demonstrates the broad applicability of the road design guidelines\nfor driver speed compliance identified in this paper. Finally, we develop a\nmachine learning model to predict driving speeds based on street\ncharacteristics. We showcase the model's predictive power by estimating the\ncompliance with speed limits in Milan if the city were to adopt a 30 km/h speed\nlimit city-wide. The tool provides actionable insights for urban planners,\nsupporting the design of interventions to improve speed limit compliance.",

In\nthis work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task\nof predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps\nin our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt\nto correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually\ncurated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative\nexamples as part of an active learning scheme.

    "abstract": "Telerobotic technologies are becoming increasingly essential in fields such\nas remote surgery, nuclear decommissioning, and space exploration. Reliable\ndatasets and testbeds are essential for evaluating telerobotic system\nperformance prior to real-world deployment. However, there is a notable lack of\ndatasets that capture the impact of network delays, as well as testbeds that\nrealistically model the communication link between the operator and the robot.\nThis paper introduces TeleSim, a network-aware teleoperation dataset and\ntestbed designed to assess the performance of telerobotic applications under\ndiverse network conditions. TeleSim systematically collects performance data\nfrom fine manipulation tasks executed under three predefined network quality\ntiers: High, Medium, and Low. Each tier is characterized through controlled\nsettings of bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss. Using OMNeT++ for\nprecise network simulation, we record a wide range of metrics, including\ncompletion time, success rates, video quality indicators (Peak Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)), and quality of\nservice (QoS) parameters. TeleSim comprises 300 experimental trials, providing\na robust benchmark for evaluating teleoperation systems across heterogeneous\nnetwork scenarios. In the worst network condition, completion time increases by\n221.8% and success rate drops by 64%. Our findings reveal that network\ndegradation leads to compounding negative impacts, notably reduced video\nquality and prolonged task execution, highlighting the need for adaptive,\nresilient teleoperation protocols.

NourID+ creates a strong foundation for future\nsubsidy programs by unifying three government-issued and digitalized\ncredentials: Moroccan national identity cards (CIN), cadastral plans, and\nproperty ownership certificates are transformed into unique digital energy IDs\n(DE-IDs) that map authenticated identities with specific properties and their\nenergy consumption patterns. The system supports three property ownership\nprofiles: farmers (landowners), entrepreneurs (factory or company owners), and\nhouseholds (house owners), as energy consumption is directly related to land\nownership. NourID+ provides dual access through a government portal allowing\nofficials to process DE-ID generation requests, as well as a citizen portal for\nDE-ID usage and energy monitoring. Our framework supports CIN upload with\nfacial biometric matching, automated property retrieval through government\nAPIs, and government officer approval workflow for DE-ID generation. After\nevaluation of the system, we demonstrate a reduction in verification time from\nweeks to minutes, with 98% accuracy of document validation. The proposed\nsolution allows for targeted subsidy allocation of electricity based on actual\nconsumption needs rather than estimations, potentially improving the efficiency\nof Morocco's significant energy subsidy expenditure.",

Our evaluation of Skipper, using both real-world and\nsynthetic graphs with up to 161 billion edges, and across three different\ncomputer architectures, shows that Skipper processes only 1.2% of the edges and\ndelivers a 47.1 times average speedup (geometric mean).

To address this, we propose RAT, an intermediate design\nthat bridges the efficiency of RNNs and capacity of attention. RAT partitions\nthe input into chunks, applies recurrence within each chunk for local\ndependencies, and softmax-based attention across chunks for long-range\ninteractions. This design mitigates memory degradation and enables direct\naccess to distant tokens, while retaining computational efficiency.\nEmpirically, with a chunk size of 16, the RAT block achieves a 7x improvement\nin training speed with 100K token sequences and 9x in generation at the 4K\nposition, while maintaining similar performance compared to standard attention.\nWe demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter models from scratch and\nperforming large-scale evaluations, including short- and long-context\nbenchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We further propose a\nhybrid architecture that interleaves RAT with local attention.

We introduce a geometric\ninflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D\nbounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we\nconstruct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes\ndataset.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization\nperformance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D\ninputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has emerged as a compelling framework for scene\nrepresentation and 3D recovery. To improve its performance on real-world data,\ndepth regularizations have proven to be the most effective ones. However, depth\nestimation models not only require expensive 3D supervision in training, but\nalso suffer from generalization issues. As a result, the depth estimations can\nbe erroneous in practice, especially for outdoor unbounded scenes. In this\npaper, we propose to employ view-consistent distributions instead of fixed\ndepth value estimations to regularize NeRF training. Specifically, the\ndistribution is computed by utilizing both low-level color features and\nhigh-level distilled features from foundation models at the projected 2D\npixel-locations from per-ray sampled 3D points. By sampling from the\nview-consistency distributions, an implicit regularization is imposed on the\ntraining of NeRF. We also utilize a depth-pushing loss that works in\nconjunction with the sampling technique to jointly provide effective\nregularizations for eliminating the failure modes. Extensive experiments\nconducted on various scenes from public datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod can generate significantly better novel view synthesis results than\nstate-of-the-art NeRF variants as well as different depth regularization\nmethods.",

HESS J1626$-$490 is an unidentified TeV gamma-ray source but\nis expected to originate from CRs that escaped from the nearby supernova\nremnant (SNR) G335.2+0.1 and are interacting with dense interstellar clouds.

From X-ray and GeV gamma-ray data analyses, we find an extended\nGeV gamma-ray emission overlapping with the SNR and H.E.S.S. source regions but\nno X-ray emission. The location of the peak of the extended GeV emission\nchanges from near the SNR at $\\lesssim 1$~GeV to the H.E.S.S. source at\n$>10$~GeV.

Second, unlike moir\\'e systems, where the superlattice amplitude\nis set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude\nof the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic\nwave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that\nvarying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ\ncontrol over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and\nnontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.",

    "abstract": "Academic writing increasingly involves multimodal tasks requiring students to\nintegrate visual information and textual arguments. While generative AI (GenAI)\ntools, like ChatGPT, offer new pathways for supporting academic writing, little\nis known about how students' GenAI literacy influences their independent\nmultimodal writing skills or how chatbot interaction strategies (passive\nreactive vs. proactive scaffolding) impact learning. This study examined 79\nhigher education students' multimodal academic writing performance using a\ncomparative research design. Students completed writing tasks integrating\nvisual data under two chatbot-assisted conditions (passive vs. proactive) and\nsubsequently without AI assistance. Their writing performance was rigorously\nevaluated across five dimensions, including insightfulness, visual data\nintegration, organisation, linguistic quality, and critical thinking. Ordinal\nlogistic regression and correlation analyses revealed that higher levels of\nGenAI literacy significantly predicted stronger independent multimodal writing\nperformance immediately after AI assistance removal, particularly for students\nusing passive chatbots requiring active prompting. These results highlight the\ncritical role of GenAI literacy and specific chatbot interaction strategies in\nshaping students' capacities for independent multimodal academic writing. Our\nfindings emphasise the need for purposeful integration of GenAI literacy\ntraining into curricula and balancing external scaffolding support with\nautonomous learning opportunities. This research offers valuable\nrecommendations for educators leveraging AI-enhanced pedagogies to optimise\nstudent writing outcomes and technological engagement strategies.",

    "abstract": "Cross-modal remote sensing image (CRSI) registration is critical for\nmulti-modal image applications. However, CRSI mainly faces two challenges:\nsignificant nonlinear radiometric variations between cross-modal images and\nlimited textures hindering the discriminative information extraction. Existing\nmethods mainly adopt convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer\narchitectures to extract discriminative features for registration. However,\nCNNs with the local receptive field fail to capture global contextual features,\nand Transformers have high computational complexity and restrict their\napplication to high-resolution CRSI. To solve these issues, this paper proposes\nRegistrationMamba, a novel Mamba architecture based on state space models\n(SSMs) integrating multi-expert feature learning for improving the accuracy of\nCRSI registration. Specifically, RegistrationMamba employs a multi-directional\ncross-scanning strategy to capture global contextual relationships with linear\ncomplexity. To enhance the performance of RegistrationMamba under\ntexture-limited scenarios, we propose a multi-expert feature learning (MEFL)\nstrategy to capture features from various augmented image variants through\nmultiple feature experts. MEFL leverages a learnable soft router to dynamically\nfuse the features from multiple experts, thereby enriching feature\nrepresentations and improving registration performance. Notably, MEFL can be\nseamlessly integrated into various frameworks, substantially boosting\nregistration performance. Additionally, RegistrationMamba integrates a\nmulti-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to extract fine-grained local\ninformation and enable effective interaction between global and local features.\nExtensive experiments on CRSI with varying image resolutions have demonstrated\nthat RegistrationMamba has superior performance and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement\nLearning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the\nthird chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient\nalgorithms.\n  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and\nextensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent\nactions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an\nagent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a\ncognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also\naddresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization\nbehavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.\n  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine\nif an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer\n(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The\nchapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing\nthe continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random\nhorizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a\nBayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise\noverview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse\nstochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.\n  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive\nLangevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions\ngiven noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms\npresented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient\nalgorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic\ngradient algorithm is in operation.",

While the majority\nof research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve\nmathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical\nproblem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this\npaper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential\nof various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction\ntuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,\nincluding both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5\nmathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining\non math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.\nIn constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides\nlimited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.\nNotably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating\nrule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,\nsignificantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning\nprocesses into other domains.

To further ensure the safety of the\ngenerated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed,\nwhich selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and\ncontrol feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen\nscenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while\nmaintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle\nfurther demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world\napplications. The project page is at: https://rstp-comp-diffuser.github.io/.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian tumor, as a common gynecological disease, can rapidly deteriorate\ninto serious health crises when undetected early, thus posing significant\nthreats to the health of women. Deep neural networks have the potential to\nidentify ovarian tumors, thereby reducing mortality rates, but limited public\ndatasets hinder its progress. To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian\ntumor pathological recognition dataset called \\textbf{ViTaL} that contains\n\\textbf{V}isual, \\textbf{T}abular and \\textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496\npatients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three\nsubsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from\n2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations\nof 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients.\nIt is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian\ntumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of\novarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset\nAttention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion\nof multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and\ncomplementarity between information from different modalities.

The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed\nto be that discovery instrument.

This\nsetup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux\nshould be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the\npowerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an\noptimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m\nacross a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina's San Juan\nprovince.

    "abstract": "In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for\nprocessing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and\nchannel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as\na token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,\nwhile the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each\ntime step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current\nmainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.\nTransformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention\nmechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and\nsuffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in\nlong-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models\n(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but\nstruggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome\nthe limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel\nforecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series\nforecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a\nchannel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the\nTransformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model\ncross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two\ndistinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These\nrepresentations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a\ntemporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion\nlayer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive\nexperiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over\nexisting models.",

This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a\nmethod to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned\nin a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.\nSpecifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image\nclassifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model.

Based on the\ntask arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on\nthe prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.\nExperimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,\nexcept for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability\ncan be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving\nexplanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification\naccuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a\nlarge and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,\nexhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out\nof ten different target datasets.

The results\ndemonstrate that VA-MPPI significantly improves safety by reducing collision\nwith unseen obstacles while maintaining competitive performance. For example,\nin the off-road scenario with 400 control samples, the VA-MPPI controller\nachieved a success rate of 84%, compared to only 8% for the deterministic\ncontroller, with all VA-MPPI failures arising from unmet stopping criteria\nrather than collisions. Furthermore, the controller implicitly avoids\nunobserved space, improving safety without explicit directives. The proposed\nframework highlights the potential for robust, visibility-aware navigation in\nunstructured and occluded environments, paving the way for future advancements\nin autonomous ground vehicle systems.",

However, effectively navigating\ncomplex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced\ntrajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed\nself-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from\nreal-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches\nencounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where\nreal or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic\nfeedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and\n(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can\ninvolve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and\ncomputational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable\nself-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for\ntrajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model\nto simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform\nefficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the\nlarge-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are\nsubsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic\ndataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models\ntrained on large-scale real-world data.",

Our motivation stems from the\nobservation that existing fusion strategies are constrained by their inability\nto simultaneously achieve efficiency, long-range modeling, and retaining\ncomplete scene information. Inspired by recent advances in state-space models\n(SSMs) and linear attention, we leverage their linear complexity and long-range\nmodeling capabilities to address these challenges. However, this is non-trivial\nsince our experiments reveal that simply adopting efficient linear-complexity\nmethods does not necessarily yield improvements and may even degrade\nperformance. We attribute this degradation to the loss of height information\nduring multi-modal alignment, leading to deviations in sequence order. To\nresolve this, we propose height-fidelity LiDAR encoding that preserves precise\nheight information through voxel compression in continuous space, thereby\nenhancing camera-LiDAR alignment. Subsequently, we introduce the Hybrid Mamba\nBlock, which leverages the enriched height-informed features to conduct local\nand global contextual learning.

Jailbreak attacks exploit\nvulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.\nHowever, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this\npaper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:\nAttention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the\nattention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack\nprocess, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is\nconsistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token\nreplacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.\nAdditionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token\nHighlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention\nSlipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of\nmitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,\na new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the\nattention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four\nleading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)\nshow that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while\nmaintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval.

However, it remains\nunclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.\n  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form\nquestions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly\nimpacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and\nfree-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour\nfrom insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking\nthem to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the\nfactual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to\nchange their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all\ncases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to\nprompt nudges.\n  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned\nresponses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to\nrate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher\nscores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'\nprobability of giving a misaligned answer.

    "abstract": "Ethereum smart contracts operate in a concurrent environment where multiple\ntransactions can be submitted simultaneously. However, the Ethereum Virtual\nMachine (EVM) enforces sequential execution of transactions within each block\nto prevent conflicts arising from concurrent access to the same state\nvariables. Although this approach guarantees correct behavior, it limits the\nability of validators to leverage multi-core architectures for faster\ntransaction processing, thus restricting throughput. Existing solutions\nintroduce concurrency by allowing simultaneous transaction execution combined\nwith runtime conflict detection and rollback mechanisms to maintain\ncorrectness. However, these methods incur significant overhead due to\ncontinuous conflict tracking and transaction reversion. Recently, alternative\napproaches have emerged that aim to predict conflicts statically, before\nexecution, by analyzing smart contract code for potential transaction\ninteractions. Despite their promise, there is a lack of comprehensive studies\nthat examine static conflict detection and its broader implications in specific\nsmart contracts. This paper fills this important gap by proposing a novel\nstatic analysis method to detect potential transaction conflicts in Ethereum\nsmart contracts. Our method identifies read-write, write-write, and function\ncall conflicts between transaction pairs by analyzing state variable access\npatterns in Solidity contracts. We implement a tool that parses contract code\nand performs conflict detection. Evaluation on a dataset of real-world Ethereum\nsmart contracts demonstrates that our approach achieves high precision in\nidentifying potential conflicts. By enabling proactive conflict detection, our\ntool supports further design of transaction scheduling strategies that reduce\nruntime failures, enhance validator throughput, and contribute to blockchain\nscalability.",

In order to deliver greater safety and reliability in the\nsystem, we present the general formulation of this as a two-level optimization\nscheme which incorporates control at the lower level, and classical planning at\nthe higher level, integrated with a capacity for learning. This synergistic\nintegration of multiple methodologies -- control, classical planning, and RL --\npresents an opportunity for greater insight for algorithm development, leading\nto more efficient and reliable performance. Here, the notion of reliability\npertains to physical safety and interpretability into an otherwise black box\noperation of autonomous agents, concerning users and regulators.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) frameworks are essential to DL-based software systems, and\nframework bugs may lead to substantial disasters, thus requiring effective\ntesting. Researchers adopt DL models or single interfaces as test inputs and\nanalyze their execution results to detect bugs. However, floating-point errors,\ninherent randomness, and the complexity of test inputs make it challenging to\nanalyze execution results effectively, leading to existing methods suffering\nfrom a lack of suitable test oracles. Some researchers utilize metamorphic\ntesting to tackle this challenge. They design Metamorphic Relations (MRs) based\non input data and parameter settings of a single framework interface to\ngenerate equivalent test inputs, ensuring consistent execution results between\noriginal and generated test inputs. Despite their promising effectiveness, they\nstill face certain limitations. (1) Existing MRs overlook structural\ncomplexity, limiting test input diversity. (2) Existing MRs focus on limited\ninterfaces, which limits generalization and necessitates additional\nadaptations. (3) Their detected bugs are related to the result consistency of\nsingle interfaces and far from those exposed in multi-interface combinations\nand runtime metrics (e.g., resource usage). To address these limitations, we\npropose ModelMeta, a model-level metamorphic testing method for DL frameworks\nwith four MRs focused on the structure characteristics of DL models.

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning\ncapabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also\nintroduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning\nprocesses, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has\nattempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated\nsamples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more\nconcise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty\noften lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while\npreserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off\nbetween accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose\nSmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained\ncontrol over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each\nindividual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a\nshort-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length\nControl Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,\nwhich increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while\nreducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core\ncomponents: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward\nfunction, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a\ndifficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components\nenable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.\nEmpirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone\nmodels demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning\nwhile achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.",

One recent\ntrend is the emergence of large grid-connected batteries, that can be\ncontrolled to provide multiple storage and flexibility services, using a\nstacked revenue model. Another emerging development is renewable energy\ncommunities (REC), in which prosumers invest in their own renewable generation\ncapacity, but also requiring battery storage for flexibility. In this paper, we\nstudy settings in which energy communities rent battery capacity from a battery\noperator through a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) model. We present a methodology\nfor determining the sizing and pricing of battery capacity that can be rented,\nsuch that it provides economic benefits to both the community and the battery\noperator that participates in the energy market. We examine how sizes and\nprices vary across a number of different scenarios for different types of\ntariffs (flat, dynamic) and competing energy market uses. Second, we conduct a\nsystematic study of linear optimization models for battery control when\ndeployed to provide flexibility to energy communities. We show that existing\napproaches for battery control with daily time windows have a number of\nimportant limitations in practical deployments, and we propose a number of\nregularization functions in the optimization to address them. Finally, we\ninvestigate the proposed method using real generation, demand, tariffs, and\nbattery data, based on a practical case study from a large battery operator in\nthe Netherlands. For the settings in our case study, we find that a community\nof 200 houses with a 330 kW wind turbine can save up to 12,874 euros per year\nby renting just 280 kWh of battery capacity (after subtracting battery rental\ncosts), with the methodology applicable to a wide variety of settings and\ntariff types.",

The model extends the Standard\nModel by introducing a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an approximate global $U(1)$\nsymmetry, each spontaneously broken by a corresponding complex scalar singlet.\nThis setup gives rise to a network of effectively global and local cosmic\nstrings, whose stochastic gravitational wave signals can jointly account for\nthe spectrum observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, particularly for majoron\nmasses $m_{\\chi} < 10^{-23}$ eV. Although the fit is not as strong as that from\nsupermassive black hole mergers, the model still provides an alternative\nexplanation rooted in high-energy physics. The model also generates light\nneutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and avoids cosmological constraints\nfrom $\\Delta N_{\\text{eff}}$, CMB anisotropies, and isocurvature fluctuations.\nAlthough the majoron can contribute to dark matter through thermal, coherent\noscillation, and string-induced production mechanisms, its relic abundance\nremains subdominant in the NANOGrav-compatible region. In contrast, the\nmeasured dark matter relic density is achievable at higher $m_\\chi$, though at\nthe cost of tension with cosmological bounds.

In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on\nscene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning\naccuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune\nmodels using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and\nevaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates\nsuperior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,\nwe find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade\nperformance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from \"closer to\" to \"farther\nfrom\"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable\nperformance under such shifts.

High-order methods such as the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme are attractive candidates for their\nnumerical approximation. However, high-order methods are prone to instabilities\nin the presence of underresolved flow features. A popular counter measure to\nstabilize DG methods is the use of entropy-stable formulations based on\nsummation-by-parts (SBP) operators. The present paper aims to construct a\nrobust and efficient entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element\nmethod (DGSEM) of arbitrary order on heterogeneous, curvilinear grids composed\nof triangular and quadrilateral elements or hexahedral, prismatic, tetrahedral\nand pyramid elements. To the author's knowledge, with the exception of\nhexahedral and quadrilateral elements, entropy-stable DGSE operators have been\nconstructed exclusively for tetrahedral and triangular meshes. The extension of\nthe DGSEM to more complex element shapes is achieved by means of a collapsed\ncoordinate transformation. Legendre--Gauss quadrature nodes are employed as\ncollocation points in conjunction with a generalized SBP operator and\nentropy-projected variables. The purely hyperbolic operator is extended to\nhyperbolic-parabolic problems by the use of a lifting procedure. To circumvent\nthe penalizing time step restriction imposed by the collapsing, modal rather\nthan nodal degrees of freedom are evolved in time, thereby relying on a\nmemory-efficient weight-adjusted approximation to the inverse of the mass\nmatrix. Essential properties of the proposed numerical scheme including\nfree-stream preservation, polynomial and grid convergence as well as entropy\nconservation / stability are verified. Finally, with the flow around the common\nresearch model, the applicability of the presented method to real-world\nproblems is demonstrated.",

The Mid-360, with its\ndome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable\nperformance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,\nsuch as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars\nsignificantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across\nplatforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state\nand high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently\nexamined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.\n  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from\nmultiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped\nMid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.\nNotably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively\nincludes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state\nand spinning lidars.

We\nadopt the framework of a merging kpc-scale dual-core system in an elliptical\norbit, which has an emission-line galaxy with clear narrow line regions (NLRs)\nmerging with a companion galaxy lacking emission line features. Due to\ngravitational forces induced by both galaxies on the NLRs, the accelerations of\nthe far-side and near-side NLR components may share the same vector direction\nwhen projected along the line-of-sight, leading the velocities of the observed\nDPNELs to shift in the same direction.

In this\nwork we characterize the X-ray emission of the Galactic Center (GC) region\nusing wide-field observations with the ART-XC telescope on board the SRG\nobservatory in the 4-12 keV energy band. Our analysis demonstrates that the\nX-ray emission of the GC at a spatial scale of a few hundred parsecs is\ndominated by the regularly shaped NSD aligned in the Galactic plane, and\ncharacterized by latitudinal and longitudinal scale heights of approximately 20\npc and approximately 100 pc, respectively.

    "abstract": "Event cameras are a novel type of sensor designed for capturing the dynamic\nchanges of a scene. Due to factors such as trigger and transmission delays, a\ntime offset exists in the data collected by multiple event cameras, leading to\ninaccurate information fusion. Thus, the collected data needs to be\nsynchronized to overcome any potential time offset issue. Hardware\nsynchronization methods require additional circuits, while certain models of\nevent cameras (e.g., CeleX5) do not support hardware synchronization.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a hardware-free event camera synchronization\nmethod. This method determines differences between start times by minimizing\nthe dissimilarity of the event density distributions of different event cameras\nand synchronizes the data by adjusting timestamps. The experiments demonstrate\nthat the method's synchronization error is less than 10ms under various senses\nwith multiple models of event cameras.",

However, PBFL\napproaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their\ndiscriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel\nPBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:\nPrototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU).

In this paper, we propose a method to\nadapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups\nwith only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated\nenvironment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.\nReinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when\ntrained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in\nreal-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,\nproviding only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a\nDomain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full\nmeasurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this\nmap, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our\nmethod enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights\ninto the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their\nimplementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, great progress has been made in the field of formal\nverification for low-level systems. Many of them are based on one of two\npopular approaches: refinement or unary separation logic. These two approaches\nare very different in nature and offer complementary benefits in\ncompositionality.\n  Recently, to fuse these benefits into a single unified mechanism, a new\napproach called Conditional Contextual Refinement (CCR 1.0 for short) was\nproposed. In this paper, we advance CCR 1.0 and provide novel and intuitive\nreasoning principles, resulting in CCR 2.0. Achieving this goal was challenging\ndue to non-trivial counterexamples which necessitated elegant changes to the\nmodel of CCR 1.0. On top of CCR 2.0, we show how to fuse the benefits of\nrefinement, unary separation logic, and also relational separation logic.\n  Our results are formalized in Rocq.",

Existing studies\nreveal that LLM-based RSs exhibit greater unfairness than traditional RSs, yet\nfairness issues in LLM-enhanced RSs remain largely unexplored. In this paper,\nour empirical study reveals that while LLM-enhanced RSs improve fairness across\nitem groups, a significant fairness gap persists. Further enhancement remains\nchallenging due to the architectural differences and varying sources of\nunfairness inherent in LLM-enhanced RSs. To bridge this gap, we first decompose\nunfairness into i) \\textit{prior unfairness} in LLM-generated representations\nand ii) \\textit{training unfairness} in recommendation models.

In this paper, we\npropose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop\nself-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow\nsystem harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation\n(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a\nfast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set\nthat are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,\nwe further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for\ngenerating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast\nCollaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after\nthorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its\nself-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively\ncorrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and\nsemantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8\ndistinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over\nSOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and\nfunctional completeness.",

We\nassess the wavevector anisotropy with the 2D and slab turbulence model for the\nCH wind and the streamer wind, and the nearly incompressible (NI) MHD\nturbulence model for the LMBL wind where Taylor's hypothesis becomes\nquestionable. Unlike the $\\sim80\\%$ 2D contribution typically reported at 1 au,\nour results show that only $26\\%$ of the inertial range energy is associated\nwith 2D fluctuations in the CH wind, and this fraction increases to $45\\%$ in\nthe streamer wind. As a representation of the LMBL wind, similarly, the oblique\nsub-Alfv\\'enic intervals and the near-subsonic intervals are characterized by\nthe dominance of slab fluctuations. All the results suggest that slab\nfluctuations are more abundant in the young solar wind below 0.3 au than at 1\nau. Furthermore, we find a dependence of the variance anisotropy in the\ninertial range on proton plasma beta $\\beta_p$. The variance anisotropy is the\nstrongest in the LMBL wind with the lowest $\\beta_p$, and the weakest in the\nstreamer wind with the highest $\\beta_p$.

    "abstract": "A classical approach to studying Markov decision processes (MDPs) is to view\nthem as state transformers. However, MDPs can also be viewed as distribution\ntransformers, where an MDP under a strategy generates a sequence of probability\ndistributions over MDP states. This view arises in several applications, even\nas the probabilistic model checking problem becomes much harder compared to the\nclassical state transformer counterpart. It is known that even distributional\nreachability and safety problems become computationally intractable (Skolem-\nand positivity-hard). To address this challenge, recent works focused on sound\nbut possibly incomplete methods for verification and control of MDPs under the\ndistributional view. However, existing automated methods are applicable only to\ndistributional reachability, safety and reach-avoidance specifications.\n  In this work, we present the first automated method for verification and\ncontrol of MDPs with respect to distributional omega-regular specifications. To\nachieve this, we propose a novel notion of distributional certificates, which\nare sound and complete proof rules for proving that an MDP under a\ndistributionally memoryless strategy satisfies some distributional\nomega-regular specification. We then use our distributional certificates to\ndesign the first fully automated algorithms for verification and control of\nMDPs with respect to distributional omega-regular specifications. Our\nalgorithms follow a template-based synthesis approach and provide soundness and\nrelative completeness guarantees, while running in PSPACE. Our prototype\nimplementation demonstrates practical applicability of our algorithms to\nchallenging examples collected from the literature.",

    "abstract": "Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet\nchallenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,\nhigh-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to\nreal-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune\nfoundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.\nHowever, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on\npost-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in\nmodern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error\naccumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,\nwe introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual\nknowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate\ncomplete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution\nof UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence\ngeneration problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of\nmulti-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the\nconsistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.\nTo further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a\ndecoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide\ncross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine\ntexture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these\ncomponents allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize\nhigh-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive\nexperiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nimage-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with\nsuperior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world\ngeneralization.",

    "abstract": "Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are essential for aviation,\nrequiring strict integrity monitoring to alert users to hazardously misleading\ninformation. Conventional receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) and\nadvanced RAIM (ARAIM) rely heavily on Gaussian models in bounding nominal\nerrors, which can be overly conservative with real-world non-Gaussian errors\nwith heavy tails, such as the satellite clock and orbit errors. This paper\nproposes an extended jackknife detector capable of detecting multiple\nsimultaneous faults with non-Gaussian nominal errors. Furthermore, an integrity\nmonitoring algorithm, jackknife ARAIM, is developed by systematically\nexploiting the properties of the jackknife detector in the range domain. A\ntight bound of the integrity risk is derived by quantifying the impacts of\nhypothetical fault vectors on the position solution. The proposed method is\nexamined in worldwide simulations, with the nominal measurement error simulated\nbased on authentic experimental data, which reveals different findings in\nexisting research. In a setting of a single Global Positioning System (GPS)\nconstellation, the proposed method reduces the 99.5 percentile vertical\nprotection level (VPL) 45m, where the VPL of the baseline ARAIM is larger than\n50m in most user locations. For dual-constellation (GPS-Galileo) settings,\nbaseline ARAIM suffers VPL inflation over 60m due to the over-conservatism\ninduced by the heavy-tailed Galileo signal-in-space range errors, whereas the\nproposed jackknife ARAIM retains VPL below 40m, achieving over 92% normal\noperations for a 35m Vertical Alert Limit. These improvements have promising\npotential to support localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) with a\ndecision height of 200 ft, enhancing integrity and availability for\nmulti-constellation GNSS applications.",

However, this free-form prediction\nparadigm introduces significant challenges in evaluation.

    "abstract": "We present a case study exploring the potential of OpenAI's o3 model as a\nsignal-agnostic tool for predicting optimized selection cuts in high-energy\nphysics analyses. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of the model\nin separating signal from relevant Standard Model backgrounds in the context of\nFlavour-Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) top-quark couplings, focusing on the\nrare decay process $t \\rightarrow uZ$. The study is performed at three collider\nsetups: the approved High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), the proposed High-Energy LHC\n(HE-LHC), and the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode (FCC-hh). We\ntrain the o3 model on detector level data for signal and background processes\nto predict selection cuts that enhance Signal-to-Background (S/B)\ndiscrimination. A comparative analysis is then carried out between the\nefficiencies resulting from o3-predicted cuts and those derived from\ntraditional manually designed strategies used by a control group. Our results\ndemonstrate that the o3 model performs on par with traditional methods in terms\nof S/B separation, with a slight improvement in the case of FCC-hh, suggesting\nits promise as a fast and generalizable tool for new physics searches.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the failure and plasticity of solids remains a longstanding\nchallenge, with broad implications for materials design and functional\nreliability. Disordered solids like metallic glasses can fail either abruptly\nor gradually without clear precursors, and the mechanical response depends\nstrongly on composition, thermal history and deformation protocol -- impeding\ngeneralizable modeling. While deep learning methods offer predictive power,\nthey often rely on numerous input parameters, hindering interpretability,\nmethodology advancement and practical deployment. Here, we propose a\nmacroscopic, physically grounded approach that uses plastic strain accumulation\nin the elastic regime to robustly predict deformation and yield. This method\nreduces complexity and improves interpretability, offering a practical\nalternative for disordered materials. For the Cu-Zr-(Al) metallic glasses\nprepared with varied annealing, we identify two limiting regimes of plastic\nstrain growth: power-law in poorly annealed and exponential in well-annealed\nsamples. A physics-informed framework with Bayesian inference extracts growth\nparameters from stress-strain data within $\\sim$5\\% strain, enabling early\nprediction of bulk response and yield point, well before the failure. The\npredictive performance improves with annealing, and bulk plasticity correlates\nwith the microscopic plastic activity from scattered to growth near yielding.\nThis work presents a physically interpretable and experimentally relevant\nframework for predicting plasticity and failure in metallic glasses from early\nmechanical response, offering both theoretical insights and practical tools for\nmaterial characterization and design.",

It is of interest to find a consistent\nphysical framework that is able to account for both of these effects\nsimultaneously. Aims: We investigate the impact of the Tayler instability on\nthe surface abundance of boron in massive B-type stars as predicted by rotating\nstellar models accounting for the advective nature of meridional currents.\nMethods: We used the Geneva stellar evolution code to compute models of 9, 12,\nand 15 Msun stars at different rotational velocities and with and without\nmagnetic fields. We compared the surface boron abundances predicted by these\nmodels with those of observed B-type stars. Results: We find that models with\nonly hydrodynamic transport processes overestimate the amount of boron\ndepletion for stars with high rotation rates, in disagreement with\nobservational constraints. We show that this excessively high mixing efficiency\nis a consequence of the high degree of differential rotation predicted by\npurely hydrodynamic models. We thus conclude that surface abundances of boron\nindicate that a more efficient AM transport is needed in stellar radiative\nzones. We then studied the impact of the Tayler instability as a possible\nphysical explanation to this issue. Models including this instability are found\nto be in good agreement with constraints on the surface boron abundances, the\nevolutionary state, and the projected rotational velocity of moderately and\nfast-rotating B-type stars. Finally, we note that at low rotational velocities,\nmodels with magnetic fields do not predict sufficient depletion to be\nconsistent with the observations. This could suggest that the current\nprescriptions for the Tayler instability may overestimate the AM transport in\nslow-rotating B-type stars.",

In 1992, Pyber proved that\n$\\chi'_2(G) \\leq 4$ for every graph $G$, and posed the question of whether\n$\\chi'_k(G)$ can be bounded solely in terms of $k$ for every $k\\geq 3$.

Recently, Botler, Colucci,\nand Kohayakawa (2023) answered Scott's question affirmatively proving that\n$\\chi'_k(G) \\leq 198k - 101$, and conjectured that the multiplicative constant\ncould be reduced to $1$.

While quantum algorithms of\nboth quantizations provide advantages over classical algorithms for ground\nstate calculation and time-evolution, they face distinct limitations and\ninefficiencies in addressing real-world molecular and material simulation\nproblems. As an example, the first-quantized representation is unsuitable for\ncalculating electron non-conserving properties, such as dynamic correlations.\nConversely, the ground-state molecular orbital wavefunction efficiently\nprepared in the second quantization may benefit from efficient first-quantized\nmeasurement circuits. In light of this, we propose a hybrid quantization scheme\nfor electronic simulations that employs a conversion circuit to switch\nefficiently between the two quantizations, achieving a gate cost of\n$\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N \\log M)$ and requiring $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log M)$ qubits for\na system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals. This way, plane-wave Hamiltonian\nsimulations can be done efficiently in the first-quantization before converting\nto the second quantization to apply electron non-conserving operations.\nSimilarly, second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation algorithms can take\nadvantage of efficient measurement circuits originally designed for the\nfirst-quantized representation. We discuss applications of this hybrid\nquantization scheme to bring polynomial circuit improvements in the\ncharacterization of ground-state and excited-state properties, and in\nperforming ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations.",

To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence\nbetween the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model\nand a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically\naligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we\ndevise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and\nstylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with\nhigh-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is\nalso designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the\nstylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional\ndiffusion model that integrates a ControlNet recording high-frequency\ninformation and the style guidance to generate the final result. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code and trained\nmodel are available at https://github.com/wangxb29/DGPST.",

In contrast to\nconventional guide-running systems that rely heavily on continuous verbal\ncommunication or mechanical tethering, RunPacer emphasizes interpersonal\ncadence alignment as its core interaction model. By pre-setting a target step\nfrequency or dynamically adapting to the guide's natural pace, the system\nensures that both runners receive identical haptic cues, enabling them to\nmaintain coordinated motion intuitively and efficiently.

Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are\nvulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work,\nwe present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of\nmobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework\nAgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen\ncontent within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a\ncomprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution\nenvironment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling\nover 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58\nreproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content,\nwhile the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14\npopular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to\nbe feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile\nGUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings\nreveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading\nthird-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted\nattack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the\nemployed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess\ntraining-based mitigation strategies, highlighting both the challenges and\nopportunities for enhancing the robustness of mobile GUI agents.

    "abstract": "Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) is widely used for solving black-box\noptimization and control problems. In particular, single-point ZO (SZO) is\nwell-suited to online or dynamic problem settings due to its requirement of\nonly a single function evaluation per iteration. However, SZO suffers from high\ngradient estimation variance and slow convergence, which severely limit its\npractical applicability. Despite recent advances, the convergence of existing\nSZO methods remains inferior to that of two-point ZO methods. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel yet simple SZO framework, termed\nregression-based SZO (RESZO), which substantially enhances the convergence\nrate. Unlike conventional ZO methods that rely solely on function evaluations\nat the current point for gradient estimation, RESZO improves gradient\nestimation by effectively leveraging historical function evaluations from\nprevious iterations. Specifically, RESZO constructs a surrogate function via\nregression using recent historical evaluations and employs the gradient of this\nsurrogate function for iterative updates. Two variants of RESZO, which fit\nlinear and quadratic surrogate functions respectively, are introduced.\nTheoretically, we provide a non-asymptotic convergence analysis for the linear\nvariant of RESZO, showing that its convergence rates are comparable to those of\ntwo-point ZO methods for both smooth nonconvex and strongly convex functions.\nMoreover, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that RESZO not only\nmatches but empirically outperforms two-point ZO in terms of function query\ncomplexity.",

Although there has been\nabundant work on the problem of Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) for a\nlow-dimensional response in the presence of a high-dimensional predictor,\nlittle work has been done for a high-dimensional response such as images. The\npromising performance of normalizing flow (NF) neural networks in unconditional\ndensity estimation acts a motivating starting point. In this work, we extend NF\nneural networks when external $x$ is present. Specifically, they use the NF to\nparameterize a one-to-one transform between a high-dimensional $y$ and a latent\n$z$ that comprises two components \\([z_P,z_N]\\). The $z_P$ component is a\nlow-dimensional subvector obtained from the posterior distribution of an\nelementary predictive model for $x$, such as logistic/linear regression. The\n$z_N$ component is a high-dimensional independent Gaussian vector, which\nexplains the variations in $y$ not or less related to $x$. Unlike existing CDE\nmethods, the proposed approach, coined Augmented Posterior CDE (AP-CDE), only\nrequires a simple modification on the common normalizing flow framework, while\nsignificantly improving the interpretation of the latent component, since $z_P$\nrepresents a supervised dimension reduction. In image analytics applications,\nAP-CDE shows good separation of $x$-related variations due to factors such as\nlighting condition and subject id, from the other random variations. Further,\nthe experiments show that an unconditional NF neural network, based on an\nunsupervised model of $z$, such as Gaussian mixture, fails to generate\ninterpretable results.",

    "abstract": "The quantum metric, a key component of quantum geometry, plays a central role\nin a wide range of physical phenomena and has been extensively studied in\nperiodic crystals and moir\\'{e} materials. Here, we systematically investigate\nquantum geometry in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic systems and uncover\nnovel properties that fundamentally distinguish them from both periodic\ncrystals and disordered media. Our comparative analysis reveals that\nquasiperiodicity significantly enhances the quantum metric -- despite the\nabsence of translational symmetry -- due to the presence of critical\nwavefunctions with long-range spatial correlations. In the\nAubry-Andr\\'{e}-Harper model, we show that the quantum metric serves as a\nsensitive probe of localization transitions, exhibiting sharp changes at the\ncritical point and distinct behaviors near mobility edges. In the Fibonacci\nchain, characterized by a singular continuous spectrum, we discover an\nanomalous enhancement of the quantum metric when the Fermi level lies within\nthe minimal gaps of the fractal energy spectrum. Using a perturbative\nrenormalization group framework, we trace this enhancement to the hierarchical\nstructure of the spectrum and the bonding-antibonding nature of critical states\nacross narrow gaps. Our findings establish a fundamental connection between\nwavefunction criticality, spectral fractality, and quantum geometry, suggesting\nquasiperiodic systems as promising platforms for engineering enhanced quantum\ngeometric properties beyond conventional crystalline paradigms.",

Galaxies are classified\nby specific star formation rate, optical color, and bulge-to-total light ratio,\nallowing us to disentangle environmental effects from intrinsic galaxy\nproperties. We examine the SMR in three contexts: (1) comparing galaxy sizes in\ntwo extreme environments-dense clusters versus cosmic voids; (2) analyzing\ncluster galaxies across a range of cluster masses; and (3) studying member\ngalaxies located in different cluster regions, from the core to the infall\nzone. In all three cases, we find no significant dependence of the SMR on\nenvironment at fixed stellar mass and galaxy type. Cluster and void galaxies\nfollow consistent SMR trends, and no measurable variation is observed with\ncluster mass or cluster-centric distance. We also confirm that early-type\ngalaxies exhibit steeper SMR slopes than late types.

Here the effect of the pseudogap\non LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is investigated within the\nkinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. The strong coupling of the electrons\nwith the spin excitation induces the pseudogap-state in the particle-hole\nchannel and superconducting (SC) state in the particle-particle channel, where\nthe pseudogap and SC gap respectively originate from the electron normal and\nanomalous self-energies, and are evaluated by taking into account the vertex\ncorrection. As a natural consequence of the interplay between the\npseudogap-state and SC-state, the SC transition temperature Tc exhibits a\ndome-like shape of the doping dependence, however, in a striking contrast to Tc\nin the underdoped regime, the pseudogap crossover temperature T* is much higher\nthan Tc in the underdoped regime, and then it decreases with the increase of\ndoping, eventually disappearing together with Tc at the end of the SC dome.\nConcomitantly, the spectral weight on the electron Fermi surface (EFS) at\naround the antinodal region is suppressed strongly by this pseudogap, and then\nEFS is truncated to form four disconnected Fermi arcs centered around the nodal\nregion with the largest spectral weight located at around the tips of the\ndisconnected Fermi arcs. Moreover, the dip in the peak-dip-hump structure\nobserved in the energy distribution curve and checkerboard charge ordering\nfound in the ARPES autocorrelation are intrinsically connected with the\nemergence of the pseudogap. The theory therefore indicates that the same spin\nexcitation that governs both the pseudogap-state and SC-state naturally leads\nto the exotic features of LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors.",

Building upon these achievements, diffusion\nmodels have also been effectively adapted to image restoration tasks, e.g.,\nsuper-resolution and deblurring, aiming to recover high-quality images from\ndegraded inputs. Although existing zero-shot approaches enable pretrained\ndiffusion models to perform restoration tasks without additional fine-tuning,\nthese methods often suffer from prolonged iteration times in the denoising\nprocess. To address this limitation, we propose a Quick Bypass Mechanism (QBM),\na strategy that significantly accelerates the denoising process by initializing\nfrom an intermediate approximation, effectively bypassing early denoising\nsteps. Furthermore, recognizing that approximation may introduce\ninconsistencies, we introduce a Revised Reverse Process (RRP), which adjusts\nthe weighting of random noise to enhance the stochasticity and mitigate\npotential disharmony.

In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic\nanalogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools\nfaster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class\nof \"valley-river\" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate\nquickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba\neffect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and\nmotivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss\ndecrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists\nan optimal plateau learning rate - the \"strong Mpemba point\" - at which the\nslowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.\nWe derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics\nrequired to preserve the Mpemba advantage.

To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a\nnovel optimization algorithm named extragradient-fractional programming (EG-FP)\nto address the MMF problem of downlink RSMA. The proposed algorithm first\nleverages FP to transform the original problem into a block-wise convex\nproblem.

This feature is especially beneficial in\nscenarios with a large number of transmit antennas.

Numerical results demonstrate that the MMF rate achieved by our\nproposed algorithms closely matches that of the conventional successive convex\napproximation (SCA) algorithm and significantly outperforms other baseline\nschemes.

    "abstract": "Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely adopted cryptographic\nalgorithm, yet its practical implementations remain susceptible to side-channel\nand fault injection attacks. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework\nthat enhances AES-128 encryption security through controlled anomaly injection\nand real-time anomaly detection using both statistical and machine learning\n(ML) methods. We simulate timing and fault-based anomalies by injecting\nexecution delays and ciphertext perturbations during encryption, generating\nlabeled datasets for detection model training. Two complementary detection\nmechanisms are developed: a threshold-based timing anomaly detector and a\nsupervised Random Forest classifier trained on combined timing and ciphertext\nfeatures. We implement and evaluate the framework on both CPU and FPGA-based\nSoC hardware (PYNQ-Z1), measuring performance across varying block sizes,\ninjection rates, and core counts. Our results show that ML-based detection\nsignificantly outperforms threshold-based methods in precision and recall while\nmaintaining real-time performance on embedded hardware. Compared to existing\nAES anomaly detection methods, our solution offers a low-cost, real-time, and\naccurate detection approach deployable on lightweight FPGA platforms.",

This study leverages artificial intelligence\nto predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten\nyears of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather\nrecords. We evaluated 17 machine learning algorithms, with Extra Trees emerging\nas the optimal solution, achieving $77\\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly\noutperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that\nmeteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity\nare the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and\nseasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits\ndramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,\nand daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's\nair quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models\ndetected an encouraging $31\\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research\ndemonstrates that intelligent forecasting systems can provide city planners and\nenvironmental officials with powerful prediction tools, enabling life-saving\nearly warning systems and informed urban planning decisions.

We tackle the constrained optimization problem of allocating\nthe dwell time to track individual targets by employing a deep deterministic\npolicy gradient (DDPG) based reinforcement learning approach.

    "abstract": "Theoretical works on supervised transfer learning (STL) -- where the learner\nhas access to labeled samples from both source and target distributions -- have\nfor the most part focused on statistical aspects of the problem, while\nefficient optimization has received less attention. We consider the problem of\ndesigning an SGD procedure for STL that alternates sampling between source and\ntarget data, while maintaining statistical transfer guarantees without prior\nknowledge of the quality of the source data. A main algorithmic difficulty is\nin understanding how to design such an adaptive sub-sampling mechanism at each\nSGD step, to automatically gain from the source when it is informative, or bias\ntowards the target and avoid negative transfer when the source is less\ninformative.\n  We show that, such a mixed-sample SGD procedure is feasible for general\nprediction tasks with convex losses, rooted in tracking an abstract sequence of\nconstrained convex programs that serve to maintain the desired transfer\nguarantees.\n  We instantiate these results in the concrete setting of linear regression\nwith square loss, and show that the procedure converges, with $1/\\sqrt{T}$\nrate, to a solution whose statistical performance on the target is adaptive to\nthe a priori unknown quality of the source. Experiments with synthetic and real\ndatasets support the theory.",

This new\nsource of astrophysical neutrinos provides an exciting laboratory for probing\nthe nature of neutrino masses. In particular, extremely small mass splittings,\nsuch as those predicted by quasi-Dirac neutrino mass models, and finite\nneutrino lifetimes from neutrino decays, would induce effects on the spectra\nand flavor ratios of neutrinos with TeV-scale energies traversing\nkiloparsec-scale baselines. Using $\\mathtt{TANDEM}$, an upcoming three\ndimensional galactic neutrino emission model, we explore the sensitivity of\nIceCube and KM3NeT/ARCA to these ultra-long-baseline phenomena.

    "abstract": "Differentiable programming that enables automatic differentiation through\nsimulation pipelines has emerged as a powerful paradigm in scientific\ncomputing, supporting both forward and inverse modeling and facilitating\nintegration with deep learning frameworks. We present JAX-MPM, a\ngeneral-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid\nLagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum\nmechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic\nmaterial behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard\napplications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using\nthe JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and\nGPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly\nthrough time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models\nand neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural\nconstitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,\nincluding dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and\nperformance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million\nparticles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98\nseconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we\ndemonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction\nand spatially varying friction estimation.
