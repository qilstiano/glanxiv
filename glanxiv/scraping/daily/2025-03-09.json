    "abstract": "Current techniques for privacy auditing of large language models (LLMs) have\nlimited efficacy -- they rely on basic approaches to generate canaries which\nleads to weak membership inference attacks that in turn give loose lower bounds\non the empirical privacy leakage. We develop canaries that are far more\neffective than those used in prior work under threat models that cover a range\nof realistic settings. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on multiple\nfamilies of fine-tuned LLMs that our approach sets a new standard for detection\nof privacy leakage. For measuring the memorization rate of non-privately\ntrained LLMs, our designed canaries surpass prior approaches. For example, on\nthe Qwen2.5-0.5B model, our designed canaries achieve $49.6\\%$ TPR at $1\\%$\nFPR, vastly surpassing the prior approach's $4.2\\%$ TPR at $1\\%$ FPR. Our\nmethod can be used to provide a privacy audit of $\\varepsilon \\approx 1$ for a\nmodel trained with theoretical $\\varepsilon$ of 4. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time that a privacy audit of LLM training has\nachieved nontrivial auditing success in the setting where the attacker cannot\ntrain shadow models, insert gradient canaries, or access the model at every\niteration.",

The power received at the device\nside from a conventional transmit antenna with a physically small aperture\ndecays rapidly with the distance. New opportunities arise from the transition\nfrom conventional far-field beamforming to near-field beam focusing. We argue\nthat a physically large aperture, i.e., large with respect to the distance to\nthe receiver, enables a power budget that remains practically independent of\ndistance. Distance-dependent array gain patterns allow focusing the power\ndensity maximum precisely at the device location, while reducing the power\ndensity near the infrastructure. Physical aperture size is a key resource in\nenabling efficient yet regulatory-compliant WPT. We use real-world measurements\nto demonstrate that a regulatory-compliant system operating at sub-10GHz\nfrequencies can increase the power received at the device into the milliwatt\nrange. Our empirical demonstration shows that power-optimal near-field beam\nfocusing inherently exploits multipath propagation, yielding both increased WPT\nefficiency and improved human exposure safety.",

However, till date, there is\nlittle to no work that provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art\nresearch in assistive XR for disability at ACM ASSETS, a premier conference\ndedicated for research in HCI for people with disabilities.\n  This study aims to fill this research gap by conducting a scoping review of\nliterature delineating the key focus areas, research methods, statistical and\ntemporal trends in XR research for disability at ACM ASSETS (2019-2023). From a\npool of 1595 articles submitted to ASSETS, 26 articles are identified that\nspecifically focus on XR research for disability. Through a detailed analysis,\n6 key focus areas of XR research explored at ACM ASSETS are identified and a\ndetailed examination of each is provided.

When magnetization is suppressed, the specific heat exhibits a clear\n$60^\\circ$ periodicity in its angular dependence, with the locations of maxima\nand minima consistent with recent experimental observations in\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. A qualitative difference in their temperature dependence is\nobserved: the minima show gap-like behavior that may signal Majorana gap\nformation due to time-reversal symmetry breaking, while the maxima do not\nexhibit the expected gapless Majorana fermion signature. In addition, a\nlinear-in-field effect -- distinct from magnetization -- emerges, with the\ncharacteristic temperature below which angular dependence appears increasing\nlinearly with the magnetic field. Importantly, this directional dependence\nbecomes quantitatively significant only at very low temperatures. When finite\nmagnetization is included, the angular dependence of the specific heat remains,\nand the qualitative behavior is similar to the $m = 0$ case: the minima\ncontinue to exhibit gap-like features, while the maxima do not show signatures\nof gapless Majorana fermions.

A second notion of inverse measure entropy is\ndefined by using measurable partitions. Our notions have several useful\napplications. Inverse entropy can distinguish between isomorphism classes of\nendomorphisms on Lebesgue spaces, when they have the same forward\nmeasure-theoretic entropy. In a general setting we prove that the local inverse\nentropy of an ergodic measure \\mu is equal to the forward entropy minus the\nfolding entropy. The inverse entropy of hyperbolic measures on compact\nmanifolds is explored, focusing on their negative Lyapunov exponents. We\ncompute next the inverse entropy of the inverse SRB measure on a hyperbolic\nrepellor. We prove an entropy rigidity result for special Anosov endomorphisms\nof \\mathbb T^2, namely that they can be classified up to smooth conjugacy by\nknowing the entropy of their SRB measure and the inverse entropy of their\ninverse SRB measure. Next we study the relations between our inverse\nmeasure-theoretic entropy and the generalized topological inverse entropy on\nsubsets of prehistories. In general we establish a Partial Variational\nPrinciple for inverse entropy. We obtain also a Full Variational Principle for\ninverse entropy in the case of special TA-covering maps on tori.

Additionally, the model\nincorporates confidence estimation, allowing the identification of cases\nrequiring expert review for precise clinical interpretation. Preliminary\nfindings demonstrate that integrating multiple data modalities improves\ncachexia prediction accuracy at the time of cancer diagnosis. The AI-based\nbiomarker dynamically adapts to patient-specific factors such as age, race,\nethnicity, weight, cancer type, and stage, avoiding the limitations of\nfixed-threshold biomarkers.

While robotic systems\nhave shown promise in addressing these challenges through autonomous scanning\nand vessel reconstruction, clinical translation remains limited due to reliance\non simplified phantom models that fail to capture human anatomical complexity.\nIn this work, we present a method for autonomous robotic US scanning of\nbifurcated femoral arteries, and validate it on five vascular phantoms created\nfrom real patient computed tomography (CT) data. Additionally, we introduce a\nvideo-based deep learning US segmentation network tailored for vascular\nimaging, enabling improved 3D arterial reconstruction. The proposed network\nachieves a Dice score of 89.21% and an Intersection over Union of 80.54% on a\nnew vascular dataset. The reconstructed artery centerline is evaluated against\nground truth CT data, showing an average L2 error of 0.91+/-0.70 mm, with an\naverage Hausdorff distance of 4.36+/-1.11mm. This study is the first to\nvalidate an autonomous robotic system for US scanning of the femoral artery on\na diverse set of patient-specific phantoms, introducing a more advanced\nframework for evaluating robotic performance in vascular imaging and\nintervention.",

To address such challenge without costly\nre-training, post-training acceleration techniques like quantization and token\nreduction are extensively explored. However, current acceleration evaluations\nprimarily target minimal overall performance degradation, overlooking a crucial\nquestion: does the accelerated model still give the same answers to the same\nquestions as it did before acceleration? This is vital for stability-centered\nindustrial applications where consistently correct answers for specific, known\nsituations are paramount, such as in AI-based disease diagnosis. We\nsystematically investigate this for accelerated VLMs, testing four leading\nmodels (LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next, Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL) with eight acceleration\nmethods on ten multi-modal benchmarks. Our findings are stark: despite minimal\naggregate performance drops, accelerated models changed original answers up to\n20% of the time. Critically, up to 6.5% of these changes converted correct\nanswers to incorrect. Input perturbations magnified these inconsistencies, and\nthe trend is confirmed by case studies with the medical VLM LLaVA-Med. This\nresearch reveals a significant oversight in VLM acceleration, stressing an\nurgent need for instance-level stability checks to ensure trustworthy\nreal-world deployment.",

Specifically, T2I tasks prioritize multi-step\ninversion to synthesize coherent outputs aligned with textual prompts and\nshrink the latent space to reduce generating complexity. Contrariwise, SR tasks\npreserve most information from low-resolution input while solely restoring\nhigh-frequency details, thus necessitating sufficient latent space and fewer\ninference steps.

For such hybrid devices, a good coupling between the superconductor\nand the conducting states in the semiconductor wire is crucial. GaAs/InAs\ncore/shell nanowires with an insulating core, and a conductive InAs shell\nfulfill this requirement, since the electronic states are strongly confined\nnear the surface. However, maintaining a good crystal quality in the conducting\nshell is a challenge for this type of nanowire. In this work, we present\nphase-pure zincblende GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires and analyze their\nlow-temperature magnetotransport properties. We observe pronounced magnetic\nflux quantum periodic oscillations, which can be attributed to a combination of\nAharonov-Bohm and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations. From the gate and\ntemperature dependence of the conductance oscillations, as well as from\nsupporting theoretical transport calculations, we conclude that the conducting\nstates in the shell are in the quasi-ballistic transport regime, with few\nscattering centers, but nevertheless leading to an Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak\ncorrection that dominates at small magnetic field strengths.

    "abstract": "Generic text rewriting is a prevalent large language model (LLM) application\nthat covers diverse real-world tasks, such as style transfer, fact correction,\nand email editing. These tasks vary in rewriting objectives (e.g., factual\nconsistency vs. semantic preservation), making it challenging to develop a\nunified model that excels across all dimensions. Existing methods often\nspecialize in either a single task or a specific objective, limiting their\ngeneralizability. In this work, we introduce a generic model proficient in\nfactuality, stylistic, and conversational rewriting tasks. To simulate\nreal-world user rewrite requests, we construct a conversational rewrite\ndataset, ChatRewrite, that presents ``natural''-sounding instructions, from raw\nemails using LLMs. Combined with other popular rewrite datasets, including\nLongFact for the factuality rewrite task and RewriteLM for the stylistic\nrewrite task, this forms a broad benchmark for training and evaluating generic\nrewrite models. To align with task-specific objectives, we propose Dr Genre, a\nDecoupled-reward learning framework for Generic rewriting, that utilizes\nobjective-oriented reward models with a task-specific weighting. Evaluation\nshows that \\approach delivers higher-quality rewrites across all targeted\ntasks, improving objectives including instruction following (agreement),\ninternal consistency (coherence), and minimal unnecessary edits (conciseness).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce SemHiTok, a unified image Tokenizer via\nSemantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook that provides consistent discrete\nrepresentations for multimodal understanding and generation. Recently, unified\nimage tokenizers have sparked exploration within research community, which is\ndesigned to capture high-level semantic features for understanding and\nretaining low-level pixel features for generation. Previous works attempt to\ntrain a unified image tokenizer by combining loss for semantic distillation and\npixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features\nprioritized by multimodal understanding and generation, joint training methods\nface significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses\nthis challenge through a novel semantic-guided hierarchical codebook, which\nbuilds pixel sub-codebooks on a pretrained semantic codebook. This design\ndecouples semantic and pixel both in terms of structure and training strategy,\nenabling the tokenizer to capture pixel features while retaining its ability to\ncomprehend high-level semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that\nSemHiTok achieves SOTA performance in image reconstruction and multimodal\nunderstanding under LLaVA-v1.5 setting. Further, we develop a unified MLLM with\nSemHiTok, which exhibits superior performance across multimodal understanding\nand generation tasks. For understanding, SemHiTok achieves impressive\nperformance on most benchmarks. For generation, our model achieves SOTA\nperformance on MJHQ30K in unified MLLMs.",

    "abstract": "Regular expression (RE) matching is a very common functionality that scans a\ntext to find occurrences of patterns specified by an RE; it includes the\nsimpler function of RE recognition. Here we address RE parsing, which subsumes\nmatching by providing not just the pattern positions in the text, but also the\nsyntactic structure of each pattern occurrence, in the form of a tree\nrepresenting how the RE operators produced the patterns. RE parsing increases\nthe selectivity of matching, yet avoiding the complications of context-free\ngrammar parsers. Our parser manages ambiguous REs and texts by returning the\nset of all syntax trees, compressed into a Shared-Packed-Parse-Forest\ndata-structure. We initially convert the RE into a serial parser, which\nsimulates a finite automaton (FA) so that the states the automaton passes\nthrough encode the syntax tree of the input. On long texts, serial matching and\nparsing may be too slow for time-constrained applications. Therefore, we\npresent a novel efficient parallel parser for multi-processor computing\nplatforms; its speed-up over the serial algorithm scales well with the text\nlength. We innovatively apply to RE parsing the approach typical of parallel RE\nmatchers / recognizers, where the text is split into chunks to be parsed in\nparallel and then joined together. Such an approach suffers from the so-called\nspeculation overhead, due to the lack of knowledge by a chunk processor about\nthe state reached at the end of the preceding chunk; this forces each chunk\nprocessor to speculatively start in all its states. We introduce a novel\ntechnique that minimizes the speculation overhead. The multi-threaded parser\nprogram, written in Java, has been validated and its performance has been\nmeasured on a commodity multi-core computer, using public and synthetic RE\nbenchmarks. The speed-up over serial parsing, parsing times, and parser\nconstruction times are reported.",

    "abstract": "Neural fields have emerged as a powerful framework for representing\ncontinuous multidimensional signals such as images and videos, 3D and 4D\nobjects and scenes, and radiance fields. While efficient, achieving\nhigh-quality representation requires the use of wide and deep neural networks.\nThese, however, are slow to train and evaluate. Although several acceleration\ntechniques have been proposed, they either trade memory for faster training\nand/or inference, rely on thousands of fitted primitives with considerable\noptimization time, or compromise the smooth, continuous nature of neural\nfields. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Neural Fields (GNF), a novel\ncompact neural decoder that maps learned feature grids into continuous\nnon-linear signals, such as RGB images, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), and\nradiance fields, using a single compact layer of Gaussian kernels defined in a\nhigh-dimensional feature space. Our key observation is that neurons in\ntraditional MLPs perform simple computations, usually a dot product followed by\nan activation function, necessitating wide and deep MLPs or high-resolution\nfeature grids to model complex functions. In this paper, we show that replacing\nMLP-based decoders with Gaussian kernels whose centers are learned features\nyields highly accurate representations of 2D (RGB), 3D (geometry), and 5D\n(radiance fields) signals with just a single layer of such kernels. This\nrepresentation is highly parallelizable, operates on low-resolution grids, and\ntrains in under $15$ seconds for 3D geometry and under $11$ minutes for view\nsynthesis. GNF matches the accuracy of deep MLP-based decoders with far fewer\nparameters and significantly higher inference throughput.",

    "abstract": "The Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) is an X-ray CCD camera of the Xtend system\nonboard the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), which was\nsuccessfully launched on September 7, 2023 (JST). During ground cooling tests\nof the CCDs in 2020/2021, using the flight-model detector housing, electronic\nboards, and a mechanical cooler, we encountered an unexpected issue. Anomalous\ncharges appeared outside the imaging area of the CCDs and intruded into the\nimaging area, causing pulse heights to stick to the maximum value over a wide\nregion. Although this issue has not occurred in subsequent tests or in orbit so\nfar, it could seriously affect the imaging and spectroscopic performance of the\nSXI if it were to happen in the future. Through experiments with\nnon-flight-model detector components, we successfully reproduced the issue and\nidentified that the anomalous charges intrude via the potential structure\ncreated by the charge injection electrode at the top of the imaging area. To\nprevent anomalous charge intrusion and maintain imaging and spectroscopic\nperformance that satisfies the requirements, even if this issue occurs in\norbit, we developed a new CCD driving technique. This technique is different\nfrom the normal operation in terms of potential structure and its changes\nduring imaging and charge injection.

    "abstract": "Near-field communication with large antenna arrays promises significant\nbeamforming and multiplexing gains.

This leads to critical challenges for the\nrobustness of these near-field communication systems. In this paper, we propose\n\\textit{sphere precoding}, which is a robust precoding design to address user\nmobility in near-field communications. To gain insights into the spatial\ncorrelation of near-field channels, we extend the one-ring channel model to\nwhat we call one-sphere channel model and derive the channel covariance\nconsidering user mobility. Based on the one-sphere channel model, a robust\nprecoding design problem is defined to optimize the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) satisfaction probability among\nmobile users. By utilizing the eigen structure of channel covariance, we\nfurther design a relaxed convex problem to approximate the solution of the\noriginal non-convex problem. The low-complexity solution effectively shapes a\nsphere that maintains the signal power for the target user and also nulls its\ninterference within spheres around the other users.

    "abstract": "The frequency of a quantum harmonic oscillator cannot be determined through\nstatic measurement strategies on a prepared state, as the eigenstates of the\nsystem are independent of its frequency. Therefore, dynamic procedures must be\nemployed, involving measurements taken after the system has evolved and encoded\nthe frequency information. This paper explores the precision achievable in a\nprotocol where a known detuning suddenly shifts the oscillator's frequency,\nwhich then reverts to its original value after a specific time interval. Our\nresults demonstrate that the squeezing induced by this frequency jump can\neffectively enhance the encoding of frequency information, significantly\nimproving the quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR) compared to standard free\nevolution at the same resource (energy and time) cost. The QSNR exhibits\nminimal dependence on the actual frequency and increases with both the\nmagnitude of the detuning and the overall duration of the protocol.\nFurthermore, incorporating multiple frequency jumps into the protocol could\nfurther enhance precision, particularly for lower frequency values.",

Treatment for LVO involves highly specialized care, in particular\nendovascular thrombectomy, and is available only at certain hospitals.\nTherefore, prehospital identification of LVO by emergency ambulance services,\ncan be critical for triaging LVO stroke patients directly to a hospital with\naccess to endovascular therapy. Clinical scores exist to help distinguish LVO\nfrom less severe strokes, but they are based on a series of examinations that\ncan take minutes and may be impractical for patients with dementia or those who\ncannot follow commands due to their stroke. There is a need for a fast and\nreliable method to aid in the early identification of LVO. In this study, our\nobjective was to assess the feasibility of using 30-second photoplethysmography\n(PPG) recording to assist in recognizing LVO stroke. Method. A total of 88\npatients, including 25 with LVO, 27 with stroke mimic (SM), and 36 non-LVO\nstroke patients (NL), were recorded at the Liverpool Hospital emergency\ndepartment in Sydney, Australia. Demographics (age, sex), as well as\nmorphological features and beating rate variability measures, were extracted\nfrom the PPG. A binary classification approach was employed to differentiate\nbetween LVO stroke and NL+SM (NL.SM). A 2:1 train-test split was stratified and\nrepeated randomly across 100 iterations. Results. The best model achieved a\nmedian test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)\nof 0.77 (0.71--0.82). \\textit{Conclusion.} Our study demonstrates the potential\nof utilizing a 30-second PPG recording for identifying LVO stroke.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses query scheduling for goal-oriented semantic\ncommunication in pull-based status update systems. We consider a system where\nmultiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various\nattributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act\nupon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the\nendpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on\nobserved attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast\nto the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions\neffectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of\neffectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective\ntheory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk\nawareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we\ncompute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected\ndiscounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while\ncomplying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a\nmodel-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions\nemploying state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our\nfindings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the\neffectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods,\nparticularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query\nscheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.",

Considering the\nwhole sample, radio-detected sources show an increased outflow detection rate\n(56$\\pm$7\\%) compared to radio-undetected sources (25$\\pm$3\\%).

By\ncombining BAO+SN+CMB despite these mild tensions, we obtain\n$\\Omega_k=-5.5^{+4.6}_{-4.2}\\times10^{-3}$ in $k\\Lambda$CDM, and\n$w=-0.948^{+0.028}_{-0.027}$ in $w$CDM. If we open the parameter space to\n$w_0$$w_a$CDM\\$ (where the equation of state of dark energy varies as\n$w(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a$), all the datasets are mutually more compatible, and we\nfind concordance in the $[w_0>-1,w_a<0]$ quadrant. For DES BAO and SN in\ncombination with Planck-CMB, we find a $3.2\\sigma$ deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM,\nwith $w_0=-0.673^{+0.098}_{-0.097}$, $w_a = -1.37^{+0.51}_{-0.50}$, a Hubble\nconstant of $H_0=67.81^{+0.96}_{-0.86}$km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, and an abundance\nof matter of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.3109^{+0.0086}_{-0.0099}$. For the combination\nof all the background cosmological probes considered (including CMB\n$\\theta_\\star$), we still find a deviation of $2.8\\sigma$ from $\\Lambda$CDMin\nthe $w_0-w_a$ plane. Assuming a minimal neutrino mass, this work provides\nfurther evidence for non-$\\Lambda$CDM physics or systematics, which is\nconsistent with recent claims in support of evolving dark energy.",

How can SAM2 be\nadapted to multi-modal data? 2. How can SAM2 better understand semantics?\nInspired by cross-frame correlation in videos, we propose to treat multi-modal\ndata as a sequence of frames representing the same scene. Our key idea is to\n''memorize'' the modality-agnostic information and 'memorize' the semantics\nrelated to the targeted scene. To achieve this, we apply SAM2's memory\nmechanisms across multi-modal data to capture modality-agnostic features.\nMeanwhile, to memorize the semantic knowledge, we propose a training-only\nSemantic Prototype Memory Module (SPMM) to store category-level prototypes\nacross training for facilitating SAM2's transition from instance to semantic\nsegmentation. A prototypical adaptation loss is imposed between global and\nlocal prototypes iteratively to align and refine SAM2's semantic understanding.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MemorySAM\noutperforms SoTA methods by large margins on both synthetic and real-world\nbenchmarks (65.38% on DELIVER, 52.88% on MCubeS).

    "abstract": "Accurate probabilistic load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the safety\nand stability of power systems. However, the mainstream approach, multi-step\nprediction, must be improved by cumulative errors and latency issues, which\nlimits its effectiveness in probabilistic day-ahead load forecasting (PDALF).\nTo overcome these challenges, we introduce DALNet, a novel denoising diffusion\nmodel designed to generate load curves rather than relying on direct\nprediction. By shifting the focus to curve generation, DALNet captures the\ncomplex distribution of actual load time-series data under specific conditions\nwith greater fidelity. To further enhance DALNet, we propose the temporal\nmulti-scale attention block (TMSAB), a mechanism designed to integrate both\npositional and temporal information for improved forecasting precision.\nFurthermore, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) to reconstruct the\ndistribution of generated load curves and employ KL divergence to compare them\nwith the actual data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that DALNet\nexcels in load forecasting accuracy and offers a novel perspective for other\npredictive tasks within power systems.",

The results show\nthat big data adoption significantly enhances ESG investing, as data-driven\nanalytics improve sustainability assessments and capital allocation. Financial\nmarket development also positively influences ESG investments, but its effect\nis relatively small. A key finding is that inflation negatively impacts ESG\ninvestment, highlighting the importance of macroeconomic stability in fostering\nsustainable finance. In contrast, GDP per capita and foreign direct investment\n(FDI) are not significant determinants, suggesting that economic growth alone\ndoes not drive sustainability efforts.

Specifically, we design a patch-level\nadaptive condition selection mechanism that dynamically prioritizes spatially\nrelevant control signals at the sub-region level, enabling precise local\nguidance without global interference. Additionally, a time-aware control\ninjection scheme is deployed to modulate condition influence according to\ndenoising timesteps, progressively transitioning from structural preservation\nto texture refinement and fully utilizing the control information from\ndifferent categories to promote more harmonious image generation. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PixelPonder surpasses previous methods across\ndifferent benchmark datasets, showing superior improvement in spatial alignment\naccuracy while maintaining high textual semantic consistency.",

While existing methods rely on implicit representation learning\nparadigms, they often fail to dynamically adjust semantic embeddings according\nto contextual cues, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained scenarios\nsuch as cloud thickness differentiation. This work introduces a dynamic\ndictionary learning framework that explicitly models class ID embeddings\nthrough iterative refinement. The core contribution lies in a novel dictionary\nconstruction mechanism, where class-aware semantic embeddings are progressively\nupdated via multi-stage alternating cross-attention querying between image\nfeatures and dictionary embeddings. This process enables adaptive\nrepresentation learning tailored to input-specific characteristics, effectively\nresolving ambiguities in intra-class heterogeneity and inter-class homogeneity.\nTo further enhance discriminability, a contrastive constraint is applied to the\ndictionary space, ensuring compact intra-class distributions while maximizing\ninter-class separability.

While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution\nmatching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they\nfall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation\noffers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face\na persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step\nsampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To\nbridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory\nDistribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the\nstrengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a\ndata-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with\nthe teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a\nsampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different\nsteps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both\ndeterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step\nadaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency.\nOur model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL\nand PixArt-$\\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced\ntraining costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\\alpha$ into a\n4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024\nresolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere\n0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be\nextended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion.

This polarization is\ngenerally not switchable by an external electric field, because reversing the\ndomain wall polarity would require reversing the strain gradient, which in turn\nwould require switching the spontaneous strain of the adjacent domains,\ndestroying the domain wall in the process. However, domain wall polarization\ncan also arise from biquadratic coupling between polar and non-polar order\nparameters (e.g. octahedral tilts in perovskites). Such coupling is independent\nof the sign of the polarization and thus allows switching between +P and -P. In\nthis work, we seek to answer the question of whether the polarization of domain\nwalls in ferroelastic perovskites is switchable, as per the symmetric\nbiquadratic term, or non-switchable due to the unipolar flexoelectric bias.\nUsing perovskite calcium titanate (CaTiO3) as a paradigm, molecular dynamics\ncalculations indicate that high electric fields broaden the ferroelastic domain\nwalls, thereby reducing flexoelectricity (as the domain wall strain gradient is\ninversely proportional to the wall width), eventually enabling switching. The\npolarization switching, however, is not ferroelectric-like with a simple\nhysteresis loop, but antiferroelectric-like with a double hysteresis loop.\nFerroelastic domain walls thus behave as functional antiferroelectric elements,\nand also as nucleation points for a bulk phase transition to a polar state.",

    "abstract": "Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both\nintriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and\npromising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these\nstudies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study\nmany-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian\nbath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous\neigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized\nLiouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are\nnot related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the\nsymmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative\nfour-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or\ncomplex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others\ncould only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify\n$N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and\ntwo scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry.\nSimilar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also\ncharacterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator\nsize is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance.\nBy contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum\nchaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size\nand a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover,\nthe entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong\ndependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.",

We\nrun this experiment on multiple Kaggle datasets that have been intentionally\ncorrupted with errors. Our results show that LLMs can identify and correct\nerroneous entries, such as illogical values or outlier, by leveraging\ncontextual information from other features within the same row, as well as\nfeedback from previous iterations.

The analysis is based on the\nseparation between a slow centralized optimization dynamics describing the\nevolution of the average estimate toward the optimum, and a fast dynamics\ndescribing the evolution of the consensus error over the network. These two\ndynamics are mutually coupled, and the stability analysis builds on control\ntheoretic tools such as time-scale separation, Lyapunov theory, and the\nsmall-gain principle. Our analysis approach highlights that the consensus\ndynamics can be seen as a fast, parasite one, and that stability of the\ndistributed algorithm is obtained as a robustness consequence of the semiglobal\nexponential stability properties of the centralized method.

We propose AxisPose, a\nmodel-free, matching-free, single-shot solution for robust 6D pose estimation,\nwhich fundamentally diverges from the existing paradigm. Unlike existing\nmethods that rely on 2D-3D or 2D-2D matching using 3D techniques, such as SfM\nand PnP, AxisPose directly infers a robust 6D pose from a single view by\nleveraging a diffusion model to learn the latent axis distribution of objects\nwithout reference views. Specifically, AxisPose constructs an Axis Generation\nModule (AGM) to capture the latent geometric distribution of object axes\nthrough a diffusion model. The diffusion process is guided by injecting the\ngradient of geometric consistency loss into the noise estimation to maintain\nthe geometric consistency of the generated tri-axis. With the generated\ntri-axis projection, AxisPose further adopts a Triaxial Back-projection Module\n(TBM) to recover the 6D pose from the object tri-axis. The proposed AxisPose\nachieves robust performance at the cross-instance level (i.e., one model for N\ninstances) using only a single view as input without reference images, with\ngreat potential for generalization to unseen-object level.",

    "abstract": "Accurate food intake monitoring is crucial for maintaining a healthy diet and\npreventing nutrition-related diseases. With the diverse range of foods consumed\nacross various cultures, classic food classification models have limitations\ndue to their reliance on fixed-sized food datasets. Studies show that people\nconsume only a small range of foods across the existing ones, each consuming a\nunique set of foods. Existing class-incremental models have low accuracy for\nthe new classes and lack personalization. This paper introduces a personalized,\nclass-incremental food classification model designed to overcome these\nchallenges and improve the performance of food intake monitoring systems. Our\napproach adapts itself to the new array of food classes, maintaining\napplicability and accuracy, both for new and existing classes by using\npersonalization. Our model's primary focus is personalization, which improves\nclassification accuracy by prioritizing a subset of foods based on an\nindividual's eating habits, including meal frequency, times, and locations. A\nmodified version of DSN is utilized to expand on the appearance of new food\nclasses. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive framework that integrates\nthis model into a food intake monitoring system. This system analyzes meal\nimages provided by users, makes use of a smart scale to estimate food weight,\nutilizes a nutrient content database to calculate the amount of each\nmacro-nutrient, and creates a dietary user profile through a mobile\napplication. Finally, experimental evaluations on two new benchmark datasets\nFOOD101-Personal and VFN-Personal, personalized versions of well-known datasets\nfor food classification, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmodel in improving the classification accuracy of both new and existing\nclasses, addressing the limitations of both conventional and class-incremental\nfood classification models.",

Given that a model with multiple changes in factor loadings can be\nobservationally indistinguishable from one with constant loadings but varying\nfactor variances, this reduces the high-dimensional structural change problem\nto a lower-dimensional one. Due to the presence of multiple breakpoints, the\nfactor space may expand, potentially causing the pseudo factor covariance\nmatrix within some regimes to be singular. We define two types of breakpoints:\n{\\bf a singular change}, where the number of factors in the combined regime\nexceeds the minimum number of factors in the two separate regimes, and {\\bf a\nrotational change}, where the number of factors in the combined regime equals\nthat in each separate regime. Under a singular change, we derive the properties\nof the small eigenvalues and establish the consistency of the QML estimators.\nUnder a rotational change, unlike in the single-breakpoint case, the pseudo\nfactor covariance matrix within each regime can be either full rank or\nsingular, yet the QML estimation error for the breakpoints remains stably\nbounded. We further propose an information criterion (IC) to estimate the\nnumber of breakpoints and show that, with probability approaching one, it\naccurately identifies the true number of structural changes. Monte Carlo\nsimulations confirm strong finite-sample performance. Finally, we apply our\nmethod to the FRED-MD dataset, identifying five structural breaks in factor\nloadings between 1959 and 2024.",

Then by employing the many-to-one properties\nof these low degree or linearized polynomials on $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, we derive a\nseries of explicit characterization for $f(x)$ to be many-to-one on\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. On the other hand, for all $1$-to-$1$ mappings obtained in\nthis paper, we determine the inverses of these permutation polynomials.\nMoreover, we also explicitly construct involutions from $2$-to-$1$ mappings of\nthis form. Our findings generalize and unify many results in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The\nrecently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph\nneural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and\nthere is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep\ngraph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issues: (i)\nthe inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations\nfor proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of\ninter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to\nbiased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional\napproaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers,\nwhich causes a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label\nthus making all samples similar and less discriminative. To address these\nchallenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and\npropose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and\nClustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i)\ncut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal\ntransport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding\nobjective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint\nnormalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport\ntheory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of\n\"proximity to the pre-learned cluster center\". With the above two tailored\ndesigns, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can\neffectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better\nperformance.

To address this issue, a new centroiding\nalgorithm for point-source trails has been developed.

However,\nexisting studies often rely on weather data in pixel space, which presents\nseveral challenges such as smooth outputs in model outputs, limited\napplicability to a single pressure-variable subset (PVS), and high data storage\nand computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nWeather Latent Autoencoder (WLA) that transforms weather data from pixel space\nto latent space, enabling efficient weather task modeling. By decoupling\nweather reconstruction from downstream tasks, WLA improves the accuracy and\nsharpness of weather task model results. The incorporated Pressure-Variable\nUnified Module transforms multiple PVS into a unified representation, enhancing\nthe adaptability of the model in multiple weather scenarios. Furthermore,\nweather tasks can be performed in a low-storage latent space of WLA rather than\na high-storage pixel space, thus significantly reducing data storage and\ncomputational costs. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate its\nsuperior compression and reconstruction performance, enabling the creation of\nthe ERA5-latent dataset with unified representations of multiple PVS from ERA5\ndata. The compressed full PVS in the ERA5-latent dataset reduces the original\n244.34 TB of data to 0.43 TB.

To address this issue, we propose a novel\nvision-language tracking framework, named DUTrack, which captures the latest\nstate of the target by dynamically updating multi-modal references to maintain\nconsistency.

    "abstract": "Performance and reliability analyses of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can benefit\nfrom tools that ``amplify'' small datasets to synthesize larger volumes of\nplausible samples of the AV's behavior. We consider a specific instance of this\ndata synthesis problem that addresses minimizing the AV's exposure to adverse\nenvironmental conditions during travel to a fixed goal location. The\nenvironment is characterized by a threat field, which is a strictly positive\nscalar field with higher intensities corresponding to hazardous and unfavorable\nconditions for the AV. We address the problem of synthesizing datasets of\nminimum exposure paths that resemble a training dataset of such paths. The main\ncontribution of this paper is an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) model to\nsolve this problem. We consider time-invariant (static) as well as time-varying\n(dynamic) threat fields. We find that the proposed IRL model provides excellent\nperformance in synthesizing paths from initial conditions not seen in the\ntraining dataset, when the threat field is the same as that used for training.\nFurthermore, we evaluate model performance on unseen threat fields and find low\nerror in that case as well. Finally, we demonstrate the model's ability to\nsynthesize distinct datasets when trained on different datasets with distinct\ncharacteristics.",

However, consumer-grade GPUs are\noptimized for single-precision calculations, making double-precision\nsimulations inefficient on widely available hardware. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that single-precision simulations can achieve the same accuracy as\ndouble-precision methods while delivering a 27-fold increase in computational\nspeed. To achieve this, we introduce two key improvements: (i) the shifted\ndistribution function in the lattice Boltzmann method, which mitigates\nprecision loss at low velocities, and (ii) the use of larger time steps in the\nfinite-difference solver, which reduces numerical errors and improves overall\naccuracy. We find that, unlike in double precision, accuracy in\nsingle-precision simulations follows a non-monotonic trend with respect to the\nfinite-difference time step, revealing an optimal regime for precise\ncomputations. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we simulate the\ndynamics of single and multiple skyrmionic tubes in Poiseuille flow.

For this challenge, we introduce GroMo25, a dataset with images of\nfour crops: radish, okra, wheat, and mustard.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation is a core task in computer vision with applications in\nbiomedical imaging, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. While standard loss\nfunctions such as cross-entropy and Dice loss perform well in general cases,\nthey often struggle with fine structures, particularly in tasks involving thin\nstructures or closely packed objects. Various weight map-based loss functions\nhave been proposed to address this issue by assigning higher loss weights to\npixels prone to misclassification. However, these methods typically rely on\nprecomputed or runtime-generated weight maps based on distance transforms,\nwhich impose significant computational costs and fail to adapt to evolving\nnetwork predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel steerable pyramid-based\nweighted (SPW) loss function that efficiently generates adaptive weight maps.\nUnlike traditional boundary-aware losses that depend on static or iteratively\nupdated distance maps, our method leverages steerable pyramids to dynamically\nemphasize regions across multiple frequency bands (capturing features at\ndifferent scales) while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, by\nincorporating network predictions into the weight computation, our approach\nenables adaptive refinement during training. We evaluate our method on the\nSNEMI3D, GlaS, and DRIVE datasets, benchmarking it against 11 state-of-the-art\nloss functions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed SPW loss function\nachieves superior pixel precision and segmentation accuracy with minimal\ncomputational overhead. This work provides an effective and efficient solution\nfor improving semantic segmentation, particularly for applications requiring\nmultiscale feature representation.

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are envisioned to enhance the\nperformance of mmWave wireless systems. In practice, multiple mobile operators\n(MO) coexist in an area and provide simultaneous and independent services to\nuser-equipments (UEs) on different frequency bands. Then, if each MO deploys an\nIRS to enhance its performance, the IRSs also alter the channels of UEs of\nother MOs. In this context, this paper addresses the following questions: can\nan MO still continue to control its IRS independently of other MOs and IRSs? Is\njoint optimization of IRSs deployed by different MOs and inter-MO cooperation\nneeded? To that end, by considering the mmWave bands, we first derive the\nergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) in a $2$-MO system for the following\nschemes: 1) joint optimization of an overall phase angle of the IRSs with MO\ncooperation, 2) MO cooperation via time-sharing, and 3) no cooperation between\nthe MOs. We find that even with no cooperation between the MOs, the performance\nof a given MO is not degraded by the presence of an out-of-band (OOB) MO\ndeploying and independently controlling its own IRS. On the other hand, the SE\ngain obtained at a given MO using joint optimization and cooperation over the\nno-cooperation scheme decreases inversely with the number of elements in the\nIRS deployed by the other MO. We generalize our results to a multiple MO setup\nand show that the gain in the sum-SE over the no-cooperation case increases at\nleast linearly with the number of OOB MOs. Finally, we numerically verify our\nfindings and conclude that every MO can independently operate and tune its IRS;\ncooperation via optimizing an overall phase only brings marginal benefits in\npractice.",

In this article, we demonstrate that turbulence in the cosmic\nbaryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial\ndistribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the universe.\nFirst, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in\nlow-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon\nfractions, while prevent the inflow of the gas in high-density regions, leading\nto low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal\nenergy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially\nreached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in\na state of fully-developed turbulence within this redshift range. Due to\nturbulent heating, as redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is\nheated and transitions into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have been widely adopted in image and video generation.\nHowever, their complex network architecture leads to high inference overhead\nfor its generation process. Existing diffusion quantization methods primarily\nfocus on the quantization of the model structure while ignoring the impact of\ntime-steps variation during sampling. At the same time, most current approaches\nfail to account for significant activations that cannot be eliminated,\nresulting in substantial performance degradation after quantization. To address\nthese issues, we propose Time-Rotation Diffusion Quantization (TR-DQ), a novel\nquantization method incorporating time-step and rotation-based optimization.\nTR-DQ first divides the sampling process based on time-steps and applies a\nrotation matrix to smooth activations and weights dynamically. For different\ntime-steps, a dedicated hyperparameter is introduced for adaptive timing\nmodeling, which enables dynamic quantization across different time steps.\nAdditionally, we also explore the compression potential of Classifier-Free\nGuidance (CFG-wise) to establish a foundation for subsequent work. TR-DQ\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on image generation and video\ngeneration tasks and a 1.38-1.89x speedup and 1.97-2.58x memory reduction in\ninference compared to existing quantization methods.",

This study aims to\nquantify these effects through a combination of results from micro-CT imaging,\nsonic testing, and mechanical testing on coal samples. Micro-CT imaging\nprovides insights into coal's internal structure by focusing on parameters such\nas fracture porosity and fracture intensity (P32 factor). Sonic testing\nmeasures dynamic properties, including P-wave, S-wave velocities (Vp and Vs)\nand dynamic Young's modulus (Ed), under both dry and wet conditions.

The key findings\nare: (i) Micro-CT imaging shows a strong correlation between coal fracture\nporosity and P32, offering detailed insights into the coal micro-structure;\n(ii) mechanical testing reveals that dry samples exhibit a 10% higher Es and\n31% greater UCS than wet samples, suggesting that dewatering increases coal\nstrength but potentially also promotes embrittlement; and (iii) wet samples\nshow higher Vp and Ed in sonic tests, indicating water saturation significantly\ninfluences sonic measurements.

    "abstract": "Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) is a promising task to boost the\nrobustness of small-capacity models with the guidance of the pre-trained robust\nteacher. The ARD can be summarized as a min-max optimization process, i.e.,\nsynthesizing adversarial examples (inner) & training the student (outer).\nAlthough competitive robustness performance, existing ARD methods still have\nissues. In the inner process, the synthetic training examples are far from the\nteacher's decision boundary leading to important robust information missing. In\nthe outer process, the student model is decoupled from learning natural and\nrobust scenarios, leading to the robustness saturation, i.e., student\nperformance is highly susceptible to customized teacher selection. To tackle\nthese issues, this paper proposes a general Min-Max optimization Adversarial\nRobustness Distillation (MMARD) method. For the inner process, we introduce the\nteacher's robust predictions, which drive the training examples closer to the\nteacher's decision boundary to explore more robust knowledge. For the outer\nprocess, we propose a structured information modeling method based on\ntriangular relationships to measure the mutual information of the model in\nnatural and robust scenarios and enhance the model's ability to understand\nmulti-scenario mapping relationships. Experiments show our MMARD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Besides, MMARD is\nplug-and-play and convenient to combine with existing methods.",

While such models\nrepresent state-of-the-art approaches in industrial applications such as\nartificial image generation, it has recently been noted that their performance\ncan be further improved by considering injection noise with heavy tailed\ncharacteristics. Here, I present a generalization of generative diffusion\nprocesses to a wide class of non-Gaussian noise processes. I consider forward\nprocesses driven by standard Gaussian noise with super-imposed Poisson jumps\nrepresenting a finite activity Levy process. The generative process is shown to\nbe governed by a generalized score function that depends on the jump amplitude\ndistribution. Both probability flow ODE and SDE formulations are derived using\nbasic technical effort, and are implemented for jump amplitudes drawn from a\nmultivariate Laplace distribution. Remarkably, for the problem of capturing a\nheavy-tailed target distribution, the jump-diffusion Laplace model outperforms\nmodels driven by alpha-stable noise despite not containing any heavy-tailed\ncharacteristics. The framework can be readily applied to other jump statistics\nthat could further improve on the performance of standard diffusion models.",

    "abstract": "This paper critically examines the recent publication \"ChatGPT-4 in the\nTuring Test\" by Restrepo Echavarr\\'ia (2025), challenging its central claims\nregarding the absence of minimally serious test implementations and the\nconclusion that ChatGPT-4 fails the Turing Test. The analysis reveals that the\ncriticisms based on rigid criteria and limited experimental data are not fully\njustified. More importantly, the paper makes several constructive contributions\nthat enrich our understanding of Turing Test implementations. It demonstrates\nthat two distinct formats--the three-player and two-player tests--are both\nvalid, each with unique methodological implications. The work distinguishes\nbetween absolute criteria (reflecting an optimal 50% identification rate in a\nthree-player format) and relative criteria (which measure how closely a\nmachine's performance approximates that of a human), offering a more nuanced\nevaluation framework. Furthermore, the paper clarifies the probabilistic\nunderpinnings of both test types by modeling them as Bernoulli\nexperiments--correlated in the three-player version and uncorrelated in the\ntwo-player version. This formalization allows for a rigorous separation between\nthe theoretical criteria for passing the test, defined in probabilistic terms,\nand the experimental data that require robust statistical methods for proper\ninterpretation. In doing so, the paper not only refutes key aspects of the\ncriticized study but also lays a solid foundation for future research on\nobjective measures of how closely an AI's behavior aligns with, or deviates\nfrom, that of a human being.",

Although existing LLM-based moderators can detect harmful\ncontent, they struggle to assess risk levels and may miss lower-risk outputs.\nAccurate risk assessment allows platforms with different safety thresholds to\ntailor content filtering and rejection. In this paper, we introduce per-topic\nseverity rubrics for 11 harmful topics and build BingoGuard, an LLM-based\nmoderation system designed to predict both binary safety labels and severity\nlevels. To address the lack of annotations on levels of severity, we propose a\nscalable generate-then-filter framework that first generates responses across\ndifferent severity levels and then filters out low-quality responses. Using\nthis framework, we create BingoGuardTrain, a training dataset with 54,897\nexamples covering a variety of topics, response severity, styles, and\nBingoGuardTest, a test set with 988 examples explicitly labeled based on our\nseverity rubrics that enables fine-grained analysis on model behaviors on\ndifferent severity levels.

In the present work, a fluid force model for a\nfinite-size spherical particle in turbulence is developed by simulating\nturbulent flow past a fixed spherical particle using particle-resolved direct\nnumerical simulation (PRDNS). Our simulation demonstrates that turbulence\nincreases the mean drag force of the particle, which is consistent with\nprevious studies. By correlating the DNS data as functions of the Reynolds\nnumber of particles, the ratio of the particle-to-turbulence scale, and the\nintensity ratio of the turbulence, an empirical correlation for the mean drag\nforce is obtained. Furthermore, we find that the fluctuations of both the drag\nand lateral forces follow the Gaussian distribution. Consequently, the temporal\nvariations of the fluctuating drag and lateral forces are modeled using a\nstochastic Langevin equation. Empirical correlations of the fluctuation\nintensities and time scales involved in the stochastic model are also\ndetermined from the DNS data. Finally, we simulate the movement of a\nfinite-size particle in turbulence and the dispersion of particles in a\nturbulent channel flow to validate the proposed model.

We show that under suitable regularity conditions on the\nstructure functions, the extremal behavior is described by a multivariate\nPareto distribution, which can be represented as a new SCM on an extremal\ngraph. Importantly, the latter is a sub-graph of the graph in the original SCM,\nwhich means that causal links can disappear in the tails. We further introduce\na directed version of extremal graphical models and show that an extremal SCM\nsatisfies the corresponding Markov properties. Based on a new test of extremal\nconditional independence, we propose two algorithms for learning the extremal\ncausal structure from data. The first is an extremal version of the\nPC-algorithm, and the second is a pruning algorithm that removes edges from the\noriginal graph to consistently recover the extremal graph. The methods are\nillustrated on river data with known causal ground truth.",

Subsequently, a hierarchical optimization strategy is employed\nfor two CLM design scenarios: In trajectory shape-constrained scenarios, a\ncoarse-to-fine optimization process, integrating Fourier descriptors, refines\nthe design from overall shape to local features. In scenarios without\ntrajectory shape constraints, a stepwise optimization process is proposed for\nreconfigurable CLMs to transition from primary motion to auxiliary motion. The\nrobustness of the proposed design strategy is validated across three\nconfigurations and seven algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed design\nstrategy is verified by comparison with other existing CLM design methods. The\napplicability of the proposed strategy is confirmed through simulation and\nprototype experiments. The results demonstrate that the hierarchical strategy\neffectively addresses the challenges of precise performance design in CLMs. Our\nwork provides a general framework for the CLM design and offers insights for\nthe optimization design of other closed-chain linkages.",

    "abstract": "As object detection becomes integral to many safety-critical applications,\nunderstanding its vulnerabilities is essential. Backdoor attacks, in\nparticular, pose a serious threat by implanting hidden triggers in victim\nmodels, which adversaries can later exploit to induce malicious behaviors\nduring inference. However, current understanding is limited to single-target\nattacks, where adversaries must define a fixed malicious behavior (target)\nbefore training, making inference-time adaptability impossible. Given the large\noutput space of object detection (including object existence prediction,\nbounding box estimation, and classification), the feasibility of flexible,\ninference-time model control remains unexplored. This paper introduces\nAnywhereDoor, a multi-target backdoor attack for object detection. Once\nimplanted, AnywhereDoor allows adversaries to make objects disappear, fabricate\nnew ones, or mislabel them, either across all object classes or specific ones,\noffering an unprecedented degree of control. This flexibility is enabled by\nthree key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to scale the number of\nsupported targets; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure robustness even against\nregion-based detectors; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level\ndata imbalances that hinder manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat AnywhereDoor grants attackers a high degree of control, improving attack\nsuccess rates by 26% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such\nflexible control.",

To address these\nlimitations, we propose Seg-Zero, a novel framework that demonstrates\nremarkable generalizability and derives explicit chain-of-thought reasoning\nthrough cognitive reinforcement. Seg-Zero introduces a decoupled architecture\nconsisting of a reasoning model and a segmentation model.

Trained exclusively via reinforcement learning with\nGRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Seg-Zero achieves robust zero-shot\ngeneralization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning capabilities.\nExperiments show that Seg-Zero-7B achieves a zero-shot performance of 57.5 on\nthe ReasonSeg benchmark, surpassing the prior LISA-7B by 18\\%.

Deploying SLMs on edge devices, such as smartphones and smart\nvehicles, has become a growing trend. However, the security implications of\nSLMs have received less attention than LLMs, particularly regarding jailbreak\nattacks, which is recognized as one of the top threats of LLMs by the OWASP. In\nthis paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of SLMs'\nvulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Through systematically evaluation on 63\nSLMs from 15 mainstream SLM families against 8 state-of-the-art jailbreak\nmethods, we demonstrate that 47.6% of evaluated SLMs show high susceptibility\nto jailbreak attacks (ASR > 40%) and 38.1% of them can not even resist direct\nharmful query (ASR > 50%). We further analyze the reasons behind the\nvulnerabilities and identify four key factors: model size, model architecture,\ntraining datasets and training techniques. Moreover, we assess the\neffectiveness of three prompt-level defense methods and find that none of them\nachieve perfect performance, with detection accuracy varying across different\nSLMs and attack methods. Notably, we point out that the inherent security\nawareness play a critical role in SLM security, and models with strong security\nawareness could timely terminate unsafe response with little reminder. Building\nupon the findings, we highlight the urgent need for security-by-design\napproaches in SLM development and provide valuable insights for building more\ntrustworthy SLM ecosystem.",

Although post-training quantization (PTQ) offers a promising\ncompression solution, existing methods yield unsatisfactory results when\napplied to SAM, owing to its specialized model components and promptable\nworkflow: (i) The mask decoder's attention exhibits extreme outliers, and we\nfind that aggressive clipping (ranging down to even 100$\\times$), instead of\nsmoothing or isolation, is effective in suppressing outliers while maintaining\nsemantic capabilities. Unfortunately, traditional metrics (e.g., MSE) fail to\nprovide such large-scale clipping.

To address the above issues, we propose SAQ-SAM in\nthis paper, which boosts PTQ of SAM with semantic alignment. Specifically, we\npropose Perceptual-Consistency Clipping, which exploits attention focus overlap\nas clipping metric, to significantly suppress outliers. Furthermore, we propose\nPrompt-Aware Reconstruction, which incorporates visual-prompt interactions by\nleveraging cross-attention responses in mask decoder, thus facilitating\nalignment in both distribution and semantics.

As a proof of concept, we design a graphene-like\nacoustic surface wave metamaterial, where meta-atom pairs generate vortices\nwith opposite orbital angular momenta, which couple to acoustic spin textures,\nforming skyrmion molecules. Experimental measurements confirm their stable\ntransport and flexible control.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generative models have made significant advancements in recent\nyears; however, accurately capturing intricate details in textual prompts-such\nas entity missing, attribute binding errors, and incorrect relationships\nremains a formidable challenge. In response, we present an innovative,\ntraining-free method that directly addresses these challenges by incorporating\ntailored objectives to account for textual constraints. Unlike layout-based\napproaches that enforce rigid structures and limit diversity, our proposed\napproach offers a more flexible arrangement of the scene by imposing just the\nextracted constraints from the text, without any unnecessary additions. These\nconstraints are formulated as losses-entity missing, entity mixing, attribute\nbinding, and spatial relationships-integrated into a unified loss that is\napplied in the first generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce a\nfeedback-driven system for fine-grained initial noise refinement. This system\nintegrates a verifier that evaluates the generated image, identifies\ninconsistencies, and provides corrective feedback. Leveraging this feedback,\nour refinement method first targets the unmet constraints by refining the\nfaulty attention maps caused by initial noise, through the optimization of\nselective losses associated with these constraints. Subsequently, our unified\nloss function is reapplied to proceed the second generation phase. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method, relying solely on our proposed objective\nfunctions, significantly enhances compositionality, achieving a 24% improvement\nin human evaluation and a 25% gain in spatial relationships.

We generate disorder by\nintroducing random refractive index variations in one of the bilayers, while\nthe application of a control field to $\\Lambda$-type atoms within a central\ndefect layer enables dynamic tuning of the effective refractive index of\ncrystal. We have employed traditional transfer matrix method to demonstrate\ntransmission, Lyapunov exponents and absorption in the crystal. Through\ncoherent control, we dynamically tune absorption, revealing sharp contrasts in\nband gap and band edge regions. while Lyapunov exponents, quantifying\nlocalization lengths, exhibit a consistent scaling across both band gap and\nband edge frequencies, and this behavior remains robust even in the presence of\ndisorder. Hence, distinct localization mechanisms emerge at bandgap and\nband-edge frequencies. Bandgap localization arises from optical mode\nconfinement and resonant alignment of atomic transitions with the probe field\nwhile band edge localization stems from a synergy of loss-difference-induced\ntrapping and Anderson like disorder effects. Notably, while disorder weakens\nconfinement localization in the band gap, it actually strengthens localization\nat the band edges.

    "abstract": "As malware detection evolves, attackers adopt sophisticated evasion tactics.\nTraditional file-level fingerprinting, such as cryptographic and fuzzy hashes,\nis often overlooked as a target for evasion. Malware variants exploit minor\nbinary modifications to bypass detection, as seen in Microsoft's discovery of\nGoldMax variations (2020-2021). However, no large-scale empirical studies have\nassessed the limitations of traditional fingerprinting methods on real-world\nmalware samples or explored improvements.\n  This paper fills this gap by addressing three key questions: (a) How\nprevalent are file variants in malware samples? Analyzing 4 million Windows\nPortable Executable (PE) files, 21 million sections, and 48 million resources,\nwe find up to 80% deep structural similarities, including common APIs and\nexecutable sections. (b) What evasion techniques are used? We identify\nresilient fingerprints (clusters of malware variants with high similarity)\nvalidated via VirusTotal. Our analysis reveals non-functional mutations, such\nas altered section numbers, virtual sizes, and section names, as primary\nevasion tactics. We also classify two key section types: malicious sections\n(high entropy >5) and camouflage sections (entropy = 0). (c) How can\nfingerprinting be improved? We propose two novel approaches that enhance\ndetection, improving identification rates from 20% (traditional methods) to\nover 50% using our refined fingerprinting techniques.\n  Our findings highlight the limitations of existing methods and propose new\nstrategies to strengthen malware fingerprinting against evolving threats.",

For example, high-rise buildings with varying geometrical shapes\nand heights contribute to signal attenuation, reflection, diffraction, and\nscattering effects. This creates a high possibility of coverage holes (CHs)\nwithin the proximity of the buildings. Detecting these CHs is critical for\nnetwork operators to ensure quality of service, as customers in these areas may\nexperience weak or no signal reception. To address this challenge, we propose\nan approach using an autonomous vehicle, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV), to detect CHs, for minimizing drive test efforts and reducing human\nlabor. The UAV leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to find CHs using stored\nlocal building maps, its current location, and measured signal strengths. As\nthe UAV moves, it dynamically updates its knowledge of the signal environment\nand its direction to a nearby CH while avoiding collisions with buildings. We\ncreated a wide range of testing scenarios using building maps from\nOpenStreetMap and signal strength data generated by NVIDIA Sionna raytracing\nsimulations. The results show that the RL-based approach outperforms\nnon-machine learning, geometry-based methods in detecting CHs in urban areas.\nAdditionally, even with a limited number of UAV measurements, the method\nachieves performance close to theoretical upper bounds that assume complete\nknowledge of all signal strengths.",

    "abstract": "Peer interaction and social roles have been important factors in students'\nacademic performance. Recent work on what influences academic performance in\nThailand has focused on the quality of a school, students' backgrounds, and\nstudents themselves. A few works have analyzed the correlation between social\nroles and students' academic achievement. Therefore, this study was designed to\nmeasure the social networks of Thai undergraduate students and analyze the\nrelationship between their roles in social networks and academic outcomes. The\ndata analysis was based on social network theory and permutation test. Social\nnetwork theory was used to measure essential network characteristics and\nextract social roles. Four roles were extracted in a social network: central\nmembers, clique members, liaisons, and isolators, and analyzed a relationship\nbetween the roles and academic performance. Data was collected via\nquestionnaires from 384 students and used to build two types of networks:\nfriend networks and study-helper networks. A permutation test was used for\nstatistical hypothesis testing. The results showed that 1) Being a central\nmember positively correlates with academic performance in friend and\nstudy-helper networks. The correlation coefficients between the degree of being\na central member and academic performance are also positive in all schools and\nboth types of networks. 2) Being an isolator negatively correlates with\nacademic performance in study-helper networks. These results indicate that a\nsocial network plays a vital role in academic performance.

Additionally, we propose a\nnovel RGB-Event sign language translation framework (i.e., M$^2$-SLT) that\nincorporates fine-grained micro-sign and coarse-grained macro-sign retrieval,\nachieving state-of-the-art results on the proposed dataset. Both the source\ncode and dataset will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenESL.",

Phys. Chem. Lett. 2022, 13, 10627), we extend the\nmethodology by considering dynamic correlation on top of CASSCF using the\nsecond-order $n$-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2) in the DMET\nframework, abbreviated as DMET+NEVPT2, and benchmark the accuracy of this\napproach to molecular magnetic anisotropy in a set of typical transition metal\ncomplexes. We found that DMET+NEVPT2 can give the results very close to\nall-electron treatment, and can be systematically improved for higher accuracy\nby expanding the region treated as the central cluster, while the computation\ncost is dramatically reduced due to the reduction of the number of orbitals by\nDMET construction. Our findings suggest that DMET is capable of accounting for\nmost of the dynamic correlation that is important for magnetic anisotropy in\ntypical SIMs, and can be useful for further high-accuracy spin-phonon study and\nhigh-throughput computations.",

    "abstract": "Computational pathology and whole-slide image (WSI) analysis are pivotal in\ncancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the ultra-high resolution of WSIs\npresents significant modeling challenges. Recent advancements in pathology\nfoundation models have improved performance, yet most approaches rely on [CLS]\ntoken representation of tile ViT as slide-level inputs (16x16 pixels is\nrefereed as patch and 224x224 pixels as tile). This discards critical spatial\ndetails from patch tokens, limiting downstream WSI analysis tasks. We find that\nleveraging all spatial patch tokens benefits WSI analysis but incurs nearly\n200x higher storage and training costs (e.g., 196 tokens in ViT$_{224}$). To\naddress this, we introduce vector quantized (VQ) distillation on patch feature,\nwhich efficiently compresses spatial patch tokens using discrete indices and a\ndecoder. Our method reduces token dimensionality from 1024 to 16, achieving a\n64x compression rate while preserving reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we\nemploy a multi-scale VQ (MSVQ) strategy, which not only enhances VQ\nreconstruction performance but also serves as a Self-supervised Learning (SSL)\nsupervision for a seamless slide-level pretraining objective. Built upon the\nquantized patch features and supervision targets of tile via MSVQ, we develop a\nprogressive convolutional module and slide-level SSL to extract representations\nwith rich spatial-information for downstream WSI tasks. Extensive evaluations\non multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in WSI analysis. Code will be available soon.",

The physical parameters are\nchosen in the same range used in recent particle-resolved simulations, against\nwhich we compare (PRS, [1, 2]). The results of the point-wise simulations are\nin good agreement with the PRS ones, showing a reduced settling speed for the\nrange of parameters under investigation, relevant to suspensions settling in\naqueous media, at volume fractions up to a few percent for density ratios order\nof one. Results are obtained neglecting the inter-particles and particle-fluid\ninteractions while purposely including/not including the different forces (e.g.\nStokes drag, added mass, lift force) in the particles' equations of motion to\nhighlight their contributions respectively. At a high Galileo number, the mean\nsettling velocity is only slightly affected by turbulent fluctuations, and it\nis the same obtained for the settling velocity of a single particle in a\nquiescent fluid. When the Galileo number is reduced, the settling velocity is\nprogressively affected by turbulent fluctuations that cause a substantial\ndecrease in the particle sedimentation speed.

This combination enables\nSPOT to perform dense point tracking with state-of-the-art accuracy on the CVO\nbenchmark, as well as comparable or superior performance to offline models on\nsparse tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP. Notably, SPOT with\n10$\\times$ smaller parameter numbers operates at least 2$\\times$ faster than\nprevious state-of-the-art models while maintaining the best performance on CVO.\nWe will release the models and codes at: https://dqiaole.github.io/SPOT/.",

    "abstract": "The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is inspired by the structure\nof the human brain, and in turn, ANNs offer a potential means to interpret and\nunderstand brain signals. Existing methods primarily align brain signals with\nreal-world signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which solely focuses on\nlocal point-wise alignment, and ignores global matching, leading to coarse\ninterpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding.\n  In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and\ntheoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy\nthan MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel\nembeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling\nthe amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We\napply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding\nbrain siginals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our\napproach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics,\nsurpassing the previous best method by an average of 6.11\\% in single-subject\ntraining and 3.81\\% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered\nseveral insightful conclusions that align with existing brain research. We\nunveil the redundancy and synergy of brain information processing through\nregion masking and data dimensionality reduction visualization experiments. We\nbelieve our approach paves the way for a more precise understanding of brain\nsignals in the future. The code is available soon.",

In this paper, we propose a boosting\nstrategy, termed SP3D, explicitly utilizing the cross-modal semantic prompts\ngenerated from Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to boost the 3D detector with\nrobust feature discrimination capability under sparse annotation settings.\nSpecifically, we first develop a Confident Points Semantic Transfer (CPST)\nmodule that generates accurate cross-modal semantic prompts through\nboundary-constrained center cluster selection.

We give a polynomial-time deterministic algorithm for approximating the\nvolume of a ($\\Omega(n^2)$ dimensional) Kostka polytope $\\mathrm{GT}(\\lambda,\n\\mu)$ to within a multiplicative factor of $\\exp(O(n\\log n))$, when $\\lambda$\nis an integral partition with $n$ parts, with entries bounded above by a\npolynomial in $n$, and $\\mu$ is an integer vector lying in the interior of the\npermutohedron (i.e., convex hull of all permutations) of $\\lambda$. The\nalgorithm thus gives asymptotically correct estimates of the log-volume of\nKostka polytopes corresponding to such $(\\lambda, \\mu)$. Our approach is based\non a partition function interpretation of a continuous analogue of Schur\npolynomials.",

The Wi-Fi-based depth imaging technique has novel\napplications in domains such as security and elder care. However,\nreconstructing depth images from CSI is challenging because learning the\nmapping function between CSI and depth images, both of which are\nhigh-dimensional data, is particularly difficult. To address the challenge, we\npropose a new approach called Wi-Depth. The main idea behind the design of\nWi-Depth is that a depth image of a moving object can be decomposed into three\ncore components: the shape, depth, and position of the target. Therefore, in\nthe depth-image reconstruction task, Wi-Depth simultaneously estimates the\nthree core pieces of information as auxiliary tasks in our proposed VAE-based\nteacher-student architecture, enabling it to output images with the consistency\nof a correct shape, depth, and position. In addition, the design of Wi-Depth is\nbased on our idea that this decomposition efficiently takes advantage of the\nfact that shape, depth, and position relate to primitive information inferred\nfrom CSI such as angle-of-arrival, time-of-flight, and Doppler frequency shift.",

    "abstract": "Whether the synthetic control method should be implemented with the simplex\nconstraint and how to implement it in a high-dimensional setting have been\nwidely discussed. To address both issues simultaneously, we propose a novel\nBayesian synthetic control method that integrates a soft simplex constraint\nwith spike-and-slab variable selection. Our model is featured by a hierarchical\nprior capturing how well the data aligns with the simplex assumption, which\nenables our method to efficiently adapt to the structure and information\ncontained in the data by utilizing the constraint in a more flexible and\ndata-driven manner. A unique computational challenge posed by our model is that\nconventional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithms for Bayesian variable\nselection are no longer applicable, since the soft simplex constraint results\nin an intractable marginal likelihood. To tackle this challenge, we propose to\nupdate the regression coefficients of two predictors simultaneously from their\nfull conditional posterior distribution, which has an explicit but highly\ncomplicated characterization. This novel Gibbs updating scheme leads to an\nefficient Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler that enables effective posterior\nsampling from our model and accurate estimation of the average treatment\neffect. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method performs well across a\nwide range of settings, in terms of both variable selection and treatment\neffect estimation, even when the true data-generating process does not adhere\nto the simplex constraint.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based tabular data synthesis models have yielded promising results.\nHowever, we observe that when the data dimensionality increases, existing\nmodels tend to degenerate and may perform even worse than simpler,\nnon-diffusion-based models. This is because limited training samples in\nhigh-dimensional space often hinder generative models from capturing the\ndistribution accurately. To address this issue, we propose CtrTab-a condition\ncontrolled diffusion model for tabular data synthesis-to improve the\nperformance of diffusion-based generative models in high-dimensional, low-data\nscenarios. Through CtrTab, we inject samples with added Laplace noise as\ncontrol signals to improve data diversity and show its resemblance to L2\nregularization, which enhances model robustness. Experimental results across\nmultiple datasets show that CtrTab outperforms state-of-the-art models, with\nperformance gap in accuracy over 80% on average.

We demonstrate that the detectability of the extended MIR emission\nusing these coronagraphs is highly dependent on the uncertain nature of the\ncentral FUor and its circumstellar environment in various contexts.

In some cases, the\npresence of a binary companion can significantly hamper detections of the\nextended MIR emission.

Runtime prediction is\nparticularly important for managing increasingly complex distributed systems in\nwhich more sophisticated processing is pushed to the edge in search of better\nlatency. Previous approaches for runtime prediction in edge systems suffer from\npoor data efficiency or require intensive instrumentation; these challenges are\ncompounded in heterogeneous edge computing environments, where historical\nruntime data may be sparsely available and instrumentation is often\nchallenging. Moreover, edge computing environments often feature multi-tenancy\ndue to limited resources at the network edge, potentially leading to\ninterference between workloads and further complicating the runtime prediction\nproblem. Drawing from insights across machine learning and computer systems, we\ndesign a matrix factorization-inspired method that generates accurate\ninterference-aware predictions with tight provably-guaranteed uncertainty\nbounds.

    "abstract": "Visual generative abductive learning studies jointly training symbol-grounded\nneural visual generator and inducing logic rules from data, such that after\nlearning, the visual generation process is guided by the induced logic rules. A\nmajor challenge for this task is to reduce the time cost of logic abduction\nduring learning, an essential step when the logic symbol set is large and the\nlogic rule to induce is complicated. To address this challenge, we propose a\npre-training method for obtaining meta-rule selection policy for the recently\nproposed visual generative learning approach AbdGen [Peng et al., 2023], aiming\nat significantly reducing the candidate meta-rule set and pruning the search\nspace. The selection model is built based on the embedding representation of\nboth symbol grounding of cases and meta-rules, which can be effectively\nintegrated with both neural model and logic reasoning system. The pre-training\nprocess is done on pure symbol data, not involving symbol grounding learning of\nraw visual inputs, making the entire learning process low-cost. An additional\ninteresting observation is that the selection policy can rectify symbol\ngrounding errors unseen during pre-training, which is resulted from the\nmemorization ability of attention mechanism and the relative stability of\nsymbolic patterns. Experimental results show that our method is able to\neffectively address the meta-rule selection problem for visual abduction,\nboosting the efficiency of visual generative abductive learning.

Typically, these models are constructed\nusing centralized, independently and identically distributed (IID) training\ndata. However, in practical scenarios, data is often distributed across\nmultiple clients and frequently manifests non-IID characteristics. Federated\nLearning (FL) can leverage this distributed data to train diffusion models, but\nthe performance of existing FL methods is unsatisfactory in non-IID scenarios.\nTo address this, we propose FedDDPM-Federated Learning with Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Models, which leverages the data generative capability of\ndiffusion models to facilitate model training. In particular, the server uses\nwell-trained local diffusion models uploaded by each client before FL training\nto generate auxiliary data that can approximately represent the global data\ndistribution. Following each round of model aggregation, the server further\noptimizes the global model using the auxiliary dataset to alleviate the impact\nof heterogeneous data on model performance.

A critical challenge lies in enabling\nsystems to dynamically adapt to evolving scenarios, learning new activities\nwithout catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, while adhering to the\nstringent computational constraints of edge devices. Current approaches\nstruggle to reconcile these requirements due to prohibitive storage demands for\nretaining historical data and inefficient parameter utilization. We propose\nWECAR, an end-edge collaborative inference and training framework for\nWiFi-based continuous HAR, which decouples computational workloads to overcome\nthese limitations. In this framework, edge devices handle model training,\nlightweight optimization, and updates, while end devices perform efficient\ninference. WECAR introduces two key innovations, i.e., dynamic continual\nlearning with parameter efficiency and hierarchical distillation for end\ndeployment. For the former, we propose a transformer-based architecture\nenhanced by task-specific dynamic model expansion and stability-aware selective\nretraining. For the latter, we propose a dual-phase distillation mechanism that\nincludes multi-head self-attention relation distillation and prefix relation\ndistillation. We implement WECAR based on heterogeneous hardware using Jetson\nNano as edge devices and the ESP32 as end devices, respectively. Our\nexperiments across three public WiFi datasets reveal that WECAR not only\noutperforms several state-of-the-art methods in performance and parameter\nefficiency, but also achieves a substantial reduction in the model's parameter\ncount post-optimization without sacrificing accuracy.

The first algorithm uses a linear quantum walk,\nand we apply elementary calculus to show that the success probability of the\nalgorithm reaches 1 when the jumping rate of the walk takes some critical\nvalue. We show that the expected value of its Hamiltonian $H_0$ is conserved.\nThe second algorithm uses a nonlinear quantum walk with effective Hamiltonian\n$H(t) = H_0 + \\lambda|\\psi|^2$, which arises in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation\ndescribing Bose-Einstein condensates. When the interactions between the bosons\nare repulsive, $\\lambda > 0$, and there exists a range of fixed jumping rates\nsuch that the success probability reaches 1 with the same asymptotic runtime of\nthe linear algorithm, but with a larger multiplicative constant.

To bridge\nthis gap, this paper proposes a novel image layout editing method that can not\nonly re-arrange a real image to a specified layout, but also can ensure the\nvisual appearance of the objects consistent with their appearance before\nediting. Concretely, the proposed method consists of two key components.\nFirstly, a multi-concept learning scheme is used to learn the concepts of\ndifferent objects from a single image, which is crucial for keeping visual\nconsistency in the layout editing. Secondly, it leverages the semantic\nconsistency within intermediate features of diffusion models to project the\nappearance information of objects to the desired regions directly. Besides, a\nnovel initialization noise design is adopted to facilitate the process of\nre-arranging the layout.

    "abstract": "The turning distance is an efficient metric for measuring the similarity\nbetween two polygons. This metric is constructed by taking an $L^p$ distance\nbetween step functions which track each shape's tangent angle of a path tracing\nits boundary. For $p = 2$, computing the turning distance between two polygons\nwith $n$ and $m$ sides takes $O(mn \\log(m+n))$ time. In this study, we\nintroduce turning disorders for polygonal planar networks, defined by averaging\nturning distances between network faces and \"ordered\" shapes (regular polygons\nor circles). The run time for computing turning distances reduces to $O(m+n)\n\\log(m+n)$ when both shapes are ordered. We also derive closed-form expressions\nof turning distances for special classes of regular polygons, related to the\ndivisibility of $m$ and $n$, and also between regular polygons and circles. We\napply these formulas to several examples of network microstructure with varying\ndisorder. For Archimedean lattices, a class of regular tilings, we can express\nturning disorders with exact expressions. We also consider turning disorders\napplied to two examples of stochastic processes on networks: spring networks\nevolving under T1 moves and polygonal rupture processes. We find that the two\naspects of defining different turning disorders, the choice of ordered shape\nand whether to apply area-weighting, can capture different notions of network\ndisorder.",

    "abstract": "Nondestructive one-shot device (NOSD) testing plays a crucial role in\nengineering, particularly in the reliability assessment of high-stakes systems\nsuch as aerospace components, medical devices, and semiconductor technologies.\nAccurate reliability prognosis of NOSD testing data is essential for ensuring\nproduct durability, safety, and performance optimization. The conventional\nestimation methods like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are sensitive to\ndata contamination, leading to biased results. Consequently, this study\ndevelops robust inferential analysis for NOSD testing data under a progressive\nstress model. The lifetime of NOSD is assumed to follow Log-logistic\ndistribution. The estimation procedure addresses robustness by incorporating\nExponential-polynomial divergence (EPD). Equipped with three tuning parameters,\nEPD based estimation is proven to be more flexible than density power\ndivergence estimation frequently used for one-shot device testing data\nanalysis. Further, we explore the asymptotic behaviour of minimum EPD estimator\n(MEPDE) for large sample size. The robustness of MEPDE is analytically studied\nthrough influence function. Since tradeoff between efficiency and robustness of\nEPD based estimation is governed by three tuning parameters, a novel approach\nleveraging Concrete Score Matching (CSM) is introduced to optimize the tuning\nparameters of MEPDE. Moreover, a comparative study with the existing methods of\nfinding tuning parameters is conducted through extensive simulation experiment\nand data analysis. Another aspect of this study is determining an optimal plan\nto ensure a successful ALT experiment within specified budget and time\nconstraints.

This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing\nSwift Hydra, a new framework for training an anomaly detection method based on\ngenerative AI and reinforcement learning (RL). Through featuring an RL policy\nthat operates on the latent variables of a generative model, the framework\nsynthesizes novel and diverse anomaly samples that are capable of bypassing a\ndetection model. These generated synthetic samples are, in turn, used to\naugment the detection model, further improving its ability to handle\nchallenging anomalies. Swift Hydra also incorporates Mamba models structured as\na Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enable scalable adaptation of the number of Mamba\nexperts based on data complexity, effectively capturing diverse feature\ndistributions without increasing the model's inference time. Empirical\nevaluations on ADBench benchmark demonstrate that Swift Hydra outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art anomaly detection models while maintaining a relatively short\ninference time.

We decompose the GW strains into five\nspatial regions and find that strains are initially largest in the PNS surface\nlayers from accretion and later largest from the Ledoux convective and\nconvective overshoot regions of the PNS. We compute the fractional GW\nluminosity as a function of enclosed radius and observe that most of the\nluminosity moves from the PNS surface to deep within the PNS at later times.\nUsing a self-consistent perturbative analysis, we investigate the evolution of\nthe oscillation modes of the PNS. We find that the frequency of the evolving\nhigh-frequency component of the GW signal is well matched to the eigenfrequency\nevolution of the ${}^2g_2$-, ${}^2g_1$-, and ${}^2f$-modes over time. We show\nthat the ${}^2g$-modes emit most of their power in GW initially from the PNS\nsurface region, but within a few 100 ms after bounce, it is the convective\novershoot region of the PNS that emits the most GW power for the\n${}^2g_1$-mode. Eventually, the ${}^2f$-mode is the dominant mode producing\nGWs, and they are emitted primarily from the convective overshoot region. Thus,\nwe show that, while the GW emission is global, it is possible to source the\ndominant contributions to it. We find that the source of the high-frequency GW\nemission from the PNS in CCSN is more complex than assessed by other methods,\nas well as time dependent, first emitted by ${}^2g$-modes driven by accretion\nonto the PNS and later emitted by the ${}^2f$-mode driven by sustained Ledoux\nconvection.",

However, a\ncritical issue is often overlooked: the heterogeneous modality gap between\nlow-level audio representations and high-level text representations.

The\nmulti-modal fusion module uses dynamic bimodal attention and a dynamic gating\nmechanism to filter incorrect cross-modal relationships and fully exploit both\nintra-modal and inter-modal interactions.

Although these models excel at lip synchronization, they\noften struggle to maintain fine-grained control over facial details in\ngenerated images. In this work, we identify \"lip averaging\" phenomenon where\nthe model fails to preserve subtle facial details when dubbing unseen\nin-the-wild videos. This issue arises because the commonly used UNet backbone\nprimarily integrates audio features into visual representations in the latent\nspace via cross-attention mechanisms and multi-scale fusion, but it struggles\nto retain fine-grained lip details in the generated faces. To address this\nissue, we propose UnAvgLip, which extracts identity embeddings from reference\nvideos to generate highly faithful facial sequences while maintaining accurate\nlip synchronization. Specifically, our method comprises two primary components:\n(1) an Identity Perceiver module that encodes facial embeddings to align with\nconditioned audio features; and (2) an ID-CrossAttn module that injects facial\nembeddings into the generation process, enhancing model's capability of\nidentity retention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, at a modest\ntraining and inference cost, UnAvgLip effectively mitigates the \"averaging\"\nphenomenon in lip inpainting, significantly preserving unique facial\ncharacteristics while maintaining precise lip synchronization.

In this paper, we propose a\ngeneralized decentralized framework that unifies the Control Lyapunov Function\n(CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) to facilitate efficient task execution\nand ensure deadlock-free trajectories for the multi-agent systems. As the\nagents approach the deadlock-related undesirable equilibrium, the framework can\ndetect the equilibrium and drive agents away before that happens. This is\nachieved by a secondary deadlock resolution design with an auxiliary CBF to\nprevent the multi-agent systems from converging to the undesirable equilibrium.\nTo avoid dominating effects due to the deadlock resolution over the original\ntask-related controllers, a deadlock indicator function using CBF-inspired risk\nmeasurement is proposed and encoded in the unified framework for the agents to\nadaptively determine when to activate the deadlock resolution. This allows the\nagents to follow their original control tasks and seamlessly unlock or\ndeactivate deadlock resolution as necessary, effectively improving task\nefficiency.

For example, the state-of-the-art VulRepair\nModel, which is reported to have 44% accuracy, on average yielded 9% accuracy\nwhen test-set duplicates were removed from its training set and 13% accuracy\nwhen training-set duplicates were removed from its test set. In an effort to\ntackle these data quality concerns, we have retrained models from several\npapers without duplicates and conducted an accuracy assessment of labels for\nthe top ten most hazardous Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). Our findings\nindicate that 56% of the samples had incorrect labels and 44% comprised\nincomplete samples--only 31% were both accurate and complete. Finally, we\nemploy transfer learning using a large deduplicated bugfix corpus to show that\nthese models can exhibit better performance if given larger amounts of\nhigh-quality pre-training data, leading us to conclude that while previous\nstudies have over-estimated performance due to poor dataset quality, this does\nnot demonstrate that better performance is not possible.",

While\ndeterministic deep learning models have been commonly employed for SE, recent\nresearch indicates that generative models, such as denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs), have shown promise. However, unlike speech\ngeneration, SE has a strong constraint in generating results in accordance with\nthe underlying ground-truth signal. Additionally, for a wide variety of\napplications, SE systems need to be employed in real-time, and traditional\ndiffusion models (DMs) requiring many iterations of a large model during\ninference are inefficient. To address these issues, we propose ProSE\n(diffusion-based Priors for SE), a novel methodology based on an alternative\nframework for applying diffusion models to SE. Specifically, we first apply\nDDPMs to generate priors in a latent space due to their powerful distribution\nmapping capabilities. The priors are then integrated into a transformer-based\nregression model for SE. The priors guide the regression model in the\nenhancement process. Since the diffusion process is applied to a compact latent\nspace, the diffusion model takes fewer iterations than the traditional DM to\nobtain accurate estimations. Additionally, using a regression model for SE\navoids the distortion issue caused by misaligned details generated by DMs. Our\nexperiments show that ProSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark\ndatasets with fewer computational costs.",

Quantum\nmechanics encodes significantly more information through superposition,\nentanglement, and phase coherence, which are lost due to decoherence, phase\naveraging, and measurement, reducing the system to a classical probability\ndistribution. This transition is quantified using Kolmogorov complexity, where\nclassical systems require \\( O(N) \\) bits of information, while quantum\ndescriptions require \\( O(2^N) \\), showing an exponential reduction in\ncomplexity. Further justification comes from Ehrenfest's theorem, which ensures\nthat quantum expectation values obey Newton's laws, and path integral\nsuppression, which eliminates non-classical trajectories when \\( S \\gg \\hbar\n\\). Thus, rather than viewing quantum mechanics as an extension of classical\nmechanics, we argue that classical mechanics is a lossy, computationally\nreduced encoding of quantum physics, emerging from a systematic loss of quantum\ncorrelations.",

The parent sample was identified by optical variability\nfrom the DES supernova survey program imaging. Using publicly available spectra\nand photometric catalogs, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts,\nestimate their black hole masses using broad line widths and luminosities, and\nobtain improved stellar masses using spectral energy distribution fitting from\nX-ray to mid-infrared wavelengths. Our results confirm previous work from\nHyper-Suprime Camera imaging that variability searches with deep,\nhigh-precision photometry can reliably identify AGNs in low-mass galaxies up to\n$z\\sim1$. However, we find that the hosted black holes are overmassive than\npredicted by the local AGN relation, fixing host galaxy stellar mass. Instead,\n$z\\sim 0.1-1.5$ variability-selected AGNs lie in between the\n$M_{\\rm{BH}}-M_{\\ast}$ relation for local inactive early-type galaxies and\nlocal active galaxies. This result agrees with most previous studies of\n$M_{\\rm{BH}}-M_{\\ast}$ relation for AGNs at similar redshifts, regardless of\nselection technique.

Therefore, in this\nwork, we introduce VORTEX (ViTs with Orderless and Randomized Token Encodings\nfor Texture Recognition), a novel method that enables the effective use of ViTs\nfor texture analysis. VORTEX extracts multi-depth token embeddings from\npre-trained ViT backbones and employs a lightweight module to aggregate\nhierarchical features and perform orderless encoding, obtaining a better image\nrepresentation for texture recognition tasks. This approach allows seamless\nintegration with any ViT with the common transformer architecture. Moreover, no\nfine-tuning of the backbone is performed, since they are used only as frozen\nfeature extractors, and the features are fed to a linear SVM. We evaluate\nVORTEX on nine diverse texture datasets, demonstrating its ability to achieve\nor surpass SOTA performance in a variety of texture analysis scenarios. By\nbridging the gap between texture recognition with CNNs and transformer-based\narchitectures, VORTEX paves the way for adopting emerging transformer\nfoundation models. Furthermore, VORTEX demonstrates robust computational\nefficiency when coupled with ViT backbones compared to CNNs with similar costs.\nThe method implementation and experimental scripts are publicly available in\nour online repository.",
