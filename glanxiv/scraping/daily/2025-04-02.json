    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in large Language models (LLMs) have significantly\nenhanced their reasoning capabilities, driven by various strategies such as\nmulti-agent collaboration. However, unlike the well-established performance\nimprovements achieved through scaling data and model size, the scaling of\nreasoning in LLMs is more complex and can even negatively impact reasoning\nperformance, introducing new challenges in model alignment and robustness. In\nthis survey, we provide a comprehensive examination of scaling in LLM\nreasoning, categorizing it into multiple dimensions and analyzing how and to\nwhat extent different scaling strategies contribute to improving reasoning\ncapabilities. We begin by exploring scaling in input size, which enables LLMs\nto process and utilize more extensive context for improved reasoning. Next, we\nanalyze scaling in reasoning steps that improves multi-step inference and\nlogical consistency. We then examine scaling in reasoning rounds, where\niterative interactions refine reasoning outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss\nscaling in training-enabled reasoning, focusing on optimization through\niterative model improvement. Finally, we review applications of scaling across\ndomains and outline future directions for further advancing LLM reasoning. By\nsynthesizing these diverse perspectives, this survey aims to provide insights\ninto how scaling strategies fundamentally enhance the reasoning capabilities of\nLLMs and further guide the development of next-generation AI systems.",

Meat-Free Day (MFD) is a widely adopted strategy to\naddress this challenge by encouraging plant-based diets through the removal of\nanimal-based meals. We assessed the environmental, behavioral, and nutritional\nimpacts of MFD by implementing 67 MFDs over 18 months (once a week on a\nrandomly chosen day) across 12 cafeterias on a large university campus,\nanalyzing over 400,000 food purchases. MFD reduced on-campus food-related\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on treated days by 52.9% and contributed to\nimproved fiber (+26.9%) and cholesterol (-4.5%) consumption without altering\ncaloric intake. These nutritional benefits were, however, accompanied by a\n27.6% decrease in protein intake and a 34.2% increase in sugar consumption.\nMoreover, the increase in plant-based meals did not carry over to subsequent\ndays, as evidenced by a 3.5% rebound in animal-based meal consumption on days\nimmediately following treated days. MFD also led to a 16.8% drop in on-campus\nmeal sales on treated days.Monte Carlo simulations suggest that if 8.7% of\ndiners were to eat burgers off-campus on treated days, MFD's GHG savings would\nbe fully negated. As our analysis identifies on-campus customer retention as\nthe main challenge to MFD effectiveness, we recommend combining MFD with\ncustomer retention interventions to ensure environmental and nutritional\nbenefits.",

These classifiers must also be robust to packet sequence\ndisorders in candidate flows and capable of detecting unseen flow types that\nare not within the existing classification scope, which are not well achieved\nby existing methods. In this paper, we develop FastFlow, a time-series flow\nclassification method that accurately classifies network flows as one of the\nknown types or the unknown type, which dynamically selects the minimal number\nof packets to balance accuracy and efficiency. Toward the objectives, we first\ndevelop a flow representation process that converts packet streams at both\nper-packet and per-slot granularity for precise packet statistics with\nrobustness to packet sequence disorders. Second, we develop a sequential\ndecision-based classification model that leverages LSTM architecture trained\nwith reinforcement learning. Our model makes dynamic decisions on the minimal\nnumber of time-series data points per flow for the confident classification as\none of the known flow types or an unknown one. We evaluated our method on\npublic datasets and demonstrated its superior performance in early and accurate\nflow classification.

    "abstract": "Language learning refers to the problem of inferring a mathematical model\nwhich accurately represents a formal language. Many language learning\nalgorithms learn by asking certain types of queries about the language being\nmodeled. Language learning is of practical interest in the field of\ncybersecurity, where it is used to model the language accepted by a program's\ninput parser (also known as its input processor). In this setting, a learner\ncan only query a string of its choice by executing the parser on it, which\nlimits the language learning algorithms that can be used. Most practical\nparsers can indicate not only whether the string is valid or not, but also\nwhere the parsing failed. This extra information can be leveraged into\nproducing a type of query we call the prefix query. Notably, no existing\nlanguage learning algorithms make use of prefix queries, though some ask\nmembership queries i.e., they ask whether or not a given string is valid. When\nthese approaches are used to learn the language of a parser, the prefix\ninformation provided by the parser remains unused.\n  In this work, we present PL*, the first known language learning algorithm to\nmake use of the prefix query, and a novel modification of the classical L*\nalgorithm. We show both theoretically and empirically that PL* is able to learn\nmore efficiently than L* due to its ability to exploit the additional\ninformation given by prefix queries over membership queries. Furthermore, we\nshow how PL* can be used to learn the language of a parser, by adapting it to a\nmore practical setting in which prefix queries are the only source of\ninformation available to it; that is, it does not have access to any labelled\nexamples or any other types of queries. We demonstrate empirically that, even\nin this more constrained setting, PL* is still capable of accurately learning a\nrange of languages of practical interest.",

    "abstract": "Current structural pruning methods face two significant limitations: (i) they\noften limit pruning to finer-grained levels like channels, making aggressive\nparameter reduction challenging, and (ii) they focus heavily on parameter and\nFLOP reduction, with existing latency-aware methods frequently relying on\nsimplistic, suboptimal linear models that fail to generalize well to\ntransformers, where multiple interacting dimensions impact latency. In this\npaper, we address both limitations by introducing Multi-Dimensional Pruning\n(MDP), a novel paradigm that jointly optimizes across a variety of pruning\ngranularities-including channels, query, key, heads, embeddings, and blocks.\nMDP employs an advanced latency modeling technique to accurately capture\nlatency variations across all prunable dimensions, achieving an optimal balance\nbetween latency and accuracy. By reformulating pruning as a Mixed-Integer\nNonlinear Program (MINLP), MDP efficiently identifies the optimal pruned\nstructure across all prunable dimensions while respecting latency constraints.\nThis versatile framework supports both CNNs and transformers. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MDP significantly outperforms previous methods,\nespecially at high pruning ratios. On ImageNet, MDP achieves a 28% speed\nincrease with a +1.4 Top-1 accuracy improvement over prior work like HALP for\nResNet50 pruning. Against the latest transformer pruning method, Isomorphic,\nMDP delivers an additional 37% acceleration with a +0.7 Top-1 accuracy\nimprovement.",

    "abstract": "This study examines how political engagement shapes public attitudes toward\nlegal immigration in the United States. Using nationally weighted data from the\n2024 ANES Pilot Study, we construct a novel Political Engagement Index (PAX)\nbased on five civic actions: discussing politics, online sharing, attending\nrallies, wearing political symbols, and campaign volunteering. By applying\nweighted ordered logistic regression models, we find that higher engagement\npredicts greater support for easing legal immigration, even after adjusting for\neducation, gender, age, partisanship, income, urban residence, and generalized\nsocial trust. To capture the substantive effect, we visualize predicted\nprobabilities across levels of engagement. In full-sample models, the\nlikelihood of supporting \"a lot harder\" immigration drops from 26% to 13% as\nengagement rises, while support for \"a lot easier\" increases from 10% to 21%.\nSubgroup analyses by partisanship show consistent directionality, with notable\nshifts among Republicans. Social trust and education are also consistently\nassociated with more open attitudes, while older respondents tend to support\nless lenient pathways to legal immigration policies. These findings suggest\nthat a cumulative increase in political participation is linked to support for\nlegal immigration pathways, with varying intensity across partisan identities\nand socio-demographic characteristics.",

RIS effectively addresses this issue by\ndynamically shaping the wireless environment to enhance signal quality, reduce\npower consumption, and extend UAV operation time, thus enabling sustainable and\nscalable deployment across various LAE applications. This survey provides a\ncomprehensive review of RIS-assisted UAV networks, focusing on energy-efficient\ndesign within LAE applications.

Next, advanced EE-driven strategies\nfor integrating RIS and UAVs. Techniques such as trajectory optimization, power\ncontrol, beamforming, and dynamic resource management are examined. Emphasis is\nplaced on collaborative solutions that incorporate UAV-mounted RIS, wireless\nenergy harvesting (EH), and intelligent scheduling frameworks. We further\ncategorize RIS-enabled schemes based on key performance objectives relevant to\nLAE scenarios. These objectives include sum rate maximization, coverage\nextension, QoS guarantees, secrecy rate improvement, latency reduction, and age\nof information (AoI) minimization. The survey also delves into RIS-UAV synergy\nwith emerging technologies like MEC, NOMA, V2X communication, and WPT. These\ntechnologies are crucial to the LAE ecosystem.

Curiously, different online communities often overlap\nconsiderably in topic and membership. Recent research has investigated\ncompetition and mutualism among overlapping online communities through the lens\nof organizational ecology; however, it has not accounted for how the nonlinear\ndynamics of online attention may lead to episodic competition and mutualism.\nNeither has it explored the origins of competition and mutualism in the\nprocesses by which online communities select or adapt to their niches. This\npaper presents a large-scale study of 8,806 Reddit communities belonging to\n1,919 clusters of high user overlap over a 5-year period. The method uses\nnonlinear time series methods to infer bursty, often short-lived ecological\ndynamics. Results reveal that mutualism episodes are longer lived and slightly\nmore frequent than competition episodes. Next, it tests whether online\ncommunities find their niches by specializing to avoid competition using panel\nregression models. It finds that competitive ecological interactions lead to\ndecreasing topic and user overlaps; however, changes that decrease such niche\noverlaps do not lead to mutualism. The discussion proposes that future designs\nmay enable online community ecosystem management by informing online community\nleaders to organize \"spin-off\" communities or via feeds and recommendations.",

While many previous studies focused on improving the efficiency and\neffectiveness of data discovery, little attention has been paid to the\nusability of such applications. In particular, exploring data discovery results\ncan be cumbersome due to the cognitive load involved in understanding raw\ntabular results and identifying insights to draw conclusions. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a new problem -- visualization recommendation for data\ndiscovery over data lakes -- which aims at automatically identifying\nvisualizations that highlight relevant or desired trends in the results\nreturned by data discovery engines. We propose LakeVisage, an end-to-end\nframework as the first solution to this problem. Given a data lake, a data\ndiscovery engine, and a user-specified query table, LakeVisage intelligently\nexplores the space of visualizations and recommends the most useful and\n``interesting'' visualization plans. To this end, we developed (i) approaches\nto smartly construct the candidate visualization plans from the results of the\ndata discovery engine and (ii) effective pruning strategies to filter out less\ninteresting plans so as to accelerate the visual analysis. Experimental results\non real data lakes show that our proposed techniques can lead to an order of\nmagnitude speedup in visualization recommendation.

Recently, hundreds of millions of single-cell omics data\nhave provided a robust foundation for understanding these signaling networks\nwithin various cell subpopulations and conditions.

First, it introduces a novel graph model that integrates\nhuman-readable annotations -- such as biological functions, cellular locations,\nsignaling pathways, related diseases, and drugs -- with quantitative gene and\nprotein abundance data, enabling graph reasoning to decode cell signaling. This\napproach calls for new joint models combining large language models and graph\nneural networks. Second, the dataset is built from single-cell RNA sequencing\ndata of approximately 120 million cells from diverse tissues and conditions\n(healthy and diseased) and is fully compatible with PyTorch.

The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API\ncalls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By\nconnecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources,\nand prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs.\nHowever, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security\nrisks for end users.

For a given stellar mass range, HSBs consistently\nexhibit a higher bar fraction compared to LSBs, except at M$\\star > 10^{11}$\nM$\\odot$, where the difference vanishes. To explore the origin of this trend\nand its relation to host galaxy properties, we construct several control\nsamples matched in stellar mass, spin, gas mass fraction, and bulge-to-total\nmass ratio. For galaxies with M$\\star<10^{11}$ M$\\odot$, the lower bar fraction\nin LSBs appears to be associated with their higher spin and gas content\n-factors known to inhibit bar formation and growth. At the high mass end, only\nthe bulge-to-total mass ratio is capable of enhancing the bar fraction\ndifference, although its effect is limited. We also study the role of the local\nenvironment through the tidal parameter. Our results suggest that, unlike in\nHSBs, where the bar fraction remains largely unaffected, tidal interactions may\npromote bar formation in LSBs, albeit with a smaller impact than the intrinsic\nphysical properties. These findings provide insight into the physical\nconditions that shape the presence of bars in LSBs.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has the potential to impact safety and efficiency in\nsafety-critical domains such as construction, manufacturing, and healthcare.\nFor example, using sensor data from wearable devices, such as inertial\nmeasurement units (IMUs), human gestures can be detected while maintaining\nprivacy, thereby ensuring that safety protocols are followed. However, strict\nsafety requirements in these domains have limited the adoption of AI, since\naccurate calibration of predicted probabilities and robustness against\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data is necessary.\n  This paper proposes UAC (Uncertainty-Aware Calibration), a novel two-step\nmethod to address these challenges in IMU-based gesture recognition. First, we\npresent an uncertainty-aware gesture network architecture that predicts both\ngesture probabilities and their associated uncertainties from IMU data. This\nuncertainty is then used to calibrate the probabilities of each potential\ngesture. Second, an entropy-weighted expectation of predictions over multiple\nIMU data windows is used to improve accuracy while maintaining correct\ncalibration.\n  Our method is evaluated using three publicly available IMU datasets for\ngesture detection and is compared to three state-of-the-art calibration methods\nfor neural networks: temperature scaling, entropy maximization, and Laplace\napproximation. UAC outperforms existing methods, achieving improved accuracy\nand calibration in both OOD and in-distribution scenarios. Moreover, we find\nthat, unlike our method, none of the state-of-the-art methods significantly\nimprove the calibration of IMU-based gesture recognition models. In conclusion,\nour work highlights the advantages of uncertainty-aware calibration of neural\nnetworks, demonstrating improvements in both calibration and accuracy for\ngesture detection using IMU data.",

Without explicit group annotations, proposed solutions rely on\nheuristics that aim to identify and then amplify the minority samples during\ntraining. In our work, we first uncover a critical shortcoming of these\nmethods: an inability to distinguish legitimate minority samples from poison\nsamples in the training set. By amplifying poison samples as well, group\nrobustness methods inadvertently boost the success rate of an adversary --\ne.g., from $0\\%$ without amplification to over $97\\%$ with it. Notably, we\nsupplement our empirical evidence with an impossibility result proving this\ninability of a standard heuristic under some assumptions. Moreover,\nscrutinizing recent poisoning defenses both in centralized and federated\nlearning, we observe that they rely on similar heuristics to identify which\nsamples should be eliminated as poisons. In consequence, minority samples are\neliminated along with poisons, which damages group robustness -- e.g., from\n$55\\%$ without the removal of the minority samples to $41\\%$ with it. Finally,\nas they pursue opposing goals using similar heuristics, our attempt to\nalleviate the trade-off by combining group robustness methods and poisoning\ndefenses falls short.

    "abstract": "Here, we present several examples of unusual evolutionary patterns in solar\ncoronal loops that resemble cross-field drift motions. These loops were\nsimultaneously observed from two vantage points by two different spacecraft:\nthe High-Resolution Imager (HRI$_{EUV}$) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager\naboard the Solar Orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory. Across all these events, a recurring pattern is\nobserved: Initially, a thin, strand-like structure detaches and shifts several\nmegameters (Mm) away from a main or parent loop. During this period, the parent\nloop remains intact in its original position. After a few minutes, the shifted\nstrand reverses its direction and returns to the location of the parent loop.\nKey features of this `split-drift' type evolution are: (i) the presence of kink\noscillations in the loops before and after the split events, (ii) a sudden\nsplit motion at about 30~km.s$^{-1}$, with additional slow drifts, either away\nfrom or back to the parent loops, at around 5~km.s$^{-1}$. Co-temporal\nphotospheric magnetic field data obtained from the Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager (HMI) reveal that during such split-drift evolution, one of the loop\npoints in the photosphere moves back and forth between nearby magnetic\npolarities. While the exact cause of this `split-drift' phenomenon is still\nunclear, the consistent patterns observed in its characteristics indicate that\nthere may be a broader physical mechanism at play.

To address these issues,\nmany systems rely on random hashing to handle the id space and control the\ncorresponding model parameters (i.e embedding table). However, this approach\nintroduces data pollution from multiple ids sharing the same embedding, leading\nto degraded model performance and embedding representation instability.\n  This paper examines these challenges and introduces Semantic ID prefix ngram,\na novel token parameterization technique that significantly improves the\nperformance of the original Semantic ID.

Extinction curves are essential for\ncharacterizing dust properties, but mid-infrared (MIR) extinction remains less\nconstrained in protostellar environments. Gas-phase line ratios from embedded\nprotostellar jets provide a spatially resolved method for probing extinction\nthrough protostellar envelopes, complementing background starlight approaches.\nAims: We aim to derive MIR extinction curves along sightlines toward a\nprotostellar jet embedded in an envelope and assess whether they differ from\nthose in dense molecular clouds. Methods: We analyze JWST NIRSpec IFU and MIRI\nMRS observations of four positions along the blue-shifted TMC1A jet. We extract\nobserved [Fe II] line intensities and model intrinsic ratios using the Cloudy\nspectral synthesis code across a range of electron densities and temperatures.\nBy comparing observed near-IR (NIR) and MIR line ratios to Cloudy predictions,\nwe infer the relative extinction between NIR and MIR wavelengths. Results:\nElectron densities (ne) derived from NIR [Fe II] lines range from ~5 x 10^4 to\n~5 x 10^3 cm^-3 at scales <~350 AU. MIR extinction values show stronger\nreddening than the empirical dark cloud curve from McClure (2009) at similar ne\nand temperatures (~10^3 to 10^4 K). If MIR emission arises from cooler,\nlower-density gas, extinction curves remain consistent with background\nstarlight measurements. Conclusions: This method enables spatially resolved MIR\nextinction curves in embedded protostellar systems. Results suggest either a\nchange in dust size distribution (e.g., from grain growth) or that MIR emission\noriginates from cooler, less dense regions than NIR emission.

    "abstract": "Parameterized Sequential Decision Making (Para-SDM) framework models a wide\narray of network design applications spanning supply-chain, transportation, and\nsensor networks. These problems entail sequential multi-stage optimization\ncharacterized by states, control actions, and cost functions dependent on\ndesignable parameters. The challenge is to determine both the sequential\ndecision policy and parameters simultaneously to minimize cumulative stagewise\ncosts. Many Para-SDM problems are NP-hard and often necessitate time-varying\npolicies. Existing algorithms tackling finite-horizon time-varying Para-SDM\nproblems struggle with scalability when faced with a large number of states.\nConversely, the sole algorithm addressing infinite-horizon Para-SDM assumes\ntime (stage)-invariance, yielding stationary policies. However, this approach\nproves scalable for time-invariant problems by leveraging deep neural networks\nto learn optimal stage-invariant state-action value functions, enabling\nhandling of large-scale scenarios. This article proposes a novel approach that\nreinterprets finite-horizon, time-varying Para-SDM problems as equivalent\ntime-invariant problems through topography lifting. Our method achieves nearly\nidentical results to the time-varying solution while exhibiting improved\nperformance times in various simulations, notably in the small cell network\nproblem.

    "abstract": "The governance of frontier artificial intelligence (AI) systems--particularly\nthose capable of catastrophic misuse or systemic failure--requires\ninstitutional structures that are robust, adaptive, and innovation-preserving.\nThis paper proposes a novel framework for governing such high-stakes models\nthrough a three-tiered insurance architecture: (1) mandatory private liability\ninsurance for frontier model developers; (2) an industry-administered risk pool\nto absorb recurring, non-catastrophic losses; and (3) federally backed\nreinsurance for tail-risk events. Drawing from historical precedents in nuclear\nenergy (Price-Anderson), terrorism risk (TRIA), agricultural crop insurance,\nflood reinsurance, and medical malpractice, the proposal shows how the federal\ngovernment can stabilize private AI insurance markets without resorting to\nbrittle regulation or predictive licensing regimes. The structure aligns\nincentives between AI developers and downstream stakeholders, transforms safety\npractices into insurable standards, and enables modular oversight through\nadaptive eligibility criteria. By focusing on risk-transfer mechanisms rather\nthan prescriptive rules, this framework seeks to render AI safety a structural\nfeature of the innovation ecosystem itself--integrated into capital markets,\nnot external to them.

Heterogeneous coefficients and low regularity of the\nsolution are reasons not to employ high order discretizations. We present a new\napproach for the simulation of instationary PDEs that allows to partially\nmitigate the performance problems. By reformulating the original problem we\nderive a parallel in time time integrator that increases the arithmetic\nintensity and introduces additional structure into the problem. By this it\nhelps accelerate matrix-based simulations on modern hardware architectures.\nBased on a system for multiple time steps we will formulate a matrix equation\nthat can be solved using vectorised solvers like Block Krylov methods. The\nstructure of this approach makes it applicable for a wide range of linear and\nnonlinear problems. In our numerical experiments we present some first results\nfor three different PDEs, a linear convection-diffusion equation, a nonlinear\ndiffusion-reaction equation and a realistic example based on the Richards'\nequation.",

We\nprovide an exact characterization of the resulting witness sizes in terms of\neffective resistances of related graphs. We also provide less-powerful, but\neasier-to-use upper bounds on these witness sizes. We give generic\ntime-efficient implementations of algorithms generated through the graph\ncomposition framework, in the quantum read-only memory model, which is a weaker\nassumption than the more common quantum random-access model. Along the way, we\nsimplify the span program algorithm, and remove the dependence of its analysis\non the effective spectral gap lemma.\n  We unify the quantum algorithmic frameworks that are based on span programs\nor the quantum adversary bound. In particular, we show how the st-connectivity\nframework subsumes the learning graph framework, the weighted-decision-tree\nframework, and a zero-error version of the latter. We show that the graph\ncomposition framework subsumes part of the quantum divide and conquer\nframework, and that it is itself subsumed by the multidimensional quantum walk\nframework. Moreover, we show that the weighted-decision-tree complexity is\nquadratically related to deterministic query complexity, and to the GT-bound\nwith polynomial exponent 3/2. For the latter, we also provide a matching\nseparation.\n  We apply our techniques to give improved algorithms for various string-search\nproblems, namely the Dyck-language recognition problem of depth 3, the\n3-increasing subsequence problem, and the OR $\\circ$ pSEARCH problem.

We use a recurrence joint\nprobability based analysis that accounts for the lagged nonlinear dependency\nbetween time series, which also allows quantifying the statistical\nsignificance, based on a twin surrogates technique of the recurrence analysis.\nBy means of such nonlinear dependence analysis we find that at interannual\ntimescales AM hydrology influences future states of the TNA SSTs from 0 to 2\nmonths later with a 90% to 95% statistical confidence. It also unveils the\nexistence of two-way feedback mechanisms between the variables involved in the\nprocesses: (i) precipitation over AM leads the atmospheric pressure gradient\nbetween TNA and AM from 0 and 2 month lags, (ii) the pressure gradient leads\nthe trade zonal winds over the TNA from 0 to 3 months and from 7 to 12 months,\n(iii) the zonal winds lead the SSTs from 0 to 3 months, and (iv) the SSTs lead\nprecipitation over AM by 1 month lag. The analyses were made for time series\nspanning from 1979 to 2008, and for extreme precipitation events in the AM\nduring the years 1999, 2005, 2009 and 2010. We also evaluated the monthly mean\nconditions of the relevant variables during the extreme AM droughts of 1963,\n1980, 1983, 1997, 1998, 2005, and 2010, and also during the floods of 1989,\n1999, and 2009.

By\ndependent censoring, it is meant that the duration time ($T$) and right\ncensoring time ($C$) are not statistically independent of each other, even\nafter conditioning on the measured covariates. The endogeneity issue is handled\nby making use of a binary instrumental variable for the treatment. To deal with\nthe dependent censoring problem, it is assumed that on the stratum of\ncompliers: (i) $T$ follows a semiparametric proportional hazards model; (ii)\n$C$ follows a fully parametric model; and (iii) the relation between $T$ and\n$C$ is modeled by a parametric copula, such that the association parameter can\nbe left unspecified. In this framework, the treatment effect of interest is the\ncomplier causal hazard ratio (CCHR). We devise an estimation procedure that is\nbased on a weighted maximum likelihood approach, where the weights are the\nprobabilities of an observation coming from a complier. The weights are\nestimated non-parametrically in a first stage, followed by the estimation of\nthe CCHR. Novel conditions under which the model is identifiable are given, a\ntwo-step estimation procedure is proposed and some important asymptotic\nproperties are established. Simulations are used to assess the validity and\nfinite-sample performance of the estimation procedure. Finally, we apply the\napproach to estimate the CCHR of both job training programs on unemployment\nduration and periodic screening examinations on time until death from breast\ncancer.

The overarching goal was to understand the role of Non-Local\nThermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) and horizontal radiative transfer (RT) effects\nin the formation of these lines. In the present paper, we extend this\ninvestigation using a high resolution MHD simulation, with a grid spacing much\nsmaller than the currently resolvable scales by telescopes. We aim to\nunderstand whether the horizontal RT effects imposes an intrinsic limit on the\nsmall scale structures that can be observed by telescopes, by spatially\nsmearing out these structures in the solar atmosphere. We synthesize the Stokes\nprofiles of two iron line pairs, one at 525 nm and other at 630 nm in 3-D NLTE.\nWe compare our results with those in previous papers and check the impact of\nhorizontal transfer on the quality of the images. Our results with the high\nresolution simulations align with those inferred from lower resolution\nsimulations in the previous papers of this series. The spatial smearing due to\nhorizontal RT, although present, is quite small. The degradation caused by the\npoint spread function of a telescope is much stronger. In the photospheric\nlayers, we do not see an image degradation caused by horizontal RT that is\nlarge enough to smear out the small scale structures in the simulation box.

To investigate this, we conducted a\nstudy where participants either engaged in conversations with an AI chatbot (N\n= 334) or wrote journal entires (N = 193) on the same randomly assigned topics\nand reported their momentary happiness afterward.

Therefore accurate map generation but also re-localization\nagainst these maps is necessary. Due to best 3D reconstruction of the\nsurrounding, LiDAR has become a reliable modality for localization. The latest\nLiDAR odometry estimation are based on iterative closest point (ICP)\napproaches, namely KISS-ICP and SAGE-ICP. We extend the capabilities of\nKISS-ICP by incorporating semantic information into the point alignment process\nusing a generalizable approach with minimal parameter tuning. This enhancement\nallows us to surpass KISS-ICP in terms of absolute trajectory error (ATE), the\nprimary metric for map accuracy. Additionally, we improve the Cartographer\nmapping framework to handle semantic information. Cartographer facilitates loop\nclosure detection over larger areas, mitigating odometry drift and further\nenhancing ATE accuracy. By integrating semantic information into the mapping\nprocess, we enable the filtering of specific classes, such as parked vehicles,\nfrom the resulting map. This filtering improves relocalization quality by\naddressing temporal changes, such as vehicles being moved.",

Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC,\nbut the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations\nfor both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed\nformalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local\ncharge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron\ngas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} =\n2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local\ncharge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent\nagreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local\ncharge conservation.

To investigate its impact, we conducted a\ncrowdsourcing study with 450 participants, each completing one of six\ndecision-making tasks spanning public safety, diet and health management,\nsustainability, and AI ethics. Participants engaged in a multi-prompt\nconversation with ChatGPT to address the task, allowing us to compare pre-chat\nintent-based expectations with observed interactions.

Frequent ChatGPT\nusers reduced deictic terms and hedge words and frequently adjusted prompts.\nUsers with rich search experience maintained structured, less-conversational\nqueries with minimal modifications.

    "abstract": "Tidal interactions between massive galaxies and their satellites are\nfundamental processes in a Universe with L-Cold Dark Matter cosmology,\nredistributing material into faint features that preserve records of past\ngalactic interactions. While stellar streams in the Local Group impressively\ndemonstrate satellite disruption, they do not constitute a statistically\nsignificant sample. Constructing a substantial catalog of stellar streams\nbeyond the Local Group remains challenging due to the difficulties in obtaining\ndeep, wide-field images of galaxies. Despite their potential to illuminate dark\nmatter distribution and galaxy formation processes, stellar streams remain\nunderutilized as cosmological probes. The Stellar Tidal Stream Survey (STSS)\naddresses this observational gap by leveraging amateur telescopes to obtain\ndeep, scientific-grade images of galactic outskirts, capable of building a more\nstatistically meaningful sample of stellar streams. Over the last decade, the\nSTSS has acquired deep (up to surface brightness limit 28.3 mag/arcsec^2 in the\nr-band), wide-field images of 15 nearby Milky Way analog galaxies using a\nnetwork of robotic amateur telescopes, avoiding the issues associated with\n\"mosaicing\" smaller images taken with a professional telescope. Our survey has\nrevealed a diverse range of previously unreported faint features related to\ndwarf satellite accretion - including stellar streams, shells, and\numbrella-like structures. We discover an ultra-diffuse galaxy (NGC150-UDG1),\nwhich shows hints of tidal tails. The STSS demonstrates the suitability of\nmodern amateur telescopes to detect and study faint, diffuse structures in\nlarge fields around nearby spiral galaxies. Their economic and accessibility\nadvantages enable larger samples with deep imaging, essential for testing\ngalaxy formation models and constraining the properties of minor merger events\nin the local Universe.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to ensure the safe development of artificial general intelligence\n(AGI) often rely on consensus-based alignment approaches grounded in axiomatic\nformalism, interpretability, and empirical validation. However, these methods\nmay be structurally unable to recognize or incorporate novel solutions that\nfall outside their accepted epistemic frameworks. This paper introduces a\nfunctional model of epistemic closure, in which cognitive, institutional,\nsocial, and infrastructural filters combine to make many alignment proposals\nillegible to existing evaluation systems. We present a weighted closure model\nsupported by both theoretical and empirical sources, including a meta-analysis\nperformed by an AI system on patterns of rejection and non-engagement with a\nframework for decentralized collective intelligence (DCI). We argue that the\nrecursive failure to assess models like DCI is not just a sociological\noversight but a structural attractor, mirroring the very risks of misalignment\nwe aim to avoid in AGI. Without the adoption of DCI or a similarly recursive\nmodel of epistemic correction, we may be on a predictable path toward\nirreversible misalignment. The development and acceptance of this paper, first\nthrough simulated review and then through formal channels, provide a case study\nsupporting its central claim: that epistemic closure can only be overcome by\nrecursive modeling of the constraints that sustain it.",

Typically, they are\neither localized at a single atomic site or delocalized over multiple sites.\nHowever, after the desodiation of Na$_{2}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, we identify a rare\nsplit-hole polaron, where a single hole is shared between two adjacent oxygen\natoms rather than fully localized or delocalized. We present a density\nfunctional theory (DFT) study on the migration and transport properties of\nthese oxygen hole polarons in NaMn$_{3}$O$_{7}$ and Na$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$.\nOur calculations reveal that the split polaron configuration near a sodium\nvacancy is the ground state, while the localized polaron acts as the transition\nstate. Migration occurs via a stepwise charge transfer mechanism along the\n$b$-axis, where the split-hole polaron transitions through a localized hole\nstate. This transport behavior closely resembles the Grotthuss mechanism, which\ndescribes proton transport in H$_{2}$O. We compute the polaron mobility as\n$\\mu$ = 1.37 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^2$/(V$\\cdot$s) with an energy barrier of\n242 meV. Using the Mulliken-Hush theory, we determine the electronic coupling\nparameter $V_{AB}$ = 0.87 eV. A similar migration mechanism is observed in\nNa$_{1.5}$Mn$_{3}$O$_{7}$, where the split polaron remains more stable than in\nthe localized state. This study provides the first theoretical investigation of\nsplit-hole polaron migration, offering new insights into the charge transport\nof exotic polaronic species in materials with implications for a wide range of\nfunctional materials including battery cathodes, thermoelectrics,\nphotocatalysts, and next-generation optoelectronic devices.",

We evaluated the correctness of\nLLM-generated conversation transcripts, accuracy of survey responses inferred\nby GPT-4o and overall participant experience.\n  Results: Survey responses were successfully extracted by GPT-4o from\nconversation transcripts with an average accuracy of 98% despite transcripts\nexhibiting an average per-line word error rate of 7.7%.

Surprisingly, the TeV gamma-ray signal peaks $\\sim 2$ days after the GeV\nsignal and the origin of this delay has still not been clearly understood. We\ninvestigate the possibility that this delay is due to the effect of gamma-ray\nabsorption resulted from interactions between gamma rays and optical photons\ncopiously emitted during the outburst. We model particle acceleration at a nova\nshock to obtain the gamma-ray emission produced in interactions between the\naccelerated particles and the shocked gas. The effect of gamma-ray absorption\nis then included in details using the radiative transfer equation. We find that\nthis can naturally account for the delay between the peaks of GeV and TeV\ngamma-ray lightcurves. This result emphasizes the importance of gamma-ray\nabsorption for interpreting gamma-ray observations of novae in the TeV range\nwhich, in turn, demonstrates the necessity of a multi-wavelength view for\nunraveling the underlying physics of particle acceleration in these systems.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic voids offer a unique opportunity to explore modified gravity (MG)\nmodels. Their low-density nature and vast extent make them especially sensitive\nto cosmological scenarios of the class $f(R)$, which incorporate screening\nmechanisms in dense, compact regions. Weak lensing (WL) by voids, in\nparticular, provides a direct probe for testing MG scenarios. While traditional\nvoids are identified from 3D galaxy positions, 2D voids detected in WL maps\ntrace underdense regions along the line of sight and are sensitive to unbiased\nmatter distribution. To investigate this, we developed an efficient pipeline\nfor identifying and analyzing tunnel voids, i.e., underdensities detected in WL\nmaps, specifically in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the convergence. In\nthis work, we used this pipeline to generate realistic SNR maps from\ncosmological simulations featuring different $f(R)$ scenarios and massive\nneutrinos, comparing their effects against the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nUsing the convergence maps and the 2D void catalogs, we analyzed various\nstatistics, including the probability density function, angular power spectrum,\nand void size function. We then focused on the tangential shear profile around\n2D voids, demonstrating how the proposed void-finding algorithm maximizes the\nsignal. We showed that MG leads to deeper void shear profiles due to the\nenhanced evolution of cosmic structures, while massive neutrinos have the\nopposite effect. Furthermore, we found that parametric functions typically\napplied to 3D void density profiles are not suitable for deriving the shear\nprofiles of tunnel voids. We, therefore, proposed a new parametric formula that\nprovides an excellent fit to the void shear profiles across different void\nsizes and cosmological models. Finally, we tested the sensitivity of the free\nparameters of this new formula to the cosmological model.",

In\nprevious works of our group, we demonstrated that such a relation does not show\nany redshift evolution in its slope. The derived distances are in agreement\nwith the standard flat $\\Lambda$CDM model up to $z$$\\sim$1.5, but they show\nsignificant deviations at higher redshifts. Yet, several authors suggested that\nthis discrepancy is due to inconsistencies between the low- and high-redshift\nsources within the parent sample, or to a redshift evolution of the relation.\nHere, we discuss these issues through a quantitative comparison with\nsupernova-derived distances in the common redshift range, complemented by\nsimulations showing that all the claimed inconsistencies would naturally arise\nfrom any limitation of the cosmological model adopted for the data analysis,\nthat is, from our ignorance of the true cosmology. We argue that the\nreliability of the method can only be based on a cosmology-independent\nevaluation of the hypothesis of non-evolution of the X-ray to UV relation at\n$z$>1.5, subsequent to a careful check of the sample selection and of the flux\nmeasurements for possible redshift-dependent systematic effects. Since we do\nnot conceive any physical reason for a sudden change of the normalization of\nthe relation at $z$>1.5, and we can exclude any severe systematic effect in the\ndata selection and flux measurements, we conclude that the application of the\nX-ray to UV relation to cosmology is well motivated. To further strengthen this\npoint, we need to achieve a better understanding of the physical process behind\nthe observed relation and/or an independent observational proof possibly\nconfirming the discrepancy with $\\Lambda$CDM found with quasars, such as future\nsupernova measurements at $z$$\\sim$2 or higher.",

Using optimization algorithms and Monte Carlo Markov Chains, PMs are\ncombined to create the final best-fitting model.

    "abstract": "In light-shining-through-walls experiments, axions and axion-like particles\n(ALPs) are searched for by exposing an optically thick barrier to a laser beam.\nIn a magnetic field, photons could convert into ALPs in front of the barrier\nand reconvert behind it, giving rise to a signal that can occur only in the\npresence of such hidden particles. In this work, we utilize the\nlight-shining-through-walls concept and apply it to astrophysical scales.\nNamely, we consider eclipsing binary systems, consisting of a neutron star,\nwhich is a bright source of X-rays, and a companion star with a much larger\nradius. Space observatories such as XMM-Newton and NuSTAR have performed\nextensive measurements of such systems, obtaining data on both out-of-eclipse\nphoton rates and those during eclipses. The latter are typically\n$\\mathscr{O}(10^2-10^3)$ times smaller, due to the fact that X-rays propagating\nalong the line of sight from the neutron star to the X-ray observatory do not\npass through the barrier that is the companion star. Using this attenuation, we\nderive a constraint on ALP-photon coupling of $g_{a\\gamma} \\simeq 10^{-10}\n\\,\\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for the LMC X-4 eclipsing binary system, surpassing current\nbounds from light-shining-through-walls experiments by several orders of\nmagnitude. We also present future prospects that could realistically improve\nthis limit by an order of magnitude in $g_{a\\gamma}$, making it competitive\nwith some of the strongest limits derived to date.",

At finite temperatures, a precise treatment of thermal\nresummations is essential, as bosonic fields encounter significant infrared\nissues that can compromise standard perturbative approaches. The Partial\nDressing (or the tadpole resummation) method provides a self consistent\nresummation of higher order corrections, allowing the computation of thermal\nmasses and the effective potential including the proper Boltzmann suppression\nfactors and without relying on any high-temperature approximation. We\nsystematically compare the Partial dressing resummation scheme results with the\nParwani and Arnold Espinosa (AE) ones to investigate the thermal phase\ntransition dynamics in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). Our findings reveal\nthat different resummation prescriptions can significantly alter the nature of\nthe phase transition within the same region of parameter space, confirming the\ndifferences that have already been noticed between the Parwani and AE schemes.\nNotably, the more refined resummation prescription, the Partial Dressing\nscheme, does not support symmetry non-restoration in 2HDM at high temperatures\nobserved using the AE prescription. Furthermore, we quantify the uncertainties\nin the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from an FOPT due to\nvariations in resummation methods, illustrating their role in shaping\ntheoretical predictions for upcoming GW experiments.

The aim of this\nwork is to provide evidence of the imprints left by LSS on galaxy properties by\nselecting samples of galaxies from different environments, while matching their\nintrinsic characteristics. We investigate the effects of the LSS on the g-r\ncolour and star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies with stellar mass M $>\n10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$, with the redshift $0.05 \\le z \\le 0.1$, and selected from\nthe SDSS DR16. We use a catalogue of the LSS available in the literature to\ndefine samples of galaxies located in field and filament environments. Galaxies\nlocated in the field tend to exhibit bluer g-r stellar colours and higher SFR\nthan those in filaments. These differences persist even in samples of galaxies\nmatched by mass and galaxy local overdensity, indicating that they are not\nproduced by internal processes. These differences cannot be attributed to\nvariations in morphology. There is also a variation in stellar colour and SFR\nwith distance to the filaments (Df). The SFR of galaxies becomes statistically\nsmaller than that of field galaxies for objects located at Df<5 Mpc, while\nchanges in stellar colour occur at smaller distances (Df<1 Mpc). This could\nindicates that the typical filament width is about 2.5-5 Mpc. The variations in\ncolour and SFR between galaxy samples in the field and in filaments, with\nmatched masses and local overdensities, indicate that large-scale environmental\nfactors drive these transformations rather than local or internal galaxy\nproperties. These transformations are not strong enough to produce changes in\ngalaxy morphology. They could be explained by cosmic web starvation.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised panoptic segmentation aims to partition an image into\nsemantically meaningful regions and distinct object instances without training\non manually annotated data. In contrast to prior work on unsupervised panoptic\nscene understanding, we eliminate the need for object-centric training data,\nenabling the unsupervised understanding of complex scenes. To that end, we\npresent the first unsupervised panoptic method that directly trains on\nscene-centric imagery. In particular, we propose an approach to obtain\nhigh-resolution panoptic pseudo labels on complex scene-centric data, combining\nvisual representations, depth, and motion cues. Utilizing both pseudo-label\ntraining and a panoptic self-training strategy yields a novel approach that\naccurately predicts panoptic segmentation of complex scenes without requiring\nany human annotations. Our approach significantly improves panoptic quality,\ne.g., surpassing the recent state of the art in unsupervised panoptic\nsegmentation on Cityscapes by 9.4% points in PQ.",

This introduces\ngreat challenges due to the diverse and nuanced ways users describe targets.\nHowever, existing datasets and models mainly focus on designing grounding\nspecialists for object-level target localization, lacking the necessary data\nresources and unified frameworks for the more practical multi-grained RES. In\nthis paper, we take a step further towards visual granularity unified RES task.\nTo overcome the limitation of data scarcity, we introduce a new\nmulti-granularity referring expression segmentation (MRES) task, alongside the\nRefCOCOm benchmark, which includes part-level annotations for advancing\nfiner-grained visual understanding. In addition, we create MRES-32M, the\nlargest visual grounding dataset, comprising over 32.2M masks and captions\nacross 1M images, specifically designed for part-level vision-language\ngrounding. To tackle the challenges of multi-granularity RES, we propose\nUniRES++, a unified multimodal large language model that integrates\nobject-level and part-level RES tasks.

Due to\nthe increasing volume of data a DBMS deals with, current processor-centric\narchitectures (e.g., CPUs, GPUs) suffer from data movement bottlenecks when\nexecuting key DBMS operations (e.g., selection, aggregation, ordering, and\njoin). This happens mostly due to the limited memory bandwidth between compute\nand memory resources. Data-centric architectures like Processing-in-Memory\n(PIM) are a promising alternative for applications bottlenecked by data,\nplacing compute resources close to where data resides. Previous works have\nevaluated using PIM for data analytics. However, they either do not use\nreal-world architectures or they consider only a subset of the operators used\nin analytical queries. This work aims to fully evaluate a data-centric approach\nto data analytics, by using the real-world UPMEM PIM system. To this end we\nfirst present the PIM Data Analytics Library (PIMDAL), which implements four\nmajor DB operators: selection, aggregation, ordering and join. Second, we use\nhardware performance metrics to understand which properties of a PIM system are\nimportant for a high-performance implementation. Third, we compare PIMDAL to\nreference implementations on high-end CPU and GPU systems. Fourth, we use\nPIMDAL to implement five TPC-H queries to gain insights into analytical\nqueries. We analyze and show how to overcome the three main limitations of the\nUPMEM system when implementing DB operators: (I) low arithmetic performance,\n(II) explicit memory management and (III) limited communication between compute\nunits. Our evaluation shows PIMDAL achieves 3.9x the performance of a high-end\nCPU, on average across the five TPC-H queries.",

A key factor governing brain tissue\ndeformation and the risk of mTBI is the rotational kinematics of the head.\nInstrumented mouthguards are a widely accepted method for measuring rotational\nhead motions, owing to their robust sensor-skull coupling. However, wearing\nmouthguards is not feasible in all situations, especially for long-term data\ncollection. Therefore, alternative wearable devices are needed. In this study,\nwe present an improved design and data processing scheme for an instrumented\nheadband. Our instrumented headband utilizes an array of inertial measurement\nunits (IMUs) and a new data-processing scheme based on continuous wavelet\ntransforms to address sources of error in the IMU measurements. The headband\nperformance was evaluated in the laboratory on an anthropomorphic test device,\nwhich was impacted with a soccer ball to replicate soccer heading. When\ncomparing the measured peak rotational velocities (PRV) and peak rotational\naccelerations (PRA) between the reference sensors and the headband for impacts\nto the front of the head, the correlation coefficients (r) were 0.80 and 0.63,\nand the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values were 0.20 and 0.28,\nrespectively. However, when considering all impact locations, r dropped to 0.42\nand 0.34 and NRMSE increased to 0.5 and 0.41 for PRV and PRA, respectively.\nThis new instrumented headband improves upon previous headband designs in\nreconstructing the rotational head kinematics resulting from frontal soccer\nball impacts, providing a potential alternative to instrumented mouthguards.",

To mitigate this,\nLaViT and ILLUME employ semantic encoders for tokenization, but they struggle\nwith image editing due to poor texture preservation. Meanwhile, Janus series\ndecouples the input and output image representation, limiting their abilities\nto seamlessly handle interleaved image-text understanding and generation.

Additionally, we employ a diffusion model as the image detokenizer\nfor enhanced generation quality and efficient super-resolution.

    "abstract": "Given parameters $c>0, \\delta\\ne0$ and a sequence $(X_n)$ of real-valued,\nintegrable, independent and identically $F$-distributed random variables, we\ncharacterise distributions $F$ such that $(N_n-cM_n)$ is a martingale, where\n$N_n$ denotes the number of observations $X_k$ among $X_1,\\ldots,X_n$ such that\n$X_k>M_{k-1}+\\delta$, called $\\delta$-records, and $M_k=\\max\\{X_1,\\ldots,\nX_k\\}$.\n  The problem is recast as $1-F(x+\\delta)=c\\int_{x}^{\\infty}(1-F)(t)dt$, for\n$x\\in T$, with $F(T)=1$. Unlike standard functional equations, where the\nequality must hold for all $x$ in a fixed set, our problem involves a domain\nthat depends on $F$ itself, introducing complexity but allowing for more\npossibilities of solutions.\n  We find the explicit expressions of all solutions when $\\delta < 0$ and, when\n$\\delta > 0$, for distributions with bounded support. In the unbounded support\ncase, we focus attention on continuous and lattice distributions. In the\ncontinuous setting, with support $\\mathbb{R}_+$, we reduce the problem to a\ndelay differential equation, showing that, besides particular cases of the\nexponential distribution, mixtures of exponential and gamma distributions and\nmany others are solutions as well. The lattice case, with support\n$\\mathbb{Z}_+$ is treated analogously and reduced to the study of a difference\nequation. Analogous results are obtained; in particular, mixtures of geometric\nand negative binomial distributions are found to solve the problem.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Anderson modules form a generalization of Drinfeld modules and are commonly\nunderstood as the counterpart of abelian varieties but with function field\ncoefficients. In an attempt to study their ``motivic theory'', two objects of\nsemilinear algebra are attached to an Anderson module: its motive and its dual\nmotive. While the former is better suited to follow the analogy with\nGrothendieck motives, the latter has proven much useful in the study of\ntranscendence questions in positive characteristic. Despite sharing similar\ndefinitions, the relationship between motives and dual motives has remained\nnebulous. Over perfect fields, it was only proved recently by the second author\nthat the finite generation of the motive is equivalent to the finite generation\nof the dual motive, answering a long-standing open question in function field\narithmetic (the ``abelian equals $A$-finite'' theorem). This work constructs a\nperfect pairing among the motive and the dual motive of an Anderson module,\nwith values in a module of differentials, thus answering a question raised by\nHartl and Juschka. Our construction involves taking the residue of certain\nformal power series in the Frobenius endomorphism. Although it may seem\npeculiar, this pairing is natural and compatible with base change. It also\ncomes with several new consequences in function field arithmetic; for example,\nwe generalize the ``abelian equals A-finite'' theorem to a large class of\nalgebras, including fields, perfect algebras and noetherian regular domains.",

    "abstract": "Early and accurate assessment of brain microstructure using diffusion\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is crucial for identifying neurodevelopmental\ndisorders in neonates, but remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR), motion artifacts, and ongoing myelination. In this study, we propose a\nrotationally equivariant Spherical Convolutional Neural Network (sCNN)\nframework tailored for neonatal dMRI. We predict the Fiber Orientation\nDistribution (FOD) from multi-shell dMRI signals acquired with a reduced set of\ngradient directions (30% of the full protocol), enabling faster and more\ncost-effective acquisitions. We train and evaluate the performance of our sCNN\nusing real data from 43 neonatal dMRI datasets provided by the Developing Human\nConnectome Project (dHCP). Our results demonstrate that the sCNN achieves\nsignificantly lower mean squared error (MSE) and higher angular correlation\ncoefficient (ACC) compared to a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) baseline,\nindicating improved accuracy in FOD estimation. Furthermore, tractography\nresults based on the sCNN-predicted FODs show improved anatomical plausibility,\ncoverage, and coherence compared to those from the MLP. These findings\nhighlight that sCNNs, with their inherent rotational equivariance, offer a\npromising approach for accurate and clinically efficient dMRI analysis, paving\nthe way for improved diagnostic capabilities and characterization of early\nbrain development.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, researchers have made significant advancements in\nsimulating human crowds, yet these efforts largely focus on low-level tasks\nlike collision avoidance and a narrow range of behaviors such as path following\nand flocking. However, creating compelling crowd scenes demands more than just\nfunctional movement-it requires capturing high-level interactions between\nagents, their environment, and each other over time. To address this issue, we\nintroduce Gen-C, a generative model to automate the task of authoring\nhigh-level crowd behaviors. Gen-C bypasses the labor-intensive and challenging\ntask of collecting and annotating real crowd video data by leveraging a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to generate a limited set of crowd scenarios, which are\nsubsequently expanded and generalized through simulations to construct\ntime-expanded graphs that model the actions and interactions of virtual agents.\nOur method employs two Variational Graph Auto-Encoders guided by a condition\nprior network: one dedicated to learning a latent space for graph structures\n(agent interactions) and the other for node features (agent actions and\nnavigation). This setup enables the flexible generation of dynamic crowd\ninteractions. The trained model can be conditioned on natural language,\nempowering users to synthesize novel crowd behaviors from text descriptions. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in two scenarios, a University\nCampus and a Train Station, showcasing its potential for populating diverse\nvirtual environments with agents exhibiting varied and dynamic behaviors that\nreflect complex interactions and high-level decision-making patterns.",

    "abstract": "Using both atomistic and particle-based simulations, we investigate the\ncurrent-driven dynamics of skyrmions on two-dimensional periodic substrates\nwhen there are multiple skyrmions per substrate minimum. At zero drive, the\nsystem forms pinned skyrmion molecular crystal states consisting of dimers,\ntrimers, or dimer-trimer mixtures that have both positional and orientational\norder. On a square substrate lattice, the motion above depinning occurs via a\nrunning soliton that travels completely transverse to the applied current. This\nmotion is generated by a torque from the Magnus force, which rotates the\n$n$-mer states perpendicular to the applied current. At higher drives, the flow\nbecomes disordered while the Hall angle diminishes and gradually approaches the\nintrinsic value. In some cases, we also find directional locking where the Hall\nangle becomes locked to certain symmetry directions of the substrate over a\nrange of currents. The transitions into and out of directionally locked states\nare accompanied by negative differential mobility in which the net velocity\ndecreases as the drive increases. On a triangular substrate, we find no\ntransverse mobility effects, but still observe directionally locked motion.",

    "abstract": "The threat that online fake news and misinformation pose to democracy,\njustice, public confidence, and especially to vulnerable populations, has led\nto a sharp increase in the need for fake news detection and intervention.\nWhether multi-modal or pure text-based, most fake news detection methods depend\non textual analysis of entire articles. However, these fake news detection\nmethods come with certain limitations. For instance, fake news detection\nmethods that rely on full text can be computationally inefficient, demand large\namounts of training data to achieve competitive accuracy, and may lack\nrobustness across different datasets. This is because fake news datasets have\nstrong variations in terms of the level and types of information they provide;\nwhere some can include large paragraphs of text with images and metadata,\nothers can be a few short sentences. Perhaps if one could only use minimal\ninformation to detect fake news, fake news detection methods could become more\nrobust and resilient to the lack of information. We aim to overcome these\nlimitations by detecting fake news using systematically selected, limited\ninformation that is both effective and capable of delivering robust, promising\nperformance. We propose a framework called SLIM Systematically-selected Limited\nInformation) for fake news detection. In SLIM, we quantify the amount of\ninformation by introducing information-theoretic measures. SLIM leverages\nlimited information to achieve performance in fake news detection comparable to\nthat of state-of-the-art obtained using the full text. Furthermore, by\ncombining various types of limited information, SLIM can perform even better\nwhile significantly reducing the quantity of information required for training\ncompared to state-of-the-art language model-based fake news detection\ntechniques.",

This heterogeneity manifests as\ndata heterogeneity concerning local data distribution and latency heterogeneity\nduring model transmission to the server. While prior research has introduced\nvarious efficient client selection methods to alleviate the negative impacts of\neither of these heterogeneities individually, efficient methods to handle\nreal-world settings where both these heterogeneities exist simultaneously do\nnot exist.

While refactoring is often seen as a key tool for addressing\ntechnical debt in source code, there is a significant research gap regarding\nthe specific refactoring changes developers apply to build code and whether\nthese refactorings effectively address technical debt. In this paper, we\naddress this gap by examining refactorings applied to build scripts in\nopen-source projects, covering the widely used build systems of Gradle, Ant,\nand Maven. Additionally, we investigate whether these refactorings are used to\ntackle technical debts in build systems. Our analysis was conducted on\n\\totalCommits examined build-file-related commits.

We examine how the behaviour of these spectral\ndensities evolves as the system approaches the conformal limit with on-shell\ngluons. The perturbative analysis reveals that such sum rules are fundamental\ndynamical features of anomaly-induced interactions. In particular, the\nappearance or absence of associated dilaton poles is closely tied to whether\nthe sum rule is saturated by a pole contribution or by a dispersive continuum.\nIn the conformal, on-shell limit, the particle-pole interaction yields a\nnonlocal S-matrix element entirely supported on the light-cone.",

However, differential\nthermal analysis reveals a relatively high thermal hysteresis of 137{\\deg}C for\nthis composition, indicating that the proposed design criteria are not\nuniversally applicable to all ZrO$_2$-based ceramics. We also explore reducing\ntetragonality of the austenite phase by addition of Er$_2$O$_3$. The idea is to\ntune the lattice parameters of austenite phase towards a cubic structure will\nincrease the number of martensite variants, thus, allowing more flexibility for\nthem to accommodate high strain during transformation. We find the effect of\nEr$_2$O$_3$ on tetragonality is weak due to limited solubility. We conclude\nthat a more effective dopant is needed to achieve significant tetragonality\nreduction. Overall, Gaussian process machine learning models are shown to be\nhighly useful for prediction of compositions and lattice parameters, but the\ndiscovery of low hysteresis ceramic materials apparently involves other factors\nnot relevant to phase transformations in metals.",

    "abstract": "We present a multi-fidelity method for uncertainty quantification of\nparameter estimates in complex systems, leveraging generative models trained to\nsample the target conditional distribution. In the Bayesian inference setting,\ntraditional parameter estimation methods rely on repeated simulations of\npotentially expensive forward models to determine the posterior distribution of\nthe parameter values, which may result in computationally intractable\nworkflows. Furthermore, methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nnecessitate rerunning the entire algorithm for each new data observation,\nfurther increasing the computational burden. Hence, we propose a novel method\nfor efficiently obtaining posterior distributions of parameter estimates for\nhigh-fidelity models given data observations of interest. The method first\nconstructs a low-fidelity, conditional generative model capable of amortized\nBayesian inference and hence rapid posterior density approximation over a\nwide-range of data observations. When higher accuracy is needed for a specific\ndata observation, the method employs adaptive refinement of the density\napproximation. It uses outputs from the low-fidelity generative model to refine\nthe parameter sampling space, ensuring efficient use of the computationally\nexpensive high-fidelity solver. Subsequently, a high-fidelity, unconditional\ngenerative model is trained to achieve greater accuracy in the target posterior\ndistribution. Both low- and high- fidelity generative models enable efficient\nsampling from the target posterior and do not require repeated simulation of\nthe high-fidelity forward model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method on several numerical examples, including cases with multi-modal\ndensities, as well as an application in plasma physics for a runaway electron\nsimulation model.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Rehabilitation Lower Extremity Robotic\nExoskeletons (RLEEX) technology, significant advancements have been made in\nHuman-Robot Interaction (HRI) methods. These include traditional physical HRI\nmethods that are easily recognizable and various bio-electrical signal-based\nHRI methods that can visualize and predict actions. However, most of these HRI\nmethods are contact-based, facing challenges such as operational complexity,\nsensitivity to interference, risks associated with implantable devices, and,\nmost importantly, limitations in comfort. These challenges render the\ninteraction less intuitive and natural, which can negatively impact patient\nmotivation for rehabilitation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nnovel non-contact gesture interaction control method for RLEEX, based on RGB\nmonocular camera depth estimation. This method integrates three key steps:\ndetecting keypoints, recognizing gestures, and assessing distance, thereby\napplying gesture information and augmented reality triggering technology to\ncontrol gait movements of RLEEX. Results indicate that this approach provides a\nfeasible solution to the problems of poor comfort, low reliability, and high\nlatency in HRI for RLEEX platforms. Specifically, it achieves a\ngesture-controlled exoskeleton motion accuracy of 94.11\\% and an average system\nresponse time of 0.615 seconds through non-contact HRI.

Specifically, it is unknown whether\nASMs shorten seizures by simply compressing existing seizure activity into a\nshorter time frame or by selectively suppressing certain seizure activity\npatterns.\n  Methods: We analysed intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of 457 seizures from\n28 people with epilepsy undergoing ASM tapering. Beyond measuring seizure\noccurrence and duration, we categorized distinct seizure activity patterns\n(states) based on spatial and frequency power characteristics and related these\nto different ASM levels.\n  Results: We found that reducing ASM levels led to increased seizure frequency\n(r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and longer seizure duration ($\\beta$ = -0.033, p <\n0.001), consistent with prior research. Further analysis revealed two distinct\nmechanisms in which seizures became prolonged:\n  Emergence of new seizure patterns - In approx. 40% of patients, ASM tapering\nunmasked additional seizure activity states, and seizures containing these\n'taper-emergent states' were substantially longer (r = 0.49, p < 0.001).\n  Prolongation of existing seizure patterns - Even in seizures without\ntaper-emergent states, lower ASM levels still resulted in approx. 12-224%\nlonger durations depending on the ASM dosage and tapering ($\\beta$ = -0.049, p\n< 0.001).\n  Conclusion: ASMs influence seizures through two mechanisms: they (i) suppress\nspecific seizure activity patterns (states) in an all-or-nothing fashion and\n(ii) curtail the duration of other seizure patterns. These findings highlight\nthe complex role of ASMs in seizure modulation and could inform personalized\ndosing strategies for epilepsy management.

    "abstract": "The use of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) tunneling by an attacker to hide malicious\nactivity within encrypted DNS traffic poses a serious threat to network\nsecurity, as it allows malicious actors to bypass traditional monitoring and\nintrusion detection systems while evading detection by conventional traffic\nanalysis techniques. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to detect DoH\ntunnels; however, their effectiveness relies on large datasets containing both\nbenign and malicious traffic. Sharing such datasets across entities is\nchallenging due to privacy concerns. In this work, we propose CO-DEFEND\n(Continuous Decentralized Federated Learning for Secure DoH-Based Threat\nDetection), a Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) framework that enables\nmultiple entities to collaboratively train a classification machine learning\nmodel while preserving data privacy and enhancing resilience against single\npoints of failure. The proposed DFL framework, which is scalable and\nprivacy-preserving, is based on a federation process that allows multiple\nentities to train online their local models using incoming DoH flows in real\ntime as they are processed by the entity. In addition, we adapt four classical\nmachine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression\n(LR), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF), for federated scenarios,\ncomparing their results with more computationally complex alternatives such as\nneural networks.

    "abstract": "Supramolecular block copolymers (SBC) consist of covalent polymer building\nblocks that are connected into well-defined architectures via supramolecular\nbonds. Assisted by the dynamic and reversible supramolecular interactions, it\nis envisaged that SBC self-assemblies may exhibit more diverse morphologies,\nstimuli-responsivity comparing to their covalent analogues. At the fundamental\nlevel, these features are related to the free-energy landscape of\nself-assemblies. It is therefore of central importance to understand the impact\nof dynamic/reversible bonds on the free energy landscape during structure\ntransitions. In this study, we first conduct smart Monte Carlo simulations to\ncompare the kinetics of the disorder-order transition (DOT) of supramolecular\ndiblock copolymers (SDBC) to that of covalent diblock copolymers (CDBC). The\nstructural order parameter for CDBC exhibits a fast and smooth transition\nprocess across different random number seeds and initial configurations. In\ncontrast, the SDBC system shows more diverse transition pathways, which can be\nclassified into three types. These results suggest that reversible\nsupramolecular interactions complicate the pathways, and bring about various\nintermediate structures. Next, we apply the string method to construct the\nminimum free energy path of the transition, from which the transition state and\nthe free energy barrier are evaluated. It is found that the transition free\nenergy barrier strongly correlates with the fraction of supramolecules. By\ndecomposing the free energy into A-B interaction energy and association energy,\nwe found that the interplay of both two effects decide the kinetic pathway and\nthe final equilibrium structures.",

    "abstract": "Context: Using Gaia DR3 data, Jim\\'enez-Arranz et al. (2024a) computed the\nLMC bar pattern speed using three different methods. One of them suggested that\nthe LMC might be hosting a bar that barely rotates, and is slightly\ncounter-rotating with respect to the LMC disc, with a pattern speed of\n$\\Omega_p = -1.0 \\pm 0.5$ km/s/kpc. Aims: To confirm that tidal interactions\ncan trigger the LMC hosting a non-rotating bar due to its interaction with the\nSMC, which could cause the LMC bar to slow down significantly until it\n(momentarily) stops. Methods: We analyse a subset of models (K9 and K21) from\nthe KRATOS suite (Jim\\'enez-Arranz et al. 2024b) where we detected non-rotating\nbars. We make use of two different methods to track the evolution of the bar\npattern speed: the program patternSpeed.py (Dehnen et al. 2023), and temporal\nfinite-differences of the change rate the bar major axis' phase angle. Results:\nIn the second LMC-SMC-like pericenter passage of K9, the bar of the LMC-like\ngalaxy weakens to almost disappear and regenerates with a pattern speed that\nsuffers a slowdown from $\\Omega_p \\sim 20$ km/s/kpc to $\\Omega_p \\sim 0$\nkm/s/kpc in less than 75 Myr. Then, the bar rotates at less than $\\Omega_p \\sim\n3-5$ km/s/kpc for around 100 Myr, until it recovers the initial (before\ninteraction) pattern speed of $\\Omega_p \\sim 10$ km/s/kpc. The results for the\nK21 simulation are comparable. Conclusions: This work is the first direct\nevidence that galactic bars can be slowed down or even stopped by tidal\ninteraction, which strengthens the possibility of the LMC hosting a\nnon-rotating bar, and can add an alternative formation scenario for observed\nslow-rotating bars.",

Intrinsic bugs can be backtracked to specific changes in the\nversion control system (VCS), while extrinsic bugs originate from external\nchanges to the VCS and lack a direct bug-inducing change. Using only intrinsic\nbugs to train bug prediction models has been reported as beneficial to improve\nthe performance of such models. However, there is currently no automated\napproach to identify intrinsic bugs. To bridge this gap, our study employs\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify\nintrinsic bugs. Specifically, we utilize two embedding techniques, seBERT and\nTF-IDF, applied to the title and description text of bug reports. The resulting\nembeddings are fed into well-established machine learning algorithms such as\nSupport Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and\nK-Nearest Neighbors. The primary objective of this paper is to assess the\nperformance of various NLP and machine learning techniques in identifying\nintrinsic bugs using the textual information extracted from bug reports. The\nresults demonstrate that both seBERT and TF-IDF can be effectively utilized for\nintrinsic bug identification. The highest performance scores were achieved by\ncombining TF-IDF with the Decision Tree algorithm and utilizing the bug titles\n(yielding an F1 score of 78%). This was closely followed by seBERT, Support\nVector Machine, and bug titles (with an F1 score of 77%).

    "abstract": "The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands\non traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in\nefficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on software\ntesting by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two\ninterconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with\nlimited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming,\nwhich supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of\nsoftware testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system\nthat synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug\ndetection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5%\nhigher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of\nAI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.",

    "abstract": "Offline evaluation of recommender systems has traditionally treated the\nproblem as a machine learning problem. In the classic case of recommending\nmovies, where the user has provided explicit ratings of which movies they like\nand don't like, each user's ratings are split into test and train sets, and the\nevaluation task becomes to predict the held out test data using the training\ndata. This machine learning style of evaluation makes the objective to\nrecommend the movies that a user has watched and rated highly, which is not the\nsame task as helping the user find movies that they would enjoy if they watched\nthem. This mismatch in objective between evaluation and task is a compromise to\navoid the cost of asking a user to evaluate recommendations by watching each\nmovie. We offer an extension to the MovieLens-32M dataset that provides for new\nevaluation objectives. Our primary objective is to predict the movies that a\nuser would be interested in watching, i.e. predict their watchlist. To\nconstruct this extension, we recruited MovieLens users, collected their\nprofiles, made recommendations with a diverse set of algorithms, pooled the\nrecommendations, and had the users assess the pools. This paper demonstrates\nthe feasibility of using pooling to construct a test collection for recommender\nsystems. Notably, we found that the traditional machine learning style of\nevaluation ranks the Popular algorithm, which recommends movies based on total\nnumber of ratings in the system, in the middle of the twenty-two recommendation\nruns we used to build the pools. In contrast, when we rank the runs by users'\ninterest in watching movies, we find that recommending popular movies as a\nrecommendation algorithm becomes one of the worst performing runs. It appears\nthat by asking users to assess their personal recommendations, we can alleviate\nthe issue of popularity bias in the evaluation of top-n recommendation.",

To overcome these constraints, we propose the\nCross-Lingual Consistency (CLC) framework, an innovative inference paradigm\nthat integrates multilingual reasoning paths through majority voting to elevate\nLLMs' reasoning capabilities.

    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil,\na Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \\pm 0.0035$ with the photometric\nproperties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS\nand PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies\nin JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W\n$-$ F1500W = $2.84\\pm0.04$ mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS\nprogram offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an\naverage star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar\nmetallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization\nparameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of\nVirgil from UV and H$\\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either\nentering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics\nemployed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN),\nthis classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered.\nNonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed\nAGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15 $\\mu$m reinforce the\nAGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution\n(SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those\nof Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon,\nparticularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a\nmulti-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at\n$z\\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and\nearly black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.",

Typically,\ntarget trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles\nexhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in\nthermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised\nMachine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of\ntargets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts\nthe distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and\nparameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using\na time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed\nvirtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only\ntraining data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in\nreplacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path\nplanning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for\naerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic\npredictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms\nfor autonomous vehicles.",

This makes it crucial to\nalign these tools with human values to prevent malicious misuse. In this paper,\nwe propose a comprehensive framework for assessing the potential harmfulness of\nLLMs within the software engineering domain. We begin by developing a taxonomy\nof potentially harmful software engineering scenarios and subsequently, create\na dataset of prompts based on this taxonomy. To systematically assess the\nresponses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the\noutputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well\nas general-purpose and code-specific LLMs. Furthermore, we investigate the\nimpact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their\ntendency to generate harmful content. The results show significant disparities\nin the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness. We find that some models and\nmodel families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that\ncode-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose\ncounterparts. Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than\ntheir base-models due to their design choices. On the other side, we find that\nlarger models tend to be more helpful and are less likely to respond with\nharmful information.

We propose stochastic and deterministic\nmathematical models to investigate the impact of filament nucleation and\nlength-regulation mechanisms on emergent properties such as MT lengths and\nnumbers in living cells. We expand our stochastic continuous-time Markov chain\nmodel of filament dynamics to incorporate MT nucleation and capture realistic\nstochastic fluctuations in MT numbers and tubulin availability. We also propose\na simplified partial differential equation (PDE) model, which allows for\ntractable analytical investigation into steady-state MT distributions under\ndifferent nucleation and length-regulating mechanisms. We find that the\nstochastic and PDE modeling approaches show good agreement in predicted MT\nlength distributions, and that both MT nucleation and the catastrophe rate of\nlarge-length MTs regulate MT length distributions. In both frameworks, multiple\nmechanistic combinations achieve the same average MT length. The models\nproposed can predict parameter regimes where the system is scarce in tubulin,\nthe building block of MTs, and suggest that low filament nucleation regimes are\ncharacterized by high variation in MT lengths, while high nucleation regimes\ndrive high variation in MT numbers. These mathematical frameworks have the\npotential to improve our understanding of MT regulation in both healthy and\ninjured neurons.",

The\nsize distribution of the particles follows a power law, with its index\ndecreasing toward perihelion, along with a reduction in the minimum particle\nradius, leading to both brightness and dust mass being dominated by small\nparticles at perihelion. The particle speeds exhibit a dependence on\nheliocentric distance ($r_h$) that closely follows the classical $r_h^{-0.5}$\nlaw near perihelion but deviates at larger heliocentric distances. We\ndemonstrate that the dependence of particle speeds on the cosine of the solar\nzenith angle at the emission point plays a significant role in shaping the\nsynthetic dust tails and in the formation of a dark stripe along the tail axis\nobserved in high spatial resolution images near the comet's perihelion.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework by formulating heterogeneous FL as a hierarchical\noptimization problem. This new framework captures both local and global\ntraining processes through a bilevel formulation and is capable of the\nfollowing: (i) addressing client heterogeneity through a personalized learning\nframework; (ii) capturing the pre-training process on the server side; (iii)\nupdating the global model through nonstandard aggregation; (iv) allowing for\nnonidentical local steps; and (v) capturing clients' local constraints. We\ndesign and analyze an implicit zeroth-order FL method (ZO-HFL), equipped with\nnonasymptotic convergence guarantees for both the server-agent and the\nindividual client-agents, and asymptotic guarantees for both the server-agent\nand client-agents in an almost sure sense. Notably, our method does not rely on\nstandard assumptions in heterogeneous FL, such as the bounded gradient\ndissimilarity condition. We implement our method on image classification tasks\nand compare with other methods under different heterogeneous settings.",

As an asteroid flyby observation instrument, a\ntelescope mechanically capable of single-axis rotation, named TCAP, is mounted\non the spacecraft to track and observe the target asteroids during flyby. As in\npast flyby missions utilizing rotating telescopes, TCAP is also used as a\nnavigation camera for autonomous optical navigation during the closest-approach\nphase. To mitigate the degradation of the navigation accuracy, past missions\nperformed calibration of the navigation camera's alignment before starting\noptical navigation. However, such calibration requires significant operational\ntime to complete and imposes constraints on the operation sequence. From the\nabove background, the DESTINY+ team has studied the possibility of reducing\noperational costs by allowing TCAP alignment errors to remain. This paper\ndescribes an autonomous optical navigation algorithm robust to the misalignment\nof rotating telescopes, proposed in this context. In the proposed method, the\nmisalignment of the telescope is estimated simultaneously with the spacecraft's\norbit relative to the flyby target. To deal with the nonlinearity between the\nmisalignment and the observation value, the proposed method utilizes the\nunscented Kalman filter, instead of the extended Kalman filter widely used in\npast studies. The proposed method was evaluated with numerical simulations on a\nPC and with hardware-in-the-loop simulation, taking the Phaethon flyby in the\nDESTINY+ mission as an example. The validation results suggest that the\nproposed method can mitigate the misalignment-induced degradation of the\noptical navigation accuracy with reasonable computational costs suited for\nonboard computers.",

The tight sequence\nof cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is\nessential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations\nand the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective\nenvelope.

In this work we explore the\nimpact of microphysics on the bulk evolution of discs. The polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) abundance, and the extent to which grain growth has occurred\nin the disc have profound effects on the strength of mass loss rates due to\nexternal photoevaporation, which in turn can have a significant impact on the\ndisc evolution, impacting disc radii and accretion rates over time. The\nstrongest sensitivity is to whether grain growth has occurred in the disc,\nwhich reduces the amount of dust entrained in the wind to shield the disc, thus\nincreasing the rate at which gas is lost. Additionally, larger PAH abundances\nresult in stronger heating and higher mass loss rates, but to a lesser extent\nthan grain growth. We find that plausible variations in the PAH abundance and\ndisc dust evolution can leave observable differences in disc populations.

    "abstract": "There are numerous methods to characterize topology and its boundary zero\nmodes, yet their statistical mechanical properties have not received as much\nattention as other approaches. Here, we investigate the Fisher zeros and\nthermofield dynamics of topological models, revealing that boundary zero modes\ncan be described by an overlooked real-time Fisher zero pairing effect. This\neffect is validated in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain\nmodel, with the latter exhibiting a Fisher zero braiding picture. Topological\nzero modes exhibit robustness even when non-Hermiticity is introduced into the\nsystem and display characteristics of imaginary-time crystals when the energy\neigenvalues are complex. We further examine the real-time Fisher zeros of the\none-dimensional transverse field Ising model, which maps to the Kitaev chain.\nWe present a fractal picture of the Fisher zeros, illustrating how interactions\neliminate topology. The mechanism of zero-pairing provides a natural\nstatistical mechanical approach to understanding the connection between\ntopology and many-body physics.",

    "abstract": "Cross-chain technology enables seamless asset transfer and message-passing\nwithin decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems, facilitating multi-chain\ncoexistence in the current blockchain environment. However, this development\nalso raises security concerns, as malicious actors exploit cross-chain asset\nflows to conceal the provenance and destination of assets, thereby facilitating\nillegal activities such as money laundering. Consequently, the need for\ncross-chain transaction traceability has become increasingly urgent. Prior\nresearch on transaction traceability has predominantly focused on single-chain\nand centralized finance (CeFi) cross-chain scenarios, overlooking DeFispecific\nconsiderations. This paper proposes ABCTRACER, an automated, bi-directional\ncross-chain transaction tracing tool, specifically designed for DeFi\necosystems. By harnessing transaction event log mining and named entity\nrecognition techniques, ABCTRACER automatically extracts explicit cross-chain\ncues. These cues are then combined with information retrieval techniques to\nencode implicit cues. ABCTRACER facilitates the autonomous learning of latent\nassociated information and achieves bidirectional, generalized cross-chain\ntransaction tracing. Our experiments on 12 mainstream cross-chain bridges\ndemonstrate that ABCTRACER attains 91.75% bi-directional traceability (F1\nmetrics) with self-adaptive capability. Furthermore, we apply ABCTRACER to\nreal-world cross-chain attack transactions and money laundering traceability,\nthereby bolstering the traceability and blockchain ecological security of DeFi\nbridging applications.",

By tuning\nthe illumination over four orders of magnitude, we get the additional\ninformation to simultaneously extract hole mobility, electron mobility, and\nbackground doping. For the first time, we show that a MAPI single crystal,\nexhibiting n-type behaviour in the dark, can show p-type behaviour under light\ndue to the difference in hole and electron mobility. The data partly explains\nthe variability in mobility reported in the literature. We show that one can\nerroneously extract any mobility from 0 to 25 cm2/Vs if we restrict the\nexperiment to a small range of illumination intensities.

    "abstract": "Radar-based vital sign monitoring (VSM) systems have become valuable for\nnon-contact health monitoring by detecting physiological activities, such as\nrespiration and heartbeat, remotely. However, the conventional phased array\nused in VSM is vulnerable to privacy breaches, as an eavesdropper can extract\nsensitive vital sign information by analyzing the reflected radar signals. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach to protect privacy in radar-based VSM\nby modifying the radar transmitter hardware, specifically by strategically\nselecting the transmit antennas from the available antennas in the transmit\narray. By dynamically selecting which antennas connect or disconnect to the\nradio frequency chain, the transmitter introduces additional phase noise to the\nradar echoes, generating false frequencies in the power spectrum of the\nextracted phases at the eavesdropper's receiver. The antenna activation pattern\nis designed to maximize the variance of the phases introduced by antenna\nselection, which effectively makes the false frequencies dominate the spectrum,\nobscuring the actual vital sign frequencies. Meanwhile, the authorized\nreceiver, having knowledge of the antenna selection pattern, can compensate for\nthe phase noise and accurately extract the vital signs. Numerical experiments\nare conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in\nenhancing privacy while maintaining vital sign monitoring.",

Current research on bias primarily\naddresses explicit biases with recognizable visual patterns, such as skin color\nand gender. This paper introduces a novel form of implicit bias that lacks\nexplicit visual features but can manifest in diverse ways across various\nsemantic contexts. This subtle and versatile nature makes this bias challenging\nto detect, easy to propagate, and adaptable to a wide range of scenarios. We\nfurther propose an implicit bias injection attack framework (IBI-Attacks)\nagainst T2I diffusion models by precomputing a general bias direction in the\nprompt embedding space and adaptively adjusting it based on different inputs.\nOur attack module can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion\nmodels in a plug-and-play manner without direct manipulation of user input or\nmodel retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our\nscheme in introducing bias through subtle and diverse modifications while\npreserving the original semantics.

In conventional QCCD architectures, each trap electrode is\ncontrolled via a dedicated digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The conventional\napproach places an overwhelming demand on electronic resources and wiring\ncomplexity. This is because the number of trap electrodes typically exceeds the\nnumber of trapped-ion qubits. This study proposes a method that leverages a\nhigh-speed DAC to generate time-division multiplexed signals to control a\nlarge-scale QCCD trapped-ion quantum processor. The proposed method replaces\nconventional DACs with a single high-speed DAC that generates the complete\nvoltage waveforms required to control the trap electrodes, thereby\nsignificantly reducing the wiring complexity and overall resource requirements.\nBased on realistic parameters and commercially available electronics, our\nanalysis demonstrates that a QCCD trapped-ion quantum computer with 10,000 trap\nelectrodes can be controlled using only 13 field-programmable gate arrays and\n104 high-speed DACs. This is in stark contrast to the 10,000 dedicated DACs\nrequired by conventional control methods.

This limitation stems\nprimarily from 1) the absence of high-quality datasets for this task, and 2)\nthe lack of effective training strategies to develop spatial reasoning\ncapabilities. Motivated by the success of Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Reward (RLVR) in unlocking LLM reasoning abilities, this work aims\nto improve MLLMs in video spatial reasoning through the RLVR paradigm. To this\nend, we introduce the $\\textbf{SpaceR}$ framework. First, we present\n$\\textbf{SpaceR-151k}$, a dataset with 91k questions spanning diverse spatial\nreasoning scenarios with verifiable answers, and 60k samples for maintaining\ngeneral multimodal understanding. Second, we propose $\\textbf{Spatially-Guided\nRLVR (SG-RLVR)}$, a novel reinforcement learning approach that extends Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a novel map imagination mechanism,\nwhich encourages the model to infer spatial layouts in the thinking process,\nthereby facilitating more effective spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SpaceR achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial\nreasoning benchmarks (e.g., VSI-Bench, STI-Bench, and SPAR-Bench), while\nmaintaining competitive results on video understanding benchmarks (e.g.,\nVideo-MME, TempCompass, and LongVideoBench).

    "abstract": "Microswimming cells and robots exhibit diverse behaviours due to both their\nswimming and their environment. One of the core environmental features\nimpacting inertialess swimming is background flows. While the influence of\nselect flows, particularly shear flows, have been extensively investigated,\nthese are special cases. Here, we examine inertialess swimmers in more general\nflows, specifically general linear planar flows that may also possess rapid\noscillations. Relatively weak symmetry constraints are imposed on the swimmer\nto ensure planarity and to reduce complexity. A further constraint reflecting\ncommon observation is imposed, namely that the swimmer is inefficient, which we\nsuitably define. This introduces two separate timescales: a fast timescale\nassociated with swimmer actuation, and a second timescale associated with net\nswimmer movement, with inefficiency dictating that this latter timescale is\nmuch slower, allowing for a multiple timescale simplification of the governing\nequations. With the exception of mathematically precise edge cases, we find\nthat the behaviour of the swimmer is dictated by two parameter groupings, both\nof which measure balances between the angular velocity and rate of strain of\nthe background flow. While the measures of flow angular velocity and strain\nrates that primarily govern the rotational dynamics are modulated by swimmer\nproperties, the primary features of the translational motion are determined\nsolely by a ratio of flow angular velocity to strain rate. Hence, a simple\nclassification of the swimmer dynamics emerges. For example, this illustrates\nthe limited extent to which, and how, microswimmers may control their\norientations and trajectories in flows.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in industrial artificial intelligence (AI) are reshaping\nthe industry by driving smarter manufacturing, predictive maintenance, and\nintelligent decision-making. However, existing approaches often focus primarily\non algorithms and models while overlooking the importance of systematically\nintegrating domain knowledge, data, and models to develop more comprehensive\nand effective AI solutions. Therefore, the effective development and deployment\nof industrial AI require a more comprehensive and systematic approach. To\naddress this gap, this paper reviews previous research, rethinks the role of\nindustrial AI, and proposes a unified industrial AI foundation framework\ncomprising three core modules: the knowledge module, data module, and model\nmodule. These modules help to extend and enhance the industrial AI methodology\nplatform, supporting various industrial applications. In addition, a case study\non rotating machinery diagnosis is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed framework, and several future directions are highlighted for\nthe development of the industrial AI foundation framework.",

These recordings encode recognizable properties of latent states and\ntransitions from physical phenomena that can be modelled as abstract processes.\nThe unsupervised localization and identification of these states and their\ntransitions is the task of time series state detection (TSSD). Current TSSD\nalgorithms employ classical unsupervised learning techniques, to infer state\nmembership directly from feature space. This limits their predictive power,\ncompared to supervised learning methods, which can exploit additional label\ninformation. We introduce CLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm\nfor TSSD. It leverages the predictive power of time series classification for\nTSSD in an unsupervised setting by applying novel self-supervision techniques\nto detect whether data segments emerge from the same state. To this end, CLaP\ncross-validates a classifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify\nconfusion between segments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion,\nrepresenting the same latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall\nclassification quality. We conducted an experimental evaluation using 405 TS\nfrom five benchmarks and found CLaP to be significantly more precise in\ndetecting states than six state-of-the-art competitors.

However, most of these results rely on the assumption that\nthe principal has an unlimited budget for incentivizing agents, an assumption\nthat is often unrealistic in practice. This motivates the study of the optimal\ncontract problem under budget constraints.\n  In this work, we study multi-agent contracts with binary actions under budget\nconstraints. Our contribution is threefold. First, we show that all previously\nknown approximation guarantees on the principal's utility extend\n(asymptotically) to budgeted settings. Second, through the lens of budget\nconstraints, we uncover insightful connections between the standard objective\nof maximizing the principal's utility and other relevant objectives.\nSpecifically, we identify a broad class of objectives, which we term BEST\n(BEyond STandard) objectives, including reward, social welfare, and principal's\nutility, and show that they are all equivalent (up to a constant factor),\nleading to approximation guarantees for all BEST objectives. Third, we\nintroduce the price of frugality, which quantifies the loss due to budget\nconstraints, and establish near-tight bounds on this measure, providing deeper\ninsights into the tradeoffs between budgets and incentives.",

In this work, I\nhave used the newer publicly available observations from TESS and CHEOPS for\nfive very interesting long-period transiting exoplanets, i.e., HD95338 b,\nTOI-2134 c, K2-290 c, TOI-1898 b, and TOI-813 b, combined with the previously\nreported observations, to reanalyze their transit properties and estimate the\nupdated ephemeris. The analyses also incorporated a critical noise treatment\nalgorithm, which uses well-tested techniques such as wavelet denoising and\nGaussian process regression, to effectively reduce the impact of various noise\ncomponents present in the lightcurves on the estimated parameters. The study\nhas resulted in a more precise estimation of ephemeris for all the targets,\nwith the precision in the estimated periods being better than 5 seconds, except\nfor TOI-813 b, for which the precision in the estimated period is better than\n21 seconds.

    "abstract": "The increasing global prevalence of mental disorders, such as depression and\nPTSD, requires objective and scalable diagnostic tools. Traditional clinical\nassessments often face limitations in accessibility, objectivity, and\nconsistency. This paper investigates the potential of multimodal machine\nlearning to address these challenges, leveraging the complementary information\navailable in text, audio, and video data. Our approach involves a comprehensive\nanalysis of various data preprocessing techniques, including novel chunking and\nutterance-based formatting strategies. We systematically evaluate a range of\nstate-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature\nextraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion\ntechniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM)\npredictions. We also investigate the impact of replacing Multilayer Perceptron\nclassifiers with Support Vector Machines. We extend our analysis to severity\nprediction using PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores and multi-class classification\n(considering co-occurring conditions). Our results demonstrate that\nutterance-based chunking significantly improves performance, particularly for\ntext and audio modalities. Decision-level fusion, incorporating LLM\npredictions, achieves the highest accuracy, with a balanced accuracy of 94.8%\nfor depression and 96.2% for PTSD detection. The combination of CNN-BiLSTM\narchitectures with utterance-level chunking, coupled with the integration of\nexternal LLM, provides a powerful and nuanced approach to the detection and\nassessment of mental health conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of\nMMML for developing more accurate, accessible, and personalized mental\nhealthcare tools.",

    "abstract": "Compounding error, where small prediction mistakes accumulate over time,\npresents a major challenge in learning-based control. For example, this issue\noften limits the performance of model-based reinforcement learning and\nimitation learning. One common approach to mitigate compounding error is to\ntrain multi-step predictors directly, rather than relying on autoregressive\nrollout of a single-step model. However, it is not well understood when the\nbenefits of multi-step prediction outweigh the added complexity of learning a\nmore complicated model. In this work, we provide a rigorous analysis of this\ntrade-off in the context of linear dynamical systems. We show that when the\nmodel class is well-specified and accurately captures the system dynamics,\nsingle-step models achieve lower asymptotic prediction error. On the other\nhand, when the model class is misspecified due to partial observability, direct\nmulti-step predictors can significantly reduce bias and thus outperform\nsingle-step approaches. These theoretical results are supported by numerical\nexperiments, wherein we also (a) empirically evaluate an intermediate strategy\nwhich trains a single-step model using a multi-step loss and (b) evaluate\nperformance of single step and multi-step predictors in a closed loop control\nsetting.",

To address these limitations, our work\nintroduces a groundbreaking motion pre-training method based on contextualized\nrepresentation learning. Specifically, our method involves masking 2D pose\nfeatures and utilizing a Transformer-GCN dual-stream model to learn\nhigh-dimensional representations through a self-distillation setup. By focusing\non contextualized representation learning and spatial-temporal modeling, our\napproach enhances the model's ability to understand spatial-temporal\nrelationships between postures, resulting in superior generalization.\nFurthermore, leveraging the Transformer-GCN dual-stream model, our approach\neffectively balances global and local interactions in video pose estimation.\nThe model adaptively integrates information from both the Transformer and GCN\nstreams, where the GCN stream effectively learns local relationships between\nadjacent key points and frames, while the Transformer stream captures\ncomprehensive global spatial and temporal features. Our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, with an MPJPE of 38.0mm\nand P-MPJPE of 31.9mm on Human3.6M, and an MPJPE of 15.9mm on MPI-INF-3DHP.\nFurthermore, visual experiments on public datasets and in-the-wild videos\ndemonstrate the robustness and generalization capabilities of our approach.",

Here, we\nperformed low-temperature, high-pressure $^{121/123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole\nresonance (NQR) measurements to explore the superconducting pairing symmetry in\nCsV$_3$Sb$_5$. At ambient pressure, we found that the spin-lattice relaxation\nrate 1/$T_1$ exhibits a kink at $T \\sim$ 0.4 $T_\\textrm{c}$ within the\nsuperconducting state and follows a $T^3$ variation as temperature further\ndecreases. This suggests the presence of two superconducting gaps with line\nnodes in the smaller one. As pressure increases beyond $P_{\\rm c} \\sim 1.85$\nGPa, where the charge-density wave phase is completely suppressed, 1/$T_1$\nshows no Hebel-Slichter peak just below $T_\\textrm{c}$, and decreases rapidly,\neven faster than $T^5$, indicating that the gap is fully opened for pressures\nabove $P_{\\rm c}$. In this high pressure region, the angular dependence of the\nin-plane upper critical magnetic field $H_{\\rm c2}$ breaks the $C_6$ rotational\nsymmetry. We propose the $s+id$ pairing at $P > P_{\\rm c}$ which explains both\nthe 1/$T_1$ and $H_{\\rm c2}$ behaviors.

Next, we formulate a two-timescale optimization problem of\nparameter freezing percentage and transmit power to minimize the model\nconvergence error subject to the energy budget. To solve this problem, we\ndecompose it into parallel sub-problems and decompose each sub-problem into two\ndifferent timescales problems using the Lyapunov optimization method.

The availability of modern\nclustering algorithms, together with \\textit{Gaia} DR3 kinematics and\ncomplementary spectroscopic data, makes it a suitable site for studies of\nGalactic structure. We seek to quantify the spatial scale of star formation in\nthe spiral arms, using Cas OB5 as a pilot target before extending our study to\nmore distant and extinguished regions of the Galaxy. We selected 129,695\ncandidate OBA stars in a 6x8 deg$^2$ region around Cas OB5. We applied a\nspectral energy distribution (SED) fitting process to this sample to derive the\nphysical parameters. Through this process, we found 56 379 OBA stars, which we\nthen clustered using HDBSCAN. We identified 17 open clusters inside this area,\nfour of which appear to form a coherent structure that we identify as Cas OB5.\nNevertheless, our findings suggest that these clusters belong to two different\nage groups despite sharing a similar position and kinematics. Spectroscopic\nobservations confirm the youth of NGC 7788 (10-15 Myr) compared to NGC 7790\n($110\\pm15\\:$Myr). We have determined a spatial scale for star formation of a\nfew tens of pc to a few hundreds of pc, comparing the clustered to the diffuse\npopulation of Cas~OB5 across this part of the Perseus arm. A spectroscopic\nanalysis was required to complement the clustering algorithm, so that we could\nseparate younger OCs (tracers of the spiral arm) from older ones.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nimproved code translation, but challenges remain, particularly in inferring\nprogram functionality. These issues worsen with longer and more complex code,\nwhere current LLMs struggle to handle length and intricate semantics. To\nevaluate LLMs on long code translation, we introduce LongTrans, a large-scale\nexecution-based benchmark with C++, Java, and Python programs, ranging from\nhundreds to thousands of tokens. Our empirical study of 12 LLMs reveals a sharp\nperformance decline as code length increases, with even the best-performing\nmodel, GPT-4o, achieving only 57.51% computational accuracy. This highlights\nthe need for further research in long code translation. We argue that code\ntranslation should maintain invariant functionality while transforming syntax\nand keywords across languages. Despite differences in appearance, program\nstates should remain consistent throughout execution. To address this, we\npropose PAST (Program State Alignment augmented Translation), which integrates\ninstrumentation to capture and align program states during translation. This\napproach is the first to leverage LLMs to insert instrumentation in both\noriginal and translated code, tracing program states at runtime. By prompting\nthe LLM to correct errors based on output traces, we mitigate inconsistencies\nand enhance translation accuracy.

A key focus is the behavior of wave packets in the minisuperspace\nframework. Notably, the correspondence principle (connection between classical\nand quantum solutions) is also demonstrated. Furthermore, the appropriate\nquintom duality is introduced, and we discuss its consequences. A section\nincluding interesting and challenging discussions is also presented.",

    "abstract": "Many Bayesian Network structure learning algorithms are unstable, with the\nlearned graph sensitive to arbitrary dataset artifacts, such as the ordering of\ncolumns (i.e., variable order). PC-Stable attempts to address this issue for\nthe widely-used PC algorithm, prompting researchers to use the \"stable\" version\ninstead. However, this problem seems to have been overlooked for score-based\nalgorithms. In this study, we show that some widely-used score-based\nalgorithms, as well as hybrid and constraint-based algorithms, including\nPC-Stable, suffer from the same issue. We propose a novel solution for\nscore-based greedy hill-climbing that eliminates instability by determining a\nstable node order, leading to consistent results regardless of variable\nordering. Two implementations, HC-Stable and Tabu-Stable, are introduced.\nTabu-Stable achieves the highest BIC scores across all networks, and the\nhighest accuracy for categorical networks. These results highlight the\nimportance of addressing instability in structure learning and provide a robust\nand practical approach for future applications.

While existing efforts utilize adversarial\nfine-tuning to enhance robustness, they often suffer from performance\ndegradation on clean inputs. In this paper, we proposes AdPO, a novel\nadversarial defense strategy for LVLMs based on preference optimization. For\nthe first time, we reframe adversarial training as a preference optimization\nproblem, aiming to enhance the model's preference for generating normal outputs\non clean inputs while rejecting the potential misleading outputs for\nadversarial examples. Notably, AdPO achieves this by solely modifying the image\nencoder, e.g., CLIP ViT, resulting in superior clean and adversarial\nperformance in a variety of downsream tasks. Considering that training involves\nlarge language models (LLMs), the computational cost increases significantly.\nWe validate that training on smaller LVLMs and subsequently transferring to\nlarger models can achieve competitive performance while maintaining efficiency\ncomparable to baseline methods.

However, empirical\ninvestigations indicate that such iterative decoders are susceptible to having\na high error floor while decoding QLDPC codes. The main objective of this paper\nis to analyze the decoding failures of the \\emph{hypergraph-product} and\n\\emph{lifted-product} codes and to design decoders that mitigate these\nfailures, thus achieving a reduced error floor. The suboptimal performance of\nthese codes can predominantly be ascribed to two structural phenomena: (1)\nstabilizer-induced trapping sets, which are subgraphs formed by stabilizers,\nand (2) classical trapping sets, which originate from the classical codes\nutilized in the construction of hypergraph-product and lifted-product codes.\nThe dynamics of stabilizer-induced trapping sets is examined and a\nstraightforward modification of iterative decoders is proposed to circumvent\nthese trapping sets. Moreover, this work proposes a systematic methodology for\ndesigning decoders that can circumvent classical trapping sets in both\nhypergraph product and lifted product codes, from decoders capable of avoiding\ntheir trapping set in the parent classical LDPC code.

Such applications are\nexecuted on supercomputers, which are often organized in a hierarchical\nhardware topology, consisting of islands, racks, nodes, and processors, where\nprocessing elements reside. To ensure efficient workload distribution, tasks\nmust be allocated to processing elements in a way that ensures balanced\nutilization. However, this approach optimizes only the workload, not the\ncommunication cost of the application. It is straightforward to see that\nplacing groups of tasks that frequently exchange large amounts of data on\nprocessing elements located near each other is beneficial. The problem of\nmapping tasks to processing elements considering optimization goals is called\nprocess mapping. In this work, we focus on minimizing communication cost while\nevenly distributing work. We present the first shared-memory algorithm that\nutilizes hierarchical multisection to partition the communication model across\nprocessing elements. Our parallel approach achieves the best solution on 95\npercent of instances while also being marginally faster than the next best\nalgorithm. Even in a serial setting, it delivers the best solution quality\nwhile also outperforming previous serial algorithms in speed.",

Initiatives such as\nthe ESA CCI map attempt to generate global biomass products from diverse\nspaceborne sensors but at a coarser resolution. To enable global,\nhigh-resolution (HR) mapping, several works propose to regress AGB from HR\nsatellite observations such as ESA Sentinel-1/2 images. We propose a novel way\nto address HR AGB estimation, by leveraging both HR satellite observations and\nexisting low-resolution (LR) biomass products. We cast this problem as Guided\nSuper-Resolution (GSR), aiming at upsampling LR biomass maps (sources) from\n$100$ to $10$ m resolution, using auxiliary HR co-registered satellite images\n(guides). We compare super-resolving AGB maps with and without guidance,\nagainst direct regression from satellite images, on the public BioMassters\ndataset. We observe that Multi-Scale Guidance (MSG) outperforms direct\nregression both for regression ($-780$ t/ha RMSE) and perception ($+2.0$ dB\nPSNR) metrics, and better captures high-biomass values, without significant\ncomputational overhead. Interestingly, unlike the RGB+Depth setting they were\noriginally designed for, our best-performing AGB GSR approaches are those that\nmost preserve the guide image texture. Our results make a strong case for\nadopting the GSR framework for accurate HR biomass mapping at scale.

Traditional methods relying\non a single modality or rigid rules struggle with noisy or misaligned data as\nwell as with object descriptions that do not perfectly fit the predefined\nobject names (e.g. 'Pick that red object'). We introduce TransforMerger, a\ntransformer-based reasoning model that infers a structured action command for\nrobotic manipulation based on fused voice and gesture inputs. Our approach\nmerges multimodal data into a single unified sentence, which is then processed\nby the language model. We employ probabilistic embeddings to handle uncertainty\nand we integrate contextual scene understanding to resolve ambiguous references\n(e.g., gestures pointing to multiple objects or vague verbal cues like \"this\").\nWe evaluate TransforMerger in simulated and real-world experiments,\ndemonstrating its robustness to noise, misalignment, and missing information.\nOur results show that TransforMerger outperforms deterministic baselines,\nespecially in scenarios requiring more contextual knowledge, enabling more\nrobust and flexible human-robot communication.

We investigate\nthis question empirically by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) and\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to LLMs of varying scales (0.5B to 7B parameters)\nand evaluating them across multiple ToM datasets. Our results reveal a\nscale-dependent impact of RL: while RL significantly improves accuracy and\nfosters high-quality, interpretable, and transferable belief-tracking reasoning\nin larger models (7B), it leads to \"reasoning collapse\" in smaller models\n($\\leq$3B), where high accuracy and generalization ability are achieved via\ndrastically shortened, less meaningful responses.

These findings highlight a\ncritical discrepancy between benchmark accuracy and the nature of learned\nreasoning.

Traditional FWI employs\nthe $l_2$ norm measurement to minimize the misfit between observed and\npredicted seismic data. However, when the background velocity is inaccurate or\nthe seismic data lacks low-frequency components, the conventional FWI suffers\nfrom cycle skipping, leading to inaccurate inversion results. This paper\nintroduces a multiscale structural similarity index measure (M-SSIM) objective\nfunction for FWI. We also incorporate anisotropic total p-variation\nregularization (ATpV) to further improve the accuracy of FWI. M-SSIM extracts\nmulti-scale structural features of seismic data in terms of both phase and\namplitude. These features can reduce the risk of cycle skipping and improve the\nstability of FWI.

    "abstract": "Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum\noptimization heuristic with empirical evidence of speedup over classical\nstate-of-the-art for some problems. QAOA solves optimization problems using a\nparameterized circuit with $p$ layers, with higher $p$ leading to better\nsolutions. Existing methods require optimizing $2p$ independent parameters\nwhich is challenging for large $p$. In this work, we present an iterative\ninterpolation method that exploits the smoothness of optimal parameter\nschedules by expressing them in a basis of orthogonal functions, generalizing\nZhou et al. By optimizing a small number of basis coefficients and iteratively\nincreasing both circuit depth and the number of coefficients until convergence,\nour approach enables construction of high-quality schedules for large $p$. We\ndemonstrate our method achieves better performance with fewer optimization\nsteps than current approaches on three problems: the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\n(SK) model, portfolio optimization, and Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequences\n(LABS). For the largest LABS instance, we achieve near-optimal merit factors\nwith schedules exceeding 1000 layers, an order of magnitude beyond previous\nmethods. As an application of our technique, we observe a mild growth of QAOA\ndepth sufficient to solve SK model exactly, a result of independent interest.",

Instead, they advocate for the use of the\nIntraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) as a measure of stability for feature\nselection. However, the direct effect of segmentation variability on the\npredictive models is rarely studied. This study investigates the impact of\nsegmentation variability on feature stability and predictive performance in\nradiomics-based prediction of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) subtype\nusing Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A total of 244 images from the Duke dataset\nwere used, with segmentation variability introduced through modifications of\nmanual segmentations. For each mask, explainable radiomic features were\nselected using the Shapley Additive exPlanations method and used to train\nlogistic regression models. Feature stability across segmentations was assessed\nvia ICC, Pearson's correlation, and reliability scores quantifying the\nrelationship between feature stability and segmentation variability. Results\nindicate that segmentation accuracy does not significantly impact predictive\nperformance. While incorporating peritumoral information may reduce feature\nreproducibility, it does not diminish feature predictive capability. Moreover,\nfeature selection in predictive models is not inherently tied to feature\nstability with respect to segmentation, suggesting that an overreliance on ICC\nor reliability scores for feature selection might exclude valuable predictive\nfeatures.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of diffusion models has increased the need for\ncustomized image generation. However, current customization methods face\nseveral limitations: 1) typically accept either image or text conditions alone;\n2) customization in complex visual scenarios often leads to subject leakage or\nconfusion; 3) image-conditioned outputs tend to suffer from inconsistent\nbackgrounds; and 4) high computational costs. To address these issues, this\npaper introduces Multi-party Collaborative Attention Control (MCA-Ctrl), a\ntuning-free method that enables high-quality image customization using both\ntext and complex visual conditions. Specifically, MCA-Ctrl leverages two key\noperations within the self-attention layer to coordinate multiple parallel\ndiffusion processes and guide the target image generation. This approach allows\nMCA-Ctrl to capture the content and appearance of specific subjects while\nmaintaining semantic consistency with the conditional input. Additionally, to\nmitigate subject leakage and confusion issues common in complex visual\nscenarios, we introduce a Subject Localization Module that extracts precise\nsubject and editable image layers based on user instructions. Extensive\nquantitative and human evaluation experiments show that MCA-Ctrl outperforms\nexisting methods in zero-shot image customization, effectively resolving the\nmentioned issues.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across\nvarious computer vision tasks, but their high computational cost remains a\nchallenge. Token pruning has been proposed to reduce this cost by selectively\nremoving less important tokens. While effective in vision tasks by discarding\nnon-object regions, applying this technique to audio tasks presents unique\nchallenges, as distinguishing relevant from irrelevant regions in\ntime-frequency representations is less straightforward. In this study, for the\nfirst time, we applied token pruning to ViT-based audio classification models\nusing Mel-spectrograms and analyzed the trade-offs between model performance\nand computational cost: TopK token pruning can reduce MAC operations of\nAudioMAE and AST by 30-40%, with less than a 1% drop in accuracy. Our analysis\nreveals that while high-intensity or high-variation tokens contribute\nsignificantly to model accuracy, low-intensity or low variation tokens also\nremain important when token pruning is applied; pruning solely based on the\nintensity or variation of signals in a patch leads to a noticeable drop in\naccuracy. We support our claim by measuring high correlation between attention\nscores and these statistical features and by showing retained tokens\nconsistently receive distinct attention compared to pruned ones. We also show\nthat AudioMAE retains more low-intensity tokens than AST. This can be explained\nby AudioMAE's self-supervised reconstruction objective, which encourages\nattention to all patches, whereas AST's supervised training focuses on\nlabel-relevant tokens.",

An\nelectric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its\nmagnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of\nsinglet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals\nwithout impurities. Altermegnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a\nspecific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in\ncombinations with rotations and reflections of crystal lattice. Similar\nsplitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial\ninversion operation. Both of these types materials have an anomalous Hall\neffect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes\nmagnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in\naltermagnets there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting\npairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states\nin one zone, whereas in altermagnets we are dealing with interband pairing,\nwhich is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.",

Thus, two energy scales naturally come into\nplay: $\\rho_*$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes\nrelevant; $\\rho_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to\nplay an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether\nthere are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular\nbouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a\ndynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories\nalways expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and\nnegative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point,\nthe asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of\npositive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the\nde Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the\nbounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the\ndimensionless parameter $q\\equiv \\rho_*/\\rho_i$, which measures the relative\nstrength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the\ntopology of the phase space. When $q < 3$, some trajectories expand toward a\nsingularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at\nlate-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era\nbefore the final acceleration.

These\nfamilies are found to be distributed across three language family quadruplets,\neach characterized by significantly different exponents in the Zipf graphs.\nThis finding sheds light on the underlying structure and organization of major\nlanguage families, revealing intriguing insights into the nature of linguistic\ndiversity and distribution.",

In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent\nlight-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so\nit does not enjoy any special status, contradicting the conclusions in Phys.\nRev.

    "abstract": "As a quantum thermodynamic device that utilizes quantum systems for energy\nstorage and delivery, the quantum battery (QB) is expected to offer\nrevolutionary advantages in terms of increasing the charging power and the\nextractable work by using quantum resources. However, the ubiquitous\ndecoherence in the microscopic world inevitably forces the QB to spontaneously\nlose its stored energy. This is called the self-discharging of the QB and\nseverely limits its realization. We propose a QB scheme based on the\nnitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, where the electronic spin serves as the QB.\nInspired by our finding that the coherent ergotropy decays more slowly than the\nincoherent ergotropy, we reveal a mechanism to enhance the inherent robustness\nof the QB to the self-discharging by improving the ratio of coherent ergotropy\nto total ergotropy. The unique hyperfine interaction between the electron and\nthe native $^{14}$N nucleus in our scheme allows one to coherently optimize\nthis ratio. Mitigating the self-discharging and optimizing the extractable work\nsimultaneously, our results pave the way for the practical realization of the\nQB.",

    "abstract": "Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) is a methodology for designing\nsystems and components under the consideration of probabilistic uncertainty. In\npractical engineering, the number of input data is often limited, which can\ndamage the validity of the optimal results obtained by RBDO. Confidence-based\ndesign optimization (CBDO) has been proposed to account for the uncertainty of\nthe input distribution. However, this approach faces challenges, computational\ncost and accuracy when dealing with highly nonlinear performance constraints.\nIn this paper, we consider the compliance minimization problem of truss\nstructures with uncertain external forces. Armed with the advanced risk\nmeasure, conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), we formulate a bi-objective\noptimization problem for the worst-case expected value and the worst-case CVaR\nof compliance, which allows us to account for the tail risk of performance\nfunctions not addressed in CBDO. Employing kernel density estimation for\nestimation of the input distribution allows us to eliminate the need for\nmodeling the input distribution. We show that this problem reduces to a\nsecond-order cone programming when assigning either uniform kernel or\ntriangular kernel. Finally, through numerical experiments, we obtain the Pareto\nfront for the bi-objective optimization problem of the worst-case expected\nvalue and CVaR of compliance of truss structures, and confirm the changes in\nthe Pareto solutions.",

System Level Synthesis\n(SLS) has emerged as a powerful framework that facilitates the control of\nlarge-scale systems while accounting for model uncertainties. SLS approaches\nare currently limited to linear systems and time-varying linear control\npolicies, thus limiting the class of achievable control strategies. We\nintroduce a novel closed-loop parameterization for time-varying affine control\npolicies, extending the SLS framework to a broader class of systems and\npolicies. We show that the closed-loop behavior under affine policies can be\nequivalently characterized using past system trajectories, enabling a fully\ndata-driven formulation. This parameterization seamlessly integrates affine\npolicies into optimal control problems, allowing for a closed-loop formulation\nof general Model Predictive Control (MPC) problems. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to extend SLS to affine policies in both\nmodel-based and data-driven settings, enabling an equivalent formulation of MPC\nproblems using closed-loop maps. We validate our approach through numerical\nexperiments, demonstrating that our model-based and data-driven affine SLS\nformulations achieve performance on par with traditional model-based MPC.",

However, many specific downstream tasks, such as extreme weather\nnowcasting (e.g., downburst and tornado), disaster monitoring, and battlefield\nsurveillance, require real-time data processing. Traditional methods via\ntransferring raw data to ground stations for processing often cause significant\nissues in terms of latency and trustworthiness. To address these challenges,\nsatellite edge AI provides a paradigm shift from ground-based to on-board data\nprocessing by leveraging the integrated communication-and-computation\ncapabilities in space computing power networks (Space-CPN), thereby enhancing\nthe timeliness, effectiveness, and trustworthiness for remote sensing\ndownstream tasks. Moreover, satellite edge large AI model (LAM) involves both\nthe training (i.e., fine-tuning) and inference phases, where a key challenge\nlies in developing computation task decomposition principles to support\nscalable LAM deployment in resource-constrained space networks with\ntime-varying topologies. In this article, we first propose a satellite\nfederated fine-tuning architecture to split and deploy the modules of LAM over\nspace and ground networks for efficient LAM fine-tuning. We then introduce a\nmicroservice-empowered satellite edge LAM inference architecture that\nvirtualizes LAM components into lightweight microservices tailored for\nmulti-task multimodal inference. Finally, we discuss the future directions for\nenhancing the efficiency and scalability of satellite edge LAM, including\ntask-oriented communication, brain-inspired computing, and satellite edge AI\nnetwork optimization.",

    "abstract": "The standard model of cosmology has provided a good phenomenological\ndescription of a wide range of observations both at astrophysical and\ncosmological scales for several decades. This concordance model is constructed\nby a universal cosmological constant and supported by a matter sector described\nby the standard model of particle physics and a cold dark matter contribution,\nas well as very early-time inflationary physics, and underpinned by gravitation\nthrough general relativity. There have always been open questions about the\nsoundness of the foundations of the standard model. However, recent years have\nshown that there may also be questions from the observational sector with the\nemergence of differences between certain cosmological probes. In this White\nPaper, we identify the key objectives that need to be addressed over the coming\ndecade together with the core science projects that aim to meet these\nchallenges. These discordances primarily rest on the divergence in the\nmeasurement of core cosmological parameters with varying levels of statistical\nconfidence. These possible statistical tensions may be partially accounted for\nby systematics in various measurements or cosmological probes but there is also\na growing indication of potential new physics beyond the standard model. After\nreviewing the principal probes used in the measurement of cosmological\nparameters, as well as potential systematics, we discuss the most promising\narray of potential new physics that may be observable in upcoming surveys. We\nalso discuss the growing set of novel data analysis approaches that go beyond\ntraditional methods to test physical models. [Abridged]",

    "abstract": "3D point cloud semantic segmentation (PCSS) is a cornerstone for\nenvironmental perception in robotic systems and autonomous driving, enabling\nprecise scene understanding through point-wise classification. While\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates label scarcity in PCSS, existing\nmethods critically overlook the inherent vulnerability to real-world\nperturbations (e.g., snow, fog, rain) and adversarial distortions. This work\nfirst identifies two intrinsic limitations that undermine current PCSS-UDA\nrobustness: (a) unsupervised features overlap from unaligned boundaries in\nshared-class regions and (b) feature structure erosion caused by\ndomain-invariant learning that suppresses target-specific patterns. To address\nthe proposed problems, we propose a tripartite framework consisting of: 1) a\nrobustness evaluation model quantifying resilience against adversarial\nattack/corruption types through robustness metrics; 2) an invertible attention\nalignment module (IAAM) enabling bidirectional domain mapping while preserving\ndiscriminative structure via attention-guided overlap suppression; and 3) a\ncontrastive memory bank with quality-aware contrastive learning that\nprogressively refines pseudo-labels with feature quality for more\ndiscriminative representations. Extensive experiments on\nSynLiDAR-to-SemanticPOSS adaptation demonstrate a maximum mIoU improvement of\n14.3\\% under adversarial attack.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an increasingly important tool in\nresearch and society at large. While LLMs are regularly used all over the world\nby experts and lay-people alike, they are predominantly developed with\nEnglish-speaking users in mind, performing well in English and other\nwide-spread languages while less-resourced languages such as Luxembourgish are\nseen as a lower priority. This lack of attention is also reflected in the\nsparsity of available evaluation tools and datasets. In this study, we\ninvestigate the viability of language proficiency exams as such evaluation\ntools for the Luxembourgish language. We find that large models such as\nChatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek-R1 typically achieve high scores, while smaller\nmodels show weak performances.

We introduce two\nvariants, SLA-Adapter and SLA-LoRA, which integrate PEFT modules into the CLIP\nvisual encoder, enabling fine-tuning with minimal trainable parameters. The\neffectiveness of the proposed frameworks is validated on four datasets:\nPhoenix2014, Phoenix2014-T, CSL-Daily, and Isharah-500, where both CLIP-SLA\nvariants outperformed several SOTA models with fewer trainable parameters.\nExtensive ablation studies emphasize the effectiveness and flexibility of the\nproposed methods with different vision-language models for CSLR.

We examine the three\nstandard recovery regimes: exact recovery, almost exact recovery, and weak\nrecovery. When communities vary in size, traditional accuracy- or\nalignment-based metrics become unsuitable for assessing the correctness of a\npredicted partition. To address this, we redefine these recovery regimes using\nthe correlation coefficient, a more versatile metric for comparing partitions.\nWe then demonstrate that $\\textit{Diamond Percolation}$, an algorithm based on\ncommon-neighbors, successfully recovers communities under mild assumptions on\nedge probabilities, with minimal restrictions on the number and sizes of\ncommunities. As a key application, we consider the case where community sizes\nfollow a power-law distribution, a characteristic frequently found in\nreal-world networks.

These priors guide the\ndenoising model to focus on anatomically relevant regions to suppress noise\nwhile preserving clinically relevant structures. We highlight three main\ncontributions: BioAtt outperforms baseline and attention-based models in SSIM,\nPSNR, and RMSE across multiple anatomical regions. The framework introduces a\nnew architectural paradigm by embedding anatomic priors directly into spatial\nattention. Finally, BioAtt attention maps provide visual confirmation that the\nimprovements stem from anatomical guidance rather than increased model\ncomplexity.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting enables high-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) at\nreal-time frame rates. However, its quality drops sharply as we depart from the\ntraining views. Thus, dense captures are needed to match the high-quality\nexpectations of applications like Virtual Reality (VR). However, such dense\ncaptures are very laborious and expensive to obtain. Existing works have\nexplored using 2D generative models to alleviate this requirement by\ndistillation or generating additional training views. These models typically\nrely on a noise-to-data generative process conditioned only on a handful of\nreference input views, leading to hallucinations, inconsistent generation\nresults, and subsequent reconstruction artifacts. Instead, we propose a\nmulti-view, flow matching model that learns a flow to directly connect novel\nview renderings from possibly sparse reconstructions to renderings that we\nexpect from dense reconstructions. This enables augmenting scene captures with\nconsistent, generated views to improve reconstruction quality. Our model is\ntrained on a novel dataset of 3.6M image pairs and can process up to 45 views\nat 540x960 resolution (91K tokens) on one H100 GPU in a single forward pass.\nOur pipeline consistently improves NVS in sparse- and dense-view scenarios,\nleading to higher-quality reconstructions than prior works across multiple,\nwidely-used NVS benchmarks.",

This paper tackles the problem of identifying\nCSISs for black-box discrete-time systems, where the model is unknown and only\nlimited simulation data is accessible. Traditionally, a CSIS is defined as a\nsubset of a safe set, encompassing initial states for which a control input\nexists that keeps the system within the set at the next time step-this is\nreferred to as the one-step invariance property. However, the requirement for\none-step invariance can be equivalently translated into a stricter condition of\n``always-invariance'', meaning that there exist control inputs capable of\nkeeping the system within this set indefinitely. Such a condition may prove\noverly stringent or impractical for black-box systems, where predictions can\nbecome unreliable beyond a single time step or a limited number of finite time\nsteps. To overcome the challenges posed by black-box systems, we reformulate\nthe one-step invariance property in a ``Probably Approximately Correct'' (PAC)\nsense. This approach allows us to assess the probability that a control input\nexists to keep the system within the CSIS at the next time step, with a\npredefined level of confidence. If the system successfully remains within the\nset at the next time step, we can then reapply the invariance evaluation to the\nnew state, thereby facilitating a recursive assurance of invariance. Our method\nemploys barrier functions and scenario optimization, resulting in a linear\nprogramming method to estimate PAC CSISs. Finally, the effectiveness of our\napproach is demonstrated on several examples.",

While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic\nsegmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions,\na comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision\nmodels under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills\nthis gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial\nrobustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to\nassess the impact of localized corruptions. Furthermore, we uncover the\ninherent complexity of characterizing worst-case robustness using a single\nlocalized adversarial perturbation. To address this, we propose region-aware\nmulti-attack adversarial analysis, a method that enables a deeper understanding\nof model robustness against adversarial perturbations applied to specific\nregions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14\nsegmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the\neffects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The\nresults reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently;\nfor instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable\nrobustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to\nadversarial ones and vice-versa for CNN-based models.

More precisely, we\nessentially assume that the drift coefficient is piecewise Lipschitz continuous\nwith an exceptional set $\\Theta\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ that is an orientable\n$C^4$-hypersurface of positive reach, the diffusion coefficient is assumed to\nbe Lipschitz continuous and, in a neighborhood of $\\Theta$, both coefficients\nare bounded and the diffusion coefficient has a non-degenerate portion\northogonal to $\\Theta$.\n  In recent years, a number of results have been proven in the literature for\nstrong approximation of such SDEs and, in particular, the performance of the\nEuler-Maruyama scheme was studied. For $d=1$ and finite $\\Theta$ it was shown\nthat the Euler-Maruyama scheme achieves an $L_p$-error rate of at least $1/2$\nfor all $p\\geq 1$ as in the classical case of Lipschitz continuous\ncoefficients. For $d>1$, it was only known so far, that the Euler-Maruyama\nscheme achieves an $L_2$-error rate of at least $1/4-$ if, additionally, the\ncoefficients $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are globally bounded.\n  In this article, we prove that in the above setting the Euler-Maruyama scheme\nin fact achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of at least $1/2-$ for all\n$d\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and all $p\\geq 1$. The proof of this result is based on the\nwell-known approach of transforming such an SDE into an SDE with globally\nLipschitz continuous coefficients, a new It\\^{o} formula for a class of\nfunctions which are not globally $C^2$ and a detailed analysis of the expected\ntotal time that the actual position of the time-continuous Euler-Maruyama\nscheme and its position at the preceding time point on the underlying grid are\non 'different sides' of the hypersurface $\\Theta$.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Horizon scanning in healthcare assesses early signals of\ninnovation, crucial for timely adoption. Current horizon scanning faces\nchallenges in efficient information retrieval and analysis, especially from\nunstructured sources like news, presenting a need for innovative tools.\nMethodology: The study introduces SCANAR and AIDOC, open-source Python-based\ntools designed to improve horizon scanning. SCANAR automates the retrieval and\nprocessing of news articles, offering functionalities such as de-duplication\nand unsupervised relevancy ranking. AIDOC aids filtration by leveraging AI to\nreorder textual data based on relevancy, employing neural networks for semantic\nsimilarity, and subsequently prioritizing likely relevant entries for human\nreview. Results: Twelve internal datasets from horizon scans and four external\nbenchmarking datasets were used. SCANAR improved retrieval efficiency by\nautomating processes previously dependent on manual labour. AIDOC displayed\nwork-saving potential, achieving around 62% reduction in manual review efforts\nat 95% recall. Comparative analysis with benchmarking data showed AIDOC's\nperformance was similar to existing systematic review automation tools, though\nperformance varied depending on dataset characteristics. A smaller case-study\non our news datasets shows the potential of ensembling large language models\nwithin the active-learning process for faster detection of relevant articles\nacross news datasets. Conclusion: The validation indicates that SCANAR and\nAIDOC show potential to enhance horizon scanning efficiency by streamlining\ndata retrieval and prioritisation. These tools may alleviate methodological\nlimitations and allow broader, swifter horizon scans. Further studies are\nsuggested to optimize these models and to design new workflows and validation\nprocesses that integrate large language models.",

Exercise presents\nadditional challenges due to complex effects on glucose dynamics. Despite\nadvancements in diabetes technology, significant gaps remain in understanding\nthe relationship between exercise, glycemic variability (GV), and hypoglycemia\nin both automated insulin delivery (AID) and non-AID users. Additionally,\nlimited research explores the temporal progression of GV before and after\nhypoglycemia and the impact of long-duration episodes on glucose recovery. This\nstudy analyses the Type 1 Diabetes and Exercise Initiative (T1DEXI) dataset,\nassessing GV, hypoglycemia, gender, and exercise interactions in AID (n=222)\nand non-AID (n=276) users. The study examined patterns of glycemic variability\nmetrics like time below range (TBR) surrounding hypoglycemia events, focusing\non the 48 hours before and after these events. We further assess the impact of\ndifferent hypoglycemia levels (41-50 mg/dL, 51-60 mg/dL, and 61-70 mg/dL) on\npost-event glucose stability. GV increased before and after hypoglycemia up to\n48 hours in both AID and non-AID users, with statistically significant\ndifferences. TBR elevation persisted across all groups, peaking around\nhypoglycemic episodes. Notably, females using AID achieved significantly\nimproved glucose stability compared to non-AID females - a larger within-group\ndifference than that observed in males. Individual-level AID analyses showed\nthat long hypoglycemia episodes (>40 minutes) led to prolonged TBR elevation,\nsuggesting slower recovery despite AID intervention. GV trends may aid in\npredicting hypoglycemia over extended periods. Integrating GV patterns into AID\nsystems could enhance glucose stability and mitigate hypoglycemia cycles.",

The proof involves certain graphs on $[n+1]$; more strongly, we\nexplain why the character (i.e., generating function) of the Kostant partition\nfunction of any loopless multigraph on $[n+1]$ is Lorentzian after shifting and\nnormalizing.

Local AHC is found to be predominantly\nlocated in regions with consecutive correct stacking orders, contributing to\nquasi-quantized AHC. Conversely, regions with consecutive incorrect stacking\ncontribute minimally to the total AHC, which can be attributed to the varied\ninterlayer coupling in different stacking configurations.

However, existing deep methods\nthat are limited by pooling have difficulty extracting diverse and complex\ngraph structure features, while traditional graph kernel methods rely on\nexhaustive substructure search, unable to adaptive handle multi-relational\ndata. This limitation hampers producing robust and representative graph-level\nembeddings. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Relation\nGraph-Kernel Strengthen Network for Graph-Level Clustering (MGSN), which\nintegrates multi-relation modeling with graph kernel techniques to fully\nleverage their respective advantages. Specifically, MGSN constructs\nmulti-relation graphs to capture diverse semantic relationships between nodes\nand graphs, which employ graph kernel methods to extract graph similarity\nfeatures, enriching the representation space. Moreover, a relation-aware\nrepresentation refinement strategy is designed, which adaptively aligns\nmulti-relation information across views while enhancing graph-level features\nthrough a progressive fusion process. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of MGSN over state-of-the-art\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Objective: Spike sorting is a fundamental step in analysing extracellular\nrecordings, enabling the isolation of single-neuron activity. However, it\nremains a challenging problem because extracellular traces mix overlapping\nspikes from neighbouring cells and are marred by recording instabilities such\nas electrode drift. Numerous algorithms have been proposed, yet many struggle\nto balance accuracy and computational efficiency, limiting their practicality\nfor todays large-scale datasets. Approach: In response, we introduce SpikeSift,\na spike-sorting algorithm expressly designed to mitigate drift while running on\nstandard CPUs. SpikeSift (i) partitions long recordings into shorter,\nrelatively stationary segments, (ii) carries out spike detection and clustering\nsimultaneously through an iterative detect-and-subtract scheme within each\nsegment, and (iii) preserves neuronal identity across segments via a fast\ntemplate alignment stage that dispenses with continuous trajectory estimation.\nMain results: Extensive validation on paired intracellularly validated datasets\nand on biophysically realistic MEArec simulations covering elevated noise,\ndiverse drift profiles, ultra short recordings and bursting activity,\ndemonstrates that SpikeSift matches or exceeds the accuracy of state of the art\nmethods while completing sorting an order of magnitude faster on a single\ndesktop core.

    "abstract": "Image inpainting aims to fill the missing region of an image. Recently, there\nhas been a surge of interest in foreground-conditioned background inpainting, a\nsub-task that fills the background of an image while the foreground subject and\nassociated text prompt are provided. Existing background inpainting methods\ntypically strictly preserve the subject's original position from the source\nimage, resulting in inconsistencies between the subject and the generated\nbackground. To address this challenge, we propose a new task, the \"Text-Guided\nSubject-Position Variable Background Inpainting\", which aims to dynamically\nadjust the subject position to achieve a harmonious relationship between the\nsubject and the inpainted background, and propose the Adaptive Transformation\nAgent (A$^\\text{T}$A) for this task. Firstly, we design a PosAgent Block that\nadaptively predicts an appropriate displacement based on given features to\nachieve variable subject-position. Secondly, we design the Reverse Displacement\nTransform (RDT) module, which arranges multiple PosAgent blocks in a reverse\nstructure, to transform hierarchical feature maps from deep to shallow based on\nsemantic information. Thirdly, we equip A$^\\text{T}$A with a Position Switch\nEmbedding to control whether the subject's position in the generated image is\nadaptively predicted or fixed. Extensive comparative experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our A$^\\text{T}$A approach, which not only demonstrates\nsuperior inpainting capabilities in subject-position variable inpainting, but\nalso ensures good performance on subject-position fixed inpainting.",

    "abstract": "In modern online streaming platforms, the comments section plays a critical\nrole in enhancing the overall user experience. Understanding user behavior\nwithin the comments section is essential for comprehensive user interest\nmodeling. A key factor of user engagement is staytime, which refers to the\namount of time that users browse and post comments. Existing watchtime\nprediction methods struggle to adapt to staytime prediction, overlooking\ninteractions with individual comments and their interrelation. In this paper,\nwe present a micro-video recommendation dataset with video comments (named as\nKuaiComt) which is collected from Kuaishou platform. correspondingly, we\npropose a practical framework for comment staytime prediction with LLM-enhanced\nComment Understanding (LCU). Our framework leverages the strong text\ncomprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to understand\ntextual information of comments, while also incorporating fine-grained comment\nranking signals as auxiliary tasks. The framework is two-staged: first, the LLM\nis fine-tuned using domain-specific tasks to bridge the video and the comments;\nsecond, we incorporate the LLM outputs into the prediction model and design two\ncomment ranking auxiliary tasks to better understand user preference. Extensive\noffline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, showing\nsignificant improvements on the task of comment staytime prediction.\nAdditionally, online A/B testing further validates the practical benefits on\nindustrial scenario.

Gait\nfeature measurements are paramount for wide-ranging applications, varying from\nthe medical field to the design of bridges. Personal space and choice of\ndirection (directional bias) play important roles during crowd simulations. In\nthis study, we formulate an automatic algorithm for calculating the gait\nfeatures of a trajectory extracted from video recorded using a single camera\nattached to the roof of a building. Our findings indicate that females have\n28.64% smaller sway amplitudes, 8.68% smaller stride lengths, and 8.14% slower\nspeeds compared to males, with no significant difference in frequency. However,\naccording to further investigation, our study reveals that the body parameters\nare the main variables that dominate gait features rather than gender. We have\nconducted three experiments in which the volunteers are walking towards the\ndestination a) without any obstruction, b) with a stationary non-living\nobstacle present in the middle of the path, and c) with a human being standing\nin the middle of the path. From a comprehensive statistical analysis, key\nobservations include no significant difference in gait features with respect to\ngender, no significant difference in gait features in the absence or presence\nof an obstacle, pedestrians treating stationary human beings and stationary\nobstacles the same given that the gender is same to match the comfort level,\nand a directional bias towards the left direction, likely influenced by\nleft-hand traffic rule in India.",

In addition, two of the QSO2s\nshow absorption bands of CO, H2O, and aliphatic grains, indicating different\nlevels of nuclear obscuration across the sample. 2) [NeV]/[NeII] ratios ranging\nfrom 0.1 to 2.1 and [NeIII]/[NeII] from 1.0 to 3.5, indicating different\ncoronal line and ionizing continuum strengths. 3) Warm molecular gas masses of\n1-4x10^7 Msun and warm-to-cold gas mass ratios of 1-2%, with molecular gas\nexcitation likely due to jet-induced shocks in J1430+1339, and to UV heating\nand/or turbulence in J1509+0434. 4) PAH emission features with equivalent\nwidths ranging from <0.002 to 0.075 micron, from which we measure a larger\ncontribution from neutral molecules (PAH 11.3/6.2=1.3-3.4) and SFRs<3-7\nMsun/yr.

Due to the polar nature of the KTaO3(001) surface, one can expect\ndifficulties and challenges to arise in its preparation. Maintaining good\ninsulating characteristics without adding undesirable in-gap electronic states,\nobtaining good crystalline order up to the top surface layer, a sufficiently\nflat surface, and complete cleanliness of the surface (without water, C or OH\ncontaminants), are in general difficult conditions to accomplish\nsimultaneously. Cleaving in vacuum is likely the best option for obtaining a\nclean surface.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the topological\nphases in the superconducting states of UTe$_2$ is still lacking. Here, we\npresent an exhaustive classification of topological phases for all\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking pairing symmetries of UTe$_2$. Using the K\ntheoretical classification approach, we uncover that 25 out of 36 possible\npairing states are classified as higher-order topological phases, with some\ndemonstrating hybrid-order topology through an intricate interplay of hinge and\ncorner states. Furthermore, under the weak-coupling condition of the pair\npotentials, the possible pairing symmetries are constrained to $B_{ju} + i\nB_{ku}$, $A_{u} + i B_{j u}$, and $B_{j g} + iA_u$ ($j,k = 1,2,3$; $j \\neq k$),\nwhere these symbols denote the irreducible representations of the point group\n$D_{2h}$. For these pairing states, the topological invariants are related to\nthe Fermi surface topology via the Fermi-surface formula, enabling us to\nsystematically diagnose higher-order topological phases. Using a tight-binding\nmodel, we demonstrate the higher-order topological phases of the mixed-parity\n$A_u + iB_{1g}$ superconductors, where the second-order and hybrid-order\ntopological phases emerge as the number of Fermi surfaces enclosing the\ntime-reversal invariant momentum evolves from two to four.

In the past, a model was proposed\nto describe GRB LCs as the outcome of a stochastic pulse avalanche process,\npossibly originating from a turbulent regime, and it was tested by comparing\naverage temporal properties of simulated and real LCs. Recently, we revived\nthis model and optimised its parameters using a genetic algorithm (GA), a\nmachine-learning-based approach. Our findings suggested that GRB inner engines\nmay operate near a critical regime. Here we present an advanced version of the\nmodel, which allows us to constrain the peak flux distribution of individual\npulses, and evaluate its performance on a new dataset of GRBs observed by the\nFermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). After introducing new model parameters and\na further comparison metric, that is the observed signal-to-noise (S/N)\ndistribution, we test the new model on three complementary datasets:\nCGRO/BATSE, Swift/BAT, and Fermi/GBM. As in our previous work, the model\nparameters are optimised using a GA. The updated sets of parameters achieve a\nfurther reduction in loss compared to both the original model and our earlier\noptimisation. The different values of the parameters across the datasets are\nshown to originate from the different energy passbands, effective areas,\ntrigger algorithms, and, ultimately, different GRB populations of the three\nexperiments. Our results further underpin the stochastic and avalanche\ncharacter of the dissipation process behind long GRB prompt emission, with an\nemphasis on the near-critical behaviour, and establish this new model as a\nreliable tool for generating realistic GRB LCs as they would be seen with\nfuture experiments.",

By incorporating a\nmotion trend module and a latentbone encoder, we explicitly model\npose-dependent deformations and temporal variations in clothing behavior.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach in capturing fine-grained clothing deformations and motion-driven\nshape variations. Our method significantly enhances structural fidelity and\nperceptual quality in dynamic human reconstruction, particularly in non-rigid\nregions, while achieving better consistency across temporal frames.",

    "abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of checking if two shallow (i.e.,\nconstant-depth) quantum circuits perform equivalent computations. Equivalence\nchecking is a fundamental correctness question -- needed, e.g., for ensuring\nthat transformations applied to a quantum circuit do not alter its behavior.\nFor quantum circuits, the problem is challenging because a straightforward\nrepresentation on a classical computer of each circuit's quantum state can\nrequire time and space that are exponential in the number of qubits $n$.\n  The paper presents decision procedures for two variants of the\nequivalence-checking problem. Both can be carried out on a classical computer\nin time and space that, for any fixed depth, is linear in $n$. Our critical\ninsight is that local projections are precise enough to completely characterize\nthe output state of a shallow quantum circuit. Instead of explicitly computing\nthe output state of a circuit, we generate a set of local projections that\nserve as constraints on the output state. Moreover, the circuit's output state\nis the unique quantum state that satisfies all the constraints.\n  Beyond equivalence checking, we show how to use the constraint representation\nto check a class of assertions, both statically and at run time. Our\nassertion-checking methods are sound and complete for assertions expressed as\nconjunctions of local projections.\n  Our experiments show that on a server equipped with 2 x\nIntel\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered} Xeon\\textsuperscript{\\textregistered}\nGold 6338 CPUs (128 threads total) and 1.0~TiB of RAM, running Ubuntu 20.04.6\nLTS, the constraint representation of a random 100-qubit circuit of depth 6 can\nbe computed in 19.8 seconds. For fixed inputs $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes 100}$,\nequivalence checking of {random} 100-qubit circuits of depth 3 takes 4.46\nseconds; for arbitrary inputs, it takes no more than 31.96 seconds.",

Traditional ER methods use\nbatch processing, which becomes impractical with growing data volumes due to\nhigh computational costs and lack of real-time capabilities. In many\napplications, users need to resolve entities for only a small portion of their\ndata, making full data processing unnecessary -- a scenario known as\n\"ER-on-demand\". This paper proposes FastER, an efficient ER-on-demand framework\nfor property graphs. Our approach uses graph differential dependencies (GDDs)\nas a knowledge encoding language to design effective filtering mechanisms that\nleverage both structural and attribute semantics of graphs. We construct a\nblocking graph from filtered subgraphs to reduce the number of candidate entity\npairs requiring comparison.

    "abstract": "Causal effect identification using causal graphs is a fundamental challenge\nin causal inference. While extensive research has been conducted in this area,\nmost existing methods assume the availability of fully specified directed\nacyclic graphs or acyclic directed mixed graphs. However, in complex domains\nsuch as medicine and epidemiology, complete causal knowledge is often\nunavailable, and only partial information about the system is accessible. This\npaper focuses on causal effect identification within partially specified causal\ngraphs, with particular emphasis on cluster-directed mixed graphs (C-DMGs)\nwhich can represent many different acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs). These\ngraphs provide a higher-level representation of causal relationships by\ngrouping variables into clusters, offering a more practical approach for\nhandling complex systems. Unlike fully specified ADMGs, C-DMGs can contain\ncycles, which complicate their analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, their\ncluster-based nature introduces new challenges, as it gives rise to two\ndistinct types of causal effects: macro causal effects and micro causal\neffects, each with different properties. In this work, we focus on macro causal\neffects, which describe the effects of entire clusters on other clusters. We\nestablish that the do-calculus is both sound and complete for identifying these\neffects in C-DMGs over ADMGs when the cluster sizes are either unknown or of\nsize greater than one.

However, it often requires large annotated training datasets,\nwhich limits its scalability in clinical settings. To address this challenge,\nsemi-supervised learning is a well-established approach that leverages both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce a novel semi-supervised\nteacher-student framework for biomedical image segmentation, inspired by the\nrecent success of generative models. Our approach leverages denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate segmentation masks by progressively\nrefining noisy inputs conditioned on the corresponding images. The teacher\nmodel is first trained in an unsupervised manner using a cycle-consistency\nconstraint based on noise-corrupted image reconstruction, enabling it to\ngenerate informative semantic masks. Subsequently, the teacher is integrated\ninto a co-training process with a twin-student network. The student learns from\nground-truth labels when available and from teacher-generated pseudo-labels\notherwise, while the teacher continuously improves its pseudo-labeling\ncapabilities. Finally, to further enhance performance, we introduce a\nmulti-round pseudo-label generation strategy that iteratively improves the\npseudo-labeling process. We evaluate our approach on multiple biomedical\nimaging benchmarks, spanning multiple imaging modalities and segmentation\ntasks. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art semi-supervised techniques, highlighting its effectiveness in\nscenarios with limited annotated data.

This is especially the case for\nphysiological time series, which are both noisy and scarce, which calls for\ndata augmentation to artificially increase the size of datasets. Another issue\nis that the time-evolving statistical properties of nonstationary signals\nprevent the use of standard data augmentation techniques. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel method for augmenting nonstationary time series. This is\nachieved by combining offline changepoint detection with the iterative\namplitude-adjusted Fourier transform (iAAFT), which ensures that the\ntime-frequency properties of the original signal are preserved during\naugmentation. The proposed method is validated through comparisons of the\nperformance of i) a deep learning seizure detection algorithm on both the\noriginal and augmented versions of the CHB-MIT and Siena scalp\nelectroencephalography (EEG) databases, and ii) a deep learning atrial\nfibrillation (AF) detection algorithm on the original and augmented versions of\nthe Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 dataset. By virtue of the proposed\nmethod, for the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets respectively, accuracy rose by 4.4%\nand 1.9%, precision by 10% and 5.5%, recall by 3.6% and 0.9%, and F1 by 4.2%\nand 1.4%.

    "abstract": "Lattice QCD has become a crucial tool for studying hadron-hadron interactions\nfrom first principles. However, significant challenges arise when extracting\ninfinite-volume scattering parameters from finite-volume energy levels using\nthe conventional L\\\"uscher method, particularly due to the presence of\nleft-hand cuts induced by long-range interactions such as the one-pion\nexchange. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that\ncombines chiral effective field theory and the plane-wave expansion with the\nHamiltonian approach. By solving a Schr\\\"odinger-like equation in a finite\nvolume, this method establishes a connection between finite-volume energy\nspectra and infinite-volume physical quantities, while effectively handling\nissues caused by left-hand cuts. Furthermore, the adoption of a plane-wave\nbasis helps mitigating complexities associated with partial-wave mixing. Our\npreliminary numerical results at $m_\\pi \\approx 280$ MeV confirm that this\napproach efficiently overcomes the shortcomings of the L\\\"uscher method and\nindicate a resonant interpretation of the $T_{cc}(3875)$ state--in contrast to\nthe virtual state suggested in conventional analyses.",

This paradigm of computation in particular allows for hugely\ndistributed algorithms, where independent instances of a given LCA provide\nconsistent access to a common output solution.\n  The past decade has seen a significant amount of work on LCAs, by and large\nfocusing on graph problems. In this paper, we initiate the study of Local\nComputation Algorithms for perhaps the archetypal combinatorial optimization\nproblem, Knapsack. We first establish strong impossibility results, ruling out\nthe existence of any non-trivial LCA for Knapsack as several of its\nrelaxations. We then show how equipping the LCA with additional access to the\nKnapsack instance, namely, weighted item sampling, allows one to circumvent\nthese impossibility results, and obtain sublinear-time and query LCAs. Our\npositive result draws on a connection to the recent notion of reproducibility\nfor learning algorithms (Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell, 2022), a\nconnection we believe to be of independent interest for the design of LCAs.",

In this article, we present the first study utilising registers or\ngenres - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic\nvariation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of\nregister on the performance of LLMs. We train small generative models with\nregister classified data and evaluate them using standard benchmarks, and show\nthat the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance.\nWe uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the\nresulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on\nthe contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and\nopinion blogs, is highly beneficial.

Within these pipelines, reliable quality assessment must be ensured\nto validate the generated results. Image quality assessment is often applied\nwith full-reference methods to estimate the similarity between the ground truth\nand the output images. However, current methods often show poor agreement with\nvisual perception and lead to the generation of various full-reference metrics\ntailored to specific applications. Additionally, they rely on pixel-wise\ncomparisons, emphasizing local intensity similarity while often overlooking\ncomprehensive and interpretable image quality assessment. To address these\nissues, we have developed a multi-marker similarity method that compares\nstandard quality markers, such as resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast,\nand high frequency components. The method computes a similarity score between\nthe image and the ground truth for each marker, then combines these scores into\nan overall similarity estimate. This provides a full-reference estimate of\nimage quality while extracting global quality features and detecting\nexperimental artifacts. Multi-marker similarity provides a reliable and\ninterpretable method for image quality assessment and the generation of quality\nrankings. By focusing on the comparison of quality markers rather than direct\nimage distances, the method enables reduced reference implementations, where a\nsingle field of view is used as a benchmark for multiple measurements.

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods have shown promise in learning chaotic dynamical\nsystems, enabling model-free short-term prediction and attractor\nreconstruction. However, when applied to large-scale, spatiotemporally chaotic\nsystems, purely data-driven machine learning methods often suffer from\ninefficiencies, as they require a large learning model size and a massive\namount of training data to achieve acceptable performance. To address this\nchallenge, we incorporate the spatial coupling structure of the target system\nas an inductive bias in the network design. Specifically, we introduce\nphysics-guided clustered echo state networks, leveraging the efficiency of the\necho state networks as a base model. Experimental results on benchmark chaotic\nsystems demonstrate that our physics-informed method outperforms existing echo\nstate network models in learning the target chaotic systems. Additionally, we\nnumerically demonstrate that leveraging coupling knowledge into ESN models can\nenhance their robustness to variations of training and target system\nconditions. We further show that our proposed model remains effective even when\nthe coupling knowledge is imperfect or extracted directly from time series\ndata. We believe this approach has the potential to enhance other\nmachine-learning methods.",

However, the inherent time\nvariance of many spatio-temporal systems poses challenges to achieving accurate\npredictions whenever stationarity is not granted. In order to address\nnon-stationarity, we propose a Distribution and Relation Adaptive Network\n(DRAN) capable of dynamically adapting to relation and distribution changes\nover time. While temporal normalization and de-normalization are frequently\nused techniques to adapt to distribution shifts, this operation is not suitable\nfor the spatio-temporal context as temporal normalization scales the time\nseries of nodes and possibly disrupts the spatial relations among nodes. In\norder to address this problem, a Spatial Factor Learner (SFL) module is\ndeveloped that enables the normalization and de-normalization process. To adapt\nto dynamic changes in spatial relationships among sensors, we propose a\nDynamic-Static Fusion Learner (DSFL) module that effectively integrates\nfeatures learned from both dynamic and static relations through an adaptive\nfusion ratio mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Stochastic Learner to\ncapture the noisy components of spatio-temporal representations. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on weather prediction and traffic flow\nforecasting tasks.Experimental results show that our SFL efficiently preserves\nspatial relationships across various temporal normalization operations.\nVisualizations of the learned dynamic and static relations demonstrate that\nDSFL can capture both local and distant relationships between nodes.",

Recent work has improved the\nstate-of-the-art of APR by fine-tuning pre-trained large language models\n(LLMs), such as CodeT5, for APR. However, the effectiveness of fine-tuning\nbecomes weakened in data scarcity scenarios, and data scarcity can be a common\nissue in practice, limiting fine-tuning performance. To alleviate this\nlimitation, this paper adapts prompt tuning for enhanced APR and conducts a\ncomprehensive study to evaluate its effectiveness in data scarcity scenarios,\nusing three LLMs of different sizes and six diverse datasets across four\nprogramming languages. Prompt tuning rewrites the input to a model by adding\nextra prompt tokens and tunes both the model and the prompts on a small\ndataset. These tokens provide task-specific knowledge that can improve the\nmodel for APR, which is especially critical in data scarcity scenarios.\nMoreover, domain knowledge has proven crucial in many code intelligence tasks,\nbut existing studies fail to leverage domain knowledge during the prompt tuning\nfor APR. To close this gap, we introduce knowledge prompt tuning, an approach\nthat adapts prompt tuning with six distinct types of code- or bug-related\ndomain knowledge for APR. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first\nto adapt and evaluate prompt tuning and the effectiveness of code- or\nbug-related domain knowledge for APR, particularly under data scarcity\nsettings.

    "abstract": "Conditional image synthesis is a crucial task with broad applications, such\nas artistic creation and virtual reality. However, current generative methods\nare often task-oriented with a narrow scope, handling a restricted condition\nwith constrained applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that\ntreats conditional image synthesis as the modular combination of diverse\nfundamental condition units. Specifically, we divide conditions into three\nprimary units: text, layout, and drag. To enable effective control over these\nconditions, we design a dedicated alignment module for each. For the text\ncondition, we introduce a Dense Concept Alignment (DCA) module, which achieves\ndense visual-text alignment by drawing on diverse textual concepts. For the\nlayout condition, we propose a Dense Geometry Alignment (DGA) module to enforce\ncomprehensive geometric constraints that preserve the spatial configuration.\nFor the drag condition, we introduce a Dense Motion Alignment (DMA) module to\napply multi-level motion regularization, ensuring that each pixel follows its\ndesired trajectory without visual artifacts. By flexibly inserting and\ncombining these alignment modules, our framework enhances the model's\nadaptability to diverse conditional generation tasks and greatly expands its\napplication range. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance\nof our framework across a variety of conditions, including textual description,\nsegmentation mask (bounding box), drag manipulation, and their combinations.\nCode is available at https://github.com/ZixuanWang0525/DADG.",

    "abstract": "The chemical deposition of high-performance Zinc Oxide (ZnO) thin films is\nchallenging, thus significant efforts have been devoted during the past decades\nto develop cost-effective, scalable fabrication methods in gas phase. This work\ndemonstrates how ultra-short-pulse Laser Beam Scanning (LBS) can be used to\nmodulate electrical conductivity in ZnO thin films deposited on soda-lime glass\nby Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition (SALD), a high-throughput, low-temperature\ndeposition technique suitable for large-area applications. By systematically\noptimizing laser parameters, including pulse energy and hatching distance,\nsignificant improvements in the electrical performance of 90 nm-thick ZnO films\nwere achieved. The optimization of the laser annealing parameters, 0.21\nuJ/pulse energy and a 1 micron hatching distance, yielded ZnO films with an\nelectrical resistivity of (9 +- 2) 10-2 Ohm cm, 3 orders of magnitude lower\nthan as deposited films. This result suggests that laser\npost-deposition-processing can play an important role in tailoring the\nproperties of ZnO thin films. Excessive laser intensity can compromise\nstructural integrity of the films, however, degrading their electrical\ntransport properties. Notably, the electrical resistance of laser-annealed ZnO\nfilms exhibited high sensitivity to oxygen concentration in the surrounding\natmosphere, suggesting exciting prospects for application in devices based on\ntransparent oxygen sensors. This study thus positions ultra-short pulsed laser\nannealing as a versatile post-deposition method for fine-tuning the properties\nof ZnO thin films, enabling their use in advanced optoelectronic and\ngas-sensing technologies, particularly on temperature-sensitive substrates.",

They learn 3D Gaussians from 2D RGB images generated from\npre-trained multi-view diffusion (MVD) models, and have shown a promising\navenue for 3D generation through a single image. Despite the current progress,\nthese methods still suffer from the inconsistency jointly caused by the\ngeometric ambiguity in the 2D images, and the lack of structure of 3D\nGaussians, leading to distorted and blurry 3D object generation. In this paper,\nwe propose to fix these issues by GS-RGBN, a new RGBN-volume Gaussian\nReconstruction Model designed to generate high-fidelity 3D objects from\nsingle-view images. Our key insight is a structured 3D representation can\nsimultaneously mitigate the afore-mentioned two issues. To this end, we propose\na novel hybrid Voxel-Gaussian representation, where a 3D voxel representation\ncontains explicit 3D geometric information, eliminating the geometric ambiguity\nfrom 2D images. It also structures Gaussians during learning so that the\noptimization tends to find better local optima. Our 3D voxel representation is\nobtained by a fusion module that aligns RGB features and surface normal\nfeatures, both of which can be estimated from 2D images.

To address this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, PROPHET,\nwhich comprises inferable forecasting questions paired with relevant news for\nretrieval. To ensure the inferability of the benchmark, we propose Causal\nIntervened Likelihood (CIL), a statistical measure that assesses inferability\nthrough causal inference. In constructing this benchmark, we first collected\nrecent trend forecasting questions and then filtered the data using CIL,\nresulting in an inferable benchmark for event prediction.

Through this framework, the term $\\nabla^2\nf(X_t)\\dot{X_t}$, known as the gradient-correction term, was found to be\nessential for reducing oscillations and accelerating the convergence rate of\nfunction values. Despite the importance of this term, simply adding it to the\nlow-resolution ODE may sometimes lead to a slower convergence rate. To fully\nunderstand this phenomenon, we propose a generalized perturbed ODE and analyze\nthe role of the gradient and gradient-correction perturbation terms under both\ncontinuous-time and discrete-time settings. We demonstrate that while the\ngradient-correction perturbation is essential for obtaining accelerations, it\ncan hinder the convergence rate of function values in certain cases.

This paper investigates\nthe feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and\nhow to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web\napplications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and\nfailing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and\npinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps,\nverifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using\nour benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed\nto a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best\nperforming implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation,\nSeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA\nimplementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement).\nHowever, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a\npromising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be\naddressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for\nrobust, low maintenance test automation.

In turn, a temporal\ngraph is often a much more realistic and accurate representation of a\nreal-world network. In this thesis we provide a definition for a shortcut set\nin a temporal graph and explore differences to classic shortcut sets. Utilizing\nthis definition, we show that temporal and regular shortcut sets yield the same\nresults on temporal paths, enabling the application of existing construction\nalgorithms for static shortcut sets on paths. The primary contribution of this\nthesis is a translation approach for general temporal graphs that utilizes the\nstatic expansion of a temporal graph, allowing the conversion of static\nshortcut sets into temporal shortcut sets, yielding similar results.",

    "abstract": "Egocentric interaction perception is one of the essential branches in\ninvestigating human-environment interaction, which lays the basis for\ndeveloping next-generation intelligent systems. However, existing egocentric\ninteraction understanding methods cannot yield coherent textual and pixel-level\nresponses simultaneously according to user queries, which lacks flexibility for\nvarying downstream application requirements. To comprehend egocentric\ninteractions exhaustively, this paper presents a novel task named Egocentric\nInteraction Reasoning and pixel Grounding (Ego-IRG). Taking an egocentric image\nwith the query as input, Ego-IRG is the first task that aims to resolve the\ninteractions through three crucial steps: analyzing, answering, and pixel\ngrounding, which results in fluent textual and fine-grained pixel-level\nresponses. Another challenge is that existing datasets cannot meet the\nconditions for the Ego-IRG task. To address this limitation, this paper creates\nthe Ego-IRGBench dataset based on extensive manual efforts, which includes over\n20k egocentric images with 1.6 million queries and corresponding multimodal\nresponses about interactions. Moreover, we design a unified ANNEXE model to\ngenerate text- and pixel-level outputs utilizing multimodal large language\nmodels, which enables a comprehensive interpretation of egocentric\ninteractions. The experiments on the Ego-IRGBench exhibit the effectiveness of\nour ANNEXE model compared with other works.",

Among\nthe various types of deepfakes, lip-syncing deepfakes are one of the most\nchallenging deepfakes to detect. In these videos, a person's lip movements are\nsynthesized to match altered or entirely new audio using AI models. Therefore,\nunlike other types of deepfakes, the artifacts in lip-syncing deepfakes are\nconfined to the mouth region, making them more subtle and, thus harder to\ndiscern. In this paper, we propose LIPINC-V2, a novel detection framework that\nleverages a combination of vision temporal transformer with multihead\ncross-attention to detect lip-syncing deepfakes by identifying spatiotemporal\ninconsistencies in the mouth region. These inconsistencies appear across\nadjacent frames and persist throughout the video. Our model can successfully\ncapture both short-term and long-term variations in mouth movement, enhancing\nits ability to detect these inconsistencies. Additionally, we created a new\nlip-syncing deepfake dataset, LipSyncTIMIT, which was generated using five\nstate-of-the-art lip-syncing models to simulate real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "The Sb$^{3+}$ ion has garnered significant interest due to its effectiveness\nin boosting the optical properties of host materials. Among the interesting\nphenomena is the commonly observed dual-band emission, which has often been\ninterpreted by adopting the phenomenological model that explains the dual-band\nemission (``ultraviolet band'' and ``visible band'') in Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$\n($L$ = Sc, Y, Lu). However, the model for Sb-doped $L$PO$_{4}$ series itself\nhas not been well understood theoretically. In this work, we employ\nfirst-principles calculations combined with group-theory analysis to clarify\nthe underlying physical mechanism behind dual-band emission in Sb-doped\n$L$PO$_{4}$ series. We demonstrate that the dual-band arises from two\nexcited-state equilibrium structures, one exhibits a relatively small\ndistortion with respect to the ground-state equilibrium structure, while the\nother displays a significantly larger distortion, characteristic of an\n``off-center'' configuration. The deviations from the ground-state\nconfiguration are dominated by two distinct vibrational modes, $b_2$ and $e$\nmodes, involving the Jahn-Teller effect and the pseudo Jahn-Teller effect,\nrespectively. Furthermore, charge transition levels and energy barriers\ncalculated using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method have\naided in understanding the relaxation between the two excited-state\nconfigurations and the property changes across the Sc, Y, and Lu series. These\ninsights provide a basis for understanding the exotic properties of Sb$^{3+}$\nin other hosts and may facilitate the design of optical materials in a broader\nrange of systems involving Sb$^{3+}$ ions.",

    "abstract": "In this work an analysis of the intracluster light (ICL) in the galaxy\ncluster SMACS J0723.3-7327 (hereafter, SMACS J0723) using JWST/NIRCam deep\nimaging in six filters (F090W to F444W) is presented. The images were processed\nfor low surface brightness (LSB) science, with additional correction for\ninstrumental scattering in the short-wavelength channels, and analysed using\nwavelet-based decomposition. The ICL, brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and\nsatellite galaxies were extracted and modelled, with 2D maps for each\ncomponent. ICL and ICL+BCG fractions, computed across all filters within a 400\nkpc radius, exhibit a flat trend with wavelength, averaging 28% and 34%,\nrespectively. Flux ratios between the BCG and the next brightest members\n(M$_{12}$, M$_{13}$ and M$_{14}$) also display minimal wavelength dependence.\nThese results indicate that SMACS J0723 is a dynamically evolved cluster with a\ndominant BCG and well-developed ICL. Five prominent ICL substructures are\nanalysed, contributing to 10-12% of the total ICL+BCG flux budget, slightly\nexceeding simulation predictions. Their short dynamical timescales suggest an\ninstantaneous ICL injection rate of several $10^3 L_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$,\nconsistent with active dynamical assembly. These findings support a scenario\nwhere SMACS J0723's ICL growth is currently driven by galaxy mergers involving\nthe BCG and other bright satellites, rather than by the accretion of\npre-processed ICL from a recent cluster merger. However, extrapolating the\ncurrent injection rate to the cluster's lifetime indicates that additional\nmechanisms are required to match the growth observed in other clusters over\ncosmic times.",

Previous studies reported that the presence of\ntinnitus is notably absent during dreams.

(2)\nMethods: For this observational study, 195 tinnitus patients answered an online\nsurvey on the mutual-help community Siopi. (3) Results: 160 patients could\nrecall their dreams. Among them, 92.5% state they do not hear their tinnitus\nwhile dreaming. The rest (7.5%) report higher tinnitus burden, higher stress\nand more often exhibit objective tinnitus and/or tinnitus related to peripheral\nauditory pathology and/or drug intake. 13% of the participants frequently\nexperience lucid dreams. Among them, 36% could perceive their tinnitus during\nlucid dreams, and this was strongly associated with the concomitant perception\nof external sounds during lucid dreaming. While the majority of patients report\nperceiving their tinnitus instantly upon awakening, during nocturnal\nawakenings, 18% declared they could be awakened by their tinnitus and 9.8%\nmentioned that their tinnitus can temporarily cease.

Inaccurate initial values can reduce initialization speed or lead\nto failure. When the system faces urgent tasks, robust and fast initialization\nis required while the robot is moving, such as during the swift assessment of\nrescue environments after natural disasters, bomb disposal, and restarting\nLiDAR-inertial SLAM in rescue missions. However, existing initialization\nmethods usually require the platform to remain stationary, which is ineffective\nwhen the robot is in motion. To address this issue, this paper introduces a\nrobust and fast dynamic initialization method for LiDAR-inertial systems\n(D-LI-Init). This method iteratively aligns LiDAR-based odometry with IMU\nmeasurements to achieve system initialization. To enhance the reliability of\nthe LiDAR odometry module, the LiDAR and gyroscope are tightly integrated\nwithin the ESIKF framework. The gyroscope compensates for rotational distortion\nin the point cloud. Translational distortion compensation occurs during the\niterative update phase, resulting in the output of LiDAR-gyroscope odometry.\nThe proposed method can initialize the system no matter the robot is moving or\nstationary. Experiments on public datasets and real-world environments\ndemonstrate that the D-LI-Init algorithm can effectively serve various\nplatforms, including vehicles, handheld devices, and UAVs.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate vision and other\nmodalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhance AI\ncapabilities but also introduce new security vulnerabilities. By exploiting the\nvulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution\ncharacteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking\nframework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in\nadvanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using\ntoken-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful\nintent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To\ncomprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is\nfurther proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs\npost-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions,\nPiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro\nVision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods. Experimental results\nhighlight the critical gaps in current defenses, underscoring the need for more\nrobust strategies to secure advanced MLLMs.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven crowd simulation models offer advantages in enhancing the\naccuracy and realism of simulations, and improving their generalizability is\nessential for promoting application. Current data-driven approaches are\nprimarily designed for a single scenario, with very few models validated across\nmore than two scenarios. It is still an open question to develop data-driven\ncrowd simulation models with strong generalizibility. We notice that the key to\naddressing this challenge lies in effectively and accurately capturing the core\ncommon influential features that govern pedestrians' navigation across diverse\nscenarios. Particularly, we believe that visual information is one of the most\ndominant influencing features. In light of this, this paper proposes a\ndata-driven model incorporating a refined visual information extraction method\nand exit cues to enhance generalizability. The proposed model is examined on\nfour common fundamental modules: bottleneck, corridor, corner and T-junction.\nThe evaluation results demonstrate that our model performs excellently across\nthese scenarios, aligning with pedestrian movement in real-world experiments,\nand significantly outperforms the classical knowledge-driven model.\nFurthermore, we introduce a modular approach to apply our proposed model in\ncomposite scenarios, and the results regarding trajectories and fundamental\ndiagrams indicate that our simulations closely match real-world patterns in the\ncomposite scenario. The research outcomes can provide inspiration for the\ndevelopment of data-driven crowd simulation models with high generalizability\nand advance the application of data-driven approaches.This work has been\nsubmitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Federated edge learning (FEL) leverages UAVs as mobile\nlearning agents to collect data, perform local model updates, and contribute to\nglobal model aggregation. However, existing UAV-assisted FEL systems face\ncritical challenges, including excessive computational demands, privacy risks,\nand inefficient communication, primarily due to the requirement for full-model\ntraining on resource-constrained UAVs. To deal with aforementioned challenges,\nwe propose Split Federated Learning for UAV-Enabled ISCC (SFLSCC), a novel\nframework that integrates split federated learning (SFL) into UAV-assisted FEL.\nSFLSCC optimally partitions model training between UAVs and edge servers,\nsignificantly reducing UAVs' computational burden while preserving data\nprivacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis of UAV deployment, split point\nselection, data sensing volume, and client-side aggregation frequency, deriving\nclosed-form upper bounds for the convergence gap. Based on these insights, we\nconceive a joint optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption\nrequired to achieve a target model accuracy. Given the non-convex nature of the\nproblem, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to efficiently determine UAV\ndeployment, split point selection, and communication frequency. Extensive\nsimulations on a target motion recognition task validate the effectiveness of\nSFLSCC, demonstrating superior convergence performance and energy efficiency\ncompared to baseline methods.",

In this\ncase there exists a set of isolated structural parameter points that are\nobservationally equivalent under the imposed restrictions. Although the data do\nnot inform us which observationally equivalent point should be selected, the\ncommon frequentist practice is to obtain one as a maximum likelihood estimate\nand perform impulse response analysis accordingly. For Bayesians, the lack of\nglobal identification translates to non-vanishing sensitivity of the posterior\nto the prior, and the multi-modal likelihood gives rise to computational\nchallenges as posterior sampling algorithms can fail to explore all the modes.\nThis paper overcomes these challenges by proposing novel estimation and\ninference procedures. We characterize a class of identifying restrictions and\ncircumstances that deliver local but non-global identification, and the\nresulting number of observationally equivalent parameter values. We propose\nalgorithms to exhaustively compute all admissible structural parameters given\nreduced-form parameters and utilize them to sample from the multi-modal\nposterior.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing (QC) emulators, which simulate quantum algorithms on\nclassical hardware, are indispensable platforms for testing quantum algorithms\nbefore scalable quantum computers become widely available. A critical challenge\nin QC emulation is managing numerical errors from finite arithmetic precision,\nespecially truncation errors in resource-efficient fixed-point arithmetic.\nDespite its importance, systematic studies quantifying how truncation errors\nimpact quantum algorithm accuracy are limited. In this paper, we propose a\nrigorous quantitative framework analyzing truncation error propagation in\nfixed-point QC emulation, focusing on Grover's quantum search algorithm. First,\nwe introduce a simplified two-value amplitude representation of quantum states\nduring Grover's iterations and prove its theoretical validity. Using this\nrepresentation, we derive explicit mathematical expressions characterizing\ntruncation error accumulation across quantum gate operations. We quantify the\noverall emulation error by the $\\ell_2$ distance between ideal and emulated\nprobability distributions, obtaining asymptotic bounds scaling as $O(2^{n-f})$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of qubits and $f$ is fractional-bit precision.\nExtensive numerical simulations and empirical experiments on a practical\nfixed-point QC emulator confirm that observed errors precisely match our\ntheoretical predictions. Finally, we provide a closed-form formula to determine\nthe minimal fractional-bit precision required to achieve a specified error\nthreshold, offering clear guidelines for emulator designers balancing accuracy\nand resource utilization.",

Most existing methods feed textual descriptions of the graph\nstructure or neighbouring nodes' text directly into LLMs. However, these\napproaches often cause LLMs to treat structural information simply as general\ncontextual text, thus limiting their effectiveness in graph-related tasks. In\nthis paper, we introduce LanSAGNN (Language Semantic Anisotropic Graph Neural\nNetwork), a framework that extends the concept of anisotropic GNNs to the\nnatural language level.

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) shows its great importance in\nimaging microvascular networks by providing accurate 3D imaging of blood\nvessels, but it relies upon specialized sensors and expensive devices. For this\nreason, previous works show the potential to translate the readily available 3D\nOptical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into 3D OCTA images. However,\nexisting OCTA translation methods directly learn the mapping from the OCT\ndomain to the OCTA domain in continuous and infinite space with guidance from\nonly a single view, i.e., the OCTA project map, resulting in suboptimal\nresults. To this end, we propose the multi-view Tri-alignment framework for OCT\nto OCTA 3D image translation in discrete and finite space, named MuTri. In the\nfirst stage, we pre-train two vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-\nVAE) by reconstructing 3D OCT and 3D OCTA data, providing semantic prior for\nsubsequent multi-view guidances. In the second stage, our multi-view\ntri-alignment facilitates another VQVAE model to learn the mapping from the OCT\ndomain to the OCTA domain in discrete and finite space. Specifically, a\ncontrastive-inspired semantic alignment is proposed to maximize the mutual\ninformation with the pre-trained models from OCT and OCTA views, to facilitate\ncodebook learning. Meanwhile, a vessel structure alignment is proposed to\nminimize the structure discrepancy with the pre-trained models from the OCTA\nproject map view, benefiting from learning the detailed vessel structure\ninformation. We also collect the first large-scale dataset, namely, OCTA2024,\nwhich contains a pair of OCT and OCTA volumes from 846 subjects.",

This raises\nquestions on their progenitors and mass-loss processes shortly before the\nexplosion. Recently, the bright long-lived Type~II SN 2021irp was proposed to\nbe a standard Type II SN interacting with disk-like CSM. The observational\nproperties suggest that the progenitor was a massive star in a binary system\nand underwent a mass-ejection process due to the binary interaction just before\nthe explosion. Here, we study the diversity of the observational properties of\nbright long-lived Type II (21irp-like) SNe. We analyse the diversity of their\nCSM properties, in order to understand their progenitors and mass-loss\nmechanisms and their relations with the other types of interacting SNe. We\nperformed photometry, spectroscopy, and/or polarimetry for four 21irp-like SNe.\nBased on these observations as well as published data of SN~2021irp itself and\nwell-observed bright and long-lived type II SNe including SNe~2010jl, 2015da\nand 2017hcc, we discuss their CSM characteristics. This sample of SNe shows\nluminous and long-lived photometric evolution, with some variations in the\nphotometric evolution (from $\\sim-17$ to $\\sim-20$ absolute mag in the $r$/$o$\nband even at $\\sim 200$ days after the explosion). They show photospheric\nspectra characterized mainly by Balmer lines for several hundreds of days, with\nsome variations in the shapes of the lines. They show high polarization with\nslight variations in the polarization degrees with rapid declines with time\n(from $\\sim3-6$ \\% before the peak to $\\sim1$ \\% at $\\sim200$ days after the\npeak).

While GB segregation has been reported to assist austenite\nnucleation in medium manganese steels (3-12 wt.% Mn), an understanding of the\ntemperature and misorientation dependance is lacking, which is the aim of\ncurrent work. Since artifacts of atom probe can cause a broadening of the\nsegregation width, we combined experiments with results from density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations that reveal that the Mn segregation is not limited to\nthe GB plane but confined to a region in the range of approximately 1 nm.\nConsequently, GB segregation alters both the GB interface energy and the free\nenergy per unit volume corresponding to the transformation. We estimate the\nlocal driving force for austenite nucleation accounting for the segregation\nwidth of ~ 1 nm.

This paper introduces a novel algorithm for motion planning in\ncrowded spaces by combining social force principles for simulating realistic\npedestrian behavior with a risk-aware motion planner.

This study has not taken into\nconsideration real-time constraints and has been shown only in simulation so\nfar.

Researchers have proposed many\nvariants to enhance the SZZ algorithm's performance since its introduction. The\nmajority of them rely on static techniques or heuristic assumptions, making\nthem easy to implement, but their performance improvements are often limited.\nRecently, a deep learning-based SZZ algorithm has been introduced to enhance\nthe original SZZ algorithm. However, it requires complex preprocessing and is\nrestricted to a single programming language. Additionally, while it enhances\nprecision, it sacrifices recall. Furthermore, most of variants overlook crucial\ninformation, such as commit messages and patch context, and are limited to\nbug-fixing commits involving deleted lines. The emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs) offers an opportunity to address these drawbacks. In this study,\nwe investigate the strengths and limitations of LLMs and propose LLM4SZZ, which\nemploys two approaches (i.e., rank-based identification and context-enhanced\nidentification) to handle different types of bug-fixing commits. We determine\nwhich approach to adopt based on the LLM's ability to comprehend the bug and\nidentify whether the bug is present in a commit. The context-enhanced\nidentification provides the LLM with more context and requires it to find the\nbug-inducing commit among a set of candidate commits. In rank-based\nidentification, we ask the LLM to select buggy statements from the bug-fixing\ncommit and rank them based on their relevance to the root cause.

Furthermore, when queries contain numerous\nattributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it\ndifficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall\nefficiency.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce\nretrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM\nemploys joint training on text information from both queries and products to\ngenerate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between\nqueries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between\nqueries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a\nco-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval\nefficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to\ncompare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval\nefficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM\nsignificantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative\nretrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.",

In this paper, we\nestablish two key principles for AIGI detection through systematic analysis:\n(1) All Patches Matter: Unlike conventional image classification where\ndiscriminative features concentrate on object-centric regions, each patch in\nAIGIs inherently contains synthetic artifacts due to the uniform generation\nprocess, suggesting that every patch serves as an important artifact source for\ndetection. (2) More Patches Better: Leveraging distributed artifacts across\nmore patches improves detection robustness by capturing complementary forensic\nevidence and reducing over-reliance on specific patches, thereby enhancing\nrobustness and generalization. However, our counterfactual analysis reveals an\nundesirable phenomenon: naively trained detectors often exhibit a Few-Patch\nBias, discriminating between real and synthetic images based on minority\npatches. We identify Lazy Learner as the root cause: detectors preferentially\nlearn conspicuous artifacts in limited patches while neglecting broader\nartifact distributions. To address this bias, we propose the Panoptic Patch\nLearning (PPL) framework, involving: (1) Random Patch Replacement that randomly\nsubstitutes synthetic patches with real counterparts to compel models to\nidentify artifacts in underutilized regions, encouraging the broader use of\nmore patches; (2) Patch-wise Contrastive Learning that enforces consistent\ndiscriminative capability across all patches, ensuring uniform utilization of\nall patches.

For\nAFM interactions, the eigenspectrum reveals the presence of both stable and\nunstable avoided crossings (UAC), with the first-excited branch undergoing a\ndouble unstable avoided crossing. In contrast, with ferromagnetic interactions,\nonly a single UAC, which occurs between the low-lying and first-excited\nbranches, is observed. Furthermore, the eigenvectors demonstrate the transition\nfrom density-like to spin-like behaviour, as the collective excitation shows\nthe transition from stable to unstable mode for both the FM and AFM\ninteractions.

Our analysis suggests that spin-orbit coupling enhances the\ninstability gain, while Rabi coupling plays the opposite role.

    "abstract": "De novo molecular design has extensive applications in drug discovery and\nmaterials science. The vast chemical space renders direct molecular searches\ncomputationally prohibitive, while traditional experimental screening is both\ntime- and labor-intensive. Efficient molecular generation and screening methods\nare therefore essential for accelerating drug discovery and reducing costs.\nAlthough reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to optimize molecular\nproperties via reward mechanisms, its practical utility is limited by issues in\ntraining efficiency, convergence, and stability. To address these challenges,\nwe adopt Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) from NLP, which uses molecular\nscore-based sample pairs to maximize the likelihood difference between high-\nand low-quality molecules, effectively guiding the model toward better\ncompounds. Moreover, integrating curriculum learning further boosts training\nefficiency and accelerates convergence. A systematic evaluation of the proposed\nmethod on the GuacaMol Benchmark yielded excellent scores. For instance, the\nmethod achieved a score of 0.883 on the Perindopril MPO task, representing a\n6\\% improvement over competing models. And subsequent target protein binding\nexperiments confirmed its practical efficacy. These results demonstrate the\nstrong potential of DPO for molecular design tasks and highlight its\neffectiveness as a robust and efficient solution for data-driven drug\ndiscovery.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown promising\nperformance in domain-specific data (e.g., biology), and has attracted\nincreasing research attention. Existing works generally focus on collecting\nextensive domain-specific data and directly tuning the original CLIP models.\nIntuitively, such a paradigm takes no full consideration of the characteristics\nlying in domain-specific data (e.g., fine-grained nature of biological data)\nand so limits model capability, while mostly losing the original ability of\nCLIP in the general domain. In this paper, we propose a Distribution\nAlignment-based Language-Image Pre-Training (DALIP) method for biological data.\nSpecifically, DALIP optimizes CLIP models by matching the similarity between\nfeature distribution of image-text pairs instead of the original [cls] token,\nwhich can capture rich yet effective information inherent in image-text pairs\nas powerful representations, and so better cope with fine-grained nature of\nbiological data. Particularly, our DALIP efficiently approximates feature\ndistribution via its first- and second-order statistics, while presenting a\nMulti-head Brownian Distance Covariance (MBDC) module to acquire second-order\nstatistics of token features efficiently. Furthermore, we collect a new dataset\nfor plant domain (e.g., specific data in biological domain) comprising 10M\nplant data with 3M general-domain data (namely PlantMix-13M) according to data\nmixing laws. Extensive experiments show that DALIP clearly outperforms existing\nCLIP counterparts in biological domain, while well generalizing to remote\nsensing and medical imaging domains. Besides, our PlantMix-13M dataset further\nboosts performance of DALIP in plant domain, while preserving model ability in\ngeneral domain.",

Existing works have shown that vanilla visual networks are biased\ntoward learning appearance information, \\eg texture, to recognize objects. This\nimplicit bias causes the model to fail in detecting novel objects with unseen\ntextures in the open-world setting. To address this challenge, we propose a\nlearning framework, called view-Consistent LeaRning (v-CLR), which aims to\nenforce the model to learn appearance-invariant representations for robust\ninstance segmentation. In v-CLR, we first introduce additional views for each\nimage, where the texture undergoes significant alterations while preserving the\nimage's underlying structure. We then encourage the model to learn the\nappearance-invariant representation by enforcing the consistency between object\nfeatures across different views, for which we obtain class-agnostic object\nproposals using off-the-shelf unsupervised models that possess strong\nobject-awareness. These proposals enable cross-view object feature matching,\ngreatly reducing the appearance dependency while enhancing the\nobject-awareness.

It has attracted\nwidespread attention in recent years and has been applied in various domains,\nsuch as deep learning compiler construction. Recently, several MLIR compiler\nfuzzing techniques, such as MLIRSmith and MLIRod, have been proposed. However,\nnone of them can detect silent bugs, i.e., bugs that incorrectly optimize code\nsilently. The difficulty in detecting silent bugs arises from two main aspects:\n(1) UB-Free Program Generation: Ensures the generated programs are free from\nundefined behaviors to suit the non-UB assumptions required by compiler\noptimizations. (2) Lowering Support: Converts the given MLIR program into an\nexecutable form, enabling execution result comparisons, and selects a suitable\nlowering path for the program to reduce redundant lowering pass and improve the\nefficiency of fuzzing. To address the above issues, we propose DESIL. DESIL\nenables silent bug detection by defining a set of UB-elimination rules based on\nthe MLIR documentation and applying them to input programs to produce UB-free\nMLIR programs. To convert dialects in MLIR program into the executable form,\nDESIL designs a lowering path optimization strategy to convert the dialects in\ngiven MLIR program into executable form. Furthermore, DESIL incorporates the\ndifferential testing for silent bug detection. To achieve this, it introduces\nan operation-aware optimization recommendation strategy into the compilation\nprocess to generate diverse executable files. We applied DESIL to the latest\nrevisions of the MLIR compiler infrastructure. It detected 23 silent bugs and\n19 crash bugs, of which 12/14 have been confirmed or fixed",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models generate high-quality images through progressive denoising\nbut are computationally intensive due to large model sizes and repeated\nsampling. Knowledge distillation, which transfers knowledge from a complex\nteacher to a simpler student model, has been widely studied in recognition\ntasks, particularly for transferring concepts unseen during student training.\nHowever, its application to diffusion models remains underexplored, especially\nin enabling student models to generate concepts not covered by the training\nimages. In this work, we propose Random Conditioning, a novel approach that\npairs noised images with randomly selected text conditions to enable efficient,\nimage-free knowledge distillation. By leveraging this technique, we show that\nthe student can generate concepts unseen in the training images. When applied\nto conditional diffusion model distillation, our method allows the student to\nexplore the condition space without generating condition-specific images,\nresulting in notable improvements in both generation quality and efficiency.\nThis promotes resource-efficient deployment of generative diffusion models,\nbroadening their accessibility for both research and real-world applications.\nCode, models, and datasets are available at\nhttps://dohyun-as.github.io/Random-Conditioning .",

    "abstract": "This paper elucidates the dual structure of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger dynamics in\ntwo correlated stages: (1) We first derive the real-valued Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation from scratch without referring to classical mechanics, wave mechanics,\nnor optics, and thereby attain a concrete and clear interpretation of the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger (wave) function. Beginning with a factorization of the density\ndistribution function of the particles to two component vectors in\nconfiguration space, we impose very simple conditions on them such as\ntranslational invariance of space-time and the conservation of flux under a\ngiven potential function. A real-valued path-integral is formulated as a Green\nfunction for the real-valued Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. (2) We then study a\nquantum stochastic path dynamics in a manner compatible with the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation. The relation between them is like the Langevin\ndynamics with the diffusion equation. Each quantum path describes a\n\\textquotedblleft trajectory\\textquotedblright\\ in configuration space\nrepresenting, for instance, a singly launched electron in the double-slit\nexperiment that leaves a spot one by one at the measurement board, while\naccumulated spots give rise to the fringe pattern as predicted by the absolute\nsquare of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger function. We start from the relationship between\nthe Ito stochastic differential equation, the Feynman-Kac formula, and the\nassociated parabolic partial differential equations, to one of which\\ the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation is transformed. The physical significance of the\nquantum intrinsic stochasticity and the indirect correlation among the quantum\npaths and so on are discussed. The self-referential nonlinear interrelationship\nbetween the Schr\\\"{o}dinger functions (regarded as a whole) and the quantum\npaths (as its parts) is identified as the ultimate mystery in quantum dynamics.",

For example,\nmodern network telemetry systems that take advantage of existing data plane\ntechnologies for line rate traffic monitoring and processing cannot afford to\nwaste precious data plane resources on traffic that comes from \"uninteresting\"\nregions of the IP address space. However, there is currently no\nwell-established structural model or analysis toolbox that enables a\nfirst-principles approach to the specific problem of identifying\n\"uninteresting\" regions of the address space or the myriad of other networking\nproblems that prominently feature IP addresses.\n  To address this key missing piece, we present in this paper a\nfirst-of-its-kind empirically validated physical explanation for why the\nobserved IP address structure in measured Internet traffic is multifractal in\nnature. Our root cause analysis overcomes key limitations of mostly forgotten\nfindings from ~20 years ago and demonstrates that the Internet processes and\nmechanisms responsible for how IP addresses are allocated, assigned, and used\nin today's Internet are consistent with and well modeled by a class of\nevocative mathematical models called conservative cascades. We complement this\nroot cause analysis with the development of an improved toolbox that is\ntailor-made for analyzing finite and discrete sets of IP addresses and includes\nstatistical estimators that engender high confidence in the inferences they\nproduce. We illustrate the use of this toolbox in the context of a novel\naddress structure anomaly detection method we designed and conclude with a\ndiscussion of a range of challenging open networking problems that are\nmotivated or inspired by our findings.",

    "abstract": "Machine fault diagnosis (FD) is a critical task for predictive maintenance,\nenabling early fault detection and preventing unexpected failures. Despite its\nimportance, existing FD models are operation-specific with limited\ngeneralization across diverse datasets. Foundation models (FM) have\ndemonstrated remarkable potential in both visual and language domains,\nachieving impressive generalization capabilities even with minimal data through\nfew-shot or zero-shot learning. However, translating these advances to FD\npresents unique hurdles. Unlike the large-scale, cohesive datasets available\nfor images and text, FD datasets are typically smaller and more heterogeneous,\nwith significant variations in sampling frequencies and the number of channels\nacross different systems and applications. This heterogeneity complicates the\ndesign of a universal architecture capable of effectively processing such\ndiverse data while maintaining robust feature extraction and learning\ncapabilities. In this paper, we introduce UniFault, a foundation model for\nfault diagnosis that systematically addresses these issues. Specifically, the\nmodel incorporates a comprehensive data harmonization pipeline featuring two\nkey innovations. First, a unification scheme transforms multivariate inputs\ninto standardized univariate sequences while retaining local inter-channel\nrelationships. Second, a novel cross-domain temporal fusion strategy mitigates\ndistribution shifts and enriches sample diversity and count, improving the\nmodel generalization across varying conditions. UniFault is pretrained on over\n9 billion data points spanning diverse FD datasets, enabling superior few-shot\nperformance. Extensive experiments on real-world FD datasets demonstrate that\nUniFault achieves SoTA performance, setting a new benchmark for fault diagnosis\nmodels and paving the way for more scalable and robust predictive maintenance\nsolutions.",

Studying the performance and behavior of compressed\nLRMs, we report their performance scores and test-time compute (number of\ntokens spent on each question). Notably, using MuSiQue, we find that parameter\ncount has a much greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than on their\nreasoning capability, which can inform the choice of compression techniques.\nThrough our empirical analysis of test-time compute, we find that shorter model\noutputs generally achieve better performance than longer ones across several\nbenchmarks for both R1 and its compressed variants, highlighting the need for\nmore concise reasoning chains.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to\ntraditional static program analysis methods, such as symbolic execution,\noffering the ability to reason over code directly without relying on theorem\nprovers or SMT solvers. However, LLMs are also inherently probabilistic by\nnature, and therefore face significant challenges in relation to the accuracy\nand scale of the analysis in real-world application. Such issues often\nnecessitate the use of larger LLMs with higher token limits, but this requires\nenterprise-grade hardware (GPUs) and thus limits accessibility for many users.\n  In this paper, we propose LLM-based symbolic execution -- a novel approach\nthat enhances LLM inference via a path-based decomposition of the program\nanalysis tasks into smaller (more tractable) sub-tasks. The core idea is to\ngeneralize path constraints using a generic code-based representation that the\nLLM can directly reason over, and without translation into another\n(less-expressive) formal language. We implement our approach in the form of\nAutoExe, an LLM-based symbolic execution engine that is lightweight and\nlanguage-agnostic, making it a practical tool for analyzing code that is\nchallenging for traditional approaches. We show that AutoExe can improve both\nthe accuracy and scale of LLM-based program analysis, especially for smaller\nLLMs that can run on consumer grade hardware.",

The system comprises an edge server and multiple\nclients, collaborating to minimize a global loss function. In each\ncommunication round, clients perform local training, modulate their gradient\nupdates onto a set of shared orthogonal waveforms, and simultaneously transmit\nthe analog signals to the edge server. The edge server then extracts a noisy\naggregated gradient from the received radio signal, updates the global model,\nand broadcasts it to the clients for the next round of local computing. Despite\nenabling all clients to upload information in every communication round, the\nsystem is constrained by the limited number of available waveform carriers,\nallowing only a subset of gradient parameters to be transmitted. To address\nthis issue, our method maintains an age vector on the edge server, tracking the\ntime elapsed since each coordinate of the global model was last updated. The\nserver leverages this information to prioritize gradient entries for\ntransmission, ensuring that outdated yet significant parameters are updated\nmore frequently.

It\nis implemented as a probabilistic framework using Stochastic Variational\nInference to efficiently optimize the numerous parameters involved in the\nmodel.\n  The methodology was tested through a simplified simulation designed after the\nGalactic center survey of the JASMINE mission. This simulation, called the\nJASMINE mini-mock survey, covered three years of observation with 100 satellite\norbits, providing a comprehensive dataset for evaluating the performance of\nPlate Analysis. Although the observation model incorporated more than 30,000\nparameters, the parameters were efficiently optimized through Plate Analysis.\nThe results showed that the estimated coordinates closely match the expected\nstellar motions, with an average positional error of about $70\\,\\mathrm{\\mu\nas}$. These findings validate the potential of Plate Analysis for precise\nwide-field astrometric applications, offering significant insights into\nimproving the accuracy of stellar dynamics measurements.",

However, legal documents differ from the web-based text that underlies\nmost AI systems. The challenges of legal AI are both specific to the legal\ndomain, and confounded with the expectation of AI's high performance in\nhigh-stakes settings. We identify three areas of special relevance to\npractitioners: data curation, data annotation, and output verification. First,\nit is difficult to obtain usable legal texts. Legal collections are\ninconsistent, analog, and scattered for reasons technical, economic, and\njurisdictional. AI tools can assist document curation efforts, but the lack of\nexisting data also limits AI performance. Second, legal data annotation\ntypically requires significant expertise to identify complex phenomena such as\nmodes of judicial reasoning or controlling precedents. We describe case studies\nof AI systems that have been developed to improve the efficiency of human\nannotation in legal contexts and identify areas of underperformance. Finally,\nAI-supported work in the law is valuable only if results are verifiable and\ntrustworthy. We describe both the abilities of AI systems to support evaluation\nof their outputs, as well as new approaches to systematic evaluation of\ncomputational systems in complex domains.

In real-world\nimage retrieval scenarios, both query and database images often exhibit\ncomplexity, with multiple objects and intricate backgrounds. Users often want\nto retrieve images with specific object, which we define as the Focus-Oriented\nImage Retrieval (FOIR) task. While a standard image encoder can be employed to\nextract image features for similarity matching, it may not perform optimally in\nthe multi-object-based FOIR task. This is because each image is represented by\na single global feature vector. To overcome this, a prompt-based image\nretrieval solution is required. We propose an approach called Prompt-guided\nattention Head Selection (PHS) to leverage the head-wise potential of the\nmulti-head attention mechanism in ViT in a promptable manner. PHS selects\nspecific attention heads by matching their attention maps with user's visual\nprompts, such as a point, box, or segmentation. This empowers the model to\nfocus on specific object of interest while preserving the surrounding visual\ncontext.

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has successfully scaled up models while maintaining\nnearly constant computing costs. By employing a gating network to route input\ntokens, it selectively activates a subset of expert networks to process the\ncorresponding token embeddings. However, in practice, the efficiency of MoE is\nchallenging to achieve due to two key reasons: imbalanced expert activation,\nwhich leads to substantial idle time during model or expert parallelism, and\ninsufficient capacity utilization; massive communication overhead, induced by\nnumerous expert routing combinations in expert parallelism at the system level.\nPrevious works typically formulate it as the load imbalance issue characterized\nby the gating network favoring certain experts over others or attribute it to\nstatic execution which fails to adapt to the dynamic expert workload at\nruntime. In this paper, we exploit it from a brand new perspective, a\nhigher-order view and analysis of MoE routing policies: expert collaboration\nand specialization where some experts tend to activate broadly with others\n(collaborative), while others are more likely to activate only with a specific\nsubset of experts (specialized). Our experiments reveal that most experts tend\nto be overly collaborative, leading to increased communication overhead from\nrepeatedly sending tokens to different accelerators. To this end, we propose a\nnovel collaboration-constrained routing (C2R) strategy to encourage more\nspecialized expert groups, as well as to improve expert utilization, and\npresent an efficient implementation of MoE that further leverages expert\nspecialization. We achieve an average performance improvement of 0.51% and\n0.33% on LLaMA-MoE and Qwen-MoE respectively across ten downstream NLP\nbenchmarks, and reduce the all2all communication costs between GPUs, bringing\nan extra 20%-30% total running time savings on top of the existing SoTA, i.e.\nMegaBlocks.",

The scene\ndynamics model is responsible for estimating the desired vehicle trajectory, as\nwell as to adjust the true system model used by the underlying model predictive\ncontroller.

In this paper, we aim to maximize the\nweighted sum rate (WSR) in the RDARS-aided mmWave system. To take advantage of\nRDARS, we first design a reconfigurable codebook (RCB) in which the number and\ndimension of the codeword can be flexibly adjusted. Then, a low overhead beam\ntraining scheme based on hierarchical search is proposed. Accordingly, the\nactive and passive beamforming for data transmission is designed to achieve the\nmaximum WSR for both space-division multiple access (SDMA) and time-division\nmultiple access (TDMA) schemes. For the TDMA scheme, the optimal number of\nRDARS transmit elements and the allocated power budget for WSR maximization are\nderived in closed form. Besides, the superiority of the RDARS is verified and\nthe conditions under which RDARS outperforms RIS and DAS are given. For the\nSDMA scheme, we characterize the relationship between the number of RDARS\nconnected elements and the user distribution, followed by the derivation of the\noptimal placement positions of the RDARS transmit elements.

However, as\nnondominated solutions of a multi-objective optimisation problem can be\nenormous or infinitely many, it is desirable to provide the decision-maker with\nonly a small, representative portion of all the nondominated solutions in the\narchive, thus entailing a truncation operation. Then, an important issue is\nwhen to truncate the archive. This can be done once a new solution generated, a\nbatch of new solutions generated, or even using an unbounded archive to keep\nall nondominated solutions generated and truncate it later. Intuitively, the\nlast approach may lead to a better result since we have all the information in\nhand before performing the truncation. In this paper, we study this issue and\ninvestigate the effect of the timing of truncating the archive. We apply\nwell-established truncation criteria that are commonly used in the population\nmaintenance procedure of MOEAs (e.g., crowding distance, hypervolume indicator,\nand decomposition). We show that, interestingly, truncating the archive once a\nnew solution generated tends to be the best, whereas considering an unbounded\narchive is often the worst.

Extensive experiments on three standard\nbenchmarks using three mainstream backbone networks demonstrate that CFMD\nachieves substantial improvements in pixel-level accuracy and boundary\nsegmentation quality, especially in complex scenes.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a topological framework to describe global dynamics under\nfinite-energy perturbations, focusing on escapes from attracting basins,\nelimination of stagnation, and persistence of recurrent behaviors governed by\nfinite total or stepwise energy. To this end, we introduce generalized concepts\nof chain recurrence and construct corresponding filtrations for dynamical\nsystems on metric spaces. These filtrations refine Conley's classical theory\nand enable the quantitative modeling of dynamical behaviors under bounded\nenergy inputs. In particular, we introduce concepts of \"coarse chain\nrecurrences\" and Morse graphs with finite errors, which yield bifurcation\ndiagrams depicting how chain recurrent components evolve as perturbation scales\nincrease. Our framework also reveals singular limits, where the total injected\nenergy vanishes. The framework applies to both maps and semiflows, providing\ntools to analyze robustness, sensitivity, and structural evolution of recurrent\ndynamics. Applications include toy models of flow control and circulation\nmaintained under finite-energy constraints.",

However, most of the existing VL\ntrackers rely on carefully designed mechanisms to perform the multi-stage\nmulti-modal fusion. Additionally, direct multi-modal fusion without alignment\nignores distribution discrepancy between modalities in feature space,\npotentially leading to suboptimal representations. In this work, we propose\nCOST, a contrastive one-stage transformer fusion framework for VL tracking,\naiming to learn semantically consistent and unified VL representations.\nSpecifically, we introduce a contrastive alignment strategy that maximizes\nmutual information (MI) between a video and its corresponding language\ndescription. This enables effective cross-modal alignment, yielding\nsemantically consistent features in the representation space. By leveraging a\nvisual-linguistic transformer, we establish an efficient multi-modal fusion and\nreasoning mechanism, empirically demonstrating that a simple stack of\ntransformer encoders effectively enables unified VL representations. Moreover,\nwe contribute a newly collected VL tracking benchmark dataset for small object\ntracking, named VL-SOT500, with bounding boxes and language descriptions. Our\ndataset comprises two challenging subsets, VL-SOT230 and VL-SOT270, dedicated\nto evaluating generic and high-speed small object tracking, respectively. Small\nobject tracking is notoriously challenging due to weak appearance and limited\nfeatures, and this dataset is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to\nexplore the usage of language cues to enhance visual representation for small\nobject tracking.

In this study, we developed a 1-D radiative transfer model for\nplanetary and solar radiation in a proto-atmosphere composed of H2O and H2, and\na coupled thermal evolution model of a planetary interior and proto-atmosphere,\nto investigate the scattering blanketing effect on planetary radiation and\nmagma ocean cooling. Our results show that Rayleigh scattering significantly\nreduces outgoing planetary radiation at wavelengths below ~1 micrometer,\nparticularly in hot, thick atmospheres where scattering is highly effective.\nConsequently, the planetary outgoing radiation flux decreases by up to about\none to two orders of magnitude, and the magma ocean lifetime is prolonged by up\nto about three times due to the scattering blanketing effect when the total\namounts of H2O and H2 are equivalent to or greater than the present-day\nterrestrial seawater. These findings suggest that the prolonged magma ocean\nphase facilitated efficient differentiation between compatible and incompatible\nelements, even in the lower mantle.

In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training\ncauses critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple\nperturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose\nRobust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned\nimage-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack\nsuccess rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger\noptimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM,\nleveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into\nGaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety\nfine-tuning.

In this study, we have\nperformed comprehensive high-pressure neutron powder diffraction (NPD)\nexperiments on FGT up to 5 GPa, to investigate the evolution of its structural\nand magnetic properties with hydrostatic pressure.

It integrates an advanced GAMENet model enhanced\nwith Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Multi-Head Cross-Attention (MHCA) while\nensuring user privacy through federated learning. This paper outlines the\nconceptual design and architecture of HERMES, with a focus on deployment in\nhigh-traffic public areas. Methods: HERMES analyzes self-reported symptoms and\nanonymized medical histories using AI algorithms to generate context-aware OTC\nmedication recommendations. The system was initially trained using Electronic\nHealth Records (EHR) from the MIMIC-III dataset (6,350 patients) and Drug-Drug\nInteraction (DDI) data from the TWOSIDES database, incorporating the top 90\nseverity DDI types. Real-time DDI checks and ATC-mapped drug codes further\nimprove safety. The kiosk is designed for accessibility, offering multilingual\nsupport, large fonts, voice commands, and Braille compatibility. A built-in\nhealth education library promotes preventive care and health literacy. A survey\nwas conducted among 10 medical professionals to evaluate its potential\napplications in medicine. Results: Preliminary results show that the enhanced\nGAMENet model achieved a Precision-Recall AUC (PRAUC) of 0.74, outperforming\nthe original model. These findings suggest a strong potential for delivering\naccurate and secure healthcare recommendations in public settings. Conclusion:\nHERMES demonstrates how AI-driven, privacy-preserving kiosks can enhance public\nhealth access, empower users, and alleviate burdens on healthcare systems.\nFuture work will focus on real-world deployment, usability testing, and\nscalability for broader adoption.",

By\napplying a model of primeval dust, we estimate the far-infrared (FIR)-continuum\nluminosities for galaxies of different masses at redshifts $z\\gtrsim7$. In\nparticular, we predict observed fluxes for different available bands (3-10) of\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-mm Array (ALMA), considering typical\nconservative values expected for the properties of first galaxies (e.g.,\ngas-phase metallicities, dust-to-metal ratio, star formation efficiency). As\nexpected, FIR fluxes increase with stellar mass for all ALMA bands, but with a\nsteeper slope for bands 9 and 10. Encouragingly, first galaxies are affected by\na strong negative-K correction, in such a way that sources with similar\nproperties are brighter in bands 3-8 at higher redshifts. Such behavior is\nstronger for bands 6-7. Although the trends for bands 9-10 are not clear, the\nhighest fluxes for such bands are reached towards extreme $z\\gtrsim 15$.\nCounterintuitively, our results suggest that JWST sources with similar masses\nand dust properties would be more easily detectable with ALMA if they are\nlocated at higher $z$.",

    "abstract": "We present ThinkPrune, a simple yet effective method for pruning the thinking\nlength for long-thinking LLMs, which has been found to often produce\ninefficient and redundant thinking processes. Existing preliminary explorations\nof reducing thinking length primarily focus on forcing the thinking process to\nearly exit, rather than adapting the LLM to optimize and consolidate the\nthinking process, and therefore the length-performance tradeoff observed so far\nis sub-optimal. To fill this gap, ThinkPrune offers a simple solution that\ncontinuously trains the long-thinking LLMs via reinforcement learning (RL) with\nan added token limit, beyond which any unfinished thoughts and answers will be\ndiscarded, resulting in a zero reward. To further preserve model performance,\nwe introduce an iterative length pruning approach, where multiple rounds of RL\nare conducted, each with an increasingly more stringent token limit. We\nobserved that ThinkPrune results in a remarkable performance-length tradeoff --\non the AIME24 dataset, the reasoning length of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B\ncan be reduced by half with only 2% drop in performance. We also observed that\nafter pruning, the LLMs can bypass unnecessary steps while keeping the core\nreasoning process complete. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/ThinkPrune.",

    "abstract": "Automated testing plays a crucial role in ensuring software security. It\nheavily relies on formal specifications to validate the correctness of the\nsystem behavior. However, the main approach to defining these formal\nspecifications is through manual analysis of software documents, which requires\na significant amount of engineering effort from experienced researchers and\nengineers. Meanwhile, system update further increases the human labor cost to\nmaintain a corresponding formal specification, making the manual analysis\napproach a time-consuming and error-prone task. Recent advances in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in natural\nlanguage understanding. Yet, the feasibility of using LLMs to automate the\nextraction of formal specifications from software documents remains unexplored.\nWe conduct an empirical study by constructing a comprehensive dataset\ncomprising 603 specifications from 37 documents across three representative\nopen-source software. We then evaluate the most recent LLMs' capabilities in\nextracting formal specifications from documents in an end-to-end fashion,\nincluding GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama. Our study demonstrates the application of\nLLMs in formal specification extraction tasks while identifying two major\nlimitations: specification oversimplification and specification fabrication. We\nattribute these deficiencies to the LLMs' inherent limitations in processing\nand expressive capabilities, as well as their tendency to fabricate fictional\ninformation. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we propose a two-stage\nmethod, annotation-then-conversion, to address these challenges. Our method\ndemonstrates significant improvements over the end-to-end method, with a 29.2%\nincrease in the number of correctly extracted specifications and a 14.0%\nimprovement in average accuracy. In particular, our best-performing LLM\nachieves an accuracy of 71.6%.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of location-based services has led to massive spatial data\ngeneration. Spatial join is a crucial database operation that identifies pairs\nof objects from two spatial datasets based on spatial relationships. Due to the\nintensive computational demands, spatial joins are often executed in a\ndistributed manner across clusters. However, current systems fail to recognize\nsimilarities in the partitioning of spatial data, leading to redundant\ncomputations and increased overhead. Recently, incorporating machine learning\noptimizations into database operations has enhanced efficiency in traditional\njoins by predicting optimal strategies. However, applying these optimizations\nto spatial joins poses challenges due to the complex nature of spatial\nrelationships and the variability of spatial data. This paper introduces SOLAR,\nscalable distributed spatial joins through learning-based optimization. SOLAR\noperates through offline and online phases. In the offline phase, it learns\nbalanced spatial partitioning based on the similarities between datasets in\nquery workloads seen so far. In the online phase, when a new join query is\nreceived, SOLAR evaluates the similarity between the datasets in the new query\nand the already-seen workloads using the trained learning model. Then, it\ndecides to either reuse an existing partitioner, avoiding unnecessary\ncomputational overhead, or partition from scratch. Our extensive experimental\nevaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that SOLAR achieves up to 3.6X\nspeedup in overall join runtime and 2.71X speedup in partitioning time compared\nto state-of-the-art systems.",

In the first stage, the\nindividual price response curve is obtained. In the second stage, business\ngoals and resource constraints are formally expressed and modeled as an\noptimization problem. The first stage is very critical. It can answer a very\nimportant question. This question is how much incremental results can\nincentives bring, which is the basis of the second stage. Usually, the causal\nmodeling is used to obtain the curve. In the case of only observational data,\ncausal modeling and evaluation are very challenging. In some business\nscenarios, multiple causal effects need to be obtained at the same time. This\npaper proposes a new observational data modeling and evaluation framework,\nwhich can simultaneously model multiple causal effects and greatly improve the\nmodeling accuracy under some abnormal distributions. In the absence of RCT\ndata, evaluation seems impossible. This paper summarizes three priors to\nillustrate the necessity and feasibility of qualitative evaluation of cognitive\ntesting. At the same time, this paper innovatively proposes the conditions\nunder which observational data can be considered as an evaluation dataset. Our\napproach is very groundbreaking.

Randomness Inconsistency arises from the\ninherent randomness due to stochastic sampling in generative models, while\nParaphrase Inconsistency is a consequence of the language modeling objectives,\nwhere paraphrased prompts alter the distribution of vocabulary logits. This\nresearch discovers Prompt-Reverse Inconsistency (PRIN), a new form of LLM\nself-inconsistency: given a question and a couple of LLM-generated answer\ncandidates, the LLM often has conflicting responses when prompted \"Which are\ncorrect answers?\" and \"Which are incorrect answers?\". PRIN poses a big concern\nas it undermines the credibility of LLM-as-a-judge, and suggests a challenge\nfor LLMs to adhere to basic logical rules. We conduct a series of experiments\nto investigate PRIN, examining the extent of PRIN across different LLMs,\nmethods to mitigate it, potential applications, and its relationship with\nRandomness Inconsistency and Paraphrase Inconsistency.

Together, these techniques enhance both the utilization and relevance of\nretrieved content, improving factual accuracy and response quality.

Traditionally, the implemented SF law follows\nthe empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, which links the SF rate (SFR) in a\ngas element to the total gas density. More recently, an even stronger\ncorrelation has been observed between the SFR and the amount of molecular\nhydrogen ($\\mathrm{H}_2$). This opens up the question of whether molecular\nhydrogen is a necessary precursor for SF or is instead a tracer of the total\namount of gas, both of which would explain the observed correlations.

Cathepsins, a family of lysosomal\nproteolytic enzymes, have been implicated in the progression of various tumors.\nHowever, the causal relationship between the cathepsin family and EAC remains\nunresolved. Methods: To evaluate these potential causal associations,\nintegrative analyses were conducted, integrating Mendelian randomization (MR),\ntranscriptome-wide association study (TWAS), single-cell RNA sequencing\n(scRNA-seq), and single-cell expression quantitative trait locus (sc-eQTL)\nanalyses.

The TWAS analysis identified a negative association between CTSB\nexpression in esophageal tissue and EAC, consistent with experimental\nvalidation using immunohistochemistry. The scRNA-seq data analysis indicated\nthat CTSB expression was predominantly localized in macrophages infiltrating\nEAC.

Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a\npseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose\ncharacteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may\nserve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's\ncoupling (J > 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies\nof both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a\ntopological phase transition.

    "abstract": "String compactification in the framework of the low energy effective\nsupergravity requires the perturbative control in both the large volume and the\nweak coupling expansions. However, the corrected K\\\"ahler potential generated\nby the coupling of the complex structure moduli to some lattice structure\n(which is typical in the presence of a tower of states) may diverge in the\nlarge field limit, resulting in the lost of the perturbative control. Such a\ndiverging behavior is allowed by the Sp$(2(h^{2,1}+1))$ symmetry, and can be\nfound in the explicitly calculable models in which a slight modification by the\ncoupling between the lattice and the gauge field does not affect the diverging\nbehavior. This is similar to the large internal volume condition in the\nEinstein frame, where the SL$(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry of the axio-dilaton\nlooks to allow the correction to the K\\\"ahler potential to diverge in the weak\ncoupling limit but it just means that the dilaton field value must be bounded\nfrom above to keep the internal volume in the string frame sufficiently large.\nIn order to keep the perturbative control, the value of the complex structure\nmoduli also has the upper bound, which is determined by the volume of the\ninternal manifold and the string coupling constant, hence the Kaluza-Klein and\nthe string mass scales. The form and the interpretation of the bounds are quite\nsimilar to those of the distance conjecture, preventing the descent of a tower\nof states by the upper bounds on the moduli values.",

After\ndescribing general features of the replica field theories for these problems,\nwe analyze the effect of measurement on illustrative critical systems,\nincluding: critical Ising and Potts models, which show surprisingly rich phase\ndiagrams, with RG fixed points at weak, intermediate, and infinite measurement\nstrength; various models involving free fields, XY spins, or flux lines in 2D\nor 3D; and geometrical models such as polymers or clusters. We make connections\nwith quantum dynamics, in particular with \"charge sharpening\" in 1D, by giving\na formalism for measurement of classical stochastic processes: e.g. we give a\npurely hydrodynamic derivation of the known effective field theory for charge\nsharpening.

However, it comes with its own data\nprocessing challenges to overcome. Constrained codes over the DNA alphabet\n$\\{A,T,G,C\\}$ have been used to design DNA sequences that are free of long\nhomopolymers to increase stability, yet effective error detection and error\ncorrection are required to achieve reliability in data retrieval. Recently, we\nintroduced lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) codes, namely DNA LOCO\n(D-LOCO) codes, with error detection. In this paper, we equip our D-LOCO codes\nwith error correction for substitution errors via syndrome-like decoding,\ndesignated as residue decoding. We only use D-LOCO codewords of indices\ndivisible by a suitable redundancy metric $R(m) > 0$, where $m$ is the code\nlength, for error correction. We provide the community with a construction of\nconstrained codes forbidding runs of length higher than fixed $\\ell \\in\n\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $GC$-content in $\\big [0.5-\\frac{1}{2K},0.5+\\frac{1}{2K}\\big ]$\nthat correct $K$ segmented substitution errors, one per codeword.

We also give a list-decoding\nprocedure with near-quadratic time-complexity in $m$ to correct\ndouble-substitution errors within EC D-LOCO codewords, which has $> 98.20\\%$\naverage success rate. The redundancy metric is projected to require\n$2\\log_2(m)+O(1)$-bit allocation for a length-$m$ codeword.

To address these challenges, we introduce\nForestGlue, enhancing the SuperPoint feature detector through four\nconfigurations - grayscale, RGB, RGB-D, and stereo-vision - optimised for\nvarious sensing modalities. For feature matching, we employ LightGlue or\nSuperGlue, retrained with synthetic forest data. ForestGlue achieves comparable\npose estimation accuracy to baseline models but requires only 512 keypoints -\njust 25% of the baseline's 2048 - to reach an LO-RANSAC AUC score of 0.745 at a\n10{\\deg} threshold. With only a quarter of keypoints needed, ForestGlue\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead, demonstrating effectiveness in\ndynamic forest environments, and making it suitable for real-time deployment on\nresource-constrained platforms. By combining ForestGlue with a\ntransformer-based pose estimation model, we propose ForestVO, which estimates\nrelative camera poses using matched 2D pixel coordinates between frames. On\nchallenging TartanAir forest sequences, ForestVO achieves an average relative\npose error (RPE) of 1.09 m and a kitti_score of 2.33%, outperforming\ndirect-based methods like DSO by 40% in dynamic scenes.

We\nintroduce a novel control architecture that integrates a gaze-like attention\nengine with an arousal-modulated motion system to generate socially meaningful\nbehaviours.

    "abstract": "We study the dynamical large deviations (LD) of a class of one-dimensional\nkinetically constrained models whose (tilted) generators can be mapped into\nthemselves via duality transformations. We consider four representative models\nin detail: the domain-wall (DW) Fredrickson-Andersen (FA), the DW East, the\nZZZ-FA, and the XOR-FA models. Using numerical tensor networks, we build the LD\nphase diagrams of these models in terms of the softness of the constraint and\nthe counting field conjugate to the dynamical activity. In all cases, we find\ndistinct dynamical phases separated by phase transitions along the self-dual\nlines, revealing the presence of multi-critical points that delimit first-order\nfrom continuous active-inactive transitions. We discuss connections to\nsupersymmetry and possible extensions to higher spin and space dimensions.",

    "abstract": "We propose \\textbf{FLAMES (Fast Long-range Adaptive Memory for Event-based\nSystems)}, a novel hybrid framework integrating structured state-space dynamics\nwith event-driven computation. At its core, the \\textit{Spike-Aware HiPPO\n(SA-HiPPO) mechanism} dynamically adjusts memory retention based on inter-spike\nintervals, preserving both short- and long-range dependencies. To maintain\ncomputational efficiency, we introduce a normal-plus-low-rank (NPLR)\ndecomposition, reducing complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(Nr)$. FLAMES achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range\nArena benchmark and event datasets like HAR-DVS and Celex-HAR. By bridging\nneuromorphic computing and structured sequence modeling, FLAMES enables\nscalable long-range reasoning in event-driven systems.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the impact of time rescaling on the performance of\nFeedback Quantum Algorithms (FQA) and their variant for optimization tasks,\nFALQON. We introduce TR-FQA and TR-FALQON, time-rescaled versions of FQA and\nFALQON, respectively. The method is applied to two representative problems: the\nMaxCut combinatorial optimization problem and ground-state preparation in the\nANNNI quantum many-body model. The results show that TR-FALQON accelerates\nconvergence to the optimal solution in the early layers of the circuit,\nsignificantly outperforming its standard counterpart in shallow-depth regimes.\nIn the context of state preparation, TR-FQA demonstrates superior convergence,\nreducing the required circuit depth by several hundred layers. These findings\nhighlight the potential of time rescaling as a strategy to enhance algorithmic\nperformance on near-term quantum devices.",

    "authors": [

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of generative AI has led to an internet increasingly\npopulated with synthetic content-text, images, audio, and video generated\nwithout human intervention. As the distinction between human and AI-generated\ndata blurs, the ability to verify content origin becomes critical for\napplications ranging from social media and journalism to legal and financial\nsystems.\n  In this paper, we propose a conceptual, multi-layer architectural framework\nthat enables telecommunications networks to act as infrastructure level\ncertifiers of human-originated content. By leveraging identity anchoring at the\nphysical layer, metadata propagation at the network and transport layers, and\ncryptographic attestations at the session and application layers, Telcos can\nprovide an end-to-end Proof of Humanity for data traversing their networks.\n  We outline how each OSI layer can contribute to this trust fabric using\ntechnical primitives such as SIM/eSIM identity, digital signatures,\nbehavior-based ML heuristics, and edge-validated APIs. The framework is\npresented as a foundation for future implementation, highlighting monetization\npathways for telcos such as trust-as-a-service APIs, origin-certified traffic\ntiers, and regulatory compliance tools.\n  The paper does not present implementation or benchmarking results but offers\na technically detailed roadmap and strategic rationale for transforming Telcos\ninto validators of digital authenticity in an AI-dominated internet. Security,\nprivacy, and adversarial considerations are discussed as directions for future\nwork.",
