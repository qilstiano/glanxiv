Specifically, steel surfaces are analyzed to\ndetect defects such as cracks, inclusions, patches, pitted surfaces, and\nscratches. Drawing on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, KAN provides a novel\napproach compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), facilitating\nmore efficient function approximation by utilizing spline functions.

The model is obtained as the special relativistic limit of a\nfour-momentum-conservative general relativistic two-moment model. Using a\nmaximum-entropy closure, we solve for the Eulerian-frame energy and momentum.\nThe proposed numerical method is designed to preserve moment realizability,\nwhich corresponds to moments defined by a nonnegative phase-space density. The\nrealizability-preserving method is achieved with the following key components:\n(i) a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) phase-space discretization with specially\nconstructed numerical fluxes in the spatial and energy dimensions; (ii) a\nstrong stability-preserving implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-integration method;\n(iii) a realizability-preserving conserved to primitive moment solver; (iv) a\nrealizability-preserving implicit collision solver; and (v) a\nrealizability-enforcing limiter. Component (iii) is necessitated by the closure\nprocedure, which closes higher order moments nonlinearly in terms of primitive\nmoments. The nonlinear conserved to primitive and the implicit collision solves\nare formulated as fixed-point problems, which are solved with custom iterative\nsolvers designed to preserve the realizability of each iterate. With a series\nof numerical tests, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this DG-IMEX\nmethod.",

Methods have been proposed to provide insight into\nthese \"black-box\" models, but there is little research that focuses on\nsupervised ML when the model inputs are functional data. In this work, we\nconsider two applications from high-consequence spaces with objectives of\nmaking predictions using functional data inputs. One application aims to\nclassify material types to identify explosive materials given hyperspectral\ncomputed tomography scans of the materials. The other application considers the\nforensics science task of connecting an inkjet printed document to the source\nprinter using color signatures extracted by Raman spectroscopy. An instinctive\nroute to consider for analyzing these data is a data driven ML model for\nclassification, but due to the high consequence nature of the applications, we\nargue it is important to appropriately account for the nature of the data in\nthe analysis to not obscure or misrepresent patterns. As such, we propose the\nVariable importance Explainable Elastic Shape Analysis (VEESA) pipeline for\ntraining ML models with functional data that (1) accounts for the vertical and\nhorizontal variability in the functional data and (2) provides an explanation\nin the original data space of how the model uses variability in the functional\ndata for prediction. The pipeline makes use of elastic functional principal\ncomponents analysis (efPCA) to generate uncorrelated model inputs and\npermutation feature importance (PFI) to identify the principal components\nimportant for prediction. The variability captured by the important principal\ncomponents in visualized the original data space.

For the case of real massless scalar and gravitons (as well as\nany massless even integer spin-$s$ field) at $\\mathcal{I}^+$, the reality of\nwavefunction coefficients in Fourier space to all orders in perturbation theory\n(any order in loops) coming from a local, unitary, IR- and UV-finite theory,\nwhich start from the initial \\CRT-invariant Bunch-Davies state in the infinite\npast, is proven. From this it is inferred that a parity-odd correlator with any\nmassless scalar fields and even integer spin-$s$ fields vanishes in the\npresence of any number of interactions of massless fields. The same is true for\ncorrelators with an even number of conformally-coupled and massless odd integer\nspin-$s$ external fields, which is used to derive the cosmological analogue of\nFurry's theorem. The fundamental implications of \\CRT symmetry for theories\nwith chemical potentials, such as Chern-Simons and Axion inflation, is also\ndiscussed.

Motivated by this distinction, we characterize\nspontaneous topic changes in self-attention architectures, revealing both their\nsimilarities and their divergences from spontaneous human thought. First, we\nestablish theoretical results under a simplified, single-layer self-attention\nmodel with suitable conditions by defining the topic as a set of Token Priority\nGraphs (TPGs). Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the\npriority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a spontaneous topic\nchange can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority\ntokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, the longer context\nlength or the more ambiguous input topic reduces the likelihood of spontaneous\nchange. Second, we empirically validate that these dynamics persist in modern,\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, underscoring a fundamental disparity between human\ncognition and AI behaviour in the context of spontaneous topic changes.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces AFRIDOC-MT, a document-level multi-parallel translation\ndataset covering English and five African languages: Amharic, Hausa, Swahili,\nYor\\`ub\\'a, and Zulu. The dataset comprises 334 health and 271 information\ntechnology news documents, all human-translated from English to these\nlanguages. We conduct document-level translation benchmark experiments by\nevaluating neural machine translation (NMT) models and large language models\n(LLMs) for translations between English and these languages, at both the\nsentence and pseudo-document levels. These outputs are realigned to form\ncomplete documents for evaluation. Our results indicate that NLLB-200 achieved\nthe best average performance among the standard NMT models, while GPT-4o\noutperformed general-purpose LLMs. Fine-tuning selected models led to\nsubstantial performance gains, but models trained on sentences struggled to\ngeneralize effectively to longer documents. Furthermore, our analysis reveals\nthat some LLMs exhibit issues such as under-generation, repetition of words or\nphrases, and off-target translations, especially for African languages.",

However, achieving real-time\ndecision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by\naccurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper\npresents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for\nreal-time decision-making, using a multivariate deep neural network, named\nTime-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Unlike conventional\nMPC models which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of\npredicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot\n(multi-step), significantly accelerating the MPC.

We propose two novel\nestimators: the first estimator remains asymptotically consistent even when the\nerror distribution is potentially misspecified, while the second estimator\nguarantees an efficiency gain over weighted least squares estimation that uses\nthe primary study data alone. Theoretical properties of these estimators are\nrigorously derived, and extensive simulation studies are conducted to highlight\ntheir robustness and efficiency gains across various scenarios. Finally, a\nreal-world application using the NHANES dataset demonstrates the practical\nutility of the proposed methods.",

This paper anticipates the emergence of applications where\nengineering focus shifts from downlink to uplink. The current paradigm of\nscheduling users on reserved uplink resources is not able to deal efficiently\nwith unpredictable traffic patterns. As a result, 3GPP introduced the 2-step\nRACH as a mechanism to enable grant-free (random) initial access. The first of\nthe two steps is preamble detection in a RACH slot, and in this paper we\ndescribe a low-complexity algorithm for simultaneous detection of multiple\npreambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread. We provide a pathway to\nstandards adoption by choosing ZC sequences as preambles, as ZC sequences\nalready appear in 5G standards. We construct preambles by using the discrete\nZak transform to pass from a ZC sequence of length MN in the TD to a\nquasi-periodic MxN array in the DD domain. There are MN quasi-periodic Dirac\npulses, each corresponding to a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform, and the ZC preamble\nis simply the corresponding sum of Zak-OTFS carrier waveforms. We detect\nmultiple preambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread by sampling the\nreceived signal on the MxN period grid in the DD domain. We approach detection\nas a compressed sensing problem. We represent a preamble as a column of length\nMN in the DD domain and apply discrete shifts in delay and Doppler to produce a\nblock with O(MN) columns in the compressed sensing matrix. The superposition of\nmultiple preambles determines a block sparse sum of columns in the sensing\nmatrix. The correlation properties of ZC sequences result in a highly\nstructured compressed sensing matrix, making it possible to identify\nconstituent preambles using OST, which has complexity O(M^3N^3). In this paper,\nwe describe an algorithm with complexity that is O(M^2N^2) in the size of an\nindividual column.",

This new constraint class\noffers significant modeling flexibility in posing InfiniteOpt constraints that\nare enforced over a certain portion of their domain (e.g., to a certain\nprobability level), but can be challenging to reformulate/solve due to\ndifficulties in representing arbitrary logical conditions and specifying a\nprobabilistic measure on a collection of constraints. To address these\nchallenges, we derive a generalized disjunctive programming (GDP)\nrepresentation of event constrained optimization problems, which readily\nenables us to pose logical event conditions in a standard form and allows us to\ndraw from a suite of GDP solution strategies that leverage the special\nstructure of this problem class. We also extend several approximation\ntechniques from the chance constraint literature to provide a means to\nreformulate certain event constraints without the use of binary variables.

The proofs\nof the robustness characterization results, especially the recent ones for\nregression models, are technical and not intuitive, limiting the accessibility\nof and preventing the development of theory in that line of research. In this\npaper, we highlight that the proof complexity is due to the generality of the\nassumptions on the prior distribution.

Further, for a total mass density $\\rho$, Leggett argues that the\nsuperfluid fraction $\\rho_{s}/\\rho<1$. These arguments imply that there is a\nmissing mass. We attribute this to a supersolid density $\\rho_{L}$, with\n$\\rho_{L}\\equiv \\rho-\\rho_{s}-\\rho_{n}$, and a momentum-bearing supersolid\nvelocity $v_{Li}$. Using Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics we derive the\nmacroscopic dynamical equations for this system. We find that $v_{Li}$ is\nsubject to the force of elasticity, to the negative gradient of the chemical\npotential per mass $\\mu$ (as for the superfluid velocity $v_{si}$), and to drag\nagainst the normal fluid (leading to the interpretation of $L$ as lattice).\nThus both the superfluid and supersolid components are associated with the\nground state. The normal modes for such a system have a crossover in frequency,\nabove which the normal fluid velocity $v_{ni}$ is an independent variable and\nbelow which it is locked to $v_{Li}$. For an isotropic lattice we study both\nthe transverse response and longitudinal response. The ring geometry for atomic\ngas supersolid states may provide a geometry for testing these predictions.",

This study focuses on the use of physics-informed NNs and\nphysics-informed convolutional NNs as the internal (surrogate) models within\nthe NMPC formulation. One strategy embeds NN models as explicit algebraic\nconstraints, leveraging the automatic differentiation (AD) of an algebraic\nmodelling language (AML) to evaluate the derivatives. Alternatively, the solver\ncan be provided with derivatives computed external to the AML via the AD\nroutines of the machine learning environment the NN is trained in. The three\nnumerical experiments considered in this work reveal that replacing mechanistic\nmodels with NN surrogates may not always offer computational advantages when\nsmooth activation functions are used in conjunction with a local nonlinear\nsolver (e.g., Ipopt), even with highly nonlinear systems. Moreover, in this\ncontext, the external function evaluation of the NN surrogates often\noutperforms the embedding strategies that rely on explicit algebraic\nconstraints, likely due to the difficulty in initializing the auxiliary\nvariables and constraints introduced by explicit algebraic reformulations.",

Then, we develop a\njoint scheduling and beamforming framework that optimizes the OTA-FEEL\nperformance while keeping the sensing and communication quality, determined\nrespectively in terms of Cramer-Rao bound and achievable downlink rate, in a\ndesired range. The resulting scheduling problem reduces to a combinatorial\nmixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). We develop a\nlow-complexity hierarchical method based on the matching pursuit algorithm used\nwidely for sparse recovery in the literature of compressed sensing. The\nproposed algorithm uses a step-wise strategy to omit the least effective\ndevices in each iteration based on a metric that captures both the aggregation\nand sensing quality of the system. It further invokes alternating optimization\nscheme to iteratively update the downlink beamforming and uplink\npost-processing by marginally optimizing them in each iteration. Convergence\nand complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. Numerical\nevaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed algorithm.

    "abstract": "Prosecutors are essential in combating organized crime, making key decisions\nabout prosecution, target selection, and structuring imputation strategies.\nDespite their importance, the configuration of these strategies remains\nempirically underexplored. This study analyzes cases investigated by the\nInternational Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) using a\nmultilevel network approach to examine legal interventions targeting criminal\nnetworks. The research employs a multilevel Exponential Random Graph Model\n(ERGM), integrating three networks: the criminal network of actors involved in\nillegal activities, the legal framework network represents offenses, and the\nprosecution network connects actors to offenses. This approach identifies\nstructural patterns in prosecutorial strategies for individual actors and\nco-offenders. Findings show a strong tendency for triangular configurations,\nwhere two co-offenders are linked to a shared offense. Additionally,\nindividuals are more likely to be involved in diverse offenses, spanning\ncorruption-related and non-corruption-related activities, than in similar types\nof offenses. This highlights a strategic focus on addressing varied criminal\nbehaviors within interconnected networks. Notably, by capturing the interplay\nbetween legal framework, criminal network, and prosecution strategy, the\nfindings of this study emphasize the value of multilevel network analysis for\nenhancing the effectiveness of legal interventions, underscore the critical\nrole of prosecutors in dismantling complex criminal networks, and offers a\nnovel framework for improving prosecution strategies in combating organized\ncrime.",

    "abstract": "Anisotropic mesh adaptation with Riemannian metrics has proven effective for\ngenerating straight-sided meshes with anisotropy induced by the geometry of\ninterest and/or the resolved physics. Within the continuous mesh framework,\nanisotropic meshes are thought of as discrete counterparts to Riemannian\nmetrics. Ideal, or unit, simplicial meshes consist only of simplices whose\nedges exhibit unit or quasi-unit length with respect to a given Riemannian\nmetric. Recently, mesh adaptation with high-order (i.e., curved) elements has\ngrown in popularity in the meshing community, as the additional flexibility of\nhigh-order elements can further reduce the approximation error. However, a\ncomplete and competitive methodology for anisotropic and high-order mesh\nadaptation is not yet available. The goal of this paper is to address a key\naspect of metric-based high-order mesh adaptation, namely, the adequacy between\na Riemannian metric and high-order simplices. This is done by extending the\nnotions of unit simplices and unit meshes, central to the continuous mesh\nframework, to high-order elements. The existing definitions of a unit simplex\nare reviewed, then a broader definition involving Riemannian isometries is\nintroduced to handle curved and high-order simplices. Similarly, the notion of\nquasi-unitness is extended to curved simplices to tackle the practical\ngeneration of high-order meshes. Proofs of concept for unit and\n(quasi-)isometric meshes are presented in two dimensions.",

However, these models have yet to be\nfully leveraged for analyzing the rheological collective properties of such\nsystems. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we directly\ncompute the antibody solution viscosity by starting from commonly used models\nin which electrostatic interactions are treated through effective screened\nCoulomb potentials.

By thoroughly analyzing the\nmicroscopic structure of the system, we further reveal the presence of\ntransient strongly correlated antibodies which would not be present if charges\nwere treated implicitly, thus pointing to a prominent role of electrostatics in\ndetermining the increase in viscosity at high concentrations.

One of the main gaps in the literature is the lack of\nrobust and flexible measures for reacting to these security violations. To\naddress this, we propose an innovative approach leveraging Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to formulate adaptation chains, responding effectively to\nsecurity violations within cloud-based workflows. These chains consist of\nsequences of adaptation actions tailored to attack characteristics, workflow\ndependencies, and user-defined requirements. Unlike conventional single-task\nadaptations, adaptation chains provide a comprehensive mitigation strategy by\ntaking into account both control and data dependencies between tasks, thereby\naccommodating conflicting objectives effectively. Moreover, our RL-based\napproach uses insights from past responses to mitigate uncertainties associated\nwith adaptation costs. We evaluate the method using our jBPM and Cloudsim Plus\nbased implementation and compare the impact of selected adaptation chains on\nworkflows with the single adaptation approach. Results demonstrate that the\nadaptation chain approach outperforms in terms of total adaptation cost,\noffering resilience and adaptability against security threats.",

    "abstract": "Disk continuum reverberation mapping is one of the primary ways we learn\nabout active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Reverberation mapping\nassumes that time-varying X-rays incident on the accretion disk drive\nvariability in UV-optical light curves emitted by AGN disks, and uses lags\nbetween X-ray and UV-optical variability on the light-crossing timescale to\nmeasure the radial temperature profile and extent of AGN disks. However, recent\nreverberation mapping campaigns have revealed oddities in some sources such as\nweakly correlated X-ray and UV light curves, longer than anticipated lags, and\nevidence of intrinsic variability from disk fluctuations. To understand how\nX-ray reverberation works with realistic accretion disk structures, we perform\n3D multi-frequency radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of X-ray\nreprocessing by the UV-emitting region of an AGN disk using sophisticated\nopacity models that include line opacities for both the X-ray and UV radiation.\nWe find there are two important factors that determine whether X-ray\nirradiation and UV emission will be well-correlated, the ratio of X-ray to UV\nluminosity and significant absorption. When these factors are met, the\nreprocessing of X-rays into UV is nearly instantaneous, as is often assumed,\nalthough linear reprocessing models are insufficient to fully capture X-ray\nreprocessing in our simulations. Nevertheless, we can still easily recover mock\nlags in our light curves using software that assumes linear reprocessing.\nFinally, the X-rays in our simulation heat the disk, increasing temperatures by\na factor of 2--5 in the optically thin region, which could help explain the\ndiscrepancy between measured and anticipated lags.",

We\ncreated a custom data-processing pipeline to mitigate common challenges in\ndecametric radio astronomy, including radio frequency interference, ionospheric\ndistortions, and sidelobe noise from nearby bright radio sources.

Here, we examine the effects of more\nphysically motivated priors: a flexible dust law, an exponential prior on the\ndust attenuation $A_V$, and Gaussian priors that favor extended star-formation\nhistories. This results in model colors that better trace observations. We then\nperform radial SED fits to multiband flux profiles measured from Hubble Space\nTelescope images for 1,440 galaxies at $0.4<z<1.5$ of stellar masses\n$10^{10}-10^{11.5}\\ M_{\\odot}$ using both the traditional and the more\nphysically motivated assumptions.

Their slopes are similar at all masses ($0.06 -\n0.08~\\textrm{dex}~\\textrm{kpc}^{-1}$), and the normalizations for the quiescent\ngalaxies are lower.

It reduces to a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation\nwhen truncated to only include the effects of $\\eta_D$, $\\kappa_T$ and\n$\\kappa_L$. Remarkably, while heavy quarks do not reach kinetic equilibrium\nwith the plasma if evolved with this FP equation, we demonstrate that heavy\nquarks do reach kinetic equilibrium if evolved with the all-order Kolmogorov\nequation we have derived. Our results thus provide a dynamically complete\nframework for understanding the thermalization of a heavy quark that may be\ninitially far from equilibrium in the strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM\nplasma -- as well as new insight into heavy quark transport and equilibration\nin quark-gluon plasma.",

Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer\nmodule that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding\nsubject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers.

First, as paired\ndatasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we\nsample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the\ntarget video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given\nreference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this\nissue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive\nimage augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a\nchallenge in itself. To address this, we introduce a personalization benchmark\nthat focuses on accurate subject fidelity and supports diverse personalization\nscenarios.

Existing approaches lack a comprehensive framework\nfor evaluating visual reasoning and do not emphasize step-wise problem-solving.\nTo this end, we propose a comprehensive framework for advancing step-by-step\nvisual reasoning in large language models (LMMs) through three key\ncontributions. First, we introduce a visual reasoning benchmark specifically\ndesigned to evaluate multi-step reasoning tasks. The benchmark presents a\ndiverse set of challenges with eight different categories ranging from complex\nvisual perception to scientific reasoning with over 4k reasoning steps in\ntotal, enabling robust evaluation of LLMs' abilities to perform accurate and\ninterpretable visual reasoning across multiple steps. Second, we propose a\nnovel metric that assesses visual reasoning quality at the granularity of\nindividual steps, emphasizing both correctness and logical coherence. The\nproposed metric offers deeper insights into reasoning performance compared to\ntraditional end-task accuracy metrics. Third, we present a new multimodal\nvisual reasoning model, named LlamaV-o1, trained using a multi-step curriculum\nlearning approach, where tasks are progressively organized to facilitate\nincremental skill acquisition and problem-solving. The proposed LlamaV-o1 is\ndesigned for multi-step reasoning and learns step-by-step through a structured\ntraining paradigm. Extensive experiments show that our LlamaV-o1 outperforms\nexisting open-source models and performs favorably against close-source\nproprietary models. Compared to the recent Llava-CoT, our LlamaV-o1 achieves an\naverage score of 67.3 with an absolute gain of 3.8\\% across six benchmarks\nwhile being 5 times faster during inference scaling.

    "abstract": "We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of\nreconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos,\nthe unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside\nthe unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical\nlimit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP\nresonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and\ntheir link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the\nspectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic\nmany-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum\nmany-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of\nnonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be\ngeneral, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random\nphase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit\nof large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local\nenvironments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions,\nthe dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions\n(OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak\ndissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When\nthe dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary\nquantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic\nsystems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in\nthe RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage,\nthe approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP\nresonance.\n  [See the paper for the full abstract.]",

The distinct features of GR-WiFi include the support of\nparallel data streams to single or multiple users, and the compatible preamble\nprocessing to allow the co-existence of conventional, high-throughput (HT) and\nvery-high-throughput (VHT) traffics. The performance of GR-WiFi is evaluated\nthrough both extensive simulation and real-world experiments.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable advancement of smart grid technology in the IoT sector has\nraised concerns over the privacy and security of the data collected and\ntransferred in real-time. Smart meters generate detailed information about\nconsumers' energy consumption patterns, increasing the risks of data breaches,\nidentity theft, and other forms of cyber attacks. This study proposes a\nprivacy-preserving data aggregation protocol that uses reversible watermarking\nand AES cryptography to ensure the security and privacy of the data. There are\ntwo versions of the protocol: one for low-frequency smart meters that uses\nLSB-shifting-based reversible watermarking (RLS) and another for high-frequency\nsmart meters that uses difference expansion-based reversible watermarking\n(RDE). This enables the aggregation of smart meter data, maintaining\nconfidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. The proposed protocol\nsignificantly enhances privacy-preserving measures for smart metering systems,\nconducting an experimental evaluation with real hardware implementation using\nNucleo microcontroller boards and the RIOT operating system and comparing the\nresults to existing security schemes.",

    "abstract": "The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external\nradiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on\nextreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the\nOrion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at\nthe edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation\nfields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new\nchemical models of a T-Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased\ninterstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV\nstrength of 10 to 100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate\nradiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and\nhave interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We\nfind that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that\nimpacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk\nstructure. Certain molecules like C$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, C, and CS are more\nstrongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and\nobservable emission. Other abundant species like HCO$^+$ and CO are less\naffected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV\nconditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner\ntens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately\nexternally irradiated disks, the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to\nisolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.",

To achieve this, we employ a WENO finite difference framework\nand apply WENO reconstruction to a global flux assembled nodewise as the sum of\nthe physical flux and a source primitive. The novel idea is to compute the\nsource primitive using high-order multi-step ODE methods applied on the finite\ndifference grid. This approach provides a locally well-balanced splitting of\nthe source integral, with weights derived from the ODE integrator. By\nconstruction, the discrete solutions of the proposed schemes align with those\nof the underlying ODE integrator. The proposed methods employ WENO flux\nreconstructions of varying orders, combined with multi-step ODE methods of up\nto order 8, achieving steady-state accuracy determined solely by the ODE\nmethod's consistency.

Previous iQMC studies utilized a fixed-seed approach wherein\nparticles were reset to the same initial position and direction of travel at\nthe start of every transport sweep. While the QMC samples offered greatly\nimproved uniformity compared to pseudo-random samples, the fixed-seed approach\nmeant that some regions of the problem were under-sampled and resulted in\nerrors similar to ray effects observed in discrete ordinates methods.\n  This work explores using randomized-Quasi Monte Carlo techniques (RQMC) to\ngenerate unique sets of QMC samples for each transport sweep and gain a\nmuch-improved sampling of the phase space. The use of RQMC introduces some\nstochastic noise to iQMC's iterative process, which was previously absent. To\ncompensate, we adopt a ``batch'' approach similar to typical Monte Carlo\nk-eigenvalue problems, where the iQMC source is converged over\n$N_\\text{inactive}$ batches, then results from $N_\\text{active}$ batches are\nrecorded and used to calculate the average and standard deviation of the\nsolution.\n  The RQMC batch method was implemented in the Monte Carlo Dynamic Code (MC/DC)\nand is shown to be a large improvement over the fixed-seed method. The batch\nmethod was able to provide iteratively stable and more accurate solutions with\nnearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of particle histories\nper batch. Notably, despite introducing some stochastic noise to the solution,\nthe RQMC batch approach converges both the k-effective and mean scalar flux\nerror at the theoretical QMC convergence rate of $O(N^{-1})$.",

Here, we generalize the approach to the asymmetric case, where the\nplates bear charges of the same sign, but of different values. In the symmetric\nsituation, the mobile ions, which are localized in the vicinity of the two\nplates, share equally between both of them. Here, the sharing is non-trivial,\ndepending both on the coupling parameter and the distance between the plates.\nWe thus introduce a counterion occupation parameter, that is determined\nvariationally to ensure minimum of the free energy. The resulting analytical\nresults for the pressure as a function of the plate-plate distance $d$ agree\nwell with our Monte Carlo data, in a large interval of strong and intermediate\ncoupling constants $\\Xi$.

Helium escape from\nplanetary atmospheres has rapidly become the primary observational probe,\nalready observed in $\\gtrsim$20 exoplanets. Grounding our understanding in the\nbasic physics of atmospheric escape, we present a new theoretical model to\npredict the excess absorption from the helium absorption line. We constrain the\natmosphere properties, such as mass-loss rates and outflow temperatures, by\nimplementing a Parker wind solution with an energy limited evaporating outflow.\nImportantly, we self-consistently link the mass-loss rates and outflow\ntemperatures, which are critical to understanding helium absorption as the\ntriplet-level population is typically exponentially sensitive to temperature.\nFurthermore, helium absorption is typically optically thin and the absorption\nis dominated far from the planet. Therefore, the absorption depth is not a\nmeasure of the size of the helium outflow. Our results indicate that for\nplanets with a detectable signal, typically the helium triplet population in\nthe atmosphere rapidly approaches a statistical equilibrium between populations\nby recombination and depopulation caused by electron collisions. We suggest\nthat excess helium absorption can be quantified by a scaled equivalent width,\nwhich is positively correlated with the mass loss rate.

The\nlinear component is solved analytically within a low-rank manifold, while the\nnonlinear component is discretized using a second-order augmented basis update\n& Galerkin (BUG) integrator, in which the $S$-step matrix equation is solved by\nthe explicit 2-stage strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta method. The\nalgorithm has lower computational complexity than the full-rank mass-lump\nfinite element method. The dynamical low-rank finite element solution is shown\nto conserve mass up to a truncation tolerance for the conservative Allen-Cahn\nequation.

We identify trends by\nstacking measurements of chemical abundances against effective temperature and\nmodelling them with splines.

Trends are consistent between clusters of different\nages and metallicities, can reach amplitudes of ~0.5 dex and differ for dwarfs\nand giants. We use the derived trends to correct the DR4 abundances of 24 and\n31 chemical elements for dwarfs and giants, and publish a detrended catalogue.\nWhile the origin of the trends could not be pinpointed, we found that: i)\nphotometric priors affect derived abundances, ii) temperature, metallicity, and\ncontinuum levels are degenerate in spectral fitting, and it is hard to break\nthe degeneracy even by using independent measurements, iii) the completeness of\nthe linelist used in spectral synthesis is essential for cool stars, and iv)\ndifferent spectral fitting codes produce significantly different iron\nabundances for stars of all temperatures.

We implement our network to inpaint the\nmasked regions in a full-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. Inpainting\nCMB maps is a particularly formidable challenge when dealing with extensive and\nirregular masks, such as galactic masks which can obscure substantial fractions\nof the sky. The hybrid design of SkyReconNet leverages the strengths of\nstandard and dilated convolutions to accurately predict CMB fluctuations in the\nmasked regions, by effectively utilizing the information from surrounding\nunmasked areas. During training, the network optimizes its weights by\nminimizing a composite loss function that combines the Structural Similarity\nIndex Measure (SSIM) and mean squared error (MSE). SSIM preserves the essential\nstructural features of the CMB, ensuring an accurate and coherent\nreconstruction of the missing CMB fluctuations, while MSE minimizes the\npixel-wise deviations, enhancing the overall accuracy of the predictions. The\npredicted CMB maps and their corresponding angular power spectra align closely\nwith the targets, achieving the performance limited only by the fundamental\nuncertainty of cosmic variance. The network's generic architecture enables\napplication to other physics-based challenges involving data with missing or\ndefective pixels, systematic artefacts etc. Our results demonstrate its\neffectiveness in addressing the challenges posed by large irregular masks,\noffering a significant inpainting tool not only for CMB analyses but also for\nimage-based experiments across disciplines where such data imperfections are\nprevalent.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for flexible and efficient urban transportation\nsolutions has spotlighted the limitations of traditional Demand Responsive\nTransport (DRT) systems, particularly in accommodating diverse passenger needs\nand dynamic urban environments. Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) systems\nhave emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) to provide responsive and adaptable services. However, existing\nmethods primarily focus on either vehicle scheduling or path planning, which\noften simplify complex urban layouts and neglect the necessity for simultaneous\ncoordination and mutual avoidance among CAVs. This oversimplification poses\nsignificant challenges to the deployment of AMoD systems in real-world\nscenarios. To address these gaps, we propose CoDriveVLM, a novel framework that\nintegrates high-fidelity simultaneous dispatching and cooperative motion\nplanning for future AMoD systems. Our method harnesses Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) to enhance multi-modality information processing, and this enables\ncomprehensive dispatching and collision risk evaluation. The VLM-enhanced CAV\ndispatching coordinator is introduced to effectively manage complex and\nunforeseen AMoD conditions, thus supporting efficient scheduling\ndecision-making. Furthermore, we propose a scalable decentralized cooperative\nmotion planning method via consensus alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) focusing on collision risk evaluation and decentralized\ntrajectory optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and\nrobustness of CoDriveVLM in various traffic conditions, showcasing its\npotential to significantly improve the fidelity and effectiveness of AMoD\nsystems in future urban transportation networks.

    "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) is indispensable for half of all living\nlanguages that lack a formal writing system. Unlike for high-resource\nlanguages, for these languages, we cannot offload semantic understanding of\nspeech to the cascade of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-based\nlarge language models (LLMs). Even if low-resource languages possess a writing\nsystem, ASR for these languages remains unreliable due to limited bimodal\nspeech and text training data. Nonetheless, the evaluation of multilingual SLU\nis limited to shallow tasks such as intent classification or language\nidentification. This is why we present Fleurs-SLU, a multilingual SLU benchmark\nthat encompasses (i) 692 hours of speech for topical utterance classification\nin 102 languages and (ii) multiple-choice question answering via listening\ncomprehension spanning 944 hours of speech across 92 languages. We extensively\nevaluate end-to-end speech classification models, cascaded systems that combine\nspeech-to-text transcription with subsequent LLM-based classification, and\nmultimodal speech-LLMs on Fleurs-SLU. Our results show that cascaded systems\nare more robust in multilingual SLU, though well-pretrained speech encoders can\nperform competitively in topical speech classification. Closed-source\nspeech-LLMs match or surpass the performance of cascaded systems. We observe a\nstrong correlation between robust multilingual ASR, effective speech-to-text\ntranslation, and strong multilingual SLU, indicating mutual benefits between\nacoustic and semantic speech representations.",

A kinematic vehicle-trailer model is derived to describe the low-speed\nmotion of the vehicle-trailer system, and its inverse kinematics is established\nby generating an equivalent virtual trailer axle steering command. The advisory\nsystem graphics is generated based on the inverse kinematics and displays the\nexpected trailer orientation given the current vehicle steer angle and\nconfiguration (hitch angle). Simulation study and animation are set up to test\nthe efficacy of the approach, where the user can select both vehicle speed and\nvehicle steering angle freely, which allows the user to stop the\nvehicle-trailer system and experiment with different steering inputs to see\ntheir effect on the predicted trailer motion before proceeding with the best\none according to the advisory graphics, hence creating a series of piecewise\ncontinuous control actions similar to how manual trailer reverse parking is\nusually carried out.

To this\nend, we have conducted extensive experiments using the concepts of \"feature\nspace\" and \"density\" to guide and gain deeper understanding on the impact of\ndataset breadth and depth on three publicly available keystroke datasets\n(Aalto, CMU and Clarkson II). Through varying the number of training subjects,\nnumber of samples per subject, amount of data in each sample, and number of\ntriplets used in training, we found that when feasible, increasing dataset\nbreadth enables the training of a well-trained model that effectively captures\nmore inter-subject variability. In contrast, we find that the extent of depth's\nimpact from a dataset depends on the nature of the dataset. Free-text datasets\nare influenced by all three depth-wise factors; inadequate samples per subject,\nsequence length, training triplets and gallery sample size, which may all lead\nto an under-trained model. Fixed-text datasets are less affected by these\nfactors, and as such make it easier to create a well-trained model.

In contrast, modern\nmachine learning methods can model such interactions, but their\ninterpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted\nBoltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by\nencoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite\narchitecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto\ngeneralized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up\nto arbitrary order.

We further propose a robust framework for recovering\nhigher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a\nsimple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation\non synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body\ninteractions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact\nmaps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models.\nThese results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling\nhigher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.",

The spatial domain is\nsplit into two parts by introducing an arbitrary interface. Each subdomain is\ndiscretized with a mixed finite element formulation that introduces a uniform\nboundary condition in a natural way as the input. In each subdomain the spaces\nare selected from a finite element subcomplex to obtain a stable\ndiscretization.

    "abstract": "By employing superstatistical methods and machine learning, we analyze time\nseries data of water quality indicators for the River Thames, with a specific\nfocus on the dynamics of dissolved oxygen. After detrending, the probability\ndensity functions of dissolved oxygen fluctuations exhibit heavy tails that are\neffectively modeled using $q$-Gaussian distributions. Our findings indicate\nthat the multiplicative Empirical Mode Decomposition method stands out as the\nmost effective detrending technique, yielding the highest log-likelihood in\nnearly all fittings. We also observe that the optimally fitted width parameter\nof the $q$-Gaussian shows a negative correlation with the distance to the sea,\nhighlighting the influence of geographical factors on water quality dynamics.\nIn the context of same-time prediction of dissolved oxygen, regression analysis\nincorporating various water quality indicators and temporal features identify\nthe Light Gradient Boosting Machine as the best model. SHapley Additive\nexPlanations reveal that temperature, pH, and time of year play crucial roles\nin the predictions. Furthermore, we use the Transformer to forecast dissolved\noxygen concentrations. For long-term forecasting, the Informer model\nconsistently delivers superior performance, achieving the lowest MAE and SMAPE\nwith the 192 historical time steps that we used. This performance is attributed\nto the Informer's ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which allows it to\ncapture long-range dependencies in time-series data more effectively than other\nmachine learning models. It effectively recognizes the half-life cycle of\ndissolved oxygen, with particular attention to key intervals. Our findings\nprovide valuable insights for policymakers involved in ecological health\nassessments, aiding in accurate predictions of river water quality and the\nmaintenance of healthy aquatic ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in energy consumption data is crucial for identifying\nenergy waste, equipment malfunction, and overall, for ensuring efficient energy\nmanagement. Machine learning, and specifically deep learning approaches, have\nbeen greatly successful in anomaly detection; however, they are black-box\napproaches that do not provide transparency or explanations. SHAP and its\nvariants have been proposed to explain these models, but they suffer from high\ncomputational complexity (SHAP) or instability and inconsistency (e.g., Kernel\nSHAP). To address these challenges, this paper proposes an explainability\napproach for anomalies in energy consumption data that focuses on\ncontext-relevant information. The proposed approach leverages existing\nexplainability techniques, focusing on SHAP variants, together with global\nfeature importance and weighted cosine similarity to select background dataset\nbased on the context of each anomaly point. By focusing on the context and most\nrelevant features, this approach mitigates the instability of explainability\nalgorithms. Experimental results across 10 different machine learning models,\nfive datasets, and five XAI techniques, demonstrate that our method reduces the\nvariability of explanations providing consistent explanations. Statistical\nanalyses confirm the robustness of our approach, showing an average reduction\nin variability of approximately 38% across multiple datasets.",

However, the quadratic complexity with\nrespect to the sequence length of the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism\nbecomes the major bottleneck for the application of long sequence tasks, such\nas vision tasks. Although various efficient linear attention mechanisms have\nbeen proposed, they need to sacrifice performance to achieve high efficiency.\nWhat's more, memory-efficient methods, such as FlashAttention-1-3, still have\nquadratic computation complexity which can be further improved. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel efficient linear fast attention (ELFATT) mechanism to\nachieve low memory input/output operations, linear computational complexity,\nand high performance at the same time.

Using\nFlashAttention-2 acceleration, ELFATT still offers 2-3x speedups over the\nvanilla softmax-based attention mechanism on high-resolution vision tasks\nwithout losing performance. Even in some non-vision tasks of long-range arena,\nELFATT still achieves leading performance and offers 1.2-2.3x speedups over\nFlashAttention-2. Even on edge GPUs, ELFATT still offers 1.6x to 2.0x speedups\ncompared to state-of-the-art attention mechanisms in various power modes from\n5W to 60W.

Such debates have\nrevolved around whether and to what extent cosmology meets established\ndemarcation criteria for a discipline to be scientific, as well as determining\nhow to best characterize cosmology as a science, given the unique challenges\nand limitations faced by a discipline which aims to study the origin,\ncomposition, and fate of the Universe itself. The present article revisits, in\nlight of the dramatic progress in cosmology in recent decades, an earlier\ndebate held in the 1950s between Herman Bondi and Gerald Whitrow regarding the\nscientific status of cosmology. We analyse cosmology's transition from an\nemerging science to a cornerstone of modern physics, highlighting its empirical\nsuccesses in establishing the $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model\nand in its delivery of various successful novel predictions. Despite this\nremarkable scientific success and progress, we argue that modern cosmology\nfaces a further profound challenge: the permanent underdetermination of the\nmicrophysical nature of its exotic energy components: inflation, dark matter,\nand dark energy. Drawing historical parallels with the role of spectroscopy in\nrevealing the microphysical nature of atomic physics, we argue that the\nepistemic barriers obstructing us from ascertaining the microphysical nature of\nthese exotic energy components are significant, in turn casting doubt upon\nwhether cosmology can ever transcend these particular epistemic challenges.

PaCoT collects these toxic metals and\ntransmits them to release nodes, such as lymph capillaries, before they reach\ncritical organs. The design incorporates key physical parameters and operates\nthrough particle reception and release mechanisms. In the reception process,\ndescribed as ligand-receptor binding reactions, modeled as a continuous-time\nMarkov process (CTMP), PaCoT uses metallothionein proteins as receptors and\nheavy metals (e.g., Zn, Pb, Cd) as ligands. We assume that the toxicity\ncondition (toxic (bit-1), non-toxic (bit-0)) is encoded into the concentration\nof heavy metal molecules. Thus, we consider that heavy metal concentration\nwithin the MC channel (e.g., human circulatory system) employs binary\nconcentration shift keying (binary CSK). The concentration ratio of specific\nheavy metals is estimated to infer toxicity, i.e., a high ratio indicates\ntoxicity and a low ratio suggests non-toxicity. Toxicity detection is achieved\nby monitoring the receptor bound duration in the presence of interferers and\nvarious types of heavy metals. After detecting and collecting toxic heavy\nmetals, PaCoT securely retains them in a liquid medium (e.g., water) until\nrelease, employing two mechanisms: (1) a single-disc viscous micropump to\nregulate flow rate, and (2) Brownian motion to facilitate diffusion. PaCoT's\nperformance is evaluated through MATLAB simulations, focusing on bit error\nprobability (BEP) of the toxicity detection method, release time of molecules\nfrom PaCoT and energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by\nimproving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the\nsteady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full\nautomation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation\nlevels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant\nand understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and\nefficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs' compatibility with HDVs and\nsocial acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into\nmixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially\nCompliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first\ncomprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in\ndeveloping SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and\nresearch gaps. An informal expert interview was also conducted to discuss the\nliterature review results and identify critical research gaps and expectations\ntowards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a\nconceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual\nframework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers,\ntechnicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The\nsurvey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the\nsignificance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of\nintegrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research\nperspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and\ndevelopment agenda of SCAVs.",

However, decision-making\nusing predictive AI models often results in suboptimal performance. This is\nprimarily because AI models are typically constructed to best fit the data, and\nhence to predict the most likely future rather than to enable high-performance\ndecision-making. The hope that such prediction enables high-performance\ndecisions is neither guaranteed in theory nor established in practice. In fact,\nthere is increasing empirical evidence that predictive models must be tailored\nto decision-making objectives for performance. In this paper, we establish\nformal (necessary and sufficient) conditions that a predictive model (AI-based\nor not) must satisfy for a decision-making policy established using that model\nto be optimal.

    "abstract": "Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active\nturbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are\nincreasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to\nturbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through\nsimulations of a minimal model of unbounded active nematics, we find that the\ntransition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition\nfeatures a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and\nhysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time\nLyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\\approx 4900$ of\nthe dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find\nsubcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar\npatterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic\ntransients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence.\nOverall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in\nchannel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background.\nWe propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions\nof Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and\nthus render the transition discontinuous.",

The\ncalculations include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium\nand treat dust and gas temperatures separately. We find that the stellar mass\ndistributions obtained become increasingly bottom light as the redshift and/or\nmetallicity are increased. Mass functions that are similar to a typical\nGalactic initial mass function are obtained for present-day star formation\n(z=0) independent of metallicity, and also for the lowest-metallicity (1/100\nsolar) at all redshifts up to z=10, but for higher metallicities there is a\nlarger deficit of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as the metallicity and\nredshift are increased. These effects are a result of metal-rich gas being\nunable to cool to as lower temperatures at higher redshift due to the warmer\ncosmic microwave background radiation. Based on the numerical results we\nprovide a parameterisation that may be used to vary the stellar initial mass\nfunction with redshift and metallicity; this could be used in simulations of\ngalaxy formation. For example, a bottom-light mass function reduces the\nmass-to-light ratio compared to a typical Galactic stellar initial mass\nfunction, which may reduce the estimated masses of high-redshift galaxies.",

In practically relevant learning tasks, often not the\nplain-vanilla standard SGD optimization method is employed to train the\nconsidered class of DNNs but instead more sophisticated adaptive and\naccelerated variants of the standard SGD method such as the popular Adam\noptimizer are used.

In the healthcare\nfield, particularly when radiologists use AI-driven diagnostic tools hosted on\nonline platforms, there is a risk that medical imaging data may be repurposed\nfor future AI training without explicit consent, spotlighting critical privacy\nand intellectual property concerns around healthcare data usage.

To push the boundaries of UE performance\nwith theoretically unlimited resources, we scaled up UC learning across various\ndatasets using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training on the Summit\nsupercomputer. Our goal was to examine UE efficacy at high-performance\ncomputing (HPC) levels to prevent unauthorized learning and enhance data\nsecurity, particularly exploring the impact of batch size on UE's\nunlearnability. Utilizing the robust computational capabilities of the Summit,\nextensive experiments were conducted on diverse datasets such as Pets,\nMedMNist, Flowers, and Flowers102. Our findings reveal that both overly large\nand overly small batch sizes can lead to performance instability and affect\naccuracy. However, the relationship between batch size and unlearnability\nvaried across datasets, highlighting the necessity for tailored batch size\nstrategies to achieve optimal data protection.

In response, the research community has mobilized, with numerous efforts\ndedicated to strengthening defenses against these threats. The primary goal of\nthese techniques is to detect malicious software early, preventing attacks\nbefore any damage occurs. However, many of these methods either claim that\npacking has minimal impact on malware detection or fail to address the\nreliability of their approaches when applied to packed samples. Consequently,\nthey are not capable of assisting victims in handling packed programs or\nrecovering from the damages caused by untimely malware detection. In light of\nthese challenges, we propose VisUnpack, a static analysis-based data\nvisualization framework for bolstering attack prevention while aiding recovery\npost-attack by unveiling malware patterns and offering more detailed\ninformation including both malware class and family. Our method includes\nunpacking packed malware programs, calculating local similarity descriptors\nbased on basic blocks, enhancing correlations between descriptors, and refining\nthem by minimizing noises to obtain self-analysis descriptors. Moreover, we\nemploy machine learning to learn the correlations of self-analysis descriptors\nthrough architectural learning for final classification. Our comprehensive\nevaluation of VisUnpack based on a freshly gathered dataset with over 27,106\nsamples confirms its capability in accurately classifying malware programs with\na precision of 99.7%.

    "abstract": "Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a\ndelicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as\nlimited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in\nsensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through\nuncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however,\ntypically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble,\nwhich may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper\nintroduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling\ncalibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase,\npredictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are\nleveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the\ncloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal\nsets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a\nuser-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model.\nThe credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in\nthe simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language\ntasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation\nfor Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance\ncompared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation,\nmaking it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal\nspeech-text models have laid the groundwork for seamless voice interactions,\nenabling real-time, natural, and human-like conversations. Previous models for\nvoice interactions are categorized as native and aligned. Native models\nintegrate speech and text processing in one framework but struggle with issues\nlike differing sequence lengths and insufficient pre-training. Aligned models\nmaintain text LLM capabilities but are often limited by small datasets and a\nnarrow focus on speech tasks. In this work, we introduce MinMo, a Multimodal\nLarge Language Model with approximately 8B parameters for seamless voice\ninteraction. We address the main limitations of prior aligned multimodal\nmodels. We train MinMo through multiple stages of speech-to-text alignment,\ntext-to-speech alignment, speech-to-speech alignment, and duplex interaction\nalignment, on 1.4 million hours of diverse speech data and a broad range of\nspeech tasks. After the multi-stage training, MinMo achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various benchmarks for voice comprehension and generation\nwhile maintaining the capabilities of text LLMs, and also facilitates\nfull-duplex conversation, that is, simultaneous two-way communication between\nthe user and the system. Moreover, we propose a novel and simple voice decoder\nthat outperforms prior models in voice generation. The enhanced\ninstruction-following capabilities of MinMo supports controlling speech\ngeneration based on user instructions, with various nuances including emotions,\ndialects, and speaking rates, and mimicking specific voices. For MinMo, the\nspeech-to-text latency is approximately 100ms, full-duplex latency is\napproximately 600ms in theory and 800ms in practice.

We also employe\nthe embedded inclusion model and use the time evolution of mutual information\nbetween each spin and the artificial Griffith region to probe the diffusion of\nthe thermal bubble. We observe that in finite-sized systems, the critical\ndisorder strength gradually drifts away from the central.

    "abstract": "A novel method to improve the accuracy of pressure field estimation from\ntime-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry data is proposed. This method\ngenerates several new time-series of velocity field by propagating in time the\noriginal one using an advection-based model, which assumes that small-scale\nturbulence is advected by large-scale motions. Then smoothing is performed at\nthe corresponding positions across all the generated time-series. The process\nis repeated through an iterative scheme. The proposed technique smears out\nspatial noise by exploiting time information. Simultaneously, temporal jitter\nis repaired using spatial information, enhancing the accuracy of pressure\ncomputation via the Navier-Stokes equations. We provide a proof of concept of\nthe method with synthetic datasets based on a channel flow and the wake of a 2D\nwing. Different noise models are tested, including Gaussian white noise and\nerrors with some degree of spatial coherence. Additionally, the filter is\nevaluated on an experimental test case of the wake of an airfoil, where\npressure field ground truth is not available. The result shows the proposed\nmethod performs better than conventional filters in velocity and pressure field\nestimation, especially when spatially coherent errors are present. The method\nis of direct application in advection-dominated flows, although its extension\nwith more advanced models is straightforward.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have enabled heterogeneous multi-robot teams to learn complex\nand effective coordination skills. However, existing neural architectures that\nsupport heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity\nand efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by\nenabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of\nrobots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In\ncontrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling\ngreater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and\ngeneralization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by\nviewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent\nwork in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot\ntask allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a\nsoft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a\nflexible shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By\nexplicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload)\non collective behavior, CASH enables zero-shot generalization to unseen robots\nor team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks,\nthree learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient\nRL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium)\nplatforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates\nappropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline\narchitectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both\ntraining and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer learnable\nparameters.",

    "abstract": "Photothermal reactions, involving both photochemical and thermal\nreaction-steps, are the most abundant sequences in photochemistry. The\nderivation of their rate-laws is standardized, but the integration of these\nrate-laws has not yet been achieved. Indeed, the field still lacks integrated\nrate-laws for the description of these reactions behavior, and/or\nidentification of their reaction-order. This made a comprehensive account of\nthe photo-kinetics of photothermal reactions to be a gap in the knowledge. This\ngap is addressed in the present paper by introducing an unprecedented general\nmodel equation capable to mapping out the kinetic traces of such reactions when\nexposed to light or in the dark. The integrated rate-law model equation also\napplies when the reactive medium is exposed to either monochromatic or\npolychromatic light irradiation. The validity of the model equation was\nestablished against simulated data obtained by a fourth-order Runge-Kutta\nmethod. It was then used to describe and quantify several situations of\nphotothermal reactions, such as the effects of initial concentration, spectator\nmolecules, and incident radiation intensity, and the impact of the latter on\nthe photonic yield. The model equation facilitated a general elucidation method\nto determine the intrinsic reaction parameters (quantum yields and\nabsorptivities of the reactive species) for any photothermal mechanism whose\nnumber of species are known. This paper contributes to rationalizing\nphoto-kinetics along the same general guidelines adopted in chemical kinetics.",

This\nresearch applies the proposed AI-driven, autonomous, identity-based threat\nsegmentation in ZTA, along with real-time identity analytics for fine-grained,\nreal-time mechanisms. Some of the sharp practices include using the behavioral\nanalytics approach to provide real-time risk scores, such as analyzing the\npatterns used for logging into the system, the access sought, and the resources\nused.

This work outlines measures to address privacy issues, false positives,\nand scalability concerns. This research enhances the security of other critical\nareas of computer systems by providing dynamic access governance, minimizing\ninsider threats, and supporting dynamic policy enforcement while ensuring that\nthe needed balance between security and user productivity remains a top\npriority.

Theory and Methods: To encode the underlying B1+,\nmultiple (two to four) TSE image sets with various excitation and refocusing\nflip angles were acquired. To this end, the acquired signal intensities were\nmatched to a database of simulated signals which was generated by solving the\nBloch equations taking into account the exact sequence parameters. The\nretrieved B1+ values were validated against gradient-recalled and spin echo\ndual angle methods, as well as a vendor-provided turboFLASH-based mapping\nsequence, in gel phantoms and human subjects without and with metal implants.\nResults: In the absence of metal, phantom experiments demonstrated excellent\nagreement between the proposed technique using three or four flip angle sets\nand reference dual angle methods. In human subjects without metal implants, the\nproposed technique with three or four flip angle sets showed excellent\ncorrelation with the spin echo dual angle method. In the presence of metal,\nboth phantoms and human subjects revealed a narrow range of B1+ estimation with\nthe reference techniques, whereas the proposed technique successfully resolved\nB1+ near the metal.

    "abstract": "Many robotic tasks in real-world environments require physical interactions\nwith an object such as pick up or push. For successful interactions, the robot\nneeds to know the object's affordances, which are defined as the potential\nactions the robot can perform with the object. In order to learn a\nrobot-specific affordance predictor, we propose an interactive exploration\npipeline which allows the robot to collect interaction experiences while\nexploring an unknown environment. We integrate an object-level map in the\nexploration pipeline such that the robot can identify different object\ninstances and track objects across diverse viewpoints. This results in denser\nand more accurate affordance annotations compared to state-of-the-art methods,\nwhich do not incorporate a map. We show that our affordance exploration\napproach makes exploration more efficient and results in more accurate\naffordance prediction models compared to baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "The optimal fault-tolerance achievable by any protocol has been characterized\nin a wide range of settings. For example, for state machine replication (SMR)\nprotocols operating in the partially synchronous setting, it is possible to\nsimultaneously guarantee consistency against $\\alpha$-bounded adversaries\n(i.e., adversaries that control less than an $\\alpha$ fraction of the\nparticipants) and liveness against $\\beta$-bounded adversaries if and only if\n$\\alpha + 2\\beta \\leq 1$.\n  This paper characterizes to what extent \"better-than-optimal\" fault-tolerance\nguarantees are possible for SMR protocols when the standard consistency\nrequirement is relaxed to allow a bounded number $r$ of consistency violations.\nWe prove that bounding rollback is impossible without additional timing\nassumptions and investigate protocols that tolerate and recover from\nconsistency violations whenever message delays around the time of an attack are\nbounded by a parameter $\\Delta^*$ (which may be arbitrarily larger than the\nparameter $\\Delta$ that bounds post-GST message delays in the partially\nsynchronous model). Here, a protocol's fault-tolerance can be a non-constant\nfunction of $r$, and we prove, for each $r$, matching upper and lower bounds on\nthe optimal \"recoverable fault-tolerance\" achievable by any SMR protocol. For\nexample, for protocols that guarantee liveness against 1/3-bounded adversaries\nin the partially synchronous setting, a 5/9-bounded adversary can always cause\none consistency violation but not two, and a 2/3-bounded adversary can always\ncause two consistency violations but not three. Our positive results are\nachieved through a generic \"recovery procedure\" that can be grafted on to any\naccountable SMR protocol and restores consistency following a violation while\nrolling back only transactions that were finalized in the previous $2\\Delta^*$\ntimesteps.",

We find\nthat non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations\ncompared to tidally filling ones.\n  The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related\nto the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field.

    "abstract": "As the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes more embedded within our daily lives,\nthere is growing concern about the risk `smart' devices pose to network\nsecurity. To address this, one avenue of research has focused on automated IoT\ndevice identification. Research has however largely neglected the\nidentification of IoT device firmware versions. There is strong evidence that\nIoT security relies on devices being on the latest version patched for known\nvulnerabilities. Identifying when a device has updated (has changed version) or\nnot (is on a stable version) is therefore useful for IoT security. Version\nidentification involves challenges beyond those for identifying the model,\ntype, and manufacturer of IoT devices, and traditional machine learning\nalgorithms are ill-suited for effective version identification due to being\nlimited by the availability of data for training. In this paper, we introduce\nan effective technique for identifying IoT device versions based on transfer\nlearning. This technique relies on the idea that we can use a Twin Neural\nNetwork (TNN) - trained at distinguishing devices - to detect differences\nbetween a device on different versions. This facilitates real-world\nimplementation by requiring relatively little training data. We extract\nstatistical features from on-wire packet flows, convert these features into\ngreyscale images, pass these images into a TNN, and determine version changes\nbased on the Hedges' g effect size of the similarity scores. This allows us to\ndetect the subtle changes present in on-wire traffic when a device changes\nversion. To evaluate our technique, we set up a lab containing 12 IoT devices\nand recorded their on-wire packet captures for 11 days across multiple firmware\nversions. For testing data held out from training, our best performing model is\nshown to be 95.83% and 84.38% accurate at identifying stable versions and\nversion changes respectively.",

Each player can only access its local individual cost function and\nconstraints, necessitating partial information exchanges with neighboring\nplayers through time-varying unbalanced networks. Additionally, local cost\nfunctions and constraint functions are not prior knowledge and only revealed\ngradually.

Moreover, for a time-invariant stochastic strongly\nmonotone game, it is shown that the generated sequence by the designed\nalgorithm converges to its variational generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE)\nalmost surely, and the time-averaged sequence converges sublinearly with high\nprobability.

The dimension sequence $\\mathcal D _R$ is an invariant that captures\nthe various skew-fields and dimensions occurring in the layers of the socle\nsequence of $R$. Though $\\mathcal D _R$ does not determine $R$ up to an\nisomorphism even for rings of Loewy length $2$, we prove that it does so when\n$R$ is a commutative semiartinian regular $K$-algebra of countable type over a\nfield $K$. The proof is constructive: given the sequence $\\mathcal D$, we\nconstruct the unique $K$-algebra of countable type $R = B_{\\alpha,n}$ such that\n$\\mathcal D = \\mathcal D _R$ by a transfinite iterative construction from the\nbase case of the $K$-algebra $R(\\aleph_0,K)$ consisting of all eventually\nconstant sequences in $K^{\\aleph_0}$. Moreover, we prove that the $K$-algebras\n$B_{\\alpha,n}$ possess conormed strong multiplicative bases despite the fact\nthat the ambient $K$-algebras $K^{\\kappa}$ do not even have any bounded bases\nfor any infinite cardinal $\\kappa$.\n  Recently, a study of the number of limit models in AECs of modules [1] has\nraised interest in the question of existence of strictly $\\lambda$-injective\nmodules for arbitrary infinite cardinals $\\lambda$.

    "abstract": "Turbulent open channel flow is known to feature a multi-layer structure near\nthe free surface. In the present work we employ direct numerical simulations\nconsidering Reynolds numbers up to $\\mathrm{Re}_\\tau=900$ and domain sizes\nlarge enough ($L_x=12 \\pi h$, $L_z=4 \\pi h$) to faithfully capture the effect\nof very-large-scale motions in order to test the proposed scaling laws and\nultimately answer the question: How far does the influence of the free surface\nextend? In the region near the free surface, where fluctuation intensities of\nvelocity and vorticity become highly anisotropic, we observe the previously\ndocumented triple-layer structure, consisting of a wall-normal velocity damping\nlayer that scales with the channel height $h$, and two sublayers that scale\nwith the near-surface viscous length scale $\\ell_V=\\mathrm{Re}_b^{-1/2}h$ and\nwith the Kolmogorov length scale $\\ell_K=\\mathrm{Re}_b^{-3/4}h$, respectively.\nThe Kolmogorov sublayer measures $\\delta_K \\approx 20 \\ell_K$ and the layer,\nwhere the wall-normal turbulence intensity decreases linearly to zero near the\nfree surface, scales with $\\ell_V$ and the corresponding near-surface viscous\nsublayer measures $\\delta_V \\approx \\ell_V$. Importantly, the streamwise\nturbulence intensity profile for $\\mathrm{Re}_\\tau \\ge 400$ suggests that the\ninfluence of the free-slip boundary penetrates essentially all the way down to\nthe solid wall through the appearance of enhanced very-large-scale motions\n($\\delta_{SIL}\\approx h$). In contrast, the layer where the surface-normal\nturbulence intensity is damped to zero is restricted to the free surface\n($\\delta_{NVD}\\approx 0.3h$). As a consequence, the partitioning of the\nsurface-influenced region has to be expanded to a four-layer structure that\nspans the entire channel height $h$.",

Precise body measurements are important health indicators in the\nmedical industry, and guiding factors in the fashion, ergonomic and\nentertainment industries. The measuring protocol consists of scanning the whole\nsubject in the static A-pose, which is maintained without breathing or movement\nduring the scanning process. However, the A-pose is not easy to maintain during\nthe whole scanning process, which can last even up to a couple of minutes. This\nconstraint affects the final quality of the scan, which in turn affects the\naccuracy of the estimated body measurements obtained from methods that rely on\ndense geometric data. Additionally, this constraint makes it impossible to\ndevelop a digital anthropometry method for subjects unable to assume the\nA-pose, such as those with injuries or disabilities. We propose a method that\ncan obtain body measurements from sparse landmarks acquired in any pose. We\nmake use of the sparse landmarks of the posed subject to create\npose-independent features, and train a network to predict the body measurements\nas taken from the standard A-pose. We show that our method achieves comparable\nresults to competing methods that use dense geometry in the standard A-pose,\nbut has the capability of estimating the body measurements from any pose using\nsparse landmarks only.

Given our limited observational handle\non cosmic-ray sources, any model remains necessarily probabilistic. Previously,\npredictions were performed in a Monte Carlo fashion, summing the contributions\nfrom individual, simulated sources to generate samples from the statistical\nensemble of possible electron spectra. Such simulations need to be re-run if\nthe cosmic-ray transport parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficient, maximum\nenergy) are changed, rendering any parameter study computationally expensive.\nIn addition, a proper statistical analysis of observations and comparison with\nsuch probabilistic models requires the joint probability distribution of the\nfull spectrum instead of only samples.

To address this challenge, here, we present a machine learning\nmodel based on neural operator, namely, Complex Neural Operator for Air Quality\n(CoNOAir), that can effectively forecast CO concentrations. We demonstrate this\nby developing a country-level model for short-term (hourly) and long-term\n(72-hour) forecasts of CO concentrations.

We further analyse\nthe capability of the model to capture extreme events and generate forecasts in\nurban cities in India. Interestingly, we observe that the model predicts the\nnext hour CO concentrations with R2 values greater than 0.95 for all the cities\nconsidered. The deployment of such a model can greatly assist the governing\nbodies to provide early warning, plan intervention strategies, and develop\neffective strategies by considering several what-if scenarios.

This method distinguishes the entropy\ndifferences among logits of hard and easy examples, thereby identifying hard\nexamples and increasing the utility of unlabeled data, better addressing the\nimbalance problem in CISSL. In addition, we maintain a class-balanced memory\nbank with confidence decay for storing high-confidence embeddings to enhance\nthe pseudo-labels' reliability. Although our method is simple, it is effective\nand seamlessly integrates with existing approaches. We perform comprehensive\nexperiments on standard CISSL benchmarks and experimentally demonstrate that\nour proposed SeMi outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple\nbenchmarks, especially in reversed scenarios, where our best result shows\napproximately a 54.8\\% improvement over the baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "Generative methods for graphs need to be sufficiently flexible to model\ncomplex dependencies between sets of nodes. At the same time, the generated\ngraphs need to satisfy domain-dependent feasibility conditions, that is, they\nshould not violate certain constraints that would make their interpretation\nimpossible within the given application domain (e.g. a molecular graph where an\natom has a very large number of chemical bounds). Crucially, constraints can\ninvolve not only local but also long-range dependencies: for example, the\nmaximal length of a cycle can be bounded.\n  Currently, a large class of generative approaches for graphs, such as methods\nbased on artificial neural networks, is based on message passing schemes. These\napproaches suffer from information 'dilution' issues that severely limit the\nmaximal range of the dependencies that can be modeled. To address this problem,\nwe propose a generative approach based on the notion of graph grammars. The key\nnovel idea is to introduce a domain-dependent coarsening procedure to provide\nshort-cuts for long-range dependencies.\n  We show the effectiveness of our proposal in two domains: 1) small drugs and\n2) RNA secondary structures. In the first case, we compare the quality of the\ngenerated molecular graphs via the Molecular Sets (MOSES) benchmark suite,\nwhich evaluates the distance between generated and real molecules, their\nlipophilicity, synthesizability, and drug-likeness. In the second case, we show\nthat the approach can generate very large graphs (with hundreds of nodes) that\nare accepted as valid examples for a desired RNA family by the \"Infernal\"\ncovariance model, a state-of-the-art RNA classifier.\n  Our implementation is available on github:\ngithub.com/fabriziocosta/GraphLearn",

These challenges hinder model expressiveness and prevent the\nuse of deeper models to capture long-range node interactions (LRIs) within the\ngraph. Popular solutions for LRIs detection are either too expensive to process\nlarge graphs due to high time complexity or fail to generalize across diverse\ngraph structures.

Finally, to prove the efficacy of our methodology we design DeltaGNN,\nthe first scalable and generalizable approach for detecting long-range and\nshort-range interactions.

During severe grid faults, GFL inverters are vulnerable to\ntransient instability, often leading to disconnection from the grid. This paper\naims to elucidate the interaction mechanisms and define the stability\nboundaries of systems of two inverters, including GFL, grid-forming (GFM), or\ngrid-supporting (GSP) inverters. First, the generalized large-signal expression\nfor the two-inverter system under various inverter combinations is derived,\nrevealing that no energy function exists for systems containing GFL inverters.\nThis implies that the traditional direct method cannot be applied to such\nsystems. To overcome these challenges, a manifold method is employed to\nprecisely determine the domain of attraction (DOA) of the system, and the\ntransient stability margin is assessed by a new metric termed the critical\nclearing radius (CCR). A case study of the two-inverter system under various\ninverter combinations is conducted to explore large-signal interactions across\ndifferent scenarios. Manifold analysis and simulation results reveal that GSP\ninverters using PLL for grid synchronization exhibit behavior similar to GFM\ninverters when the droop coefficients in the terminal voltage control loop\n(TVC) are sufficiently large. Compared to GFL inverters, GSP inverters\nincorporating a TVC significantly enhances the transient stability of other\ninverters. In the STATCOM case, the optimal placement of the STATCOM, realized\nby GSP or GFM inverters, is identified to be at the midpoint of a transmission\nline.

This often results in the incorporation of ``noise'' from uncorrelated\nintermediate neighbors, thereby degrading performance. Second, feature learning\nshould be handled differently for different types, which is challenging\nespecially when the type sizes are large. To bridge this gap, we develop a\nnovel framework - AutoGNR, to directly utilize and automatically extract\neffective heterogeneous information. Instead of recursive homogeneous message\npassing, we introduce a non-recursive message passing mechanism for GNN to\nmitigate noise from uncorrelated node types in HINs. Furthermore, under the\nnon-recursive framework, we manage to efficiently perform neural architecture\nsearch for an optimal GNN structure in a differentiable way, which can\nautomatically define the heterogeneous paths for aggregation.

    "abstract": "This study addresses the issue of speaker gender bias in Speech Translation\n(ST) systems, which can lead to offensive and inaccurate translations. The\nmasculine bias often found in large-scale ST systems is typically perpetuated\nthrough training data derived from Machine Translation (MT) systems. Our\napproach involves two key steps. First, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto rectify translations based on the speaker's gender in a cost-effective\nmanner. Second, we fine-tune the ST model with the corrected data, enabling the\nmodel to generate gender-specific translations directly from audio cues,\nwithout the need for explicit gender input. Additionally, we propose a\nthree-mode fine-tuned model for scenarios where the speaker's gender is either\npredefined or should not be inferred from speech cues. We demonstrate a 70%\nimprovement in translations for female speakers compared to our baseline and\nother large-scale ST systems, such as Seamless M4T and Canary, on the MuST-SHE\ntest set.",

    "abstract": "A method is proposed to obtain full-domain spatial modes based on Proper\nOrthogonal Decomposition (POD) of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements\nperformed at different (overlapping) spatial locations. This situation occurs\nwhen large domains are covered by multiple non-simultaneous measurements and\nyet the large-scale flow field organization is to be captured. The proposed\nmethodology leverages the definition of POD spatial modes as eigenvectors of\nthe spatial correlation matrix, where local measurements, even when not\nobtained simultaneously, provide each a portion of the latter, which is then\nanalyzed to synthesize the full-domain spatial modes. The measurement domain\ncoverage is found to require regions overlapping by 50-75% to yield a smooth\ndistribution of the modes. The procedure identifies structures twice as large\nas each measurement patch. The technique, referred to as Patch POD, is applied\nto planar PIV data of a submerged jet flow where the effect of patching is\nsimulated by splitting the original PIV data. Patch POD is then extended to 3D\nrobotic measurement around a wall-mounted cube. The results show that the\npatching technique enables global modal analysis over a domain covered with a\nmultitude of non-simultaneous measurements.",

Such models pre-trained on human speech have demonstrated high\ntransferability for bioacoustic processing. This paper investigates (i) whether\nSSL models pre-trained directly on animal vocalizations offer a significant\nadvantage over those pre-trained on speech, and (ii) whether fine-tuning\nspeech-pretrained models on automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks can\nenhance bioacoustic classification. We conduct a comparative analysis using\nthree diverse bioacoustic datasets and two different bioacoustic tasks. Results\nindicate that pre-training on bioacoustic data provides only marginal\nimprovements over speech-pretrained models, with comparable performance in most\nscenarios. Fine-tuning on ASR tasks yields mixed outcomes, suggesting that the\ngeneral-purpose representations learned during SSL pre-training are already\nwell-suited for bioacoustic tasks.

Here, we unveil that by tuning a single parameter, the hydrostatic\npressure P, a cascade of electronic phase transitions can be induced in the\nfew-layer transition metal dichalcogenide 1T'-WS2, including superconducting,\ntopological, and anomalous Hall effect phases. Specifically, as P increases, we\nobserve a dual phase transition: the suppression of superconductivity with the\nconcomitant emergence of an anomalous Hall effect at P=1.15 GPa. Remarkably,\nupon further increasing the pressure above 1.6 GPa, we uncover a reentrant\nsuperconducting state that emerges out of a state still exhibiting an anomalous\nHall effect. This superconducting state shows a marked increase in\nsuperconducting anisotropy with respect to the phase observed at ambient\npressure, suggesting a different superconducting state with a distinct pairing\nsymmetry. Via first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the system\nconcomitantly transitions into a strong topological phase with markedly\ndifferent band orbital characters and Fermi surfaces contributing to the\nsuperconductivity. These findings position 1T'-WS2 as a unique, tunable\nsuperconductor, wherein superconductivity, anomalous transport, and band\nfeatures can be tuned through the application of moderate pressures.",

The theory\ndemonstrates how active flows create nematic domains of anisotropic cells,\ndrive active turbulence, and create topological defects. We show that the\nfilament flow-aligning parameter, $\\lambda_{\\tens{Q}}$, a rheological quantity\nthat determines the response of the filaments to velocity gradients in the\nactive flows, plays a significant, to date unappreciated, role in determining\nthe pattern of extensional and compressional active flows. In a contractile\ncell layer, local flows are expected to align elongated cells perpendicular to\nthe active filaments. However, with increasing $\\lambda_{\\tens{Q}}$, long-range\ncorrelations in the active turbulent flow field lead to extended regions where\nthis alignment is parallel, as recently observed in experiments on confluent\nMDCK cell layers. Further, the two order parameter formalism allows us to\ndistinguish defects in the filament director field, which contribute to the\nactive driving, and those in the shape director field, measured in experiments,\nwhich are advected by the active flows. By considering the relative\norientations of shape and filaments we are able to explain the surprising\nobservation of defects moving towards their heads in contractile cell layers.",

For\nboth forms of credibility assessment, automated adversarial attacks that\nrewrite deceptive statements to appear truthful pose a serious threat. Methods:\nWe used a dataset of 243 truthful and 262 fabricated autobiographical stories\nin a deception detection task for humans and machine learning models. A large\nlanguage model was tasked to rewrite deceptive statements so that they appear\ntruthful. In Study 1, humans who made a deception judgment or used the\ndetailedness heuristic and two machine learning models (a fine-tuned language\nmodel and a simple n-gram model) judged original or adversarial modifications\nof deceptive statements. In Study 2, we manipulated the target alignment of the\nmodifications, i.e. tailoring the attack to whether the statements would be\nassessed by humans or computer models. Results: When adversarial modifications\nwere aligned with their target, human (d=-0.07 and d=-0.04) and machine\njudgments (51% accuracy) dropped to the chance level. When the attack was not\naligned with the target, both human heuristics judgments (d=0.30 and d=0.36)\nand machine learning predictions (63-78%) were significantly better than\nchance.

Successful example case studies are presented including\ninversion of hard and soft clipping, digital quantization, half-wave\nrectification, and wavefolding nonlinearities. Our results suggest that, out of\nthe nonlinear functions tested here, the cubic Catmull-Rom spline is best\nsuited to approximating these nonlinearities. In the case of guitar recordings,\ncomparisons with informed and supervised methods show that the proposed blind\nmethod is at least as good as they are in terms of objective metrics.\nExperiments on distorted speech show that the proposed blind method outperforms\ngeneral-purpose speech enhancement techniques and restores the original voice\nquality. The proposed method can be applied to audio effects modeling,\nrestoration of music and speech recordings, and characterization of analog\nrecording media.",

However, recent studies have\nunderscored the extraordinarily high computational cost of TPFs on quantum\nmany-body problems, even for systems with as few as three particles. A key\ndistinction in these problems is the antisymmetry requirement on the unknown\nfunctions. In the present work, we rigorously establish that the minimum number\nof involved terms for a class of TPFs to be exactly antisymmetric increases\nexponentially fast with the problem dimension. This class encompasses both\ntraditionally discretized TPFs and the recent ones parameterized by neural\nnetworks. Our proof exploits the link between the antisymmetric TPFs in this\nclass and the corresponding antisymmetric tensors and focuses on the Canonical\nPolyadic rank of the latter. As a result, our findings uncover a fundamental\nincompatibility between antisymmetry and low-rank TPFs in high-dimensional\ncontexts and offer new insights for further developments.",

Two ordering schemes\nare adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power\n(MSP)-based ordering and\ninstantaneous-signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the coverage\nprobabilities of UTs under different channel conditions.

Based on evolutionary theory of PWNe, we consider that, when the PWN\nwas disrupted during collision by the reverse shock, some very high-energy\nelectrons escaped impulsively. The remaining electrons stayed in the relic PWN,\nwhich was displaced from the pulsar. The very high-energy part of the remaining\nelectrons were depleted by the strong magnetic field that was enhanced by the\nreverse shock compression in the reverberation stage, leaving the other part of\nthem generating GeV emission. The particles injected from the pulsar after the\ndisruption enter the relic PWN through the newly formed tunnel called the\ncocoon. The $\\gamma$-ray emission from the escaped electrons can account for\nthe TeV spectrum of component A of HESS J1809$-$193 or the TeV halo, while the\nelectrons remaining after disruption can account for the GeV spectrum of\nJ1810.3$-$1925e. Thus, combination of contributions from these two populations\nof electrons naturally reproduces the saddle-like SED of HESS J1809$-$193 and\nJ1810.3$-$1925e from 5 GeV to 30 TeV, together with the spectral hardening\naround 100 GeV.

In this work, we propose a new variant of soft multivariate\nregression trees (SRTs) where, for every input vector, the prediction is\ndefined as the linear regression associated to a single leaf node, namely, the\nleaf node obtained by routing the input vector from the root along the branches\nwith higher probability. SRTs exhibit the conditional computational property,\ni.e., each prediction depends on a small number of nodes (parameters), and our\nnonlinear optimization formulation for training them is amenable to\ndecomposition. After showing a universal approximation result for SRTs, we\npresent a decomposition training algorithm including a clustering-based\ninitialization procedure and a heuristic for reassigning the input vectors\nalong the tree. Under mild assumptions, we establish asymptotic convergence\nguarantees. Experiments on 15 wellknown datasets indicate that our SRTs and\ndecomposition algorithm yield higher accuracy and robustness compared with\ntraditional soft regression trees trained using the nonlinear optimization\nformulation of Blanquero et al., and a significant reduction in training times\nas well as a slightly better average accuracy compared with the mixed-integer\noptimization approach of Bertsimas and Dunn.

To address\nthis issue, we propose two mathematical models designed to handle uncertainty\nand data sparsity in energy consumption.

The\nsecond is a data-driven distributionally robust optimization model that\nleverages observed data to provide more flexible and informed solutions. To\nevaluate these models, we apply them to the Rotterdam bus network.

(2) Designing infrastructure based on worst-case energy\nconsumption increases costs by 67\\% compared to using average estimates. (3)\nThe data-driven distributionally robust optimization model reduces costs by\n28\\% compared to the box uncertainty model while maintaining reliability,\nespecially in scenarios where extreme energy consumption values are rare and\ndata exhibit skewness.

    "abstract": "Predicting student success or failure is vital for timely interventions and\npersonalized support. Early failure prediction is particularly crucial, yet\nlimited data availability in the early stages poses challenges, one of the\npossible solutions is to make use of additional data from other contexts,\nhowever, this might lead to overconsumption with no guarantee of better\nresults. To address this, we propose the Frugal Early Prediction (FEP) model, a\nnew hybrid model that selectively incorporates additional data, promoting data\nfrugality and efficient resource utilization. Experiments conducted on a public\ndataset from a VLE demonstrate FEP's effectiveness in reducing data usage, a\nprimary goal of this research.Experiments showcase a remarkable 27% reduction\nin data consumption, compared to a systematic use of additional data, aligning\nwith our commitment to data frugality and offering substantial benefits to\neducational institutions seeking efficient data consumption. Additionally, FEP\nalso excels in enhancing prediction accuracy. Compared to traditional\napproaches, FEP achieves an average accuracy gain of 7.3%. This not only\nhighlights the practicality and efficiency of FEP but also its superiority in\nperformance, while respecting resource constraints, providing beneficial\nfindings for educational institutions seeking data frugality.",

    "abstract": "Recent research on backdoor stealthiness focuses mainly on indistinguishable\ntriggers in input space and inseparable backdoor representations in feature\nspace, aiming to circumvent backdoor defenses that examine these respective\nspaces. However, existing backdoor attacks are typically designed to resist a\nspecific type of backdoor defense without considering the diverse range of\ndefense mechanisms. Based on this observation, we pose a natural question: Are\ncurrent backdoor attacks truly a real-world threat when facing diverse\npractical defenses?\n  To answer this question, we examine 12 common backdoor attacks that focus on\ninput-space or feature-space stealthiness and 17 diverse representative\ndefenses. Surprisingly, we reveal a critical blind spot: Backdoor attacks\ndesigned to be stealthy in input and feature spaces can be mitigated by\nexamining backdoored models in parameter space. To investigate the underlying\ncauses behind this common vulnerability, we study the characteristics of\nbackdoor attacks in the parameter space. Notably, we find that input- and\nfeature-space attacks introduce prominent backdoor-related neurons in parameter\nspace, which are not thoroughly considered by current backdoor attacks. Taking\ncomprehensive stealthiness into account, we propose a novel supply-chain attack\ncalled Grond. Grond limits the parameter changes by a simple yet effective\nmodule, Adversarial Backdoor Injection (ABI), which adaptively increases the\nparameter-space stealthiness during the backdoor injection. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Grond outperforms all 12 backdoor attacks against\nstate-of-the-art (including adaptive) defenses on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and a subset\nof ImageNet. In addition, we show that ABI consistently improves the\neffectiveness of common backdoor attacks.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies on radial migration in disc galaxies have proven the\nimportance of the effect of resonances with non-axisymmetric components on the\nevolution of galactic discs. However, the dynamical effects of classic\nNewtonian dynamics with dark matter (DM) differ from MOdified Newtonian\nDynamics (MOND) and might trigger different radial migration. A thorough\nanalysis of radial migration considering these two gravitational regimes might\nshed some light on different predictions of DM and MOND theories. We aim to\nquantitatively and qualitatively compare the effects of resonances and stellar\nradial migration (churning) in a Milky Way-like (MW-like) galaxy in the DM and\nMOND regimes. We performed simulations of a MW-like galaxy to analyse the\neffect of non-axisymmetric structures (galactic bar and spiral arms)\nconsidering various parameters of the spiral structure. We conducted a\ntwo-dimensional numerical simulation consisting of the integration of $2 \\cdot\n10^6$ stars in a static rotating galactic potential for $6~\\mbox{Gyr}$. We\nanalysed the change in the star's position, the guiding radius, as well as the\nfrequency phase space. We investigated DM and MOND approaches. The outcome of\nthe simulation shows that the radial migration is much more pronounced in the\nMOND regime compared to the DM one. Compared to the DM approach, in the MOND\nregime, we observe up to five times as many stars with a maximum change in the\nguiding radius of more than $1.5~\\mbox{kpc}$ during the time interval from\n$2-6~\\mbox{Gyr}$.Analysis of the frequency phase space reveals that the most\nprominent resonances in all DM and MOND configurations are the co-rotation\nresonance with the spiral arms ($m=p=1$), outer Lindblad resonance with the\ngalactic bar and spiral arms, and the co-rotation resonance ($m=2$, $p=1$) with\nthe superposition of the galactic bar and spiral arms, $2 \\Omega = \\Omega_b +\n\\Omega_{sp}$.",

In this study, we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor\nas a linear response and the third-order magnetic susceptibility as a nonlinear\nresponse using two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy for Kekul\\'e-Kitaev model.\nOur results reveal that the few-matter fermion excitations approximation\nprovides reliable results for both linear and nonlinear responses. Notably,\nwhile the Kekul\\'e-Kitaev model shows linear and nonlinear responses\nqualitatively similar to the Kitaev model, it displays distinct behavior under\na weak uniform/staggered magnetic field. Specifically, the Kekul\\'e-Kitaev\nmodel does not present a non-Abelian phase under a uniform magnetic field,\nwhile such phase appears in the presence of a staggered magnetic field.\nInterestingly, within the non-Abelian phase, signals originating from two\nnon-adjacent fluxes in the nonlinear response are stronger than signals from\nother flux excitations. Furthermore, We demonstrate that the ground state of\nthe Kekul\\'e-Kitaev model at isotropic coupling is mapped, through unitary spin\nrotations, to an excited state of the Kitaev model with a uniform flux\nconfiguration.",

The PDS 70 disk is so\nfar the only protoplanetary disk with concrete evidence for the presence of\nyoung planets. Mid-infrared spectra were obtained for PDS 70 by the Infrared\nSpectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) and the Mid-Infrared\nInstrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2007 and 2022,\nrespectively. In this work, we investigate the dust mineralogy through a\ndetailed decomposition of the observed mid-infrared spectra. The results show\nthat both the dust size and crystallinity increased by a factor of about two\nduring the two epochs of observation, indicating evident dust processing in the\nterrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk. The dust size (~0.8\nmicron) and crystallinity (~6%) in the PDS 70 disk are similar to those of\nother disks, which implies that the two nascent planets, PDS 70b and PDS 70c\nlocated at radial distances of ~22AU and ~34AU, do not have a significant\nimpact on the dust processing in the inner disk. The flux densities at\nwavelengths longer than ~16 micron measured by JWST/MIRI are only ~60% of those\nobtained by Spitzer/IRS. Based on self-consistent radiative transfer modeling,\nwe found that such a strong variability in mid-infrared fluxes can be produced\nby adjustments to the dust density distribution and structure of the inner disk\nprobably induced by planet-disk interaction.",

Notably,\nValley2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on e-commerce benchmarks,\nsurpassing open-source models of similar size by a large margin (79.66 vs.\n72.76). Additionally, Valley2 ranks second on the OpenCompass leaderboard among\nmodels with fewer than 10B parameters, with an impressive average score of\n67.4.

    "abstract": "3D additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of nanophotonic structures\nwith subwavelength features that control light across macroscopic scales.\nGradient-based optimization offers an efficient approach to design these\ncomplex and non-intuitive structures. However, expanding this methodology from\n2D to 3D introduces complexities, such as the need for structural integrity and\nconnectivity. This work introduces a multi-objective optimization method to\naddress these challenges in 3D nanophotonic designs. Our method combines\nelectromagnetic simulations with an auxiliary heat-diffusion solver to ensure\ncontinuous material and void connectivity. By modeling material regions as heat\nsources and boundaries as heat sinks, we optimize the structure to minimize the\ntotal temperature, thereby penalizing disconnected regions that cannot\ndissipate thermal loads. Alongside the optical response, this heat metric\nbecomes part of our objective function. We demonstrate the utility of our\nalgorithm by designing two 3D nanophotonic devices. The first is a focusing\nelement. The second is a waveguide junction, which connects two incoming\nwaveguides for two different wavelengths into two outgoing waveguides, which\nare rotated by 90{\\deg} to the incoming waveguides. Our approach offers a\ndesign pipeline that generates digital blueprints for fabricable nanophotonic\nmaterials, paving the way for practical 3D nanoprinting applications.",

    "abstract": "Background: A muonic atom, composed of a negative muon and an atomic nucleus,\nundergoes two primary decay processes: muon-electron decay and muon nuclear\ncapture. The branching ratio between these two processes can be determined from\nthe measured lifetime of the muonic atom. While past researches have examined\nthe general trend of muon capture rates across different nuclei, experimental\nand theoretical investigations into the isotope dependence of the lifetime\nremain limited. Purpose: The present study aims to measure the lifetimes of the\nmuonic atom of isotopically enriched silicon isotopes. Methods: The experiment\nwas conducted at the muon facility in the Material and Life Science Facility\n(MLF), J-PARC. A muon beam was stopped in various target materials, including\nisotopically enriched $^{28,29,30}$Si. The lifetimes of the muonic atoms were\nmeasured by detecting decay electrons using a $\\mu$SR spectrometer. The decay\nspectra were analyzed by fitting with multi-exponential functions to account\nfor contributions from the target nucleus and surrounding materials. Results:\nFor the first time, the lifetimes of the muonic atom of isotopically enriched\n$^{28,29,30}$Si were measured. Additionally, seven other targets were studied\nto validate the experimental method and analysis procedure. The results were\ncompared with theoretical models such as Primakoff, Goulard-Primakoff, and the\nrecently-developed microscopic and evaporation model (MEM). Conclusions: The\nPrimakoff and Goulard-Primakoff formulas, while reproducing certain aspects of\nthe isotope dependence, require further refinement. The comparison with MEM\ncalculations constrains the axial vector ($g_A$) and induced pseudoscalar\n($g_P$) coupling constants. The present experiment establishes a method for\nmeasuring the lifetimes of the muonic atom and will contribute to future\nsystematic investigations.",

While high-quality visual text\ngeneration has become available with the advanced generative capabilities of\ndiffusion models, these models often produce distorted text and inharmonious\ntext background when given slanted or curved text layouts due to training data\nlimitation. In this paper, we introduce a new training-free framework, STGen,\nwhich accurately generates visual texts in challenging scenarios (\\eg, slanted\nor curved text layouts) while harmonizing them with the text background. Our\nframework decomposes the visual text generation process into two branches: (i)\n\\textbf{Semantic Rectification Branch}, which leverages the ability in\ngenerating flat but accurate visual texts of the model to guide the generation\nof challenging scenarios. The generated latent of flat text is abundant in\naccurate semantic information related both to the text itself and its\nbackground. By incorporating this, we rectify the semantic information of the\ntexts and harmonize the integration of the text with its background in complex\nlayouts. (ii) \\textbf{Structure Injection Branch}, which reinforces the visual\ntext structure during inference. We incorporate the latent information of the\nglyph image, rich in glyph structure, as a new condition to further strengthen\nthe text structure. To enhance image harmony, we also apply an effective\ncombination method to merge the priors, providing a solid foundation for\ngeneration. Extensive experiments across a variety of visual text layouts\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves superior accuracy and outstanding\nquality.",

We explore this\nspace by using generic pre-trained LLMs (the 7B, 13B, and 70B variants of\nLLaMA-2) to answer 162 undergraduate-level MCQs from a course on Programming\nLanguages (PL) -- the MCQ dataset is a contribution of this work, which we make\npublicly available.

Random timing fluctuations are often studied with the power\nspectrum; this quantifies how the amplitude of variations is distributed over\ntemporal frequencies. Red noise variability -- when the power spectrum\nincreases smoothly towards low frequencies -- is ubiquitous in AGN. The\ncommonly used Fourier analysis methods, have significant challenges when\napplied to arbitrarily sampled light curves of red noise variability.

EDNet\nincorporates an XSmall detection head and a Cross Concat strategy to improve\nfeature fusion and multi-scale context awareness for detecting tiny targets in\ndiverse environments. Our unique C2f-FCA block employs Faster Context Attention\nto enhance feature extraction while reducing computational complexity. The WIoU\nloss function is employed for improved bounding box regression. With seven\nmodel sizes ranging from Tiny to XL, EDNet accommodates various deployment\nenvironments, enabling local real-time inference and ensuring data privacy.\nNotably, EDNet achieves up to a 5.6% gain in mAP@50 with significantly fewer\nparameters. On an iPhone 12, EDNet variants operate at speeds ranging from 16\nto 55 FPS, providing a scalable and efficient solution for edge-based object\ndetection in challenging drone imagery.

Spectroscopic observations are taken by the Thai\nNational Telescope (TNT) with a Medium-RESolution spectrograph (MRES)\ninstrument for seven nights spanning from 2020 to 2021.

Our observations\nreveal split Balmer emission lines throughout the entire duration of our\nmonitoring. Double Gaussian profiles were employed for line fitting to\ncharacterize these lines. The presence of double peaks in the Balmer lines\nindicates the presence of asymmetries within the circumstellar disc. We then\nanalyze V/R variations and the changes in H$\\beta$ spectra. Our analysis of V/R\nvariation which Violet (V) and Red (R) peak intensity components, revealed\nrapid fluctuations occurring within a single day, although determining the\nprecise periodicity was constrained by instrumental limitations and the\nduration of observability. Furthermore, employing observed the wavelength\ndifferences ($\\Delta\\lambda$) in conjunction with typical Be star parameters\nallowed us to estimate the radius ($r_{\\beta}$) of the H$\\beta$ emitting\nenvelope.

The chemical make-up of regions inside snowlines is\nconnected to the material drifting from the outer regions, which can be modeled\nwith dust evolution models. However, infrared observations are limited by the\nhigh dust extinction in the inner disc, and only probes the abundances of\ngaseous species in the disc surface layers. As a result, the bulk mass of\ndelivered volatiles is not directly relatable to what is measured through\ninfrared spectra. In this paper, we investigate how the delivery of dust and\nice after prolonged pebble drift affects the observable reservoir of water\nvapor in the inner disc. We develop a 1+1D approach based on dust evolution\nmodels to determine the delivery and distribution of vapor compared to the\nheight of the $\\tau = 1$ surface in the dust continuum. We find that the\nobservable column density of water vapor at wavelengths probed by JWST spans\nmany orders of magnitude over time, exhibiting different radial profiles\ndepending on dust properties, drift rate, and local processing. In the presence\nof a traffic-jam effect inside the snowline, the observable vapor reservoir\nappears constant in time despite the ongoing delivery by pebble drift, such\nthat water is effectively smuggled unnoticed. Differences in measured column\ndensities then originate not only from variations in bulk vapor content, but\nalso from differences in the properties and distribution of dust particles.",

    "abstract": "Pitch ownership models allow many types of analysis in soccer and provide\nvaluable assistance to tactical analysts in understanding the game's dynamics.\nThe novelty they provide over event-based analysis is that tracking data\nincorporates context that event-based data does not possess, like player\npositioning. This paper proposes a novel approach to building pitch ownership\nmodels in soccer games using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Our\napproach provides a fast inference mechanism that can model different\napproaches to pitch control using the same algorithm. Despite its flexibility,\nit uses only three hyperparameters to tune the model, facilitating the tuning\nprocess for different player skill levels. The flexibility of the approach\nallows for the emulation of different methods available in the literature by\nadjusting a small number of parameters, including adjusting for different\nlevels of uncertainty. In summary, the proposed model provides a new and more\nflexible strategy for building pitch ownership models, extending beyond just\nreplicating existing algorithms, and can provide valuable insights for tactical\nanalysts and open up new avenues for future research. We thoroughly visualize\nseveral examples demonstrating the presented models' strengths and weaknesses.\nThe code is available at github.com/nvsclub/KNNPitchControl.",

A comprehensive dataset\nspanning recent decades of Portuguese youth and professional football provides\ngranular insights, including information such as players' birthplaces and the\ninitial grassroots clubs where they developed. The initial findings suggest a\ncorrelation between a club's prominence and the geographic reach of its youth\nscouting operations, with larger clubs able to cast their net wider. Analysis\nof the correlation between players' birthplace and high-tier football club\nlocation suggests that the performance of senior teams acts as a catalyst for\ninvestment in youth teams.

Evaluating such explanations is very difficult,\nas it includes not only the quality of the induced space of possible concepts\nbut also how effectively the chosen concepts are communicated to users.\nExisting evaluation metrics often focus solely on the former, neglecting the\nlatter. We introduce an evaluation framework for measuring concept explanations\nvia automated simulatability: a simulator's ability to predict the explained\nmodel's outputs based on the provided explanations. This approach accounts for\nboth the concept space and its interpretation in an end-to-end evaluation.\nHuman studies for simulatability are notoriously difficult to enact,\nparticularly at the scale of a wide, comprehensive empirical evaluation (which\nis the subject of this work). We propose using large language models (LLMs) as\nsimulators to approximate the evaluation and report various analyses to make\nsuch approximations reliable. Our method allows for scalable and consistent\nevaluation across various models and datasets. We report a comprehensive\nempirical evaluation using this framework and show that LLMs provide consistent\nrankings of explanation methods.

Solar power places substantial downward pressure on prices\nat very low penetration levels (up to 9 GBP/MWh per 1 GWh increase in energy\ngeneration), though its impact weakens quite rapidly.

Such systems naturally occur in contexts involving particle\nsuspensions, granular media, and charged systems, where interactions can be\ninfluenced by physical fields that decrease over distance.

Adding matter to the\nhole through an accretion disc generally acts to increase the hole's spin\nparameter, while the capture of radiation generally provides a retarding\ntorque. The balance between the torques provided by adding matter and radiation\nleads to a maximum spin parameter that can be obtained by a black hole which\ngrows by accretion, known as the Thorne limit. In the simplest theory of thin\ndisc accretion this Thorne limit has the value $a_{\\bullet, {\\rm lim}} \\simeq\n0.998$. The purpose of this paper is to highlight that any modification to\ntheories of accretion flows also modify this limiting value, and to compute\nprecisely the modification arising from a particular extension of accretion\ntheory: the inclusion of bright emission from within the plunging region which\nis sourced from the magnetohydrodynamic stresses ubiquitously observed in\nsimulations. This extra emission further suppresses black hole spin-up and\nresults in new, lower, limits on the final black hole spin.

Poems are a distinct form of\nliterature, with meanings that frequently transcend beyond the literal words.\nTo address this shortcoming, we propose a PoemToPixel framework designed to\ngenerate images that visually represent the inherent meanings of poems. Our\napproach incorporates the concept of prompt tuning in our image generation\nframework to ensure that the resulting images closely align with the poetic\ncontent. In addition, we propose the PoeKey algorithm, which extracts three key\nelements in the form of emotions, visual elements, and themes from poems to\nform instructions which are subsequently provided to a diffusion model for\ngenerating corresponding images. Furthermore, to expand the diversity of the\npoetry dataset across different genres and ages, we introduce MiniPo, a novel\nmultimodal dataset comprising 1001 children's poems and images. Leveraging this\ndataset alongside PoemSum, we conducted both quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations of image generation using our PoemToPixel framework. This paper\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and offers a fresh perspective\non generating images from literary sources.",

However, recent studies have highlighted the\nvulnerability of GNNs to backdoor attacks, which can lead the model to\nmisclassify graphs with attached triggers as the target class. The\neffectiveness of recent promising defense techniques, such as fine-tuning or\ndistillation, is heavily contingent on having comprehensive knowledge of the\nsufficient training dataset. Empirical studies have shown that fine-tuning\nmethods require a clean dataset of 20% to reduce attack accuracy to below 25%,\nwhile distillation methods require a clean dataset of 15%. However, obtaining\nsuch a large amount of clean data is commonly impractical.\n  In this paper, we propose a practical backdoor mitigation framework, denoted\nas GRAPHNAD, which can capture high-quality intermediate-layer representations\nin GNNs to enhance the distillation process with limited clean data. To achieve\nthis, we address the following key questions: How to identify the appropriate\nattention representations in graphs for distillation? How to enhance\ndistillation with limited data? By adopting the graph attention transfer\nmethod, GRAPHNAD can effectively align the intermediate-layer attention\nrepresentations of the backdoored model with that of the teacher model, forcing\nthe backdoor neurons to transform into benign ones. Besides, we extract the\nrelation maps from intermediate-layer transformation and enforce the relation\nmaps of the backdoored model to be consistent with that of the teacher model,\nthereby ensuring model accuracy while further reducing the influence of\nbackdoors. Extensive experimental results show that by fine-tuning a teacher\nmodel with only 3% of the clean data, GRAPHNAD can reduce the attack success\nrate to below 5%.",

However, existing models simplify ray propagation, generating\nechoes at interaction points without considering return paths to the sensor.\nThis can result in unrealistic artifacts and necessitates careful scene tuning\nfor plausible results. We propose a novel ultrasound simulation pipeline that\nutilizes a ray tracing algorithm to generate echo data, tracing each ray from\nthe transducer through the scene and back to the sensor.

This study aims to evaluate the Artificial Intelligence-based Diabetic\nRetinopathy Screening System (AIDRSS) for DR detection and prevalence\nassessment, addressing the growing need for scalable, automated screening\nsolutions in resource-limited settings.\n  Approach: A multicentric, cross-sectional study was conducted in Kolkata,\nIndia, involving 5,029 participants and 10,058 macula-centric retinal fundus\nimages. The AIDRSS employed a deep learning algorithm with 50 million trainable\nparameters, integrated with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization\n(CLAHE) preprocessing for enhanced image quality. DR was graded using the\nInternational Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) Scale, categorizing disease\ninto five stages (DR0 to DR4). Statistical metrics including sensitivity,\nspecificity, and prevalence rates were evaluated against expert retina\nspecialist assessments.\n  Results: The prevalence of DR in the general population was 13.7%, rising to\n38.2% among individuals with elevated random blood glucose levels. The AIDRSS\nachieved an overall sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 88%, and 100%\nsensitivity for detecting referable DR (DR3 and DR4). These results demonstrate\nthe system's robust performance in accurately identifying and grading DR in a\ndiverse population.\n  Conclusions: AIDRSS provides a reliable, scalable solution for early DR\ndetection in resource-constrained environments. Its integration of advanced AI\ntechniques ensures high diagnostic accuracy, with potential to significantly\nreduce the burden of diabetes-related vision loss in underserved regions.",

This work proposes a\nscenario-free probabilistic robust optimization algorithm that overcomes both\nthe runtime and memory limitations typical of traditional robustness\nalgorithms. The scenario-free approach minimizes cost-functions evaluated on\nexpected-dose distributions and total variance. Calculation of these quantities\nrelies on precomputed expected-dose-influence and total-variance-influence\nmatrices, such that no scenarios need to be stored for optimization. The\nalgorithm was developed within matRad and tested in several optimization\nconfigurations for photon and proton irradiation plans. A traditional robust\noptimization algorithm and a margin-based approach are used as a reference to\nbenchmark the performances of the scenario-free algorithm in terms of plan\nquality, robustness and computational workload. The scenario-free approach\nachieves plan quality compatible with traditional robust optimization\nalgorithms and it reduces the standard deviation within selected structures\nwhen variance reduction objectives are defined. Avoiding the storage of\nindividual scenario information allows for the inclusion of an arbitrary number\nof error scenarios.

It\nreduces the problem to three concepts: credibility as a characteristic granted\nto information depending on its truth-value; trust as the ability to produce\ncredible information; authority when the power to influence of an author is\naccepted, i.e., when readers accept that the source can modify their opinion,\nknowledge and decisions. The model describes also two kinds of relationships\nbetween the three concepts: an upward link and a downward link. The model is\nconfronted with findings of empirical research on Wikipedia in particular.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a formula for the Lefschetz number of a geometric\nendomorphism in the style of the Atiyah-Bott theorem. The underlying data\nconsist, first, of a compact manifold and a nowhere vanishing smooth real\nvector field $\\mathcal{T}$ that preserves some Riemannian metric, and second, a\nsequence of first order operators on sections of Hermitian vector bundles with\nconnection whose curvature is annihilated by $\\mathcal{T}$ and for which\nparallel transport along integral curves of $\\mathcal{T}$ is unitary. Assuming\nthat the operators of the sequence commute with the various covariant\nderivatives $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{T}}=\\nabla_{\\mathcal{T}}$ and that their\nrestriction to the spaces of sections annihilated by\n$\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{T}}$ form a complex, an ellipticity condition gives\nfinite-dimensionality of the resulting equivariant cohomology spaces. The\nAtiyah-Bott framework, adapted to give a geometric endomorphism only for the\ncomplex of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathcal{T}}$-parallel sections, together with the\nfiniteness of cohomology allows for the definition of a Lefschetz number.\nReplacing the condition that the fixed points of the equivariant map $f$\nassociated with the endomorphism be simple by a condition on wave front sets,\nwhich is the underlying condition of Atiyah and Bott, yields that the set of\nclosures of orbits by $\\mathcal{T}$ left invariant by $f$ is finite, and then a\nformula similar to theirs, now relating the Lefschetz number with traces along\nthese orbits.",

    "abstract": "To achieve high service quality and profitability, meal delivery platforms\nlike Uber Eats and Grubhub must strategically operate their fleets to ensure\ntimely deliveries for current orders while mitigating the consequential impacts\nof suboptimal decisions that leads to courier understaffing in the future. This\nstudy set out to solve the real-time order dispatching and idle courier\nsteering problems for a meal delivery platform by proposing a reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based strategic dual-control framework. To address the inherent\nsequential nature of these problems, we model both order dispatching and\ncourier steering as Markov Decision Processes. Trained via a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework, we obtain strategic policies by leveraging the\nexplicitly predicted demands as part of the inputs. In our dual-control\nframework, the dispatching and steering policies are iteratively trained in an\nintegrated manner. These forward-looking policies can be executed in real-time\nand provide decisions while jointly considering the impacts on local and\nnetwork levels. To enhance dispatching fairness, we propose convolutional deep\nQ networks to construct fair courier embeddings. To simultaneously rebalance\nthe supply and demand within the service network, we propose to utilize\nmean-field approximated supply-demand knowledge to reallocate idle couriers at\nthe local level. Utilizing the policies generated by the RL-based strategic\ndual-control framework, we find the delivery efficiency and fairness of\nworkload distribution among couriers have been improved, and under-supplied\nconditions have been alleviated within the service network.

The presence of the\nexchange and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a ferromagnet with\nbroken structural inversion symmetry modifies the current phase relation and\nthe critical current due to the coupling between the magnetic moment and\nJosephson phase. This breaks the time translation symmetry leading to the\nappearance of the time-crystalline order in the spatiotemporal dependence of\nsuperconducting current, which evolves with the double of the modulation\nfrequency. Due to its unique origin and properties, this inherent time\ncrystalline order stands out from the commonly known classification of time\ncrystals into discrete and continuous ones. A self-generated time crystal is\ndemonstrated in two types of hybrid Josephson junctions: the\nsuperconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor on a topological insulator and the\nsuperconductor-three layer ferromagnet-superconductor. Further, we also show\nthat a recently developed magnetometry device that visualizes a supercurrent\nflow in the Josephson junction at the nanoscale can be used as a platform for\nexperimental detection of space-time crystalline order in hybrid Josephson\njunctions.",

    "abstract": "In vertex recoloring, we are given $n$ vertices with their initial coloring,\nand edges arrive in an online fashion. The algorithm must maintain a valid\ncoloring by recoloring vertices, at a cost. The problem abstracts a scenario of\njob placement in machines (possibly in the cloud), where vertices represent\njobs, colors represent machines, and edges represent ``anti affinity''\n(disengagement) constraints. Online recoloring is a hard problem. One family of\ninstances which is fairly well-understood is bipartite graphs, in which two\ncolors are sufficient to satisfy all constraints. In this case it is known that\nthe competitive ratio of vertex recoloring is $\\Theta(\\log n)$.\n  We propose a generalization of the problem, which allows using additional\ncolors (possibly at a higher cost), to improve overall performance. We analyze\nthe simple case of bipartite graphs of bounded largest \\emph{bond} (a bond of a\nconnected graph is an edge-cut that partitions the graph into two connected\ncomponents). First, we propose two algorithms. One exhibits a trade-off for the\nuniform-cost case: given $\\Omega(\\log\\beta)\\le c\\le O(\\log n)$ colors, the\nalgorithm guarantees that its cost is at most $O(\\frac{\\log n}{c})$ times the\noptimal offline cost for two colors, where $n$ is the number of vertices and\n$\\beta$ is the size of the largest bond. The other algorithm is for the case\nwhere the additional colors come at a higher cost, $D>1$: given $\\Delta$\nadditional colors, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree in the graph, the\nalgorithm guarantees $O(\\log D)$ competitiveness. As to lower bounds, we show\nthat if the cost of the extra colors is $D>1$, no (randomized) algorithm can\nachieve a competitive ratio of $o(\\log D)$. We also show that for bipartite\ngraphs of unbounded bond size, any deterministic online algorithm has\ncompetitive ratio $\\Omega(\\min(D,\\log n))$.",

To address these challenges, we explore\nthe use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the\nperformance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation\nmethod that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward\nmodels and large-scale preference datasets.

By quantifying the impact of human\nfeedback, we believe that influence functions can enhance feedback\ninterpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in RLHF, helping labelers\nprovide more accurate and consistent feedback.

    "abstract": "In recent research, adversarial attacks on person detectors using patches or\nstatic 3D model-based texture modifications have struggled with low success\nrates due to the flexible nature of human movement. Modeling the 3D\ndeformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately,\nadvancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer\nnew possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking\napproach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human\nactions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV\nmapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and\nviewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter\nspace. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies,\nmodifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural\nnetwork parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB\nimages and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture\nedits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation\nover Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on\nunseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.75%\nattack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic\nvideo settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou\nattack, which only had a 28.50% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the\nlatest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings.

The results indicate that the\nbehaviour of BP in glass can be quantitatively understood in the following two\nsteps. First, the FSDP representing the largest structural correlation in glass\nis dominantly used to determine the unit size of the elastic modulus\nheterogeneity, and second, the magnitude of the elastic modulus fluctuation is\nused to determine the frequency and intensity of the BP.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) and its integration into\nvarious applications highlight the need for advanced communication,\ncomputation, and energy transfer techniques. However, the traditional\nhardware-based evolution of communication systems faces challenges due to\nexcessive power consumption and prohibitive hardware cost. With the rapid\nadvancement of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), a new approach by\nparallel stacking a series of RIS, i.e., multi-layer RIS, has been proposed.\nBenefiting from the characteristics of scalability, passivity, low cost, and\nenhanced computation capability, multi-layer RIS is a promising technology for\nfuture massive IoT scenarios. Thus, this article proposes a multi-layer\nRIS-based universal paradigm at the network edge, enabling three functions,\ni.e., multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, computation, and\nwireless power transfer (WPT). Starting by picturing the possible applications\nof multi-layer RIS, we explore the potential signal transmission links, energy\ntransmission links, and computation processes in IoT scenarios, showing its\nability to handle on-edge IoT tasks and associated green challenges. Then,\nthese three key functions are analyzed respectively in detail, showing the\nadvantages of the proposed scheme, compared with the traditional hardware-based\nscheme. To facilitate the implementation of this new paradigm into reality, we\nlist the dominant future research directions at last, such as inter-layer\nchannel modeling, resource allocation and scheduling, channel estimation, and\nedge training. It is anticipated that multi-layer RIS will contribute to more\nenergy-efficient wireless networks in the future by introducing a revolutionary\nparadigm shift to an all-wave-based approach.",

The model is highly sparse, focusing exclusively on the\nmost intense structures, which are represented by vortons: dynamically\nregularized quasi-singularities that experience rapid distortion from the\nlarge-scale shear. The vortons, in turn, influence the large-scale flow through\nthe sub-grid stress tensor. Despite its simplicity, the model displays an\ninteresting transition between two distinct regimes: (i) a laminar regime,\nwhere dissipation is entirely attributed to the large-scale flow, and the\nvortons dynamics is essentially diffusive, and (ii) a turbulent regime, in\nwhich most of the dissipation arises from the vortons. These regimes correspond\nto different scalings of dissipation and the Grashof number as functions of the\nReynolds number, with power-law relationships that resemble those observed in\nclassical turbulence.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based models have shown great promise in real-world image\nsuper-resolution (Real-ISR), but often generate content with structural errors\nand spurious texture details due to the empirical priors and illusions of these\nmodels. To address this issue, we introduce StructSR, a simple, effective, and\nplug-and-play method that enhances structural fidelity and suppresses spurious\ndetails for diffusion-based Real-ISR. StructSR operates without the need for\nadditional fine-tuning, external model priors, or high-level semantic\nknowledge. At its core is the Structure-Aware Screening (SAS) mechanism, which\nidentifies the image with the highest structural similarity to the\nlow-resolution (LR) input in the early inference stage, allowing us to leverage\nit as a historical structure knowledge to suppress the generation of spurious\ndetails. By intervening in the diffusion inference process, StructSR seamlessly\nintegrates with existing diffusion-based Real-ISR models. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that StructSR significantly improves the fidelity of\nstructure and texture, improving the PSNR and SSIM metrics by an average of\n5.27% and 9.36% on a synthetic dataset (DIV2K-Val) and 4.13% and 8.64% on two\nreal-world datasets (RealSR and DRealSR) when integrated with four\nstate-of-the-art diffusion-based Real-ISR methods.",

Previous\nstudies have proposed multiple approaches to eliminate the challenges posed by\nnon-iid data and inter-domain heterogeneity issues. However, they ignore the\n\\textbf{spatio-temporal} heterogeneity formed by different data distributions\nof increasing task data in the intra-domain. Moreover, the global data is\ngenerally a long-tailed distribution rather than assuming the global data is\nbalanced in practical applications. To tackle the \\textbf{spatio-temporal}\ndilemma, we propose a novel setting named \\textbf{Spatio-Temporal\nHeterogeneity} Federated Learning (STHFL). Specially, the Global-Local Dynamic\nPrototype (GLDP) framework is designed for STHFL. In GLDP, the model in each\nclient contains personalized layers which can dynamically adapt to different\ndata distributions. For long-tailed data distribution, global prototypes are\nserved as complementary knowledge for the training on classes with few samples\nin clients without leaking privacy. As tasks increase in clients, the knowledge\nof local prototypes generated in previous tasks guides for training in the\ncurrent task to solve catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, the global-local\nprototypes are updated through the moving average method after training local\nprototypes in clients. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of GLDP, which\nachieves remarkable results compared to state-of-the-art methods in STHFL\nscenarios.",

We examined over 86 million debunking tweets and more than 4\nmillion Reddit debunking comments to investigate the relationship between\nlanguage toxicity, pessimism, and social polarization in debunking efforts.\nFocusing on discussions of the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections and\nthe QAnon conspiracy theory, our analysis reveals three key findings: (1)\nperipheral participants (1-degree users) play a disproportionate role in\nshaping toxic discourse, driven by lower community accountability and emotional\nexpression; (2) platform mechanisms significantly influence polarization, with\nTwitter amplifying partisan differences and Reddit fostering higher overall\ntoxicity due to its structured, community-driven interactions; and (3) a\nnegative correlation exists between language toxicity and pessimism, with\nincreased interaction reducing toxicity, especially on Reddit. We show that\nplatform architecture affects informational complexity of user interactions,\nwith Twitter promoting concentrated, uniform discourse and Reddit encouraging\ndiverse, complex communication. Our findings highlight the importance of user\nengagement patterns, platform dynamics, and emotional expressions in shaping\npolarization in debunking discourse. This study offers insights for\npolicymakers and platform designers to mitigate harmful effects and promote\nhealthier online discussions, with implications for understanding\nmisinformation, hate speech, and political polarization in digital\nenvironments.",

Recently, various machine\nlearning-based strategies, e.g., image-based methods, have shown remarkable\nsuccess in predicting the halal status of cosmetics. However, these methods\nmainly focus on analyzing the discrete and specific ingredients within separate\ncosmetics, which ignore the high-order and complex relations between cosmetics\nand ingredients. To address this problem, we propose a halal cosmetic\nrecommendation framework, namely HaCKG, that leverages a knowledge graph of\ncosmetics and their ingredients to explicitly model and capture the\nrelationships between cosmetics and their components. By representing cosmetics\nand ingredients as entities within the knowledge graph, HaCKG effectively\nlearns the high-order and complex relations between entities, offering a robust\nmethod for predicting halal status. Specifically, we first construct a cosmetic\nknowledge graph representing the relations between various cosmetics,\ningredients, and their properties. We then propose a pre-trained relational\ngraph attention network model with residual connections to learn the structural\nrelation between entities in the knowledge graph. The pre-trained model is then\nfine-tuned on downstream cosmetic data to predict halal status. Extensive\nexperiments on the cosmetic dataset over halal prediction tasks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our model over state-of-the-art baselines.",

Although metasurfaces have shown\npromise in polarization control, the few studies focusing on the DoP often lack\nflexibility in manipulation. Here, we propose a novel approach using a\ndisordered metasurface to flexibly convert natural light into partially\npolarized light, enabling independent and flexible control over all Stokes\nparameters. The metasurface is composed of two types of meta-atoms, uniformly\ndistributed with specific quantity ratios, decoupling the design parameters in\nthe process of polarization control, and allowing a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween metasurface and polarization spaces. The azimuthal and elevation angles\nof the SoP on the Poincar\\'e sphere are independently controlled by the\nmeta-atom rotation and size, while the DoP is governed by the quantity ratio. A\ndeveloped algorithm determines the disordered metasurface arrangement, with\ntheoretical calculations showing an average error of less than 3{\\deg} for both\nthe azimuthal and elevation angles and a control accuracy of \\pm 0.05 for the\nDoP.",

Despite exponential advances in\nelectronic computer performance owing to Moore's Law and increasingly parallel\nsystem architectures, computer clock rates have remained stagnant at\n$\\sim5~\\mathrm{GHz}$ for almost two decades. This poses an intractable problem\nfor applications requiring real-time processing or control of ultrafast\ninformation systems. Here we break this barrier by proposing and experimentally\ndemonstrating computing based on an end-to-end and all-optical recurrent neural\nnetwork harnessing the ultrafast nature of linear and nonlinear optical\noperations while avoiding electronic operations. The all-optical computer\nrealizes linear operations, nonlinear functions, and memory entirely in the\noptical domain with $>100~\\mathrm{GHz}$ clock rates. We experimentally\ndemonstrate a prototypical task of noisy waveform classification as well as\nperform ultrafast in-situ analysis of the soliton states from integrated\noptical microresonators. We further illustrate the application of the\narchitecture for generative artificial intelligence based on quantum\nfluctuations to generate images even in the absence of input optical signals.\nOur results highlight the potential of all-optical computing beyond what can be\nachieved with digital electronics by utilizing ultrafast linear, nonlinear, and\nmemory functions and quantum fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "The early signs of cognitive decline are often noticeable in conversational\nspeech, and identifying those signs is crucial in dealing with later and more\nserious stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical detection is costly and\ntime-consuming and although there has been recent progress in the automatic\ndetection of speech-based cues, those systems are trained on relatively small\ndatabases, lacking detailed metadata and demographic information. This paper\npresents CognoSpeak and its associated data collection efforts. CognoSpeak asks\nmemory-probing long and short-term questions and administers standard cognitive\ntasks such as verbal and semantic fluency and picture description using a\nvirtual agent on a mobile or web platform. In addition, it collects multimodal\ndata such as audio and video along with a rich set of metadata from primary and\nsecondary care, memory clinics and remote settings like people's homes. Here,\nwe present results from 126 subjects whose audio was manually transcribed.\nSeveral classic classifiers, as well as large language model-based classifiers,\nhave been investigated and evaluated across the different types of prompts. We\ndemonstrate a high level of performance; in particular, we achieved an F1-score\nof 0.873 using a DistilBERT model to discriminate people with cognitive\nimpairment (dementia and people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) from\nhealthy volunteers using the memory responses, fluency tasks and cookie theft\npicture description.

We focus on size-structured\npopulations, where the growth rate of each individual is set at birth by\nheredity and/or random mutations. The fitness (or Malthus parameter, or\neffective fitness) of such heterogeneous population is defined by its long-term\nbehaviour, and we introduce the effective growth rate as the individual growth\nrate in the homogeneous population with the same fitness. We derive analytical\nformulae linking effective and individual growth rates in two paradigmatic\ncases: first, constant growth and division rates, second, linear growth rates\nand uniform fragmentation. Surprisingly, these two cases yield similar\nexpressions. Then, by comparing the fitness and the effective growth rates of\npopulations with different degrees of heterogeneity or different laws of\nheredity/mutation to those of average homogeneous populations, we\nquantitatively investigate the combined influence of heredity and\nheterogeneity, and revisit previous results stating that heterogeneity is\nbeneficial in the case of strong heredity.",

Moreover, motivated\nby our previous machine-learning analysis, we identify simple recursion\nrelations that relate the coefficient of a word to the coefficients of\nparticular lower-loop words. These results open an exciting door for\nunderstanding scattering amplitudes at all loop orders.",

    "abstract": "The low-altitude economy (LAE) plays an indispensable role in cargo\ntransportation, healthcare, infrastructure inspection, and especially\npost-disaster communication. Specifically, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as\none of the core technologies of the LAE, can be deployed to provide\ncommunication coverage, facilitate data collection, and relay data for trapped\nusers, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of post-disaster response\nefforts. In this paper, we design an efficient and robust UAV-swarm enabled\ncollaborative self-organizing network to facilitate post-disaster\ncommunications. Specifically, a ground device transmits data to UAV swarms,\nwhich then use collaborative beamforming (CB) technique to form virtual antenna\narrays and relay the data to a remote access point (AP) efficiently. Then, we\nformulate a rescue-oriented post-disaster transmission rate maximization\noptimization problem (RPTRMOP). Then, we propose a two-stage optimization\napproach to address it. In the first stage, the optimal traffic routing and the\ntheoretical upper bound on the transmission rate of the network are derived. In\nthe second stage, we transform the formulated RPTRMOP into a variant named\nV-RPTRMOP, and a diffusion model-enabled particle swarm optimization (DM-PSO)\nalgorithm is proposed to deal with the V-RPTRMOP. Simulation results show the\neffectiveness of the proposed two-stage optimization approach in improving the\ntransmission rate of the constructed network, which demonstrates the great\npotential for post-disaster communications. Moreover, the robustness of the\nconstructed network is also validated via evaluating the impact of two\nunexpected situations on the system transmission rate.",

    "abstract": "Despite the broad successes of the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model and its fitness to\nthe various cosmological observations, it confronts challenges stemming from\nanomalies in the measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the amplitude\nof matter fluctuations ($\\sigma_8$). These inconsistencies have necessitated a\nreassessment of the model parameters, with a particular focus on their\npotential dependence on redshift. This study pioneers a new investigation to\nprobe this redshift dependency by generating mock data simulated from\nobservational data of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and cosmic chronometers (CC),\nthereby increasing the data density in this field. By sorting the data into\nhigh-redshift and low-redshift bins, we aim to refine the cosmological\nconstraints on the parameters of the $\\Lambda$CDM model and determine whether\nthe noted dependence on redshift is due to a lack of high-redshift\nobservational data or if they signify intrinsic issues within the model itself.\nOur approach employs the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to minimize\nthe $\\chi^2$ function, thus tightening the cosmological constraints. Our\nfindings within the mock analysis reveal discrepancies between the values of\n$\\Omega_{m0}$ and $H_0$ derived from the mock data bins with high redshift and\nlow redshift, indicating the potential deviation of the standard $\\Lambda$ CDM\ncosmology from the high-redshift SNIa and CC data. If this deviation proposes a\nnew physics beyond the standard model, then with better quality future data\ntracking the new physics, these discrepancies will be statistically\nsignificant.",

Due to the small\nmagnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the absorption process is\nprohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this\ndepression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the\nsimple Bose gas model.

VRA-DGT integrates the Variance-Reduced Aggregation (VRA)\nmechanism with the distributed gradient tracking framework, which achieves a\nconvergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(k^{-1}\\right)$ in the mean-square sense\nwhen the objective function is strongly convex and smooth.

Furthermore, it is shown that the\nsubrelativistic limit presents new corrections that have not been considered in\nprevious work. We discuss the conformal invariance of the MHD equations for a\nradiation-dominated fluid and different types of scaling of the fluid variables\nthat are relevant for other equations of state when the bulk velocity is\nsubrelativistic. In particular, we review the super-comoving coordinates that\nscale the time coordinate with the Universe expansion, and present a particular\nchoice that allows the equations to become conformally flat for any choice of\nthe equation of state. Imperfect relativistic fluids are briefly described but\ntheir detailed study is not included in this work. We review the propagation of\nsound waves, Alfv\\'en waves, and magnetosonic waves in the early Universe\nplasma. The Boris correction for relativistic Alfv\\'en speeds is presented and\nadapted for early Universe applications.

The next-generation architecture, aiming at retaining\nthe competitive performance of SA while achieving low-cost inference and\nefficient long-sequence training, primarily focuses on three approaches: linear\nattention, linear RNNs, and state space models. Although these approaches\nachieve reduced complexity than SA, they all have built-in performance\ndegradation factors, such as diminished “spikiness” and compression of\nhistorical information. In contrast to these approaches, we propose a novel\nelement-wise attention mechanism, which uses the element-wise squared Euclidean\ndistance, instead of the dot product operation, to compute similarity and\napproximates the quadratic complexity term $\\exp(q_{ic}k_{jc})$ with a Taylor\npolynomial.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been effective in\nzero-shot tasks by leveraging their general knowledge from large-scale\ndatasets. Recent studies demonstrate that transformer-based models with\nclass-wise queries can effectively address zero-shot multi-label\nclassification. However, poor utilization of the relationship between seen and\nunseen attributes makes the model lack generalizability. Additionally,\nattribute classification generally involves many attributes, making maintaining\nthe model's scalability difficult. To address these issues, we propose\nSuper-class guided transFormer (SugaFormer), a novel framework that leverages\nsuper-classes to enhance scalability and generalizability for zero-shot\nattribute classification. SugaFormer employs Super-class Query Initialization\n(SQI) to reduce the number of queries, utilizing common semantic information\nfrom super-classes, and incorporates Multi-context Decoding (MD) to handle\ndiverse visual cues. To strengthen generalizability, we introduce two knowledge\ntransfer strategies that utilize VLMs. During training, Super-class guided\nConsistency Regularization (SCR) aligns model's features with VLMs using\nsuper-class guided prompts, and during inference, Zero-shot Retrieval-based\nScore Enhancement (ZRSE) refines predictions for unseen attributes.

This paper explores enhancing critique\nabilities of LLMs, noting that current approaches rely on human annotations or\nmore powerful models, leaving the challenge of improving critique abilities\nwithout external supervision unresolved. We introduce SCRIT (Self-evolving\nCRITic), a framework that trains LLMs with self-generated data to evolve their\ncritique abilities.

The final trained\nmodel operates without any reference solutions at inference time.

The asymmetric molecular line profiles\nare widely present in the surrounding gas around local-standard-of-rest\nvelocity +20 km s$^{-1}$. The secondary components centered at $\\sim$+16km\ns$^{-1}$ in the belt and $\\sim$+26 km s$^{-1}$ in the northern clump can be\nascribed to the motion of a wind-blown molecular shell. This explanation is\nsupported by the position-velocity diagram along a line cutting across the\nremnant, which shows an arc-like pattern, suggesting an expanding gas\nstructure. With the simulation of chemical effects of shock propagation, the\nabundance ratios $N$(HCO$^+$)/$N$($^{12}$CO) $\\sim2.6\\times\n10^{-5}$--$3.6\\times 10^{-4}$ obtained in the belt can be more naturally\ninterpreted by the wind-driven bubble shock than by the SNR shock.

The study focuses on the interplay of magnetoelastic\n(ME), electromagnetic-spin (EMS), and acousticelectromagnetic (AEM)\ninteractions in ferromagnetic dielectrics and metals. By deriving dispersion\nequations for coupled waves, the research reveals how the dynamic properties of\nmagnetically ordered crystals evolve in response to these interactions under\nvarying external magnetic fields and near OPT points. The ME interaction\nprominently influences spin and elastic wave dynamics, giving rise to coupled\nmodes such as quasimagnon and quasi-acoustic waves. Near the OPT, these\ninteractions become dominant, leading to phenomena like the magnetoelastic gap\nand softening of vibrational modes. The EMS interaction significantly alters\nthe activation energy and dispersion of quasi-spin and quasi-electromagnetic\nwaves. In ferromagnetic metals, helicons (weakly damped electromagnetic waves)\nexhibit strong coupling with spin and elastic waves, particularly in the OPT\nregion. The study identifies conditions for triple resonance among spin,\nelastic, and electromagnetic waves. Additionally, it explores the\nfrequency-dependent rotation of polarization planes in electromagnetic and\nmagnetoelastic waves, which sharpens near OPT points. These results provide a\ndeeper understanding of the coupled dynamics in ferromagnetic materials, paving\nthe way for new technological applications in spintronics, signal processing,\nand advanced magneto-optical devices.

In proton-proton\ninteractions studies of hadron jets devote to the better understanding of some\nbasic features of strong interaction and search for the physics beyond of\nStandard Model. First results have been obtained for massive gauge bosons and\nantitop-top pair production in proton-nuclear and heavy ion collisions at\nmulti-TeV energies. The collectivity has been observed for various particle and\nbeam species, in particular, in collision of small systems. Experimental\nresults obtained for discrete symmetries of strong interaction at finite\ntemperature confirm indirectly the topologically non-trivial structure of the\nvacuum. The recent measurements of femtoscopic correlations provide, in\nparticular, the indirect estimations for parameters of hyperon-nucleon\npotentials which are essential for study of inner structure of compact\nastrophysical objects.

Thus studies of collective effects\nin strong interaction processes provide new important results for relativistic\nastrophysics, cosmology and cosmic ray physics, i.e. have interdisciplinary\nsignificance.",

    "abstract": "The recent widespread adoption of drones for studying marine animals provides\nopportunities for deriving biological information from aerial imagery. The\nlarge scale of imagery data acquired from drones is well suited for machine\nlearning (ML) analysis. Development of ML models for analyzing marine animal\naerial imagery has followed the classical paradigm of training, testing, and\ndeploying a new model for each dataset, requiring significant time, human\neffort, and ML expertise. We introduce Frame Level ALIgment and tRacking\n(FLAIR), which leverages the video understanding of Segment Anything Model 2\n(SAM2) and the vision-language capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training (CLIP). FLAIR takes a drone video as input and outputs\nsegmentation masks of the species of interest across the video. Notably, FLAIR\nleverages a zero-shot approach, eliminating the need for labeled data, training\na new model, or fine-tuning an existing model to generalize to other species.\nWith a dataset of 18,000 drone images of Pacific nurse sharks, we trained\nstate-of-the-art object detection models to compare against FLAIR. We show that\nFLAIR massively outperforms these object detectors and performs competitively\nagainst two human-in-the-loop methods for prompting SAM2, achieving a Dice\nscore of 0.81. FLAIR readily generalizes to other shark species without\nadditional human effort and can be combined with novel heuristics to\nautomatically extract relevant information including length and tailbeat\nfrequency. FLAIR has significant potential to accelerate aerial imagery\nanalysis workflows, requiring markedly less human effort and expertise than\ntraditional machine learning workflows, while achieving superior accuracy. By\nreducing the effort required for aerial imagery analysis, FLAIR allows\nscientists to spend more time interpreting results and deriving insights about\nmarine ecosystems.",

However, several artifacts complicate the direct interpretation\nof experimental data. For instance, in the case of energy dispersive x-ray\n(EDX) spectroscopy, the linear dependency of local x-ray emission on\ncomposition is disrupted by channeling effects and cross-talk during electron\nbeam propagation. To address these challenges, it becomes necessary to adopt an\napproach that combines experimental data with inelastic scattering simulations.\nThis method aims to account for the effects of electron beam propagation on\nx-ray emission, essentially determining the quantity and the spatial origin of\nthe collected signal. In this publication, we propose to assess the precision\nand sensitivity limits of this approach in a practical case study involving a\nfocused ion beam (FIB)-prepared III-N multilayers device. The device features\nnominally pure ~1.5-nm wide GaN quantum wells surrounded by AlGaN barriers\ncontaining a low concentration of aluminum (~5 at. %). By employing\natomic-scale EDX acquisitions based on the averaging of more than several\nthousand frames, calibrated $\\zeta$-factors combined with a multi-layer x-ray\nabsorption correction model for quantification, and by comparing the x-ray\nradiation obtained from the quantum well with a reference 10-nm thick\nstructure, we demonstrate that the quantitative impact of beam propagation on\nchemical composition can be precisely accounted for, resulting in a composition\nsensitivity at the atomic scale as low as +-0.25 at.%. Finally, practical\naspects to achieve this high precision level are discussed, particularly in\nterms of inelastic multislice simulation, uncertainty determination, and sample\nquality.",

    "abstract": "In this short note, a non-intrusive data-driven formulation of ADI-based\nlow-rank balanced truncation is provided. The proposed algorithm only requires\ntransfer function samples at the mirror images of ADI shifts. If some shifts\nare used in both approximating the controllability Gramian and the\nobservability Gramian, then samples of the transfer function's derivative at\nthese shifts are also needed to enforce Hermite interpolation in the Loewner\nframework. It is noted that ADI-based low-rank balanced truncation can be\nviewed as a two-step process. The first step involves constructing an\ninterpolant of the original model at the mirror images of the ADI shifts, which\ncan be done non-intrusively within the Loewner framework. The second step\ninvolves reducing this interpolant using low-rank factors of Gramians\nassociated with the interpolation data through the balanced square-root\nalgorithm. This second step does not require any system information, making the\noverall process non-intrusive with the only required information being samples\nof the transfer function and/or its derivative at the mirror images of ADI\nshifts. Furthermore, it is shown that when the order of the reduced model in\nADI-based low-rank balanced truncation is selected to match the numerical rank\nof the low-rank factors of the Gramians, it effectively reduces to standard\ninterpolation at the mirror images of the ADI shift. An illustrative example is\nprovided to explain the proposed approach.",

These graphical representations can help\nresearchers, policymakers, and the public to better comprehend and respond to a\nmultitude of issues. In this study, we explore a visualization tool to\ninterpret and understand various data of COVID-19 pandemic. While others have\nshown COVID-19 visualization methods/tools, our tool provides a mean to analyze\nCOVID-19 data in a more comprehensive way. We have used the public data from NY\nTimes and CDC, and various COVID-19 data (e.g., core places, patterns, foot\ntraffic) from Safegraph. Figure 1 shows the basic view of our visualization\nview. In addition to providing visualizations of these data, our visualization\nalso considered the Surprising Map. The Surprising Map is a type of choropleth\nmap that can avoid misleading of producing visual prominence to known base\nrates or to artifacts of sample size and normalization in visualizing the\ndensity of events in spatial data. It is based on Bayesian surprise-it creates\na space of equi-plausible models and uses Bayesian updating to re-estimate\ntheir plausibility based on individual events.",

    "abstract": "Multilingual Pre-trained Language models (multiPLMs), trained on the Masked\nLanguage Modelling (MLM) objective are commonly being used for cross-lingual\ntasks such as bitext mining. However, the performance of these models is still\nsuboptimal for low-resource languages (LRLs). To improve the language\nrepresentation of a given multiPLM, it is possible to further pre-train it.\nThis is known as continual pre-training. Previous research has shown that\ncontinual pre-training with MLM and subsequently with Translation Language\nModelling (TLM) improves the cross-lingual representation of multiPLMs.\nHowever, during masking, both MLM and TLM give equal weight to all tokens in\nthe input sequence, irrespective of the linguistic properties of the tokens. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel masking strategy, Linguistic Entity Masking\n(LEM) to be used in the continual pre-training step to further improve the\ncross-lingual representations of existing multiPLMs. In contrast to MLM and\nTLM, LEM limits masking to the linguistic entity types nouns, verbs and named\nentities, which hold a higher prominence in a sentence. Secondly, we limit\nmasking to a single token within the linguistic entity span thus keeping more\ncontext, whereas, in MLM and TLM, tokens are masked randomly. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of LEM using three downstream tasks, namely bitext mining,\nparallel data curation and code-mixed sentiment analysis using three\nlow-resource language pairs English-Sinhala, English-Tamil, and Sinhala-Tamil.\nExperiment results show that continually pre-training a multiPLM with LEM\noutperforms a multiPLM continually pre-trained with MLM+TLM for all three\ntasks.",

SSOs are further exacerbated when grids become weaker\nbecause lines are disconnected due to maintenance or following faults. Such\nundesirable oscillations have also led to curtailment of inverter-based\nresource (IBR) outputs. In contrast to most literature addressing the issue by\nretuning/redesigning of standard IBR controllers, we propose a robust adaptive\nsupplementary control for damping of such SSOs while keeping standard controls\nunaltered. As a result, uncertainty in system conditions can be handled without\nnegatively impacting the nominal IBR performance. To that end, the adaptive\ncontrol law is derived for a GFLC connected to the grid, where the grid is\nmodeled by the Thevenin's equivalent representation with uncertainty and\ndisturbances. The theoretical result provides dissipativity certificate for the\nclosed-loop error dynamics with sufficient conditions for stability. The\neffectiveness of the developed controller is validated with several case\nstudies conducted on a single-GFLC-infinite-bus test system, the IEEE $2$-area\ntest system, wherein some of the synchronous generators are replaced by GFLCs,\nand a modified IEEE $5$-area test system with two GFLCs. The findings\ndemonstrate that under very weak grid conditions, the proposed robust adaptive\ncontrol performs well in stabilizing SSO modes, which a classical\nstate-feedback control method fails to address.",

    "abstract": "Scene Graph Generation(SGG) is a scene understanding task that aims at\nidentifying object entities and reasoning their relationships within a given\nimage. In contrast to prevailing two-stage methods based on a large object\ndetector (e.g., Faster R-CNN), one-stage methods integrate a fixed-size set of\nlearnable queries to jointly reason relational triplets <subject, predicate,\nobject>. This paradigm demonstrates robust performance with significantly\nreduced parameters and computational overhead. However, the challenge in\none-stage methods stems from the issue of weak entanglement, wherein entities\ninvolved in relationships require both coupled features shared within triplets\nand decoupled visual features. Previous methods either adopt a single decoder\nfor coupled triplet feature modeling or multiple decoders for separate visual\nfeature extraction but fail to consider both. In this paper, we introduce UniQ,\na Unified decoder with task-specific Queries architecture, where task-specific\nqueries generate decoupled visual features for subjects, objects, and\npredicates respectively, and unified decoder enables coupled feature modeling\nwithin relational triplets. Experimental results on the Visual Genome dataset\ndemonstrate that UniQ has superior performance to both one-stage and two-stage\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) typically involves learning common\nrepresentations to directly measure similarities between multimodal samples.\nMost existing CMR methods commonly assume multimodal samples in pairs and\nemploy joint training to learn common representations, limiting the flexibility\nof CMR. Although some methods adopt independent training strategies for each\nmodality to improve flexibility in CMR, they utilize the randomly initialized\northogonal matrices to guide representation learning, which is suboptimal since\nthey assume inter-class samples are independent of each other, limiting the\npotential of semantic alignments between sample representations and\nground-truth labels. To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed\nDeep Reversible Consistency Learning (DRCL) for cross-modal retrieval. DRCL\nincludes two core modules, \\ie Selective Prior Learning (SPL) and Reversible\nSemantic Consistency learning (RSC). More specifically, SPL first learns a\ntransformation weight matrix on each modality and selects the best one based on\nthe quality score as the Prior, which greatly avoids blind selection of priors\nlearned from low-quality modalities. Then, RSC employs a Modality-invariant\nRepresentation Recasting mechanism (MRR) to recast the potential\nmodality-invariant representations from sample semantic labels by the\ngeneralized inverse matrix of the prior. Since labels are devoid of\nmodal-specific information, we utilize the recast features to guide the\nrepresentation learning, thus maintaining semantic consistency to the fullest\nextent possible. In addition, a feature augmentation mechanism (FA) is\nintroduced in RSC to encourage the model to learn over a wider data\ndistribution for diversity. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on five\nwidely used datasets and comparisons with 15 state-of-the-art baselines\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our DRCL.",

We then show the consistency\nbetween SSI and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak\nlensing and galaxy clustering analyses of DES Y6. The consistency between the\ntwo catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing\nproperties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.).

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, diffusion models have emerged as novel AI solutions,\ngenerating diverse multi-modal outputs from text prompts. Despite their\ncapabilities, they face challenges in computing, such as excessive latency and\nenergy consumption due to their iterative architecture. Although prior works\nspecialized in transformer acceleration can be applied, the iterative nature of\ndiffusion models remains unresolved. In this paper, we present EXION, the first\nSW-HW co-designed diffusion accelerator that solves the computation challenges\nby exploiting the unique inter- and intra-iteration output sparsity in\ndiffusion models. To this end, we propose two SW-level optimizations. First, we\nintroduce the FFN-Reuse algorithm that identifies and skips redundant\ncomputations in FFN layers across different iterations (inter-iteration\nsparsity). Second, we use a modified eager prediction method that employs\ntwo-step leading-one detection to accurately predict the attention score,\nskipping unnecessary computations within an iteration (intra-iteration\nsparsity). We also introduce a novel data compaction mechanism named ConMerge,\nwhich can enhance HW utilization by condensing and merging sparse matrices into\ncompact forms. Finally, it has a dedicated HW architecture that supports the\nabove sparsity-inducing algorithms, translating high output sparsity into\nimproved energy efficiency and performance. To verify the feasibility of the\nEXION, we first demonstrate that it has no impact on accuracy in various types\nof multi-modal diffusion models. We then instantiate EXION in both server- and\nedge-level settings and compare its performance against GPUs with similar\nspecifications. Our evaluation shows that EXION achieves dramatic improvements\nin performance and energy efficiency by 3.2-379.3x and 45.1-3067.6x compared to\na server GPU and by 42.6-1090.9x and 196.9-4668.2x compared to an edge GPU.",

Compared with previous\ntechniques, our algorithm allows us to detect shots with lower amplitudes and\nshorter time separations. With NICER observations, we find that, after\ncorrection for detection sensitivity, both the shot amplitude and recurrence\nrate are positively scaled with the mean count rate, while the recurrence rate\nhas a much higher dependence on the count rate. These suggest that a higher\nmass accretion rate will drive more and slightly larger shots.

    "abstract": "Network services are increasingly managed by considering chained-up virtual\nnetwork functions and relevant traffic flows, known as the Service Function\nChains (SFCs). To deal with sequential arrivals of SFCs in an online fashion,\nwe must consider two closely-coupled problems - an SFC placement problem that\nmaps SFCs to servers/links in the network and an SFC scheduling problem that\ndetermines when each SFC is executed. Solving the whole SFC problem targeting\nthese two optimizations jointly is extremely challenging. In this paper, we\npropose a novel network diffuser using conditional generative modeling for this\nSFC placing-scheduling optimization. Recent advances in generative AI and\ndiffusion models have made it possible to generate high-quality images/videos\nand decision trajectories from language description. We formulate the SFC\noptimization as a problem of generating a state sequence for planning and\nperform graph diffusion on the state trajectories to enable extraction of SFC\ndecisions, with SFC optimization constraints and objectives as conditions. To\naddress the lack of demonstration data due to NP-hardness and exponential\nproblem space of the SFC optimization, we also propose a novel and somewhat\nmaverick approach -- Rather than solving instances of this difficult\noptimization, we start with randomly-generated solutions as input, and then\ndetermine appropriate SFC optimization problems that render these solutions\nfeasible. This inverse demonstration enables us to obtain sufficient expert\ndemonstrations, i.e., problem-solution pairs, through further optimization. In\nour numerical evaluations, the proposed network diffuser outperforms learning\nand heuristic baselines, by $\\sim$20\\% improvement in SFC reward and $\\sim$50\\%\nreduction in SFC waiting time and blocking rate.",

    "abstract": "In quantum theory, the inescapable interaction between a system and its\nsurroundings would lead to a loss of coherence and leakage of information into\nthe environment. An effective approach to retain the quantum characteristics of\nthe system is to decouple it from the environment. However, things get\ncomplicated in quantum parameter estimation tasks, especially when the unknown\nparameter originates from the environment. Here, we propose a general dynamical\nmodulation scheme that enables the enhancement of estimation precision\nirrespective of the origin of the parameters to be estimated. Notably, beyond\nthe capability of dynamically decoupling the system from the environment, our\nproposal can select the effective frequency of the system and in turn\nmanipulate the dynamics of the system, such as the steady-state probability and\nthe decay rate, which are sensitive to the bath parameter. Therefore, the\nquantum Fisher information is dramatically increased, leading to superior\nestimation precision. Specifically, we elucidate the effectiveness of our\nproposal with prototypical examples of the Ramsey spectroscopy and quantum\nthermometer.

    "abstract": "We develop a novel framework for fully decentralized offloading policy design\nin multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems. The system comprises $N$\npower-constrained user equipments (UEs) assisted by an edge server (ES) to\nprocess incoming tasks. Tasks are labeled with urgency flags, and in this\npaper, we classify them under three urgency levels, namely, high, moderate, and\nlow urgency. We formulate the problem of designing computation decisions for\nthe UEs within a large population noncooperative game framework, where each UE\nselfishly decides on how to split task execution between its local onboard\nprocessor and the ES. We employ the weighted average age of information (AoI)\nmetric to quantify information freshness at the UEs. Increased onboard\nprocessing consumes more local power, while increased offloading may\npotentially incur a higher average AoI due to other UEs' packets being\noffloaded to the same ES. Thus, we use the mean-field game (MFG) formulation to\ncompute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium offloading and local\ncomputation policies for the UEs to balance between the information freshness\nand local power consumption. Finally, we provide a projected gradient\ndescent-based algorithm to numerically assess the merits of our approach.",

Existing research excels\nin removing such parameters or merging the outputs of multiple different\npretrained models.

The\nintegrated model can be used directly for inference or for further fine-tuning.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on various datasets for recommendation and\nlanguage tasks, and the results show that Compatibility-aware Knowledge\nIntegration can effectively optimize incompatible parameters under multiple\ntasks and settings to break through the training limit of the original model\nwithout increasing the inference cost.",

Machine learning (ML)-based methods for solving key\nproblems in storage system efficiency, such as data placement, have shown\nsignificant promise. However, there are few known practical deployments of such\nmethods. Studying this problem in the context of real-world hyperscale data\ncenters at Google, we identify a number of challenges that we believe cause\nthis lack of practical adoption. Specifically, prior work assumes a monolithic\nmodel that resides entirely within the storage layer, an unrealistic assumption\nin real-world deployments with frequently changing workloads. To address this\nproblem, we introduce a cross-layer approach where workloads instead ''bring\ntheir own model''. This strategy moves ML out of the storage system and instead\nallows each workload to train its own lightweight model at the application\nlayer, capturing the workload's specific characteristics. These small,\ninterpretable models generate predictions that guide a co-designed scheduling\nheuristic at the storage layer, enabling adaptation to diverse online\nenvironments. We build a proof-of-concept of this approach in a production\ndistributed computation framework at Google.

With the addition of these two objects, the emerging class of\ndouble-faced white dwarfs now consists of seven members.

Fortunately, small\nrecommendation models (SRMs) can effectively supplement these shortcomings of\nLLM4Rec diagrams by consuming minimal resources for frequent training and\ninference, and by conveniently accessing real-time data on devices.\n  In light of this, we designed the Device-Cloud LLM-SRM Collaborative\nRecommendation Framework (LSC4Rec) under a device-cloud collaboration setting.\nLSC4Rec aims to integrate the advantages of both LLMs and SRMs, as well as the\nbenefits of cloud and edge computing, achieving a complementary synergy.

During inference, LLM and SRM are deployed on\nthe cloud and on the device, respectively. LLM generates candidate lists and\ninitial ranking results based on user behavior, and SRM get reranking results\nbased on the candidate list, with final results integrating both LLM's and\nSRM's scores.

    "abstract": "Error accumulation is effective for gradient sparsification in distributed\nsettings: initially-unselected gradient entries are eventually selected as\ntheir accumulated error exceeds a certain level. The accumulation essentially\nbehaves as a scaling of the learning rate for the selected entries. Although\nthis property prevents the slow-down of lateral movements in distributed\ngradient descent, it can deteriorate convergence in some settings. This work\nproposes a novel sparsification scheme that controls the learning rate scaling\nof error accumulation. The development of this scheme follows two major steps:\nfirst, gradient sparsification is formulated as an inverse probability\n(inference) problem, and the Bayesian optimal sparsification mask is derived as\na maximum-a-posteriori estimator. Using the prior distribution inherited from\nTop-$k$, we derive a new sparsification algorithm which can be interpreted as a\nregularized form of Top-$k$. We call this algorithm regularized Top-$k$\n(RegTop-$k$). It utilizes past aggregated gradients to evaluate posterior\nstatistics of the next aggregation. It then prioritizes the local accumulated\ngradient entries based on these posterior statistics. We validate our\nderivation through numerical experiments. In distributed linear regression, it\nis observed that while Top-$k$ remains at a fixed distance from the global\noptimum, RegTop-$k$ converges to the global optimum at significantly higher\ncompression ratios. We further demonstrate the generalization of this\nobservation by employing RegTop-$k$ in distributed training of ResNet-18 on\nCIFAR-10, where it noticeably outperforms Top-$k$.",

The widespread use of Variational Models,\nDiffusion Models, and Generative Adversarial Networks has made it easier to\ngenerate convincing fake images and videos, which poses significant challenges\nfor detecting and mitigating the spread of misinformation. As a result,\ndeveloping effective methods for detecting AI-generated fakes has become a\npressing concern. In our research, we propose HFMF, a comprehensive two-stage\ndeepfake detection framework that leverages both hierarchical cross-modal\nfeature fusion and multi-stream feature extraction to enhance detection\nperformance against imagery produced by state-of-the-art generative AI models.\nThe first component of our approach integrates vision Transformers and\nconvolutional nets through a hierarchical feature fusion mechanism. The second\ncomponent of our framework combines object-level information and a fine-tuned\nconvolutional net model. We then fuse the outputs from both components via an\nensemble deep neural net, enabling robust classification performances.

Our research addresses this critical need by studying the\nperformance and scaling behavior of multilingual LLMs in text classification\nand machine translation tasks across 204 languages. We systematically examine\nboth seen and unseen languages across three model families of varying sizes in\nzero-shot and few-shot settings. Our findings show significant differences in\nscaling behavior between zero-shot and two-shot scenarios, with striking\ndisparities in performance between seen and unseen languages. Model scale has\nlittle effect on zero-shot performance, which remains mostly flat. However, in\ntwo-shot settings, larger models show clear linear improvements in multilingual\ntext classification. For translation tasks, however, only the instruction-tuned\nmodel showed clear benefits from scaling. Our analysis also suggests that\noverall resource levels, not just the proportions of pretraining languages, are\nbetter predictors of model performance, shedding light on what drives\nmultilingual LLM effectiveness.",
