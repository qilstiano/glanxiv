    "abstract": "A wealth of studies report evidence that occipitotemporal cortex tessellates\ninto \"category-selective\" brain regions that are apparently specialized for\nrepresenting ecologically important visual stimuli like faces, bodies, scenes,\nand tools. Here, we argue that while valuable insights have been gained through\nthe lens of category-selectivity, a more complete view of visual function in\noccipitotemporal cortex requires centering the behavioral relevance of visual\nproperties in real-world environments rather than stimulus category. Focusing\non behavioral relevance challenges a simple mapping between stimulus and visual\nfunction in occipitotemporal cortex because the environmental properties\nrelevant to a behavior are visually diverse and how a given property is\nrepresented is modulated by our goals. Grounding our thinking in behavioral\nrelevance rather than category-selectivity raises a host of theoretical and\nempirical issues that we discuss while providing proposals for how existing\ntools can be harnessed in this light to better understand visual function in\noccipitotemporal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI (GenAI) technologies possess unprecedented potential to reshape\nour world and our perception of reality. These technologies can amplify\ntraditionally human-centered capabilities, such as creativity and complex\nproblem-solving in socio-technical contexts. By fostering human-AI\ncollaboration, GenAI could enhance productivity, dismantle communication\nbarriers across abilities and cultures, and drive innovation on a global scale.\nYet, experts and the public are deeply divided on the implications of GenAI.\nConcerns range from issues like copyright infringement and the rights of\ncreators whose work trains these models without explicit consent, to the\nconditions of those employed to annotate vast datasets. Accordingly, new laws\nand regulatory frameworks are emerging to address these unique challenges.\nOthers point to broader issues, such as economic disruptions from automation\nand the potential impact on labor markets. Although history suggests that\nsociety can adapt to such technological upheavals, the scale and complexity of\nGenAI's impact warrant careful scrutiny. This paper, however, highlights a\nsubtler, yet potentially more perilous risk of GenAI: the creation of\n$\\textit{personalized synthetic realities}$. GenAI could enable individuals to\nexperience a reality customized to personal desires or shaped by external\ninfluences, effectively creating a \"filtered\" worldview unique to each person.\nSuch personalized synthetic realities could distort how people perceive and\ninteract with the world, leading to a fragmented understanding of shared\ntruths. This paper seeks to raise awareness about these profound and\nmultifaceted risks, emphasizing the potential of GenAI to fundamentally alter\nthe very fabric of our collective reality.",

In this paper, we advocate\nthat the dynamic and event-driven nature of time-series data makes RAG a\ncrucial component of TSFMs and introduce a principled RAG framework for\ntime-series forecasting, called Retrieval Augmented Forecasting (RAF). Within\nRAF, we develop efficient strategies for retrieving related time-series\nexamples and incorporating them into forecast.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed on edge devices, known as edge LLMs,\nneed to continuously fine-tune their model parameters from user-generated data\nunder limited resource constraints. However, most existing learning methods are\nnot applicable for edge LLMs because of their reliance on high resources and\nlow learning capacity. Prompt tuning (PT) has recently emerged as an effective\nfine-tuning method for edge LLMs by only modifying a small portion of LLM\nparameters, but it suffers from user domain shifts, resulting in repetitive\ntraining and losing resource efficiency. Conventional techniques to address\ndomain shift issues often involve complex neural networks and sophisticated\ntraining, which are incompatible for PT for edge LLMs. Therefore, an open\nresearch question is how to address domain shift issues for edge LLMs with\nlimited resources. In this paper, we propose a prompt tuning framework for edge\nLLMs, exploiting the benefits offered by non-volatile computing-in-memory\n(NVCiM) architectures. We introduce a novel NVCiM-assisted PT framework, where\nwe narrow down the core operations to matrix-matrix multiplication, which can\nthen be accelerated by performing in-situ computation on NVCiM. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first work employing NVCiM to improve the edge LLM\nPT performance.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we explore the use of Co-55 as a radioisotope for multiplexed\nPET (mPET) by utilizing its emission of a prompt gamma-ray in cascade with a\npositron during decay. We leverage the prompt-gamma signal to generate triple\ncoincidences for a Co-55-labeled tracer, allowing us to distinguish it from a\ntracer labeled with a pure positron emitter, such as F-18. By employing triple\nversus double coincidence detection and signal processing methodology, we\nsuccessfully separate the Co-55 signal from that of F-18. Phantom studies were\nconducted to establish the correlation between Co-55 double and triple\ncoincidence counts and Co-55 activity. Additionally, we demonstrate the\npotential for quantifying hot spots within a warm background produced by both\nCo-55 and F-18 signals in a single PET scan.

While traditional OOD detection has primarily focused on\nsingle-modality inputs, such as images, recent advances in multimodal models\nhave demonstrated the potential of leveraging multiple modalities (e.g., video,\noptical flow, audio) to enhance detection performance. However, existing\nmethods often overlook intra-class variability within in-distribution (ID)\ndata, assuming that samples of the same class are perfectly cohesive and\nconsistent. This assumption can lead to performance degradation, especially\nwhen prediction discrepancies are uniformly amplified across all samples. To\naddress this issue, we propose Dynamic Prototype Updating (DPU), a novel\nplug-and-play framework for multimodal OOD detection that accounts for\nintra-class variations. Our method dynamically updates class center\nrepresentations for each class by measuring the variance of similar samples\nwithin each batch, enabling adaptive adjustments. This approach allows us to\namplify prediction discrepancies based on the updated class centers, thereby\nimproving the model's robustness and generalization across different\nmodalities. Extensive experiments on two tasks, five datasets, and nine base\nOOD algorithms demonstrate that DPU significantly improves OOD detection\nperformance, setting a new state-of-the-art in multimodal OOD detection, with\nimprovements of up to 80 percent in Far-OOD detection.

To quantify\ninfluences of shape irregularity and orientation, this study numerically\ninvestigates the drag in creeping flows for fractally rough grains depicted by\nSpherical Harmonics. As the grain surface becomes more angular with increasing\nrelative roughness and fractal dimension, a stronger drag reduction is\nobserved; this observed morphology-dependent reduction indicates Stokes formula\nis insufficient. The rotational dependence helps to explain the paradox wherein\ndrag enhancement is always encountered insettling-grain experiments popular in\ngeophysics.

A shared\ndecoder uses the input current, previous neuronal activity, neuron embedding,\nand behavioral data to predict the population activity in the next time step.\nUnlike common sequential models that treat population activity as a\nmultichannel time series, SynapsNet applies its decoder to each neuron\n(channel) individually, with the learnable functional connectivity serving as\nthe sole pathway for information flow between neurons. Our experiments,\nconducted on mouse cortical activity from publicly available datasets and\nrecorded using the two most common population recording modalities (Ca imaging\nand Neuropixels) across three distinct tasks, demonstrate that SynapsNet\nconsistently outperforms existing models in forecasting population activity.\nAdditionally, our experiments on both real and synthetic data showed that\nSynapsNet accurately learns functional connectivity that reveals predictive\ninteractions between neurons.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces a newly hypothesized atmospheric phenomenon called\ntoroh, inspired by the Brazilian regional phenomenon known as tromba de agua.\nThe existence of the toroh, also suggested to be termed toroh, is characterized\nby intense and localized precipitation that causes water erosion, leaving\nstraight scars on mountain slopes. The term originates from the Tupi-Guarani\nlanguage meaning rainfall like a water jet. Guarani uses sounds to imitate\nnatural phenomena, capturing distinct noises: one when water cuts through the\nair and another when it hits the ground. The toroh differs from cloudbursts and\nrainstorms, referring to other extreme precipitation events, as it is stronger\nand more localized. A conceptual model has been proposed, suggesting that a\ntoroh occurs when a supercell passes over a rift, which intensifies the liquid\nmicro-explosion and leads to the formation of a river within the atmosphere.\nPreviously, meteorological observers in Southern Brazil used the term Tromba de\nagua for the same phenomenon. However, this term also referred to waterspouts\nin official Brazilian meteorology, leading to confusion.\n  Additionally, the article emphasizes the importance of indigenous\ncontributions i\n  n naming and understanding natural phenomena, which are often overlooked by\nWestern science.",

We produced distributions of occurrence of in-situ SEP\nintensity enhancements associated with the CME events, versus \\Delta\\phi, the\nlongitudinal separation between source active region and spacecraft magnetic\nfootpoint based on the nominal Parker spiral.

We also considered\noccurrences of 71-112 keV electron events detected by MESSENGER between 0.31\nand 0.47 au. Results. We find an east-west asymmetry with respect to the best\nmagnetic connection (\\Delta\\phi=0) in the detection of >10 MeV proton events\nand of 71-112 keV electron events. For protons, observers for which the source\nAR is on the east side of the spacecraft footpoint and not well connected\n(-180<\\Delta\\phi<-40) are 93% more likely to detect an SEP event compared to\nobservers with +40<\\Delta\\phi<+180.

Each chain describes the activity of a\nsingle neuron, indicating whether it spikes at a given time. One neuron's\ninfluence on another can be either excitatory or inhibitory. To identify the\nexistence and nature of an interaction between a neuron and its postsynaptic\ncounterpart, we propose a model selection procedure based on the observation of\nthe spike activity of a finite set of neurons over a finite time. The proposed\nprocedure is also based on the maximum likelihood estimator for the synaptic\nweight matrix of the network neuronal model. In this sense, we prove the\nconsistency of the maximum likelihood estimator {followed} by a proof of the\nconsistency of the neighborhood interaction estimation procedure. The\neffectiveness of the proposed model selection procedure is demonstrated using\nsimulated data, which validates the underlying theory. The method is also\napplied to analyze spike train data recorded from hippocampal neurons in rats\nduring a visual attention task, where a computational model reconstructs the\nspiking activity and the results reveal interesting and biologically relevant\ninformation.",

Popular neural network similarity measures like centered\nkernel alignment (CKA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and Procrustes\nshape distance, do not explicitly leverage this perspective and instead\nhighlight geometric invariances to orthogonal or affine transformations when\ncomparing representations. Here, we show that many of these measures can, in\nfact, be equivalently motivated from a decoding perspective.

We also show that the\nProcrustes shape distance upper bounds the distance between optimal linear\nreadouts and that the converse holds for representations with low participation\nratio. Overall, our work demonstrates a tight link between the geometry of\nneural representations and the ability to linearly decode information.

In image editing, DiTs project text and image\ninputs to a joint latent space, from which they decode and synthesize new\nimages. However, it remains largely unexplored how multimodal information\ncollectively forms this joint space and how they guide the semantics of the\nsynthesized images. In this paper, we investigate the latent space of DiT\nmodels and uncover two key properties: First, DiT's latent space is inherently\nsemantically disentangled, where different semantic attributes can be\ncontrolled by specific editing directions. Second, consistent semantic editing\nrequires utilizing the entire joint latent space, as neither encoded image nor\ntext alone contains enough semantic information. We show that these editing\ndirections can be obtained directly from text prompts, enabling precise\nsemantic control without additional training or mask annotations. Based on\nthese insights, we propose a simple yet effective Encode-Identify-Manipulate\n(EIM) framework for zero-shot fine-grained image editing. Specifically, we\nfirst encode both the given source image and the text prompt that describes the\nimage, to obtain the joint latent embedding. Then, using our proposed Hessian\nScore Distillation Sampling (HSDS) method, we identify editing directions that\ncontrol specific target attributes while preserving other image features. These\ndirections are guided by text prompts and used to manipulate the latent\nembeddings. Moreover, we propose a new metric to quantify the disentanglement\ndegree of the latent space of diffusion models. Extensive experiment results on\nour new curated benchmark dataset and analysis demonstrate DiT's\ndisentanglement properties and effectiveness of the EIM framework.",

We determine multifrequency,\nmulti-epoch scattering times for the large dispersion measure millisecond\npulsar J1903+0327 by developing a three component model for the emitted pulse\nshape that is convolved with a best fit pulse broadening function (PBF)\nidentified from a family of thin-screen and extended-media PBFs. We show that\nthe scattering time, $\\tau$, at a fiducial frequency of 1500 MHz changes by\napproximately 10% over a 5.5yr span with a characteristic timescale of\napproximately 100 days. We also constrain the spectral index and inner scale of\nthe wavenumber spectrum of electron density variations along this line of\nsight. We find that the scaling law for $\\tau$ vs. radio frequency is strongly\naffected by any mismatch between the true and assumed PBF or between the true\nand assumed intrinsic pulse shape. We show using simulations that refraction is\na plausible cause of the epoch dependence of $\\tau$, manifesting as changes in\nthe PBF shape and $1/e$ time scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of our\nscattering results on pulsar timing including time of arrival delays and\ndispersion measure misestimation.",

    "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is a methodology for multiple\nnon-cooperating swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles to independently cover a\ncommon area. In contrast to previous research on coverage control involving\nmore than one swarm, this paper does not assume cooperation between distinct\ngroups but considers them as entirely independent units following their own\nobjectives. Using Voronoi tesselation, collision-free motion of agents within\nthe same swarm has been proved before. However, as is shown in Example 1 of\nthis paper, in the case of multiple swarms with inter-swarm but without\nintra-swarm collaboration, these guarantees do not hold. We address this issue\nby proposing an algorithm to achieve maximum coverage with multiple swarms\nwhile avoiding collisions between agents. Thus, the Optimal Reciprocal\nCollision Avoidance method used for safe navigation in multi-agent scenarios is\nadapted to suit the needs of Voronoi-based coverage control with more than one\nswarm. The functionality of the proposed technique is validated through Monte\nCarlo simulations.",

    "abstract": "There are two types of quantum chaos: eigenbasis chaos and spectral chaos.\nThe first type controls the early-time physics, e.g. the thermal relaxation and\nthe sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. It can be traced back to\nthe Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), a statistical hypothesis about\nthe eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian. The second type concerns very late-time\nphysics, e.g. the ramp of the Spectral Form Factor. It can be traced back to\nRandom Matrix Universality (RMU), a statistical hypothesis about the\neigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit (BGS) conjecture\nasserts a direct relationship between the two types of chaos for quantum\nsystems with a chaotic semiclassical limit. The BGS conjecture is challenged by\nthe Poissonian Hamiltonian ensembles, which can be used to model any quantum\nsystem displaying RMU. In this paper, we start by analyzing further aspects of\nsuch ensembles. On general and numerical grounds, we argue that these ensembles\ncan have chaotic semiclassical limits. We then study the Poissonian ensemble\nassociated with the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. While the distribution of\ncouplings peaks around the original SYK model, the Poissonian ensemble is not\n$k$-local. This suggests that the link between ETH and RMU requires of physical\n$k$-locality as an assumption. We test this hypothesis by modifying the\ncouplings of the SYK Hamiltonian via the Metropolis algorithm, rewarding\ndirections in the space of couplings that do not display RMU. The numerics\nconverge to a $k$-local Hamiltonian with eigenbasis chaos but without spectral\nchaos. We finally comment on ways out and corollaries of our results.",

To remove projection\nbias, PLC for various views were developed by co-registering the pre-existing\n3D vascular geometry mask with the DSA projections, followed by ray tracing to\ndetermine paths across 3D vessel structures. These maps were used to normalize\nthe logarithmic angiographic images, correcting for projection-induced\nforeshortening across different angles. Subsequently, we focused on eliminating\ninjection bias by analyzing the corrected angiograms under varied projection\nviews, injection rates, and flow conditions. Regions of interest at the\naneurysm dome and inlet were placed to extract Time Density Curves for the\nlesion and the arterial input function, respectively. Using three standard SVD\nmethodologies, we extracted the aneurysm Impulse Response function (IRF) and\nits associated parameters Peak Height (PHIRF), Area Under the Curve (AUCIRF),\nand Mean Transit Time (MTT).

    "abstract": "This research thesis presents a novel higher-order spectral element method\n(SEM) formulated in cylindrical coordinates for analyzing electromagnetic\nfields in waveguides filled with complex anisotropic media. In this study, we\nconsider a large class of cylindrical waveguides: radially-bounded and\nradially-unbounded domains; homogeneous and inhomogeneous waveguides;\nconcentric and non-concentric geometries; Hermitian and non-Hermitian\nanisotropic media tensors. This work explores different wave equation\nformulations for one-layer eccentric and multilayer cylindrical waveguides. For\nthe first case, we can define a new normalized scalar Helmholtz equation for\ndecoupling TM and TE modes, and for the second, a vectorial Helmholtz equation\nfor hybrid modes in multilayered anisotropic structures. Additionally, we\nformulate a transformation optics (TO) framework to include non-symmetric and\nnon-Hermitian media tensors for non-concentric multilayer waveguides. Lastly,\nwe model excitation sources for logging sensors applied in geophysical problems\nusing the fields obtained by SEM. We validate the proposed approach against\nanalytical solutions, perturbation-based and mode-matching-based methods,\nfinite-elements, and finite-integration numerical methods. Our technique\nobtains accurate results with fewer elements and degrees of freedom (DoF) than\nCartesian-based SEM and ordinary finite-element approaches. To this end, we use\nhigher-order two-dimensional basis functions associated with the zeros of the\ncompleted Lobatto polynomial to model the fields in each reference element.

These scripts can steal data,\ncompromise credentials, and disrupt operations. Unlike executables with\nstandardized formats (e.g., ELF, PE), scripts are plaintext files with diverse\nsyntax, making them harder to detect using traditional methods. As a result,\nmore sophisticated approaches are needed to protect cloud infrastructures from\nthese evolving threats. In this paper, we propose novel feature extraction and\ndeep learning (DL)-based approaches for static script malware detection,\ntargeting server-side threats. We extract features from plain-text code using\ntwo techniques: syntactic code highlighting (SCH) and abstract syntax tree\n(AST) construction. SCH leverages complex regexes to parse syntactic elements\nof code, such as keywords, variable names, etc. ASTs generate a hierarchical\nrepresentation of a program's syntactic structure. We then propose a sequential\nand a graph-based model that exploits these feature representations to detect\nscript malware. We evaluate our approach on more than 400K server-side scripts\nin Bash, Python and Perl. We use a balanced dataset of 90K scripts for\ntraining, validation, and testing, with the remaining from 400K reserved for\nfurther analysis. Experiments show that our method achieves a true positive\nrate (TPR) up to 81% higher than leading signature-based antivirus solutions,\nwhile maintaining a low false positive rate (FPR) of 0.17%. Moreover, our\napproach outperforms various neural network-based detectors, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in learning code maliciousness for accurate detection of script\nmalware.",

Existing general-purpose\nLLM guardrails are insufficient to address these unique challenges in the\nscientific domain. We provide comprehensive guidelines for deploying LLM\nguardrails in the scientific domain. We identify specific challenges --\nincluding time sensitivity, knowledge contextualization, conflict resolution,\nand intellectual property concerns -- and propose a guideline framework for the\nguardrails that can align with scientific needs. These guardrail dimensions\ninclude trustworthiness, ethics & bias, safety, and legal aspects. We also\noutline in detail the implementation strategies that employ white-box,\nblack-box, and gray-box methodologies that can be enforced within scientific\ncontexts.",

However, the associated minimization problems are generally\nlarge-scale, ill-posed, nonsmooth, and sometimes even nonconvex, which present\nchallenges in designing efficient iterative solvers and often prevent their\npractical use. Preconditioning methods can significantly accelerate the\nconvergence of iterative methods. In some applications, computing\npreconditioners on-the-fly is beneficial. Moreover, forward models in image\nreconstruction are typically represented as operators, and the corresponding\nexplicit matrices are often unavailable, which brings additional challenges in\ndesigning preconditioners. Therefore, for practical use, computing and applying\npreconditioners should be computationally inexpensive. This paper adapts the\nrandomized Nystr\\\"{o}m approximation to compute effective preconditioners that\naccelerate image reconstruction without requiring an explicit matrix for the\nforward model. We leverage modern GPU computational platforms to compute the\npreconditioner on-the-fly. Moreover, we propose efficient approaches for\napplying the preconditioner to problems with nonsmooth regularizers. Our\nnumerical results on image deblurring, super-resolution with impulsive noise,\nand computed tomography reconstruction demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the proposed preconditioner.",

    "abstract": "The Knowledge Graph Completion~(KGC) task aims to infer the missing entity\nfrom an incomplete triple. Existing embedding-based methods rely solely on\ntriples in the KG, which is vulnerable to specious relation patterns and\nlong-tail entities. On the other hand, text-based methods struggle with the\nsemantic gap between KG triples and natural language. Apart from triples,\nentity contexts (e.g., labels, descriptions, aliases) also play a significant\nrole in augmenting KGs. To address these limitations, we propose KGR3, a\ncontext-enriched framework for KGC. KGR3 is composed of three modules. Firstly,\nthe Retrieval module gathers supporting triples from the KG, collects plausible\ncandidate answers from a base embedding model, and retrieves context for each\nrelated entity. Then, the Reasoning module employs a large language model to\ngenerate potential answers for each query triple. Finally, the Re-ranking\nmodule combines candidate answers from the two modules mentioned above, and\nfine-tunes an LLM to provide the best answer. Extensive experiments on widely\nused datasets demonstrate that KGR3 consistently improves various KGC methods.\nSpecifically, the best variant of KGR3 achieves absolute Hits@1 improvements of\n12.3% and 5.6% on the FB15k237 and WN18RR datasets.",

However, most\ndeep-learning techniques have struggled to surpass or even match this level of\nsuccess as traditional machine-learning methods. The primary reason is that\nthese applications involve multi-source, heterogeneous data where features lack\nexplicit relationships. This contrasts with image data, where pixels exhibit\nspatial relationships; textual data, where words have sequential dependencies;\nand graph data, where nodes are connected through established associations. The\nabsence of explicit Feature Relation Patterns (FRPs) presents a significant\nchallenge for deep learning techniques in scientific applications that are not\nimage, text, and graph-based. In this paper, we introduce EAPCR, a universal\nfeature extractor designed for data without explicit FRPs. Tested across\nvarious scientific tasks, EAPCR consistently outperforms traditional methods\nand bridges the gap where deep learning models fall short. To further\ndemonstrate its robustness, we synthesize a dataset without explicit FRPs.\nWhile Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and feature extractors like Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and Transformers\nstruggle, EAPCR excels, demonstrating its robustness and superior performance\nin scientific tasks without FRPs.",

A variety of emergent properties arise from\nthis dynamic system, including locomotion, navigation, transportation, and\ncompetitive or cooperative interactions.

Their\nunique electronic properties have already led to new spin-dependent transport\neffects. Here, we consider their spin and charge dynamics on ultrafast\ntimescales.

In the framework\nof this model, we compute the spin-dependent electronic scattering dynamics\nafter ultrashort-pulse excitation and show through these microscopic\ncalculations how electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering processes\nredistribute optically excited carriers in a 2D slice of the Brillouin zone. We\nfind that the optically excited spin polarization is long lived (~1ps) compared\nto the electron-electron momentum scattering lifetime of roughly 10fs.

Aims: This study examines how two proto-cluster over-densities at 3\n< z < 4 impact star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass, and morphology,\nfocusing on quenched galaxies. Methods: We identified proto-cluster\nover-densities in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and Ultra Deep Survey\n(UDS) regions of the VANDELS survey. Using spectral energy distribution\nanalysis, Bayesian methods (BEAGLE and BAGPIPES) helped derive best-fit\nparameters and U-V and V-J rest-frame colours (UVJ), classifying galaxies as\nquenched or star-forming based on UVJ diagrams and specific star formation\nrates (sSFR). TNG300 simulations aided interpretation. Results: Two of 13\nproto-cluster over-densities host quenched galaxies with red U-V colours, low\nsSFR, and properties like massive passive galaxies. These quenched members are\nredder, older, more massive, and more compact. The highest-density peaks at\nz=3.55 and z=3.43 have dark matter halo masses consistent with proto-clusters\nand host AGNs, with five and three AGNs, respectively. Compared to field\ngalaxies, these quenched members are in denser environments. TNG300 simulations\nsuggest proto-clusters with quenched galaxies at high redshift evolve to\ncontain more passive galaxies by z=1. Conclusions: The over-densities host\nmassive quenched galaxies and AGNs in their densest peaks. Simulations reveal\nthat sSFR for passive galaxies in proto-clusters was high at z=6, with median\nmass growth rates of 96% from z=6 to z=3. Conditions for mass assembly likely\ninvolve galaxy interactions and high gas accretion in dense environments. Black\nhole growth and AGN feedback appear to drive quenching at z=3, aligning with\nthe properties of quenched galaxies observed in our study.",

    "abstract": "Integral projection models (IPMs) are widely used to study population growth\nand the dynamics of demographic structure (e.g. age and size distributions)\nwithin a population.These models use data on individuals' growth, survival, and\nreproduction to predict changes in the population from one time point to the\nnext and use these in turn to ask about long-term growth rates, the sensitivity\nof that growth rate to environmental factors, and aspects of the long term\npopulation such as how much reproduction concentrates in a few individuals;\nthese quantities are not directly measurable from data and must be inferred\nfrom the model. Building IPMs requires us to develop models for individual\nfates over the next time step -- Did they survive? How much did they grow or\nshrink? Did they Reproduce? -- conditional on their initial state as well as on\nenvironmental covariates in a manner that accounts for the unobservable\nquantities that are are ultimately interested in estimating.Targeted maximum\nlikelihood estimation (TMLE) methods are particularly well-suited to a\nframework in which we are largely interested in the consequences of models.\nThese build machine learning-based models that estimate the probability\ndistribution of the data we observe and define a target of inference as a\nfunction of these. The initial estimate for the distribution is then modified\nby tilting in the direction of the efficient influence function to both de-bias\nthe parameter estimate and provide more accurate inference. In this paper, we\nemploy TMLE to develop robust and efficient estimators for properties derived\nfrom a fitted IPM. Mathematically, we derive the efficient influence function\nand formulate the paths for the least favorable sub-models.

The growing sophistication and\nrealism of deepfakes is raising concerns about privacy invasion, identity\ntheft, and has societal, business impacts, including reputational damage and\nfinancial loss. Many deepfake detectors have been developed to tackle this\nproblem. Nevertheless, as for every AI model, the deepfake detectors face the\nwrath of lack of considerable generalization to unseen scenarios and\ncross-domain deepfakes. Besides, adversarial robustness is another critical\nchallenge, as detectors drastically underperform to the slightest imperceptible\nchange.

For\nKlein-Gordon fields, the corresponding weight tensor is symmetric, while for\nDirac fields, the weight tensor must contain an anti-symmetric tensor factor.\nThe dynamical components of the weight and bias tensors correspond,\nrespectively, to the temporal and spatial components of the gauge field.",

This amplitude is deeper than the\nstandard prediction (in which the radio background is determined by the cosmic\nmicrowave background) by a factor of two and potentially hints at the existence\nof a radio background excess. While this result was obtained by fitting the\ndata with a phenomenological flattened-Gaussian shape for the cosmological\nsignal, here we develop a physical model for the inhomogeneous radio background\nsourced by the first galaxies hosting population III stars. Star formation in\nthese galaxies is quenched at lower redshifts due to various feedback\nmechanisms, so they serve as a natural candidate for the excess radio\nbackground hinted by EDGES, without violating present day measurements by\nARCADE2. We forward-model the EDGES sky temperature data, jointly sampling our\nphysical model for the cosmic signal, a foreground model, and residual\ncalibration errors. We compare the Bayesian evidences obtained by varying the\ncomplexity and prior ranges for the systematics. We find that the data is best\nexplained by a model with seven log-polynomial foreground terms, and that it\nrequires calibration residuals. Interestingly, the presence of a cosmic 21cm\nsignal with a non-standard depth is decisively disfavored. This is contrary to\nprevious EDGES analysis in the context of extra radio background models,\nserving as a caution against using a ''pseudo-likelihood'' built on a model\n(flattened Gaussian) that is different from the one being used for inference.\nWe make our simulation code and associated emulator publicly-available.",

    "abstract": "Soft- and hard-constrained Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have\nachieved great success in solving partial differential equations (PDEs).\nHowever, these methods still face great challenges when solving the\nNavier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with complex boundary conditions. To address\nthese challenges, this paper introduces a novel complementary scheme combining\nsoft and hard constraint PINN methods. The soft-constrained part is thus\nformulated to obtain the preliminary results with a lighter training burden,\nupon which refined results are then achieved using a more sophisticated\nhard-constrained mechanism with a primary network and a distance metric\nnetwork. Specifically, the soft-constrained part focuses on boundary points,\nwhile the primary network emphasizes inner domain points, primarily through PDE\nloss. Additionally, the novel distance metric network is proposed to predict\nthe power function of the distance from a point to the boundaries, which serves\nas the weighting factor for the first two components. This approach ensures\naccurate predictions for both boundary and inner domain areas. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method on the NSEs problem with complex boundary\nconditions is demonstrated by solving a 2D cylinder wake problem and a 2D\nblocked cavity flow with a segmented inlet problem, achieving significantly\nhigher accuracy compared to traditional soft- and hard-constrained PINN\napproaches. Given PINN's inherent advantages in solving the inverse and the\nlarge-scale problems, which are challenging for traditional computational fluid\ndynamics (CFD) methods, this approach holds promise for the inverse design of\nrequired flow fields by specifically-designed boundary conditions and the\nreconstruction of large-scale flow fields by adding a limited number of\ntraining input points. The code for our approach will be made publicly\navailable.",

    "abstract": "We investigate how magnetic field variations around accreting black holes on\nevent horizon scales affect the morphology of magnetically-driven jet on larger\nscales. By performing radiative transfer calculations on general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulations, we find that temporal variation in the\nmagnetic flux on the event horizon and the jet power are imprinted on the\nvariability of jet width up to several hundred gravitational radii. When the\nmagnetic flux around the black hole drops and then rises, the jet initially\nnarrows or becomes truncated, then widens, creating a thin-thick pattern that\npropagates down the jet. This suggests that extended jet observations can\nprovide a history record of horizon-scale magnetic field dynamics, and\nconversely, upcoming changes in the jet image can be predicted from direct\nobservation of the magnetized accreting plasma near the black hole.\nFurthermore, the pattern of jet width variations shows acceleration up to the\nrelativistic regime as it moves away from the black hole, aligning with plasma\nbulk motion. We also find in time-averaged images that both the bulk plasma\nmotion and magnetic field configuration in the jet-launching region, which are\nsensitive to black hole spin, shape diverse features through relativistic\nbeaming and aberration. Higher black hole spins result in more poloidal bulk\nmotion and toroidal magnetic fields, leading to more symmetric jet images and\nlinear polarization patterns. These results suggest a new method for testing\nthe magnetically arrested disk model and the Blandford-Znajek process, and for\ndetermining the black hole spin through observations bridging horizon and\njet-launching scales.",

The core idea of this method is to interpret the terms in\nthe continuum model as a basis, allowing us to determine model parameters as\ncoefficients of this basis through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We apply our\nmethod to twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ with twist angles ranging from\n2.13$^\\circ$ to 3.89$^\\circ$, producing continuum models that exhibit excellent\nagreement with both energy bands and wavefunctions obtained from\nfirst-principles calculations. We further propose a strategy to integrate out\nthe higher-energy degrees of freedom to reduce the number of the parameters in\nthe model without sacrificing the accuracy for low-energy bands. Our findings\nreveal that decreasing twist angles typically need an increasing number of\nharmonics in the moir\\'e potentials to accurately replicate first-principles\nresults. We provide parameter values for all derived continuum models,\nfacilitating further robust many-body calculations.

    "abstract": "We construct an effective cosmological spin-foam model for a (2+1)\ndimensional spatially flat universe, discretized on a hypercubical lattice,\ncontaining both space- and time-like regions. Our starting point is the\nrecently proposed coherent state spin-foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum\ngravity. The full amplitude is assumed to factorize into single vertex\namplitudes with boundary data corresponding to Lorentzian 3-frusta. A\nstationary phase approximation is performed at each vertex individually, where\nthe inverse square root of the Hessian determinant serves as a measure for the\neffective path integral. Additionally, a massive scalar field is coupled to the\ngeometry, and we show that its mass renders the partition function convergent.\nFor a single 3-frustum with time-like struts, we compute the expectation value\nof the bulk strut length and show that it generically agrees with the classical\nsolutions and that it is a discontinuous function of the scalar field mass.\nAllowing the struts to be space-like introduces causality violations, which\ndrive the expectation values away from the classical solutions due to the lack\nof an exponential suppression of these configurations. This is a direct\nconsequence of the semi-classical amplitude only containing the real part of\ndeficit angles, in contrast with the Lorentzian Regge action used in effective\nspin-foams. We give an outlook on how to evaluate the partition function on an\nextended discretization including a bulk spatial slice. This serves as a\nfoundation for future investigations of physically interesting scenarios such\nas a quantum bounce or the viability of massive scalar field clocks. Our\nresults demonstrate that the effective path integral in the causally regular\nsector serves as a viable quantum cosmology model, but that the agreement of\nexpectation values with classical solutions is tightly bound to the path\nintegral measure.",

A fundamental problem that illustrates this statement is\ngiven by the task of channel discrimination, in which an unknown channel drawn\nfrom a known random ensemble should be determined by applying it for a single\ntime. In this paper, we characterise the quality of channel discrimination\nprotocols when the quantum memory, quantified by the auxiliary dimension, is\nlimited. This is achieved by formulating the problem in terms of separable\nquantum states with additional affine constraints that all of their factors in\neach separable decomposition obey. We discuss the computation of upper and\nlower bounds to the solutions of such problems which allow for new insights\ninto the role of memory in channel discrimination. In addition to the\nsingle-copy scenario, this methodological insight allows to systematically\ncharacterise quantum and classical memories in adaptive channel discrimination\nprotocols. Especially, our methods enabled us to identify channel\ndiscrimination scenarios where classical or quantum memory is required, and to\nidentify the hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships within adaptive\nchannel discrimination protocols.",

Predicted signatures of this\nregime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension,\nboth of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider\nmagnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even\na small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus\nacts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the\nmagnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the\nodd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the\nscaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel\nconductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic\nscaling regime at intermediate wave numbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic\nfield to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression\noccurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is\ncomparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode.\nThis occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength\nrequired to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an\nexperimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.",

Deep LOFAR\nradio observations are combined with large galaxy samples to study the\nincidence of radio-loud AGN across the galaxy population; the AGN are further\nsplit into low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and high-excitation radio\ngalaxies (HERGs).

The\nLERGs are then split based on their SFRs relative to the main sequence, across\nredshift. Within quiescent galaxies, LERG activity shows a steep stellar mass\ndependence with the same normalisation across the past $\\sim$ 10 Gyr; this\nindicates that hot gas fuels LERGs in quiescent galaxies across cosmic time. In\nmassive galaxies ($\\log_{10}(M/\\rm{M_{\\odot}}) \\gtrsim 11$), the incidence of\nLERGs is roughly constant across the galaxy population, suggesting that LERGs\nin massive galaxies may be fuelled by hot gas regardless of the star-formation\nactivity. At lower masses, however, LERG activity is significantly more\nenhanced (by a factor of up to 10) in star-forming galaxies compared to\nquiescent galaxies; this suggests that an additional fuelling mechanism, likely\nassociated with cold gas, may fuel the LERGs in galaxies with higher SFRs.

One of the mechanisms to reorient the\nstellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of\nthe protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant ($\\sim\n300\\;\\mathrm{AU}$) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate\nbroadly due to the $\\sim 50\\%$ binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an\nimportant role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any\ndynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for\nidealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting\nstellar obliquities are broadly distributed between $60^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$\nfor most warm and cold planets. We further show that non-homologus disk\ndissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively-opened gap at\n$\\sim 2\\;\\mathrm{AU}$, can help maintain orbital alignment of warm planets, in\nagreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial\nobliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also\nrepresent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if\nthese companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of\nevolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven\nobliquity excitation.",

The\nGalactic bar currently dominates the bulge's region, altering the orbits of\nobjects formed before its formation and complicating the trace of the field\nstars' original clusters. Here, we present the discovery of a fossil record of\nthis evolution, SOS1 -- a star trapped in the bar, exhibiting significant\nenhancements in nitrogen, sodium, and aluminum, typical of second-generation GC\nstars. SOS1 also shows an s-process Ce enhancement, suggesting an old age and\nearly enrichment by fast-rotating massive stars in the Galaxy's earliest\nphases. With the purpose of finding the SOS1's parent GC, we derive its precise\nchemodynamical properties by combining high-precision proper motions from Gaia\nwith APOGEE detailed chemical abundances. Our analysis suggests that SOS1 was\npossibly stripped from the GC Terzan 5 by the Galactic bar's gravitational\ninfluence approximately 350 Myr ago. We also found chemical similarities\nsuggesting that SOS1 belonged to the most metal-poor, ancient, and peripheral\nstellar population of Terzan 5. These results not only support the hypothesis\nthat Terzan 5 is a remnant of a primordial building block of the Galactic\nbulge, but also suggest this cluster continues losing stars to the bar.

This iDM subcomponent is acoustic at early times but decouples\nfrom the DR following dark recombination. In contrast to conventional atomic\ndark matter (ADM) models, the dark photon is part of a richer DR sector, which\nensures that it continues to be self-interacting even after recombination.

These so-called optically faint/dark galaxies are\nconsidered to be massive quiescent galaxies or highly dust-attenuated galaxies.\nHaving the entire galaxy obscured by dust, however, is likely an extreme case\nof the much more common occurrence of optically thin and thick absorption\ncoexisting in the same system. With the power of JWST imaging, we are able to\nspatially resolve massive galaxies at z~3, accurately model their spectral\nenergy distributions, and identify candidate optically thick substructures. We\ntarget galaxies with log(M*/Msun)>10.3 and 2.5<z<3.5, and get 486 galaxies in\nCEERS and PRIMER fields. Based on excess NIR luminosity, we identify 162\ngalaxies (~33\\% of the parent sample) as candidate hosts of optically thick\nsubstructures. We then carry out spatially resolved SED modeling to explore the\nphysical properties of those dark substructures and estimate the amount of\noptically thick obscuration. We find that optically thick dust is ubiquitous in\nnormal massive galaxies with a wide variety of SFR and morphology. 10-20\\% of\nthe stellar mass/SFR are unaccounted for in our selected galaxies, and the\nfraction is insensitive to stellar mass or SFR. The dark substructures are\ngenerally dustier than the rest of the galaxies and are irregularly\ndistributed, arguing against an obscured AGN as the source of the NIR excess.

B 101, 045109\n(2020)), we have proposed to extend the single-reference coupled-cluster (SRCC)\nmethod to the strong correlation regime using low-rank tensor decompositions\n(LRTD) to express the cluster operator, without truncating it with respect to\nthe number of excitations. For that purpose, we have proposed a new type of\nLRTD called ``superpositions of tree-tensor networks'' (STTN), which use the\nsame set of building blocs to define all the tensors involved in the CC\nequations, and combine different ``channels'', i.e. different types of pairing\namong excited particles and holes, in the decomposition of a given tensor.\nThose two principles are aimed at globally minimizing the total number of free\nparameters required to accurately represent the ground state. In this work, we\nshow that STTN can indeed be compact and accurate representations of strongly\ncorrelated ground states by using them to express the CC cluster operator\namplitudes and wave function coefficients of exact grounds states of small\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard clusters, at half-filling, up to three particle-hole\nexcitations. We show the compactness of STTN by using a number of free\nparameters smaller than the number of equations in the CCSD approximation, i.e.\nmuch smaller than the number of fitted tensor elements. We find that, for the\nsystems considered, the STTN are more accurate as the size of the system\nincreases and that combining different channels in the decompositions of the\nmost strongly correlated tensors is crucial to obtain good accuracy.",

However, the large\nsize and high computation demands of LLMs limit their practicality in many\napplications, especially when further fine-tuning is required. To address these\nlimitations, smaller models are typically preferred for deployment. However,\ntheir training is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data. In contrast,\nunlabeled data is often readily which can be leveraged by using LLMs to\ngenerate pseudo-labels for training smaller models. This enables the smaller\nmodels (student) to acquire knowledge from LLMs(teacher) while reducing\ncomputational costs. This process introduces challenges, such as potential\nnoisy pseudo-labels. Selecting high-quality and informative data is therefore\ncritical to enhance model performance while improving the efficiency of data\nutilization. To address this, we propose LLKD that enables Learning with Less\ncomputational resources and less data for Knowledge Distillation from LLMs.\nLLKD is an adaptive sample selection method that incorporates signals from both\nthe teacher and student. Specifically, it prioritizes samples where the teacher\ndemonstrates high confidence in its labeling, indicating reliable labels, and\nwhere the student exhibits a high information need, identifying challenging\nsamples that require further learning.

However, solving such reasoning problems often\ninvolves hypothesizing and reflecting over complex multi-body interactions\nunder the effect of a multitude of physical forces and thus learning all such\ninteractions poses a significant hurdle for state-of-the-art machine learning\nframeworks, including large language models (LLMs). To study this problem, we\npropose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task\ninvolves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an\nexternal impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and\ntheir dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal\nof reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To\nsolve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot\nblack-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and\nprogram synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the\nworld models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an\nLLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of\nthe system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit\nanalysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the\nloop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene\ntowards solving the reasoning task. To show the effectiveness of LLMPhy, we\npresent experiments on our TraySim dataset to predict the steady-state poses of\nthe objects. Our results show that the combination of the LLM and the physics\nengine leads to state-of-the-art zero-shot physical reasoning performance,\nwhile demonstrating superior convergence against standard black-box\noptimization methods and better estimation of the physical parameters.",

We create an example benchmark consisting of\nthousands of datasets, and test a suite of popular estimation methods on these\ndatasets for average, conditional average, and individual treatment effect\nestimation, both with and without hidden confounding.

When the environment has light tails and a fast decay of correlation,\nthe fluctuations of LPP are predicted to be explained by the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality theory. However, the KPZ theory is not\nexpected to apply for many natural environments, particularly \"critical\" ones\nexhibiting a hierarchical structure often leading to logarithmic correlations.\n  In this article, we initiate a novel study of LPP in such hierarchical\nenvironments by investigating two particularly interesting examples. The first\nis an i.i.d. environment but with a power-law distribution with an inverse\nquadratic tail decay which is conjectured to be the critical point for the\nvalidity of the KPZ scaling relation. The second is the Branching Random Walk\nwhich is a hierarchical approximation of the two-dimensional Gaussian Free\nField. The second example may be viewed as a high-temperature (weak coupling)\ndirected version of Liouville Quantum Gravity, which is a model of random\ngeometry driven by the exponential of a logarithmically-correlated field. Due\nto the underlying fractal structure, LPP in such environments is expected to\nexhibit logarithmic correction terms with novel critical exponents. While\ndiscussions about such critical models appear in the physics literature,\nprecise predictions about exponents seem to be missing. Developing a framework\nbased on multi-scale analysis, we obtain bounds on such exponents and prove\nalmost optimal concentration results in all dimensions for both models. As a\nbyproduct of our analysis we answer a long-standing question of Martin on\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the linear growth of the LPP energy in\ni.i.d. environments.",

    "abstract": "We study the hydrodynamic theories with approximate symmetries in the\nrecently developed effective action approach on the Schwinger-Keldysh (SK)\ncontour. We employ the method of spurious symmetry transformation for small\nexplicit symmetry-breaking parameters to systematically constrain\nsymmetry-breaking effects in the non-equilibrium effective action for\nhydrodynamics. We apply our method to the hydrodynamic theory of chiral\nsymmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature and density and\nits explicit breaking by quark masses. We show that the spurious symmetry and\nthe Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation dictate that the Ward-Takahashi\nidentity for the axial symmetry, i.e., the partial conservation of axial vector\ncurrent (PCAC) relation, contains a relaxational term proportional to the axial\nchemical potential, whose kinetic coefficient is at least of the second order\nin the quark mass. In the phase where the chiral symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken, and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone pions appear as hydrodynamic variables,\nthis relaxation effect is subleading compared to the conventional pion mass\nterm in the PCAC relation, which is of the first order in the quark mass. On\nthe other hand, in the chiral symmetry-restored phase, we show that our\nrelaxation term, which is of the second order in the quark mass, becomes the\nleading contribution to the axial charge relaxation. Therefore, the leading\naxial charge relaxation mechanism is parametrically different in the quark mass\nacross a chiral phase transition.",

    "abstract": "Resilience in social systems is crucial for mitigating the impacts of crises,\nsuch as climate change, which poses an existential threat to communities\nglobally. As disasters become more frequent and severe, enhancing community\nresilience has become imperative. This study introduces a cutting-edge\nframework, quantitative network-based modeling called Complex Analysis for\nSocio-environmental Adaptation (CASA) to evaluate and strengthen social\nresilience. CASA transforms resilience models' linear and static structure into\na complex network that integrates complexity and systems thinking, utilizing\nglobal scientific knowledge and complex network methodologies. The resulting\nresilience framework features rich interdependencies, and subsequent\ndimensionality reduction produces robust resilience indicators. This innovative\napplication of network sciences is then demonstrated by quantitatively\nassessing what are known as \"Sacrifice Zones,\" socio-environmentally sensitive\nareas. Results unveil the potential of this novel application of complex\nnetwork methodologies as tools for systemic diagnostics, identifying\nvulnerabilities, and guiding policies and practices to enhance climate\nresilience and adaptation. The CASA framework represents a pioneering tool for\nassessing territorial resilience, leveraging network science applications, big\ndata analytics, and artificial intelligence. CASA serves as a systemic\ndiagnostic tool for urban resilience and a guide for policymakers, urban\nplanners, and other professionals to promote sustainable, healthy cities in an\nera of climate change.",

One approach to offering such assurances is through a safety case: a\nstructured, evidence-based argument aimed at demonstrating why the risk\nassociated with a safety-critical system is acceptable. In this article, we\npropose a safety case template for offensive cyber capabilities. We illustrate\nhow developers could argue that a model does not have capabilities posing\nunacceptable cyber risks by breaking down the main claim into progressively\nspecific sub-claims, each supported by evidence. In our template, we identify a\nnumber of risk models, derive proxy tasks from the risk models, define\nevaluation settings for the proxy tasks, and connect those with evaluation\nresults. Elements of current frontier safety techniques - such as risk models,\nproxy tasks, and capability evaluations - use implicit arguments for overall\nsystem safety. This safety case template integrates these elements using the\nClaims Arguments Evidence (CAE) framework in order to make safety arguments\ncoherent and explicit. While uncertainties around the specifics remain, this\ntemplate serves as a proof of concept, aiming to foster discussion on AI safety\ncases and advance AI assurance.",

The angular power spectrum, or $C_\\ell$, serves as the\nfundamental estimator of the variance in this data. Alternatively, spherical\ndata and their variance can also be characterized using Multipole Vectors (MVs)\nand the Fr\\'echet variance. The vectors that minimize this variance, known as\nFr\\'echet Vectors (FVs), define the center of mass of points on a compact\nspace, and are excellent indicators of statistical correlations between\ndifferent multipoles. We demonstrate this using both simulations and real data.\nThrough simulations, we show that FVs enable a blind detection and\nreconstruction of the location associated with a mock Cold Spot anomaly\nintroduced in an otherwise isotropic sky. Applying these tools to the 2018\nPlanck maps, we implement several improvements on previous null tests of\nGaussianity and statistical isotropy, down to arc-minute scales. Planck's MVs\nappear consistent with these hypotheses at scales $2 \\leq\\ell \\leq 1500$ when\nthe common mask is applied, whereas the same test using the FVs rejects them\nwith significances between 5.3 and 8.2$\\sigma$.

Hybrid 2 studies introduce the statistical issue of\nmultiple testing, complicated by the fact that they are typically also cluster\nrandomized trials. Standard statistical methods do not apply in this scenario.\nHere, we describe the design methodologies available for validly powering\nhybrid type 2 studies and producing reliable sample size calculations in a\ncluster-randomized design with a focus on binary outcomes. Through a literature\nsearch, 18 publications were identified that included methods relevant to the\ndesign of hybrid 2 studies. Five methods were identified, two of which did not\naccount for clustering but are extended in this article to do so, namely the\ncombined outcomes approach and the single 1-degree of freedom combined test.\nProcedures for powering hybrid 2 studies using these five methods are described\nand illustrated using input parameters inspired by a study from the Community\nIntervention to Reduce CardiovascuLar Disease in Chicago (CIRCL-Chicago)\nImplementation Research Center. In this illustrative example, the intervention\neffectiveness outcome was controlled blood pressure, and the implementation\noutcome was reach.

In contrast, the\ncolor-spin-locking phase lacks these nodes due to a nontrivial color Berry\nflux, which in turn induces gapless excitations with total Berry monopole\ncharges of $\\pm 3/2-$differing from conventional Weyl fermions. Our findings\ncan be potentially extended to other fermionic systems carrying additional\ninternal degrees of freedom.",

    "abstract": "Attributing outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) in adversarial\nsettings-such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns-presents significant\nchallenges that are likely to grow in importance. We approach this attribution\nproblem from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective, drawing on formal\nlanguage theory (identification in the limit) and data-driven analysis of the\nexpanding LLM ecosystem. By modeling an LLM's set of possible outputs as a\nformal language, we analyze whether finite samples of text can uniquely\npinpoint the originating model. Our results show that, under mild assumptions\nof overlapping capabilities among models, certain classes of LLMs are\nfundamentally non-identifiable from their outputs alone. We delineate four\nregimes of theoretical identifiability: (1) an infinite class of deterministic\n(discrete) LLM languages is not identifiable (Gold's classical result from\n1967); (2) an infinite class of probabilistic LLMs is also not identifiable (by\nextension of the deterministic case); (3) a finite class of deterministic LLMs\nis identifiable (consistent with Angluin's tell-tale criterion); and (4) even a\nfinite class of probabilistic LLMs can be non-identifiable (we provide a new\ncounterexample establishing this negative result). Complementing these\ntheoretical insights, we quantify the explosion in the number of plausible\nmodel origins (hypothesis space) for a given output in recent years. Even under\nconservative assumptions-each open-source model fine-tuned on at most one new\ndataset-the count of distinct candidate models doubles approximately every 0.5\nyears, and allowing multi-dataset fine-tuning combinations yields doubling\ntimes as short as 0.28 years. This combinatorial growth, alongside the\nextraordinary computational cost of brute-force likelihood attribution across\nall models and potential users, renders exhaustive attribution infeasible in\npractice.",

The model links\nimbibition distance to time through the power law exponent alpha/2, where alpha\nis the fractal index (0 < alpha < 2 in this study).

By\nanalyzing SI data from sandstones, diatomite, carbonate, and synthetic porous\nmedia, we demonstrated that the non-Boltzmann scaling provided a better\ncollapse of the SI data than the traditional Boltzmann approach alpha = 1),\nwith alpha values ranging from 0.88 to 1.54.

These solitons,\nfeaturing a regular center, are constructed from static black holes with\ngravitational hair via a double analytic continuation. By imposing ingoing\nboundary conditions at the horizons of rotating black holes, ensuring\nregularity at the soliton centers, and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions\nat infinity, we obtain numerical spectra for the rotating black holes and\nsolitons.

In this study, we simulated geomechanical deformation,\nfluid flow, and reactive transport to understand the effect of hydraulic\nfracturing treatment on permeability evolution in shale rough-walled fractures.\nUsing concepts of fractional Brownian motion and surface roughness\ncharacterizations with laser profilometer, we first generated three\nrough-walled microfractures consistent with three laboratory experiments (i.e.,\nE4, E5 and E6). After that, the generated microfractures were subjected to a\nconfining pressure in accord with experimental conditions, and geomechanical\ndeformation was simulated. We used the OpenFOAM software package to simulate\nthe fluid flow and permeability. By comparing the simulated permeability values\nwith the experimentally measured ones we found relative errors equal to 28, 15\nand 200% respectively for the experiments E4, E5 and E6. After calibration,\nhowever, the relative error dropped below 4%. We next simulated the reactive\ntransport using the GeoChemFOAM solver and investigated permeability evolution\nin the deformed microfractures. We found that after 10 hrs of reactive\ntransport simulations, permeability increased by 47%, on average, in all cases\nstudied here.",

    "abstract": "What mechanisms underlie linguistic generalization in large language models\n(LLMs)? This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies\nanalyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of\nyet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally\nwell be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be\nformalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of\nprior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of\nregularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same\npredictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically\nEnglish adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We\nintroduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs:\nfocusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and\nanalogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a\nset of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct\nconclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and\nanalogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives\nwith regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable\nnominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match.\nFurthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies,\neven for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical\naccount of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the\nhypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization\ninvolves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the\nunderlying mechanism. Overall, our study suggests that analogical processes\nplay a bigger role in the linguistic generalization of LLMs than previously\nthought.",

Through a\nthorough study of the best-response mapping, this paper develops a simple and\nunified convergence analysis, providing the first explicit convergence rate for\nthe fictitious play algorithm in MFGs of general types, especially\nnon-potential MFGs. We demonstrate that the convergence and rate can be\ncontrolled through the weighting parameter in the algorithm, with linear\nconvergence achievable under a general assumption. Building on this analysis,\nwe propose two strategies to accelerate fictitious play.

It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviour\narises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, or\ninstead reflects the specific structured (e.g.\\ Kronecker) approximations used\nor any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates.

We exploit\nthis novel setting to study the training and generalization properties of the\nGN optimizer. We find that exact GN generalizes poorly.

    "abstract": "We investigate the driving mechanisms for the HI gas content in star-forming\ncentral galaxies at low redshift, by examining the HI-to-stelalr mass ratio\n($M_{\\rm HI}/M_\\ast$) in both the state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations,\nIllustrisTNG (TNG) and EAGLE, and the xGASS sample. We quantify the\ncorrelations of $M_{\\rm HI}/M_\\ast$ with a variety of galaxy properties using\nthe random forest regression technique, and we make comparisons between the two\nsimulations, as well as between the simulations and xGASS. Gas-phase\nmetallicity is found to be most important in both simulations, but is ranked\nmildly for xGASS, suggesting that metals and gas driven by feedback effects in\nreal galaxies is not as tightly coupled as in the simulations. Beyond that, the\naccretion rate of supermassive black holes is the most important feature in\nTNG, while specific star formation rate is the top ranked in EAGLE. This result\ncan be understood from the fact that the HI gas is regulated mainly by\nthermal-mode AGN feedback in TNG and by stellar feedback in EAGLE. Although\nneither simulation can fully reproduce the feature importance obtained for real\ngalaxies in the xGASS, EAGLE performs better than TNG in the sense that the\nobservationally top-ranked property, $u-r$, is also highly ranked in EAGLE.\nThis result implies that stellar feedback plays a more dominant role than AGN\nfeedback in driving the HI gas content of low-redshift galaxies.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the leading causes of mortality\nworldwide, necessitates effective risk assessment strategies, with coronary\nartery calcium (CAC) scoring via computed tomography (CT) being a key method\nfor prevention. Traditional methods, primarily based on UNET architectures\nimplemented on pre-built models, face challenges like the scarcity of annotated\nCT scans containing CAC and imbalanced datasets, leading to reduced performance\nin segmentation and scoring tasks. In this study, we address these limitations\nby incorporating the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of DINO\n(self-distillation with no labels), which trains without requiring CAC-specific\nannotations, enhancing its robustness in generating distinct features. The\nDINO-LG model, which leverages label guidance to focus on calcified areas,\nachieves significant improvements, with a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of\n90% for detecting CAC-containing CT slices, compared to the standard DINO\nmodel's sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 77%. Additionally, false-negative\nand false-positive rates are reduced by 49% and 59%, respectively, instilling\ngreater confidence in clinicians when ruling out calcification in low-risk\npatients and minimizing unnecessary imaging reviews by radiologists. Further,\nCAC scoring and segmentation tasks are conducted using a basic UNET\narchitecture, applied specifically to CT slices identified by the DINO-LG model\nas containing calcified areas. This targeted approach enhances CAC scoring\naccuracy by feeding the UNET model with relevant slices, significantly\nimproving diagnostic precision, reducing both false positives and false\nnegatives, and ultimately lowering overall healthcare costs by minimizing\nunnecessary tests and treatments, presenting a valuable advancement in CAD risk\nassessment.",

Good agreement with the mass-metallicity relationship of star\nforming galaxies based on stellar absorption line studies is found. A\ncomparison with HII region oxygen abundances obtained from the analysis of\nstrong emission lines shows reasonable agreement when the Pettini & Pagel\n(2004) calibration is used, while the Zaritsky et al.

Based on extinction-corrected\nmagnitudes, combined with the stellar effective temperatures and gravities we\ndetermine, we use the Flux-weighted Gravity--Luminosity Relationship (FGLR) to\nestimate an independent spectroscopic distance.

This fundamental fact about\nmultivariate polynomials has found many applications in algorithms, complexity\ntheory, coding theory, and combinatorics. We give a new proof of the lemma that\noffers some advantages over the standard proof.\n  First, the new proof is more constructive than previously known proofs. For\nevery given side-length of the cube, the proof constructs a polynomial-time\ncomputable and polynomial-time invertible surjection onto the set of roots in\nthe cube. The domain of the surjection is tight, thus showing that the set of\nroots on the cube can be compressed. Second, the new proof can be formalised in\nBuss' bounded arithmetic theory $\\mathrm{S}^1_2$ for polynomial-time reasoning.\nOne consequence of this is that the theory $\\mathrm{S}^1_2 +\n\\mathrm{dWPHP(PV)}$ for approximate counting can prove that the problem of\nverifying polynomial identities (PIT) can be solved by polynomial-size\ncircuits. The same theory can also prove the existence of small hitting sets\nfor any explicitly described class of polynomials of polynomial degree.\n  To complete the picture we show that the existence of such hitting sets is\n\\emph{equivalent} to the surjective weak pigeonhole principle\n$\\mathrm{dWPHP(PV)}$, over the theory $\\mathrm{S}^1_2$. This is a contribution\nto a line of research studying the reverse mathematics of computational\ncomplexity.

In this work, we propose Fourier\napproximations of persistence curves (FAPC), and use this technique to perform\nsleep staging based on airflow signals. We analyze performance using an XGBoost\nmodel on 1155 pediatric sleep studies taken from the Nationwide Children's\nHospital Sleep DataBank (NCHSDB), and find that FAPC methods provide\ncomplimentary information to HEPC methods alone, leading to a 4.9% increase in\nperformance over baseline methods.",

Phase transformations induce\nmicrostructural changes; therefore, accurately modeling the phase\ntransformations of the Ti-Al system is necessary to describe plasticity.\nInteratomic potentials can be a powerful tool to model how materials behave;\nhowever, existing potentials lack accuracy in certain aspects. While classical\npotentials like the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and Modified Embedded Atom\nMethod (MEAM) perform adequately for modeling dilute Al solute within Ti's\n$\\alpha$ phase, they struggle with accurately predicting plasiticity. In\nparticular, they struggle with stacking fault energies in intermetallics and to\nsome extent elastic properties. This hinders their effectiveness in\ninvestigating the plastic behavior of formed intermetallics in Ti-Al alloys.\nClassical potentials also fail to predict the $\\alpha$ to $\\beta$ phase\nboundary. Existing machine learning (ML) potentials reproduce the properties of\nformed intermetallics with density functional theory (DFT) but do not examine\nthe $\\alpha$ to $\\beta$ or $\\alpha$ to D0$_{19}$ phase boundaries.

The main developments presented here include testing the robustness\nof different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated\nalloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic\ndatabases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending\nconvergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out\nsimulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure\ndevelopment. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation\nthat interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid\nforms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this\nformulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is\nindependent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of\nenhanced solute diffusivity can be non-trivially extended to concentrated\nalloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or\nprocessing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to\nconstruct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys.\nFurthermore, 3D simulations demonstrate a good convergence similar to that\nobserved in 2D as a function of interface width.

    "abstract": "On broadly Copernican grounds, we are entitled to default assume that\napparently behaviorally sophisticated extraterrestrial entities (\"aliens\")\nwould be conscious. Otherwise, we humans would be inexplicably, implausibly\nlucky to have consciousness, while similarly behaviorally sophisticated\nentities elsewhere would be mere shells, devoid of consciousness. However, this\nCopernican default assumption is canceled in the case of behaviorally\nsophisticated entities designed to mimic superficial features associated with\nconsciousness in humans (\"consciousness mimics\"), and in particular a broad\nclass of current, near-future, and hypothetical robots. These considerations,\nwhich we formulate, respectively, as the Copernican and Mimicry Arguments,\njointly defeat an otherwise potentially attractive parity principle, according\nto which we should apply the same types of behavioral or cognitive tests to\naliens and robots, attributing or denying consciousness similarly to the extent\nthey perform similarly. Instead of grounding speculations about alien and robot\nconsciousness in metaphysical or scientific theories about the physical or\nfunctional bases of consciousness, our approach appeals directly to the\nepistemic principles of Copernican mediocrity and inference to the best\nexplanation. This permits us to justify certain default assumptions about\nconsciousness while remaining to a substantial extent neutral about specific\nmetaphysical and scientific theories.",

In our setup, the portfolio manager is given two\none-parameter controls to influence the construction of the portfolio. The\nfirst is a linear filtering parameter that may increase or decrease the level\nof autocorrelation in the signal. The second is a numerical threshold that\ndetermines a symmetric \"no-trade\" zone. Portfolio positions are constrained to\na single unit long or a single unit short. These constraints allow us to focus\non the interplay between the signal filtering mechanism and the hysteresis\nintroduced by the \"no-trade\" zone. We then formulate an optimization problem\nwhere we aim to minimize the frequency of trades subject to a fixed return\nlevel of the portfolio. We show that maintaining a no-trade zone while removing\nautocorrelation entirely from the signal yields a locally optimal solution.

    "abstract": "In magnetar crusts, magnetic fields are sufficiently strong to confine\nelectrons into a small to moderate number of quantized Landau levels. This can\nhave a dramatic effect on the crust's thermodynamic properties, generating\nfield-dependent de Haas--van Alphen oscillations. We previously argued that the\nlarge-amplitude oscillations of the magnetic susceptibility could enhance the\nOhmic dissipation of the magnetic field by continuously generating small-scale,\nrapidly dissipating field features. This could be important to magnetar field\nevolution and contribute to their observed higher temperatures. To study this,\nwe performed quasi-3D numerical simulations of electron MHD in a representative\nvolume of neutron star crust matter, for the first time including the\nmagnetization and magnetic susceptibility resulting from Landau quantization.\nWe find that the potential enhancement in the Ohmic dissipation rate due to\nthis effect can be a factor $\\sim 3$ for temperatures of the order of $10^8$ K\nand $\\sim 4.5$ for temperatures of the order of $5\\times10^7$ K, depending on\nthe magnetic field configuration. The nonlinear Hall term is crucial to this\namplification: without it the magnetic field decay is only enhanced by a factor\n$\\lesssim 2$ even at $5\\times10^7$ K. These effects generate a high wavenumber\nplateau in the magnetic energy spectrum associated with the small-scale de\nHaas--van Alphen oscillations. Our results suggest that this mechanism could\nhelp explain the magnetar heating problem, though due to the effect's\ntemperature-dependence, full magneto-thermal evolution simulations in a\nrealistic stellar model are needed to judge whether it is viable explanation.",

    "abstract": "No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA) aims to objectively\nassess the human perceptual quality of point clouds without relying on\npristine-quality point clouds for reference. It is becoming increasingly\nsignificant with the rapid advancement of immersive media applications such as\nvirtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). However, current NR-PCQA\nmodels attempt to indiscriminately learn point cloud content and distortion\nrepresentations within a single network, overlooking their distinct\ncontributions to quality information. To address this issue, we propose DisPA,\na novel disentangled representation learning framework for NR-PCQA. The\nframework trains a dual-branch disentanglement network to minimize mutual\ninformation (MI) between representations of point cloud content and distortion.\nSpecifically, to fully disentangle representations, the two branches adopt\ndifferent philosophies: the content-aware encoder is pretrained by a masked\nauto-encoding strategy, which can allow the encoder to capture semantic\ninformation from rendered images of distorted point clouds; the\ndistortion-aware encoder takes a mini-patch map as input, which forces the\nencoder to focus on low-level distortion patterns. Furthermore, we utilize an\nMI estimator to estimate the tight upper bound of the actual MI and further\nminimize it to achieve explicit representation disentanglement. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that DisPA outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on multiple PCQA datasets.",

    "abstract": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from the extrapolation error and\nvalue overestimation. From a generalization perspective, this issue can be\nattributed to the over-generalization of value functions or policies towards\nout-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Significant efforts have been devoted to\nmitigating such generalization, and recent in-sample learning approaches have\nfurther succeeded in entirely eschewing it. Nevertheless, we show that mild\ngeneralization beyond the dataset can be trusted and leveraged to improve\nperformance under certain conditions. To appropriately exploit generalization\nin offline RL, we propose Doubly Mild Generalization (DMG), comprising (i) mild\naction generalization and (ii) mild generalization propagation. The former\nrefers to selecting actions in a close neighborhood of the dataset to maximize\nthe Q values. Even so, the potential erroneous generalization can still be\npropagated, accumulated, and exacerbated by bootstrapping. In light of this,\nthe latter concept is introduced to mitigate the generalization propagation\nwithout impeding the propagation of RL learning signals. Theoretically, DMG\nguarantees better performance than the in-sample optimal policy in the oracle\ngeneralization scenario. Even under worst-case generalization, DMG can still\ncontrol value overestimation at a certain level and lower bound the\nperformance. Empirically, DMG achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nGym-MuJoCo locomotion tasks and challenging AntMaze tasks. Moreover, benefiting\nfrom its flexibility in both generalization aspects, DMG enjoys a seamless\ntransition from offline to online learning and attains strong online\nfine-tuning performance.",

Furthermore, the denoised images predicted\nby deep learning-based techniques inevitably exhibit differences in noise\ndistribution compared to normal-dose CT (NDCT) images, which can also impact\nthe final image quality and diagnostic outcomes. This paper proposes CT-Mamba,\na hybrid convolutional State Space Model for LDCT image denoising. The model\ncombines the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs with Mamba's strength\nin capturing long-range dependencies, enabling it to capture both local details\nand global context. Additionally, we introduce an innovative spatially coherent\nZ-shaped scanning scheme to ensure spatial continuity between adjacent pixels\nin the image. We design a Mamba-driven deep noise power spectrum (NPS) loss\nfunction to guide model training, ensuring that the noise texture of the\ndenoised LDCT images closely resembles that of NDCT images, thereby enhancing\noverall image quality and diagnostic value. Experimental results have\ndemonstrated that CT-Mamba performs excellently in reducing noise in LDCT\nimages, enhancing detail preservation, and optimizing noise texture\ndistribution, and exhibits higher statistical similarity with the radiomics\nfeatures of NDCT images. The proposed CT-Mamba demonstrates outstanding\nperformance in LDCT denoising and holds promise as a representative approach\nfor applying the Mamba framework to LDCT denoising tasks.",

    "abstract": "Non-transiting terrestrial planets will be accessible by upcoming\nobservatories of which LIFE is an example. Planet b orbiting Teegarden's Star\nis one of the optimal targets for such missions. We use a one-dimensional\natmospheric model with real-gas radiation, a multi-species pseudo-adiabatic\nconvection-condensation scheme, and a water cloud scheme, to estimate the\nimpact of the cloud coverage on the emission spectrum of the target, as well as\nto assess how sensitive LIFE could be to changes in outgoing flux caused by\nthese clouds. Though the emergent flux decreases with a higher cloud coverage,\nit does not decrease by more than one order of magnitude as the coverage\nincreases from 0% to 90%. This allows LIFE to retain a high sensitivity to the\ncloud cover fraction for wavelengths longer than 7 microns. In this spectral\nrange, with at least 1 bar of N2, LIFE is able to distinguish cloud cover\nfractions as small as 10% given an integration time of 24 hours, and yields\nmuch better precision with a week-long integration. An integration time of one\nweek also allows the resolution of local variations in spectral flux, which can\nlead to an easier molecule identification. This ability remains if the planet\nis a CO2-dominated Venus analog. Partial pressures of N2 lower than 1 bar may\ncreate a degeneracy with the cloud cover fraction. LIFE shows promising\npotential for detecting and characterizing atmospheres even with a high cloud\ncoverage, and retaining a fine sensitivity to relatively small differences in\ncloud cover fractions.",

Spherical modes are employed to evaluate the Green's dyadic and\nthus the Casimir stresses. The inhomogeneity of the media essentially modifies\nthe wave form of the spherical mode, leading to significant impacts on the\nCasimir stresses, especially when far away from the surface of the ball. As the\nsurface approached, the divergence (surface divergence) in Casimir stresses is\nseen. For both homogeneous and inhomogeneous cases, the leading behaviors (zero\nfor the radial component, and inverse quantic order of distance for the\ntransverse components) of Casimir stresses are exactly the same as those for\nthe corresponding planar homogeneous wall, involving only properties of media\nat the surface and reflecting no information about the spherical geometry and\nthe inhomogeneity, which implies the local nature. The other surface\ndivergences are influenced by the spherical geometry, and for the transverse\ncomponent always weaker than the planar contribution. The general impacts from\nthe inhomogeneity of media to the surface divergences are also shown. The\ninhomogeneity will further soften the surface divergence. For two touching\nmedia with permittivities and permeabilities equal up to high enough order of\ntheir expansion over the distance to the surface, surface divergences may\ndisappear together with the interaction Casimir stresses.

Let $C_t(n,r)$ and\n$U_t(n,r)$ denote the maximum number of edges that can be contained in an\n$n$-vertex $t$-cancellative and $t$-union-free $r$-graph, respectively.

Conversely, if adoption does not\nbenefit from social reinforcement, it should spread more on random networks\nwhich avoid such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion\nwith tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to\nsystematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks spread\nbehavior better than random networks. Using simulations and analytical methods,\nwe identify precise boundaries in the parameter space where one network type\noutperforms the other or they perform equally. We find that, in most cases,\nrandom networks spread behavior as far or farther than clustered networks, even\nwhen social reinforcement increases adoption. Although we find that\nprobabilistic, socially reinforced behaviors can spread farther on clustered\nnetworks in some cases, this is not the dominant pattern. Clustered networks\nare even less advantageous when individuals remain influential for longer after\nadopting, have more neighbors, or need more neighbors before social\nreinforcement takes effect. Under such conditions, clustering tends to help\nonly when adoption is nearly deterministic, which is not representative of\nsocially reinforced behaviors more generally. Clustered networks outperform\nrandom networks by a 5% margin in only 22% of the parameter space under its\nmost favorable conditions.

Corotation of\nparticle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a\nminor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have\nsuggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the\nlocation of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with\nthe event. Aims: We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are\npresent in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the\nparameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events. Methods: We analyse\nmulti-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between\n2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the\ndecay time constant, \\tau in 3 energy channels; electrons ~ 1 MeV, protons ~ 25\nMeV, and protons ~ 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \\tau on the longitudinal\nseparation, \\Delta \\phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft\nmagnetic footpoint on the Sun.\n  Results: Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time\nconstant to decrease with increasing $\\Delta \\phi$, in agreement with test\nparticle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the\nassociated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured $\\tau$ values and are\nlikely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.\n  Conclusions: We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the\ndecay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in\nfuture simulations and interpretations of these events.",

The Lagrangians we consider can be thought of\nas SYZ mirrors to lines, and their open Gromov-Witten (OGW) invariants coincide\nwith relative period integrals on the mirror quintic calculated by Walcher.\nTheir OGW invariants are irrational numbers contained in an algebraic extension\nof the rationals, and admit an expression similar to the Ooguri-Vafa multiple\ncover formula involving special values of a Dirichlet L-function. We achieve\nthese results by studying the Floer theory of a different immersed Lagrangian\nin the quintic that supports a one-dimensional family of objects in the Fukaya\ncategory homologically mirror to coherent sheaves supported on lines in the\nmirror quintic.

The particles are non-Brownian,\nspherical, with inertia and heat capacity, and they interact with the\nsurrounding fluid mechanically and thermally. We study both the cases of\nparticles denser and lighter than the fluid that are injected uniformly at the\nsystem's horizontal boundaries with their settling terminal velocity and\nprescribed temperatures. The performed linear stability analysis shows that the\nonset of thermal convection is stationary, i.e., the system undergoes a\npitchfork bifurcation as in the classical single-phase RB problem. Remarkably,\nthe mechanical coupling due to the particle motion always stabilizes the\nsystem, increasing the critical Rayleigh number ($Ra_c$) of the convective\nonset. Furthermore, the particle to fluid heat capacity ratio provides an\nadditional stabilizing mechanism, that we explore in full by addressing both\nthe asymptotic limits of negligible and overwhelming particle thermal inertia.\nThe overall resulting stabilization effect on $Ra_c$ is significant: for a\nparticulate volume fraction of 0.1% it reaches up to a factor 30 for the case\nof the lightest particle density (i.e. bubbles) and 60 for the heaviest one.\nThe present work extends the analysis performed by Prakhar & Prosperetti (Phys.\nRev.

Here, by including the\neffect of the added-mass force in the model system, we succeed in exploring the\nfull range of particle densities.

Two key\nchallenges emerge in this setting: (i) maintaining the privacy of each person's\ndata, even if other silos or an adversary with access to the central server\ntries to infer this data; (ii) ensuring that decisions are fair to different\ndemographic groups (e.g., race/gender).

The errors associated with local heights raised from datum\noffsets, local vertical datum alignment discrepancies in latitude and\nlongitude, accumulated tilts depending on the distance from the reference tide\ngauge and levelling point elevation-dependent offsets were introduced. Clocks\nachieving a fractional uncertainty of 10^-18 and 10^-17 were assumed in the\nsimulations, considering temporal correlations of clock intrinsic\nuncertainties, external effects on clock observations such as tidal effects,\npropagation delay in terms of link uncertainties and presence of outliers.

The estimation of the error parameters is\nrelated to the spatial distribution of the clocks, hence, an optimal setup of\nplacing clocks at the most distant levelling points, reference tide gauges and\nelevated points is implemented.

    "abstract": "A unified definition for the rotation angle and rotation angular speed of\ngeneral beams, including those with orbital angular momentum (OAM), has been\nlacking until now. The rotation of a general beam is characterized by observing\nthe rotational behavior of the directions of the extreme spot sizes during\npropagation. We introduce the beam quality $M^2(\\psi)$ factor to characterize\nthe unique beam quality of a general beam across all directions, not limited to\nthe $x$- or $y$-axes. Besides that, we present the beam center\n$s_{\\psi}(\\psi,z)$, spot size $w_{\\psi}(\\psi,z)$, waist position, waist radius,\nand divergence angle along the direction that forms an angle $\\psi$ with the\n$x$-axis in the plane perpendicular to the $z$-axis for the general beam.\nFurthermore, this paper presents rapid calculation formulas for these\nparameters, utilizing the mode expansion method (MEM). Subsequently, we prove\nthat only two extreme spot sizes exist in a given detection plane and the angle\nbetween the maximum and minimum spot angles is consistently $90^{\\circ}$ during\nthe propagation. We also prove the spot rotation angles converge as $z$\napproaches either positive or negative infinity. We first show the extreme spot\nsizes, spot rotation angle, and angular speed for the vortex beam. Our formulas\nefficiently differentiate between vortex OAM beams and asymmetry OAM beams.",

Using high spatial resolution observations taken at a\nhigh cadence by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar Orbiter, we\nidentified small-scale elongated brightenings within the AFSs. These\nbrightenings appear as bidirectional flows along the threads of AFSs. For our\nstudy, we investigated the coordinated observations of the AFSs acquired by the\nEUI and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO on 2022 March 4 and\n17. We analyzed 15 bidirectional propagating brightenings from EUI 174 {\\AA}\nimages. These brightenings reached propagating speeds of 100-150 km/s. The\nevent observed on March 17 exhibits blob-like structures, which may be\nsignatures of plasmoids and due to magnetic reconnection. In this case, we also\nobserved counterparts in the running difference slit-jaw images in the 1400\n{\\AA} passbands taken by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Most\nevents show co-temporal intensity variations in all AIA EUV passbands.\nTogether, this implies that these brightenings in the AFSs are dominated by\nemission from cool plasma with temperatures well below 1 MK. The magnetograms\ntaken by the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) on board Solar Orbiter\nshow signatures of flux emergence beneath the brightenings. This suggests that\nthe events in the AFSs are triggered by magnetic reconnection that may occur\nbetween the newly emerging magnetic flux and the preexisting magnetic field\nstructures in the middle of the AFSs. This would also give a natural\nexplanation for the bidirectional propagation of the brightenings near the apex\nof the AFSs. The interaction of the preexisting field and the emerging flux may\nbe important for mass and energy transfer within the AFSs.",

    "abstract": "A key obstacle to accurate models of the first stars and galaxies is the vast\nrange of distance scales that must be considered. While star formation occurs\non sub-parsec scales within dark matter (DM) minihalos, it is influenced by\nlarge-scale baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\\rm bc}$) and\nLyman-Werner (LW) radiative feedback which vary significantly on scales of\n$\\sim$100 Mpc. We present a novel approach to this issue in which we utilize\nartificial neural networks (NNs) to emulate the Population III (PopIII) and\nPopulation II (PopII) star formation histories of many small-scale cells given\nby a more complex semi-analytic framework based on DM halo merger trees. Within\neach simulation cell, the NN takes a set of input parameters that depend on the\nsurrounding large-scale environment, such as the cosmic overdensity,\n$\\delta(\\vec{x})$, and $v_{\\rm bc}$ of the cell, then outputs the resulting\nstar formation far more efficiently than is possible with the semi-analytic\nmodel. This rapid emulation allows us to self-consistently determine the LW\nbackground intensity on $\\sim$100 Mpc scales, while simultaneously including\nthe detailed merger histories (and corresponding star formation histories) of\nthe low-mass minihalos that host the first stars. Comparing with the full\nsemi-analytic framework utilizing DM halo merger trees, our NN emulators yield\nstar formation histories with redshift-averaged errors of $\\sim$7.3\\% and\n$\\sim$5.2\\% for PopII and PopIII, respectively. When compared to a simpler\nsub-grid star formation prescription reliant on halo mass function integration,\nwe find that the diversity of halo merger histories in our simulation leads to\nenhanced spatial fluctuations, an earlier transition from PopIII to PopII\ndominated star formation, and more scatter in star formation histories overall.",

    "abstract": "Humans excel at discovering regular structures from limited samples and\napplying inferred rules to novel settings. We investigate whether modern\ngenerative models can similarly learn underlying rules from finite samples and\nperform reasoning through conditional sampling. Inspired by Raven's Progressive\nMatrices task, we designed GenRAVEN dataset, where each sample consists of\nthree rows, and one of 40 relational rules governing the object position,\nnumber, or attributes applies to all rows. We trained generative models to\nlearn the data distribution, where samples are encoded as integer arrays to\nfocus on rule learning. We compared two generative model families: diffusion\n(EDM, DiT, SiT) and autoregressive models (GPT2, Mamba). We evaluated their\nability to generate structurally consistent samples and perform panel\ncompletion via unconditional and conditional sampling. We found diffusion\nmodels excel at unconditional generation, producing more novel and consistent\nsamples from scratch and memorizing less, but performing less well in panel\ncompletion, even with advanced conditional sampling methods. Conversely,\nautoregressive models excel at completing missing panels in a rule-consistent\nmanner but generate less consistent samples unconditionally. We observe diverse\ndata scaling behaviors: for both model families, rule learning emerges at a\ncertain dataset size - around 1000s examples per rule. With more training data,\ndiffusion models improve both their unconditional and conditional generation\ncapabilities. However, for autoregressive models, while panel completion\nimproves with more training data, unconditional generation consistency\ndeclines. Our findings highlight complementary capabilities and limitations of\ndiffusion and autoregressive models in rule learning and reasoning tasks,\nsuggesting avenues for further research into their mechanisms and potential for\nhuman-like reasoning.",

Despite their importance, the study of PAHs in exoplanet\natmospheres has been limited. We aim to evaluate the possibility of detecting\nPAHs on exoplanets considering future observations using JWST's NIRSpec PRISM\nmode. The hot Saturn WASP-6 b shows properties that are consistent with a\npotential PAH presence and is thus used as a case study for this work. Here, we\ncompare the likelihoods of various synthetic haze species and their\ncombinations with the influence of PAHs on the transmission spectrum of WASP-6\nb. This is possible by applying the atmospheric retrieval code petitRADTRANS to\na collection of data from previous observations. Subsequently, by exploring\nsynthetic, single transit JWST spectra of this planet that include PAHs, we\nassess if these molecules can be detected in the near future. Previous\nobservations support the presence of cloud/haze species in the spectrum of\nWASP-6 b. While this may include PAHs, the current data do not confirm their\nexistence unambiguously.

We present the first work that\ndefines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its causes, and proposes\na simple mitigating approach. Our experiments, conducted on five datasets of\nknowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14 newly developed LLMs, reveal\nthree conclusions. 1) We reveal a pervasive presence of VC across all models\nand all datasets.

This method does not rely on pre-existing\nirony corpora, making it a versatile tool for creating adversarial text in\nvarious NLP tasks. (2) We demonstrate that the performance of several\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models on sentiment analysis tasks significantly\ndeteriorates when subjected to IAE attacks. This finding underscores the\nsusceptibility of current NLP systems to adversarial manipulation through\nirony. (3) We compare the impact of IAE on human judgment versus NLP systems,\nrevealing that humans are less susceptible to the effects of irony in text.",

Our\nstudy enhances the existing H$\\alpha$ size-luminosity relation by adding\nhigh-quality results for 31 objects, whose nuclear luminosities were estimated\nusing the flux-variation gradient method, resulting in a scatter of 0.26dex\nwithin our sample. The scatter reduces to 0.17dex when the 6 lowest luminosity\nsources are discarded, which is comparable to that found for the H$\\beta$ line.\nSingle-epoch spectra enable us to estimate black hole masses using the\nH$\\alpha$ line and derive mass accretion rates from the iron-blend feature\nadjacent to H$\\beta$.

However, BNNs pose an additional challenge -- they require multiple\ninstantiations for ensembling, consuming extra resources in terms of energy and\narea. In this work, we propose a novel sparsity-aware optimization for Bayesian\nBinary Neural Network (BBNN) accelerators that exploits the inherent BBNN\nsampling sparsity -- most of the network is made up of synapses that have a\nhigh probability of being fixed at $\\pm1$ and require no sampling. The\noptimization scheme proposed here exploits the sampling sparsity that exists\nboth among layers, i.e only a few layers of the network contain a majority of\nthe probabilistic synapses, as well as the parameters i.e., a tiny fraction of\nparameters in these layers require sampling, reducing total sampled parameter\ncount further by up to $86\\%$. We demonstrate no loss in accuracy or\nuncertainty quantification performance for a VGGBinaryConnect network on\nCIFAR-100 dataset mapped on a custom sparsity-aware phase change memory (PCM)\nbased IMC simulator. We also develop a simple drift compensation technique to\ndemonstrate robustness to drift-induced degradation.

The effects of the sawtooth-waveforms synthesized from\ndifferent numbers of consecutive harmonics, N, of a fundamental frequency of\n13.56 MHz on the electron dynamics, ion and neutral transport, as well as the\netching profile evolution are revealed in different mixtures of Ar/CHF3. By\nincreasing N, a reduction in electronegativity, a decrease of the DC self-bias\nvoltage, and a transition of the discharge mode from the Drift-Ambipolar (DA)\nto an {\\alpha}-DA hybrid mode is observed accompanied by an enhanced plasma\nasymmetry. As the CHF3 gas admixture increases, the electronegativity initially\nincreases and then decreases, following a similar trend as the absolute value\nof the DC self-bias voltage. This is mainly caused by the change in ionization,\nattachment and de-attachment reaction rates. The obtained results show that\nplacing the substrate on the grounded electrode and using a higher number of\nharmonic frequencies (N) can achieve a faster etching rate, since higher ion\nfluxes can be obtained in these scenarios.

Concurrently, the world is slowly\nshifting its focus towards more sustainable computing. For these reasons, there\nhas been a recent effort to reduce the footprint of related computing\ninfrastructure, especially by deep learning algorithms, for advanced insight\ngeneration. The `TinyML' community is actively proposing methods to save\ncommunication bandwidth and excessive cloud storage costs while reducing\nalgorithm inference latency and promoting data privacy. Such proposed\napproaches should ideally process multiple types of data, including time\nseries, audio, satellite images, and video, near the network edge as multiple\ndata streams has been shown to improve the discriminative ability of learning\nalgorithms, especially for generating fine grained results. Incidentally, there\nhas been recent work on data driven conditional computation of subnetworks that\nhas shown real progress in using a single model to share parameters among very\ndifferent types of inputs such as images and text, reducing the computation\nrequirement of multi-tower multimodal networks. Inspired by such line of work,\nwe explore similar per patch conditional computation for the first time for\nmobile vision transformers (vision only case), that will eventually be used for\nsingle-tower multimodal edge models. We evaluate the model on Cornell Sap\nSucker Woods 60, a fine grained bird species discrimination dataset.

Moreover, to enhance flexibility and reduce\ncomputational costs, we propose a trainable scheme for our pipeline that\nutilizes a smaller, tunable model as the query optimizer, which is refined\nthrough knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our evaluations on\nvarious question-answering (QA) datasets and with different retrieval systems\nshow that ERRR consistently outperforms existing baselines, proving to be a\nversatile and cost-effective module for improving the utility and accuracy of\nRAG systems.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has become one of the key methods for\nprivacy-preserving collaborative learning, as it enables the transfer of models\nwithout requiring local data exchange. Within the FL framework, an aggregation\nalgorithm is recognized as one of the most crucial components for ensuring the\nefficacy and security of the system. Existing average aggregation algorithms\ntypically assume that all client-trained data holds equal value or that weights\nare based solely on the quantity of data contributed by each client. In\ncontrast, alternative approaches involve training the model locally after\naggregation to enhance adaptability. However, these approaches fundamentally\nignore the inherent heterogeneity between different clients' data and the\ncomplexity of variations in data at the aggregation stage, which may lead to a\nsuboptimal global model.\n  To address these issues, this study proposes a novel dual-criterion weighted\naggregation algorithm involving the quantity and quality of data from the\nclient node. Specifically, we quantify the data used for training and perform\nmultiple rounds of local model inference accuracy evaluation on a specialized\ndataset to assess the data quality of each client. These two factors are\nutilized as weights within the aggregation process, applied through a\ndynamically weighted summation of these two factors. This approach allows the\nalgorithm to adaptively adjust the weights, ensuring that every client can\ncontribute to the global model, regardless of their data's size or initial\nquality.

Our\nresults demonstrate that the stress in the hardening region can be correlated\nwith the average stretch of the most extended bonds in each polymer chain,\nindependent of temperatures and strain rates.

Tracking PFJ motion is challenging since static imaging\nmodalities like CT and MRI are limited by field of view and metal artefact\ninterference. Ultrasounds offer an alternative modality for dynamic\nmusculoskeletal imaging. We aim to achieve accurate visualisation of patellar\ntracking and PFJ motion, using 3D registration of point clouds extracted from\nultrasound scans across different angles of joint flexion. Ultrasound images\ncontaining soft tissue are often mislabeled as bone during segmentation,\nresulting in noisy 3D point clouds that hinder accurate registration of the\nbony joint anatomy. Machine learning the intrinsic geometry of the knee bone\nmay help us eliminate these false positives. As the intrinsic geometry of the\nknee does not change during PFJ motion, one may expect this to be robust across\nmultiple angles of joint flexion. Our dynamical graphs-based post-processing\nalgorithm (DG-PPU) is able to achieve this, creating smoother point clouds that\naccurately represent bony knee anatomy across different angles. After inverting\nthese point clouds back to their original ultrasound images, we evaluated that\nDG-PPU outperformed manual data cleaning done by our lab technician, deleting\nfalse positives and noise with 98.2% precision across three different angles of\njoint flexion.

However, this task is inherently\ndifficult due to variations in fruit size, shape, occlusion, orientation, and\nthe dynamic nature of orchards where fruits may appear or disappear between\nobservations. In this article, we propose a novel method for fruit instance\nsegmentation and re-identification on 3D terrestrial point clouds collected\nover time. Our approach directly operates on dense colored point clouds,\ncapturing fine-grained 3D spatial detail. We segment individual fruits using a\nlearning-based instance segmentation method applied directly to the point\ncloud. For each segmented fruit, we extract a compact and discriminative\ndescriptor using a 3D sparse convolutional neural network. To track fruits\nacross different times, we introduce an attention-based matching network that\nassociates fruits with their counterparts from previous sessions. Matching is\nperformed using a probabilistic assignment scheme, selecting the most likely\nassociations across time. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets of\nstrawberries and apples, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods in\nboth instance segmentation and temporal re-identification, enabling robust and\nprecise fruit monitoring across complex and dynamic orchard environments.",

This could be due to their suggested\ndynamical histories, leading to the possible ejection of other planets.\nTOI-2109 b is special in this regard because it is the hot Jupiter with the\nclosest relative separation from its host star, being separated by less than\n2.3 stellar radii. Unexpectedly, transit timing measurements from recently\nobtained CHEOPS observations show low amplitude transit-timing variations\n(TTVs). We aim to search for signs of orbital decay and to characterise the\napparent TTVs, trying to gain information about a possible companion. We fit\nthe newly obtained CHEOPS light curves using TLCM and extract the resulting\nmid-transit timings. Successively, we use these measurements in combination\nwith TESS and archival photometric data and radial velocity data to estimate\nthe rate of tidal orbital decay of TOI-2109 b, as well as characterise the TTVs\nusing the N-body code TRADES and the photodynamical approach of PyTTV. We find\ntentative evidence at $3\\sigma$ for orbital decay in the TOI-2109 system, when\nwe correct the mid-transit timings using the best-fitting sinusoidal model of\nthe TTVs. We do not detect additional transits in the available photometric\ndata, but find evidence towards the authenticity of the apparent TTVs,\nindicating a close-by, outer companion with $P_\\mathrm{c} > 1.125\\,$d. Due to\nthe fast rotation of the star, the new planetary candidate cannot be detected\nin the available radial velocity (RV) measurements, and its parameters can only\nbe loosely constrained by our joint TTV and RV modelling. TOI-2109 could join a\nsmall group of rare hot Jupiter systems that host close-by planetary\ncompanions, only one of which (WASP-47 b) has an outer companion. More\nhigh-precision photometric measurements are necessary to confirm the planetary\ncompanion.",

We formalize\nthis via block diagonality conditions on the $(n+1)$th order derivatives of the\ngenerator mapping concepts to observed data, where different orders of\n\"complexity\" correspond to different $n$. Using this formalism, we prove that\ninteraction asymmetry enables both disentanglement and compositional\ngeneralization. Our results unify recent theoretical results for learning\nconcepts of objects, which we show are recovered as special cases with\n$n\\!=\\!0$ or $1$. We provide results for up to $n\\!=\\!2$, thus extending these\nprior works to more flexible generator functions, and conjecture that the same\nproof strategies generalize to larger $n$. Practically, our theory suggests\nthat, to disentangle concepts, an autoencoder should penalize its latent\ncapacity and the interactions between concepts during decoding. We propose an\nimplementation of these criteria using a flexible Transformer-based VAE, with a\nnovel regularizer on the attention weights of the decoder. On synthetic image\ndatasets consisting of objects, we provide evidence that this model can achieve\ncomparable object disentanglement to existing models that use more explicit\nobject-centric priors.",

    ],
    "abstract": "For the numerical solution of shape optimization problems, particularly those\nconstrained by partial differential equations (PDEs), the quality of the\nunderlying mesh is of utmost importance. Particularly when investigating\ncomplex geometries, the mesh quality tends to deteriorate over the course of a\nshape optimization so that either the optimization comes to a halt or an\nexpensive remeshing operation must be performed before the optimization can be\ncontinued. In this paper, we present a novel, semi-discrete approach for\nenforcing a minimum mesh quality in shape optimization. Our approach is based\non Rosen's gradient projection method, which incorporates mesh quality\nconstraints into the shape optimization problem. The proposed constraints bound\nthe angles of triangular and solid angles of tetrahedral mesh cells and, thus,\nalso bound the quality of these mesh cells. The method treats these constraints\nby projecting the search direction to the linear subspace of the currently\nactive constraints. Additionally, only slight modifications to the usual line\nsearch procedure are required to ensure the feasibility of the method. We\npresent our method for two- and three-dimensional simplicial meshes. We\ninvestigate the proposed approach numerically for the drag minimization of an\nobstacle in a two-dimensional Stokes flow, the optimization of the flow in a\npipe governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, and for the large-scale,\nthree-dimensional optimization of a structured packing used in a distillation\ncolumn. Our results show that the proposed method is indeed capable of\nguaranteeing a minimum mesh quality for both academic examples and challenging\nindustrial applications. Particularly, our approach allows the shape\noptimization of complex structures while ensuring that the mesh quality does\nnot deteriorate.",

Trotterization-based quantum simulations have shown promise, but\nimplementations on current hardware are limited by noise, necessitating error\nmitigation techniques like circuit optimization and post-selection. A mapping\nof the FHM to a Z2 LGT was recently proposed that restricts the dynamics to a\nsubspace protected by additional symmetries, and its ability for post-selection\nerror mitigation was verified through noisy classical simulations. In this\nwork, we propose and demonstrate a suite of algorithm-hardware co-design\nstrategies on a trapped-ion quantum computer, targeting two key aspects of\nNISQ-era quantum simulation: circuit compilation and error mitigation. In\nparticular, a novel combination of iteratively preconditioned gradient descent\n(IPG) and subsystem von Neumann Entropy compression reduces the 2-qubit gate\ncount of FHM quantum simulation by 35%, consequently doubling the number of\nsimulatable Trotter steps when used in tandem with error mitigation based on\nconserved symmetries, debiasing and sharpening techniques.

We consider a population of interacting\nagents with an initial energy budget walking on a graph according to an\nexploration and return (to home) strategy that is based on the current energy\nof the person. Each move reduces the available energy depending on the flow of\nmovements and the strength of interactions, and the movement ends when an agent\nreturns home with a negative energy. We observe that a uniform distribution of\ninitial energy budgets results in a larger number of visited sites per consumed\nenergy (efficiency) compared to case that all agents have the same initial\nenergy if return to home is relevant from the beginning of the process. The\nuniform energy distribution also reduces the amount of uncertainties in the\ntotal travel times (entropy production) which is more pronounced when the\nstrength of interactions and exploration play the relevant role in the movement\nprocess. That is variability in the energies can help to increase the\nefficiency and reduce the entropy production specially in presence of strong\ninteractions.",

While prior works empirically showed that\nCCE outperforms BCE and BPR when using the full set of negative items, we\nprovide a theoretical explanation for this by proving that CCE offers the\ntightest lower bound on ranking metrics like Normalized Discounted Cumulative\nGain (NDCG) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), followed by BPR and BCE.

Under\nnegative sampling, we reveal that BPR and CCE are equivalent when a single\nnegative sample is drawn, and all three losses converge to the same global\nminimum. We further demonstrate that the sampled losses remain lower bounds for\nNDCG (MRR), albeit in a probabilistic sense. Our worst-case analysis shows that\nBCE offers the strongest bound on NDCG (MRR).

The data annotation\nprocess for the CD task is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To make\nbetter use of the scarce labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, we present\nan adaptive dynamic semi-supervised learning method, AdaSemiCD, to improve the\nuse of pseudo-labels and optimize the training process. Initially, due to the\nextreme class imbalance inherent in CD, the model is more inclined to focus on\nthe background class, and it is easy to confuse the boundary of the target\nobject. Considering these two points, we develop a measurable evaluation metric\nfor pseudo-labels that enhances the representation of information entropy by\nclass rebalancing and amplification of confusing areas to give a larger weight\nto prospects change objects. Subsequently, to enhance the reliability of\nsample-wise pseudo-labels, we introduce the AdaFusion module, which is capable\nof dynamically identifying the most uncertain region and substituting it with\nmore trustworthy content. Lastly, to ensure better training stability, we\nintroduce the AdaEMA module, which updates the teacher model using only batches\nof trusted samples. Experimental results from LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CDD\ndatasets validate the efficacy and universality of our proposed adaptive\ntraining framework.",

Although such\nmechanochemical coupling is common in living matter and associated with\nbiological functions such as cell migration, division, and differentiation, the\nunderlying principles are not well understood due to a lack of minimal models\nthat bridge the scales from the microscopic biochemical processes to the\nmacroscopic shape dynamics.

    "abstract": "This work is motivated by an original dataset of reported mumps cases across\nnine regions of England, and focuses on the modeling of temporal dynamics and\ntime-varying dependency patterns between the observed time series. The goal is\nto discover the possible presence of latent routes of contagion that go beyond\nthe geographical locations of the regions, and instead may be explained through\nother non directly observable socio-economic factors. We build upon the recent\nstatistics literature and extend the existing count time series network models\nby adopting a time-varying latent distance network model. This approach can\nefficiently capture across-series and across-time dependencies, which are both\nnot directly observed from the data. We adopt a Bayesian hierarchical framework\nand perform parameter estimation using L-BFGS optimization and Hamiltonian\nMonte Carlo. We demonstrate with several simulation experiments that the model\nparameters can be accurately estimated under a variety of realistic dependency\nsettings. Our real data application on mumps cases leads to a detailed view of\nsome possible contagion routes. A critical advantage of our methodology is that\nit permits clear and interpretable visualizations of the complex relations\nbetween the time series and how these relations may evolve over time. The\ngeometric nature of the latent embedding provides useful model based summaries.\nIn particular, we show how to extract a measure of contraction of the inferred\nlatent space, which can be interpreted as an overall risk for the escalation of\ncontagion, at each point in time.

    "abstract": "The early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires an understanding of\nthe relationships between a wide range of features. Conditional independencies\nand partial correlations are suitable measures for these relationships, because\nthey can identify the effects of confounding and mediating variables. This\narticle presents a Bayesian approach to Gaussian copula graphical models\n(GCGMs) in order to estimate these conditional dependencies and partial\ncorrelations. This approach has two key advantages. First, it includes binary,\ndiscrete, and continuous variables. Second, it quantifies the uncertainty of\nthe estimates. Despite these advantages, Bayesian GCGMs have not been applied\nto AD research yet. In this study, we design a GCGM to find the conditional\ndependencies and partial correlations among brain-region specific gray matter\nvolume and glucose uptake, amyloid-beta levels, demographic information, and\ncognitive test scores. We applied our model to 1022 participants, including\nhealthy and cognitively impaired, across different stages of AD. We found that\naging reduces cognition through three indirect pathways: hippocampal volume\nloss, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) volume loss, and amyloid-beta\naccumulation. We found a positive partial correlation between being woman and\ncognition, but also discovered four indirect pathways that dampen this\nassociation in women: lower hippocampal volume, lower PCC volume, more\namyloid-beta accumulation, and less education. We found limited relations\nbetween brain-region specific glucose uptake and cognition, but discovered that\nthe hippocampus and PCC volumes are related to cognition. These results show\nthat the use of GCGMs offers valuable insights into AD pathogenesis.",

In this work, we\nobserve a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple\ntemporally consecutive point cloud sweeps, resulting in a remarkable\nimprovement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also\nincreases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of point\ncloud sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of\npoints in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points\nhas minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective\nGumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a\nlearned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network\ncomponents and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud\nnetwork architectures. Without incurring additional computational overhead, we\nincrease the number of point cloud sweeps from 10, a common practice, to as\nmany as 40. Consequently, there is a significant enhancement in perception\nperformance. For instance, in nuScenes 3D object detection and BEV map\nsegmentation tasks, our pruning strategy improves several 3D perception\nbaseline methods.",

When the range of Eddington ratio, $\\gamma_{\\rm Edd} > 10^{-3}$,\nthe radiation force exceeds the gas pressure, leading to stronger outflows and\nlarger dust sublimation radius. Although the sub-parsec-scale outflows is a\ntime-dependence phenomena, our simulations demonstrated that the radial\ndistributions can be well explained by the steady solutions of the spherically\nsymmetric stellar winds. The dynamic structure of sub-parsec-scale outflows is\ninfluenced by the dust sublimation radius and the critical radii determined by\nthe dynamical equilibrium condition.

Here, the equal amplitude method can be\ndirectly imposed by fixing the amplitude of the bump, while the equal energy\nmethod requires a physical definition of the energy of the bump with the\nassistance of hyperboloidal framework. For both methods, when the location of\nthe bump is close to the event horizon of the black hole, and the closer it is\nto the peak of the original potential, the larger are $\\mathcal{G}$-factor and\n$\\mathcal{H}$-factor, and they are bounded by the magnitude of the amplitude or\nthe energy.

Similar to 2D plane images and\nvideos, point clouds inevitably suffer from quality degradation and information\nloss through multimedia communication systems. Therefore, automatic point cloud\nquality assessment (PCQA) is of critical importance. In this work, we propose a\nnovel no-reference PCQA method by using a graph convolutional network (GCN) to\ncharacterize the mutual dependencies of multi-view 2D projected image contents.\nThe proposed GCN-based PCQA (GC-PCQA) method contains three modules, i.e.,\nmulti-view projection, graph construction, and GCN-based quality prediction.\nFirst, multi-view projection is performed on the test point cloud to obtain a\nset of horizontally and vertically projected images. Then, a\nperception-consistent graph is constructed based on the spatial relations among\ndifferent projected images. Finally, reasoning on the constructed graph is\nperformed by GCN to characterize the mutual dependencies and interactions\nbetween different projected images, and aggregate feature information of\nmulti-view projected images for final quality prediction. Experimental results\non two publicly available benchmark databases show that our proposed GC-PCQA\ncan achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art quality assessment\nmetrics.

Although previous\nstudies have investigated its convergence properties, a comprehensive analysis,\nespecially the convergence rate, is still desirable. Recognizing that LION can\nbe regarded as solving a specific constrained problem, this paper focuses on\ndemonstrating its convergence to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point at the rate\nof $\\cal O(\\sqrt{d}K^{-1/4})$ measured by gradient $\\ell_1$ norm, where $d$ is\nthe problem dimension and $K$ is the number of iteration steps. Step further,\nwe remove the constraint and establish that LION converges to the critical\npoint of the general unconstrained problem at the same rate. This rate not only\ndelivers the currently optimal dependence on the problem dimension $d$ but also\ntightly matches the theoretical lower bound for nonconvex stochastic\noptimization algorithms, which is typically measured using the gradient\n$\\ell_2$ norm, with respect to the number of iterations $K$. Through extensive\nexperiments, we not only demonstrate that LION achieves lower loss and higher\nperformance compared to standard SGD, but also empirically confirm that the\ngradient $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$ norm ratio aligns with $\\Theta(\\sqrt{d})$, thus\nproving that our convergence rate matches the theoretical lower bound with\nrespect to $d$ in the empirical sense.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities\nin document understanding, a rapidly growing research area with significant\nindustrial demand. As a multimodal task, document understanding requires models\nto possess both perceptual and cognitive abilities. However, due to different\ntypes of annotation noise in training, current MLLMs often face conflicts\nbetween perception and cognition. Taking a document VQA task (cognition) as an\nexample, an MLLM might generate answers that do not match the corresponding\nvisual content identified by its OCR (perception). This conflict suggests that\nthe MLLM might struggle to establish an intrinsic connection between the\ninformation it \"sees\" and what it \"understands\". Such conflicts challenge the\nintuitive notion that cognition is consistent with perception, hindering the\nperformance and explainability of MLLMs. In this paper, we define the conflicts\nbetween cognition and perception as Cognition and Perception (C&P) knowledge\nconflicts, a form of multimodal knowledge conflict, and systematically assess\nthem with a focus on document understanding. Our analysis reveals that even\nGPT-4o, a leading MLLM, achieves only 75.26% C&P consistency. To mitigate the\nC&P knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel method called Multimodal Knowledge\nConsistency Fine-tuning. Our method reduces C&P knowledge conflicts across all\ntested MLLMs and enhances their performance in both cognitive and perceptual\ntasks. All data we construct will be publicly available.",

This study evaluates the sensitivity of three\nnext-generation neutrino detectors which are Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment (DUNE), Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K), and the Jiangmen Underground\nNeutrino Observatory (JUNO) to supernova neutrinos, specifically focusing on\ntheir ability to discern between normal and inverted mass hierarchies. We\nutilize three different flux models: Bollig, Tamborra and Nakazato, employing\nthe SNEWPY software to simulate the expected neutrino fluxes from core-collapse\nsupernovae. These models highlight the variability in the predictions due to\ndifferent progenitors and simulation methods. By analyzing the event rates\nacross various interaction channels and implementing the adiabatic\nMikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect on the neutrino flux, we have\ncalculated the expected detection rates for each detector. Our results indicate\nthat sensitivities range from ${\\sim}3\\sigma$ to ${\\sim}9\\sigma$ for DUNE,\n${\\sim}4\\sigma$ to ${\\sim}16\\sigma$ for Hyper-K and ${\\sim}1.7\\sigma$ to\n${\\sim}6.7\\sigma$ for JUNO depending on distance and flux model, with\nsensitivity diminishing significantly at larger distances.

This\nproblem is constrained by the delicate tension between non-determinism and\nlinearity. Prior work developed a session-typed {\\pi}-calculus with standard\nnon-deterministic choice; well-typed processes enjoy type preservation and\ndeadlock-freedom. Central to this typed calculus is a lazy semantics that\ngradually discards branches in choices. This lazy semantics, however, is\ncomplex: various technical elements are needed to describe the\nnon-deterministic behavior of typed processes. This paper develops an entirely\nnew approach, based on an eager semantics, which more directly represents\nchoices and commitment. We present a {\\pi}-calculus in which non-deterministic\nchoices are governed by this eager semantics and session types.

To address this challenge, we introduce OWLed, the\nOutlier-Weighed Layerwise Pruning for Efficient Autonomous Driving Framework\nthat leverages outlier-weighted layerwise sparsity for model compression. Our\nmethod assigns non-uniform sparsity ratios to different layers based on the\ndistribution of outlier features, significantly reducing the model size without\nthe need for fine-tuning. To ensure the compressed model adapts well to\nautonomous driving tasks, we incorporate driving environment data into both the\ncalibration and pruning processes. Our empirical studies reveal that the\nencoder component is more sensitive to pruning than the LLM, highlighting its\ncritical role in the system. Experimental results demonstrate that OWLed\noutperforms existing methods in perception, action prediction, and language\nunderstanding while substantially lowering computational requirements. These\nfindings underscore the potential of combining advanced pruning techniques with\nLLMs to develop efficient and robust autonomous driving systems capable of\nhandling complex scenarios.

    "abstract": "The emergence of space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing\n(SAGIMEC) networks opens a significant opportunity for the rapidly growing low\naltitude economy (LAE), facilitating the development of various applications by\noffering efficient communication and computing services. However, the\nheterogeneous nature of SAGIMEC networks, coupled with the stringent\ncomputational and communication requirements of diverse applications in the\nLAE, introduces considerable challenges in integrating SAGIMEC into the LAE. In\nthis work, we first present a digital twin-assisted SAGIMEC paradigm for LAE,\nwhere digital twin enables reliable network monitoring and management, while\nSAGIMEC provides efficient computing offloading services for Internet of Things\nsensor devices (ISDs). Then, a joint satellite selection, computation\noffloading, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation\nand UAV trajectory control optimization problem (JSC4OP) is formulated to\nmaximize the quality of service (QoS) of ISDs. Given the complexity of JSC4OP,\nwe propose an online decentralized optimization approach (ODOA) to address the\nproblem. Specifically, JSC4OP is first transformed into a real-time\ndecision-making optimization problem (RDOP) by leveraging Lyapunov\noptimization. Then, to solve the RDOP, we introduce an online learning-based\nlatency prediction method to predict the uncertain system environment and a\ngame theoretic decision-making method to make real-time decisions. Finally,\ntheoretical analysis confirms the effectiveness of the ODOA, while the\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed ODOA outperforms other\nalternative approaches in terms of overall system performance.",

    "abstract": "In many Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems, decisions in a trained\npolicy vary in significance for the expected safety and performance of the\npolicy. Since RL policies are very complex, testing efforts should concentrate\non states in which the agent's decisions have the highest impact on the\nexpected outcome. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based method to\nrigorously compute a ranking of state importance across the entire state space.\nWe then focus our testing efforts on the highest-ranked states. In this paper,\nwe focus on testing for safety. However, the proposed methods can be easily\nadapted to test for performance. In each iteration, our testing framework\ncomputes optimistic and pessimistic safety estimates. These estimates provide\nlower and upper bounds on the expected outcomes of the policy execution across\nall modeled states in the state space. Our approach divides the state space\ninto safe and unsafe regions upon convergence, providing clear insights into\nthe policy's weaknesses. Two important properties characterize our approach.\n(1) Optimal Test-Case Selection: At any time in the testing process, our\napproach evaluates the policy in the states that are most critical for safety.\n(2) Guaranteed Safety: Our approach can provide formal verification guarantees\nover the entire state space by sampling only a fraction of the policy. Any\nsafety properties assured by the pessimistic estimate are formally proven to\nhold for the policy. We provide a detailed evaluation of our framework on\nseveral examples, showing that our method discovers unsafe policy behavior with\nlow testing effort.",

    "abstract": "Odometry in adverse weather conditions, such as fog, rain, and snow, presents\nsignificant challenges, as traditional vision and LiDAR-based methods often\nsuffer from degraded performance. Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) has emerged as\na promising solution due to its resilience in such environments. In this paper,\nwe present RINO, a non-iterative RIO framework implemented in an adaptively\nloosely coupled manner. Building upon ORORA as the baseline for radar odometry,\nRINO introduces several key advancements, including improvements in keypoint\nextraction, motion distortion compensation, and pose estimation via an adaptive\nvoting mechanism. This voting strategy facilitates efficient polynomial-time\noptimization while simultaneously quantifying the uncertainty in the radar\nmodule's pose estimation. The estimated uncertainty is subsequently integrated\ninto the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation within a Kalman filter\nframework. Unlike prior loosely coupled odometry systems, RINO not only retains\nthe global and robust registration capabilities of the radar component but also\ndynamically accounts for the real-time operational state of each sensor during\nfusion. Experimental results conducted on publicly available datasets\ndemonstrate that RINO reduces translation and rotation errors by 1.06% and\n0.09{\\deg}/100m, respectively, when compared to the baseline method, thus\nsignificantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, RINO achieves performance\ncomparable to state-of-the-art methods.",

If choose to resize\nthe UHR image to standard input image size, the extensive spatial and\ncontextual information that UHR images contain will be neglected. Otherwise,\nthe original size of these images often exceeds the token limits of standard\nRSMLLMs, making it difficult to process the entire image and capture long-range\ndependencies to answer the query based on the abundant visual context. In this\npaper, we introduce ImageRAG for RS, a training-free framework to address the\ncomplexities of analyzing UHR remote sensing imagery. By transforming UHR\nremote sensing image analysis task to image's long context selection task, we\ndesign an innovative image contextual retrieval mechanism based on the\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, denoted as ImageRAG. ImageRAG's\ncore innovation lies in its ability to selectively retrieve and focus on the\nmost relevant portions of the UHR image as visual contexts that pertain to a\ngiven query. Fast path and slow path are proposed in this framework to handle\nthis task efficiently and effectively. ImageRAG allows RSMLLMs to manage\nextensive context and spatial information from UHR RSI, ensuring the analysis\nis both accurate and efficient.

    "abstract": "Distributed microgrids are conventionally dependent on communication networks\nto achieve secondary control objectives. This dependence makes them vulnerable\nto stealth data integrity attacks (DIAs) where adversaries may perform\nmanipulations via infected transmitters and repeaters to jeopardize stability.\nThis paper presents a physics-guided, supervised Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN)-based framework that identifies communication-level cyberattacks in\nmicrogrids by analyzing whether incoming measurements will cause abnormal\nbehavior of the secondary control layer. If abnormalities are detected, an\niteration through possible spanning tree graph topologies that can be used to\nfulfill secondary control objectives is done. Then, a communication network\ntopology that would not create secondary control abnormalities is identified\nand enforced for maximum stability. By altering the communication graph\ntopology, the framework eliminates the dependence of the secondary control\nlayer on inputs from compromised cyber devices helping it achieve resilience\nwithout instability. Several case studies are provided showcasing the\nrobustness of the framework against False Data Injections and repeater-level\nMan-in-the-Middle attacks. To understand practical feasibility, robustness is\nalso verified against larger microgrid sizes and in the presence of varying\nnoise levels. Our findings indicate that performance can be affected when\nattempting scalability in the presence of noise. However, the framework\noperates robustly in low-noise settings.",

    "abstract": "Tensor-based multi-view clustering has recently received significant\nattention due to its exceptional ability to explore cross-view high-order\ncorrelations. However, most existing methods still encounter some limitations.\n(1) Most of them explore the correlations among different affinity matrices,\nmaking them unscalable to large-scale data. (2) Although some methods address\nit by introducing bipartite graphs, they may result in sub-optimal solutions\ncaused by an unstable anchor selection process. (3) They generally ignore the\nnegative impact of latent semantic-unrelated information in each view. To\ntackle these issues, we propose a new approach termed fast Disentangled Slim\nTensor Learning (DSTL) for multi-view clustering . Instead of focusing on the\nmulti-view graph structures, DSTL directly explores the high-order correlations\namong multi-view latent semantic representations based on matrix factorization.\nTo alleviate the negative influence of feature redundancy, inspired by robust\nPCA, DSTL disentangles the latent low-dimensional representation into a\nsemantic-unrelated part and a semantic-related part for each view.\nSubsequently, two slim tensors are constructed with tensor-based\nregularization. To further enhance the quality of feature disentanglement, the\nsemantic-related representations are aligned across views through a consensus\nalignment indicator. Our proposed model is computationally efficient and can be\nsolved effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and\nefficiency of DSTL over state-of-the-art approaches.

Accurate channel modeling is\ncrucial for the design and performance evaluation of future ISAC systems. In\nthis paper, a THz measurement campaign for monostatic sensing is presented.\nVNA-based channel measurements are conducted in a laboratory scenario, where\nthe transmitter and receiver are positioned together to mimic monostatic\nsensing. The centering frequency and measured bandwidth for these measurements\nare 300 GHz and 20 GHz, respectively. A DSS scheme is employed to capture\nspatial sensing channel profiles.

Our analysis focuses on reasoning tasks,\nwhose problem structure allows us to distinguish between memorization (the\nexact replication of reasoning steps from the training data) and performance\n(the correctness of the final solution). We find that a model's generalization\nbehavior can be effectively characterized by a training metric we call\npre-memorization train accuracy: the accuracy of model samples on training\nqueries before they begin to copy the exact reasoning steps from the training\nset. On the dataset level, this metric is able to reliably predict test\naccuracy, achieving $R^2$ of around or exceeding 0.9 across various models\n(Llama3 8, Gemma2 9B), datasets (GSM8k, MATH), and training configurations. On\na per-example level, this metric is also indicative of whether individual model\npredictions are robust to perturbations in the training query. By connecting a\nmodel's learning behavior to its generalization, pre-memorization train\naccuracy can guide targeted improvements to training strategies. We focus on\ndata curation as an example, and show that prioritizing examples with low\npre-memorization accuracy leads to 1.5-2x improvements in data efficiency\ncompared to i.i.d. data scaling, and outperforms other standard data curation\ntechniques.",

    "abstract": "To improve the performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Structure\nLearning (GSL) has been extensively applied to reconstruct or refine original\ngraph structures, effectively addressing issues like heterophily,\nover-squashing, and noisy structures. While GSL is generally thought to improve\nGNN performance, it often leads to longer training times and more\nhyperparameter tuning. Besides, the distinctions among current GSL methods\nremain ambiguous from the perspective of GNN training, and there is a lack of\ntheoretical analysis to quantify their effectiveness. Recent studies further\nsuggest that, under fair comparisons with the same hyperparameter tuning, GSL\ndoes not consistently outperform baseline GNNs. This motivates us to ask a\ncritical question: is GSL really useful for GNNs? To address this question,\nthis paper makes two key contributions. First, we propose a new GSL framework,\nwhich includes three steps: GSL base (the representation used for GSL)\nconstruction, new structure construction, and view fusion, to better understand\nthe effectiveness of GSL in GNNs. Second, after graph convolution, we analyze\nthe differences in mutual information (MI) between node representations derived\nfrom the original topology and those from the newly constructed topology.\nSurprisingly, our empirical observations and theoretical analysis show that no\nmatter which type of graph structure construction methods are used, after\nfeeding the same GSL bases to the newly constructed graph, there is no MI gain\ncompared to the original GSL bases. To fairly reassess the effectiveness of\nGSL, we conduct ablation experiments and find that it is the pretrained GSL\nbases that enhance GNN performance, and in most cases, GSL cannot improve GNN\nperformance. This finding encourages us to rethink the essential components in\nGNNs, such as self-training and structural encoding, in GNN design rather than\nGSL.",

While traditional GNNs typically treat each feature\ndimension equally during graph convolution, we raise an important question: Is\nthe graph convolution operation equally beneficial for each feature? If not,\nthe convolution operation on certain feature dimensions can possibly lead to\nharmful effects, even worse than the convolution-free models. In prior studies,\nto assess the impacts of graph convolution on features, people proposed metrics\nbased on feature homophily to measure feature consistency with the graph\ntopology. However, these metrics have shown unsatisfactory alignment with GNN\nperformance and have not been effectively employed to guide feature selection\nin GNNs. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel metric, Topological\nFeature Informativeness (TFI), to distinguish between GNN-favored and\nGNN-disfavored features, where its effectiveness is validated through both\ntheoretical analysis and empirical observations. Based on TFI, we propose a\nsimple yet effective Graph Feature Selection (GFS) method, which processes\nGNN-favored and GNN-disfavored features separately, using GNNs and non-GNN\nmodels. Compared to original GNNs, GFS significantly improves the extraction of\nuseful topological information from each feature with comparable computational\ncosts. Extensive experiments show that after applying GFS to 8 baseline and\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN architectures across 10 datasets, 83.75% of the\nGFS-augmented cases show significant performance boosts. Furthermore, our\nproposed TFI metric outperforms other feature selection methods. These results\nvalidate the effectiveness of both GFS and TFI.

The direction of the\nlocalization can be conveniently characterized by the sign of the winding\nnumbers.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often perpetuate biases in pronoun usage,\nleading to misrepresentation or exclusion of queer individuals. This paper\naddresses the specific problem of biased pronoun usage in LLM outputs,\nparticularly the inappropriate use of traditionally gendered pronouns (\"he,\"\n\"she\") when inclusive language is needed to accurately represent all\nidentities. We introduce a collaborative agent pipeline designed to mitigate\nthese biases by analyzing and optimizing pronoun usage for inclusivity. Our\nmulti-agent framework includes specialized agents for both bias detection and\ncorrection. Experimental evaluations using the Tango dataset-a benchmark\nfocused on gender pronoun usage-demonstrate that our approach significantly\nimproves inclusive pronoun classification, achieving a 32.6 percentage point\nincrease over GPT-4o in correctly disagreeing with inappropriate traditionally\ngendered pronouns $(\\chi^2 = 38.57, p < 0.0001)$. These results accentuate the\npotential of agent-driven frameworks in enhancing fairness and inclusivity in\nAI-generated content, demonstrating their efficacy in reducing biases and\npromoting socially responsible AI.",

However, the\nresulting beams have been shown to be hypergeometric-Gaussian modes, due to the\nchanging radial amplitudes on propagation. In this work, we show that these\nbeams in fact have the angular spectrum of elegant Laguerre-Gaussian (eLG)\nmodes, and therefore map back to LG-type modes.

In this work, we develop a method to obtain hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) nanolayers (with or without twist) using a specially designed\nchemical exfoliation technique. The resulting hBN nanolayers are atomically\nclean and strain free, hence providing ideal MSLs for the investigation of\ntheir moir\\'e potential.

Then, the moire potential\nis reconstructed by the inverse fast Fourier transform of the moire diffraction\nspots. It has been revealed that the local interlayer atomic overlap plays a\ndecisive role in determining the periodicity and distribution of the moir\\'e\npotential, as supported by density functional theory calculations.

We focus on the local type\nnon-Gaussianity characterized by the curvature perturbation $\\zeta$ given by a\nfunction of a Gaussian random variable $\\zeta_{\\rm G}$ as\n$\\beta\\zeta=-\\ln(1-\\beta \\zeta_{\\rm G})$ with a parameter $\\beta$. Then we\nexamine how the non-Gaussianity influences the dynamics and the type of PBH\nformed, particularly focusing on type II fluctuations, where the areal radius\nvaries non-monotonically with the coordinate radius. Our findings indicate\nthat, for $\\beta>-2$, the threshold for distinguishing between type A and type\nB PBHs decreases with increasing $\\beta$ similarly to the threshold for black\nhole formation. Additionally, for large positive values of $\\beta$, the\nthreshold for type B PBHs approaches that for type II fluctuations. We also\nfind that, for a sufficiently large negative value of $\\beta\\lesssim-4.0$, the\nthreshold value is in the type II region of $\\mu$, i.e., there are fluctuations\nof type II that do not form black holes. Lastly, we calculate the PBH mass for\nseveral values of $\\beta$.

Such a formalism will\nhave many applications in physics and engineering, since the kernel is no\nlonger restricted. We first extend the work of Al-Refai and Luchko (2023) on\nfinite interval to arbitrary orders. Followed by, developing an efficient\nPetrov-Galerkin scheme by introducing Jacobi convolution series as basis\nfunctions. A notable property of this basis function, the general fractional\nderivative of Jacobi convolution series is a shifted Jacobi polynomial. Thus,\nwith a suitable test function it results in diagonal stiffness matrix, hence,\nthe efficiency in implementation.

    "abstract": "Finding a controlled-invariant set for a system with state and control\nconstraints is crucial for safety-critical applications. However, existing\nmethods often produce overly conservative solutions. This paper presents a\nmethod for generating controlled-invariant (safe) sets for nonlinear polynomial\ncontrol-affine systems using Control Barrier Certificates (CBCs). We formulate\nCBC conditions as Sum-of-Squares (SOS) constraints and solve them via an SOS\nProgram (SOSP). First, we generalize existing SOSPs for CBC synthesis to handle\nenvironments with complex unsafe state representations. Then, we propose an\niterative algorithm that progressively enlarges the safe set constructed by the\nsynthesized CBCs by maximizing boundary expansion at each iteration. We\ntheoretically prove that our method guarantees strict safe set expansion at\nevery step. Finally, we validate our approach with numerical simulations in 2D\nand 3D for single-input and multi-input systems. Empirical results show that\nthe safe set generated by our method covers in most part a larger portion of\nthe state space compared to two state-of-the-art techniques.",

In contrast, linear attention\nprovides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear\nlevels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often\nexperiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that\nthis performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's\nfeature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial\ninformation. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention,\nwe conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output\nfeatures. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA),\nwhich rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear\ncomplexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented\nVision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT\nachieves excellent performance across various vision tasks.

However, the current ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still\nsuffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function\nevaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality\ngeneration. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous\nsteps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from\nthe previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to\napproximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor\nexpansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial\ninterpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could\napproximate equals the number of previous steps we cached. We also prove that\nthe flow-solver has a more minor approximation error and faster generation\nspeed. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ, LSUN-Bedroom,\nLSUN-Church, ImageNet, and real text-to-image generation prove the efficiency\nof the flow-solver. Specifically, the flow-solver improves the FID-30K from\n13.79 to 6.75, from 46.64 to 19.49 with $\\text{NFE}=10$ on CIFAR-10 and\nLSUN-Church, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning models have demonstrated impressive abilities to capture\nsemantic similarities by aligning representations in the embedding space.\nHowever, their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data\nand its inherent biases. While Preference Optimization (PO) methods such as\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) have been applied to align generative models with human\npreferences, their use in contrastive learning has yet to be explored. This\npaper introduces a novel method for training contrastive learning models using\ndifferent PO methods to break down complex concepts. Our method systematically\naligns model behavior with desired preferences, enhancing performance on the\ntargeted task. In particular, we focus on enhancing model robustness against\ntypographic attacks and inductive biases, commonly seen in contrastive\nvision-language models like CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that models\ntrained using PO outperform standard contrastive learning techniques while\nretaining their ability to handle adversarial challenges and maintain accuracy\non other downstream tasks. This makes our method well-suited for tasks\nrequiring fairness, robustness, and alignment with specific preferences. We\nevaluate our method for tackling typographic attacks on images and explore its\nability to disentangle gender concepts and mitigate gender bias, showcasing the\nversatility of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Training-free conditional generation based on flow matching aims to leverage\npre-trained unconditional flow matching models to perform conditional\ngeneration without retraining. Recently, a successful training-free conditional\ngeneration approach incorporates conditions via posterior sampling, which\nrelies on the availability of a score function in the unconditional diffusion\nmodel. However, flow matching models do not possess an explicit score function,\nrendering such a strategy inapplicable. Approximate posterior sampling for flow\nmatching has been explored, but it is limited to linear inverse problems. In\nthis paper, we propose Flow Matching-based Posterior Sampling (FMPS) to expand\nits application scope. We introduce a correction term by steering the velocity\nfield. This correction term can be reformulated to incorporate a surrogate\nscore function, thereby bridging the gap between flow matching models and\nscore-based posterior sampling. Hence, FMPS enables the posterior sampling to\nbe adjusted within the flow matching framework. Further, we propose two\npractical implementations of the correction mechanism: one aimed at improving\ngeneration quality, and the other focused on computational efficiency.\nExperimental results on diverse conditional generation tasks demonstrate that\nour method achieves superior generation quality compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness and generality of\nFMPS.",

Non-equilibrium processes break\ntime-reversal symmetry by maintaining circulating probability currents. In\nphysical processes, these currents require a continual use and exchange of\nenergy. Accordingly, signatures of non-equilibrium behavior are important\nmarkers of energy use in biophysical systems. In this article we consider a\nparticular signature of nonequilibrium behavior: area production rates. These\nare, the average rate at which a stochastic process traces out signed area in\nits projections onto coordinate planes. Area production is an example of a\nlinear observable: a path integral over an observed trajectory against a linear\nvector field. We provide a summary review of area production rates in\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. Then, we show that, given an OU process, a\nweighted Frobenius norm of the area production rate matrix is the optimal test\nstatistic for detecting nonequilibrium behavior in the sense that its\ncoefficient of variation decays faster in the length of time observed than the\ncoefficient of variation of any other linear observable.

The outstanding substance\nidentifiability of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has significantly enhanced the\ndetection accuracy, making hyperspectral change detection (HCD) an essential\ntechnology. The detection accuracy can be further upgraded by leveraging the\ngraph structure of HSIs, motivating us to adopt the graph neural networks\n(GNNs) in solving HCD. For the first time, this work introduces quantum deep\nnetwork (QUEEN) into HCD. Unlike GNN and CNN, both extracting the\naffine-computing features, QUEEN provides fundamentally different\nunitary-computing features. We demonstrate that through the unitary feature\nextraction procedure, QUEEN provides radically new information for deciding\nwhether there is a change or not. Hierarchically, a graph feature learning\n(GFL) module exploits the graph structure of the bitemporal HSIs at the\nsuperpixel level, while a quantum feature learning (QFL) module learns the\nquantum features at the pixel level, as a complementary to GFL by preserving\npixel-level detailed spatial information not retained in the superpixels.

The concept\nof Service Function Chain (SFC) is introduced to provide complex services,\nwhich is an ordered set of Network Functions (NF). The network functions of an\nSFC can be decomposed in several ways into some Virtual Network Functions\n(VNF). Additionally, the decomposed NFs can be placed (mapped) as VNFs on\ndifferent machines on the underlying physical infrastructure. Selecting good\ndecompositions and good placements among the possible options greatly affects\nboth costs and service quality metrics. Previous research has addressed NF\ndecomposition and VNF placement as separate problems. However, in this paper,\nwe address both NF decomposition and VNF placement simultaneously as a single\nproblem. Since finding an optimal solution is NP-hard, we have employed\nheuristic algorithms to solve the problem. Specifically, we have introduced a\nmultiobjective decomposition and mapping VNFs (MODMVNF) method based on the\nnon-dominated sorting genetic multi-objective algorithm (NSGAII) to solve the\nproblem. The goal is to find near-optimal decomposition and mapping on the\nphysical network at the same time to minimize the mapping cost and\ncommunication latency of SFC.

Different\nfrom classical model reduction problems, physical realizability conditions for\nguaranteeing that the reduced-order system is also a quantum system should be\ntaken as nonlinear constraints in the optimization. To solve the optimization\nproblem with such nonlinear constraints, we employ a matrix inequality approach\nto transform nonlinear inequality constraints into readily solvable linear\nmatrix inequalities (LMIs) and nonlinear equality constraints, so that the\noptimization problem can be solved by a lifting variables approach. We\nemphasize that different from existing work, which only introduces a criterion\nto evaluate the performance after model reduction, we guide our method to\nobtain an optimal reduced model with respect to the $\\mathscr{H}_2$ norm.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) allows for\npolicy training with a simple binary cross-entropy loss without a reward model.\nThe objective of DPO is regularized by reverse KL divergence that encourages\nmode-seeking fitting to the reference policy. Nonetheless, we indicate that\nminimizing reverse KL divergence could fail to capture a mode of the reference\ndistribution, which may hurt the policy's performance. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a simple modification to DPO, H-DPO, which allows for\ncontrol over the entropy of the resulting policy, enhancing the distribution's\nsharpness and thereby enabling mode-seeking fitting more effectively. In our\nexperiments, we show that H-DPO outperformed DPO across various tasks,\ndemonstrating superior results in pass@$k$ evaluations for mathematical tasks.\nMoreover, H-DPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor modifications to\nthe loss calculation of DPO, which makes it highly practical and promising for\nwide-ranging applications in the training of LLMs.",

This paper aims to investigate\nthe control systems necessary for interception. It also proposes a subsonic\ndesign utilizing literature and prior research, suggests aerodynamic\nderivatives, and analyses a designed 2D reduced pitch autopilot control system\nresponse against performances. The pitch autopilot model contains an optimized\nPID controller, 2nd order actuator, lead compensator and Kalman Filter, that\nrejects time varying disturbances and high frequency noise expected during\nflight. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method\nthrough reduction in rise time (21%), settle time (10%), and highlighted its\nhigh frequency deficiency with respect to the compensator integration. The\nactuator delay of 100ms has been negated by the augmented compensator autopilot\ncontroller so that it exceeds system performance requirements (1) & (3).\nHowever, (2) is not satisfied as 370% overshoot exists.

The combination of high angles of attack,\ntime-varying mass, thrust, and centre of gravity, actuator delay, and signal\nnoise create a highly non-linear dynamic system with many uncertainties that is\nextremely challenging to control. A robust control system based on saturated\nsliding mode control is proposed to overcome the time-varying parameters and\nnon-linearities. A lag compensator is designed to overcome actuator delay. A\nsecond-order filter is selected to reduce high-frequency measurement noise.\nWhen combined, the proposed solutions can make the system stable despite the\nexistence of changing mass, centre of gravity, thrust, and sensor noise.

The main challenges with VTOL aircraft, comes during the dynamic\nphase (mode transition), where the aircraft transitions from a hover state to\nfull forwards flight.

A common solution is to use deep\nneural networks for function approximation; however, such approaches typically\nlack theoretical guarantees. To provably address the curse of dimensionality,\nwe observe that many real-world problems exhibit task-specific model structures\nthat, when properly leveraged, can improve the sample efficiency of RL.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose overcoming the curse of dimensionality by\napproximately factorizing the original Markov decision processes (MDPs) into\nsmaller, independently evolving MDPs. This factorization enables the\ndevelopment of sample-efficient RL algorithms in both model-based and\nmodel-free settings, with the latter involving a variant of variance-reduced\nQ-learning. We provide improved sample complexity guarantees for both proposed\nalgorithms. Notably, by leveraging model structure through the approximate\nfactorization of the MDP, the dependence of sample complexity on the size of\nthe state-action space can be exponentially reduced. Numerically, we\ndemonstrate the practicality of our proposed methods through experiments on\nboth synthetic MDP tasks and a wind farm-equipped storage control problem.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, recommendation algorithms have been designed for service\ndevelopers. But recently, a new paradigm called user-side recommender systems\nhas been proposed. User-side recommender systems are built and used by end\nusers, in sharp contrast to traditional provider-side recommender systems. Even\nif the official recommender system offered by the provider is not fair, end\nusers can create and enjoy their own user-side recommender systems by\nthemselves. Although the concept of user-side recommender systems is\nattractive, the problem is they require tremendous communication costs between\nthe user and the official system. Even the most efficient user-side recommender\nsystems require about 5 times more costs than provider-side recommender\nsystems. Such high costs hinder the adoption of user-side recommender systems.\nIn this paper, we propose overhead-free user-side recommender systems,\nRecCycle, which realizes user-side recommender systems without any\ncommunication overhead. The main idea of RecCycle is to recycle past\nrecommendation results offered by the provider's recommender systems. The\ningredients of RecCycle can be retrieved ``for free,'' and it greatly reduces\nthe cost of user-side recommendations.

These limitations manifest in the challenge\nof guaranteeing rapid response and large-scale movements simultaneously,\nultimately restricting the robots' absolute speed and overall efficiency. In\nthis paper, we introduce a high-frequency pneumatic oscillator (HIPO) to\novercome these challenges. Through a collision-induced phase resetting\nmechanism, our HIPO leverages event-based nonlinearity to trigger\nself-oscillation of pneumatic actuator, which positively utilizes intrinsic\ncharacteristics of materials. This enables the system to spontaneously generate\nperiodic control signals and directly produce motion responses, eliminating the\nneed for incorporating external actuation components. By efficiently and\nrapidly converting internal energy of airflow into the kinetic energy of\nrobots, HIPO achieves a frequency of up to 20 Hz. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthe versatility and high-performance capabilities of HIPO through bio-inspired\nrobots: an insect-like fast-crawler (with speeds up to 50.27 cm/s), a\nhigh-frequency butterfly-like wing-flapper, and a maneuverable duck-like\nswimmer.

We also describe the minimal left ideals of\n$KP_\\mathsf{k}(\\Lambda)$ in terms of the aperiodic atoms of $T_\\Lambda$ and\nthus obtain a monoid theoretic characterization for\n$Soc(KP_\\mathsf{k}(\\Lambda)$) to be an essential ideal. These results help us\nto characterize semisimple Kumjian-Pask algebras through the lens of\n$T_\\Lambda$.",

Leveraging the intrinsic variational\nstructure of higher-order dynamics, this paper presents a general technique for\napplying existing symplectic integration schemes to dissipative systems, with\nparticular emphasis on viscous fluids modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations.\nTwo very simple such schemes are developed here. Not only are these schemes\nunconditionally stable for dissipative systems, they also outperform\ntraditional methods with a similar degree of complexity in terms of accuracy\nfor a given time step. For example, in the case of viscous flow between two\ninfinite, flat plates, one of the schemes developed here is found to outperform\nboth the implicit Euler method and the explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method\nin predicting the velocity profile. To the authors' knowledge, this is the very\nfirst time that a symplectic integration scheme has been applied successfully\nto the Navier-Stokes equations. We interpret the present success as direct\nempirical validation of the canonical Hamiltonian formulation of the\nNavier-Stokes problem recently published by Sanders~\\emph{et al.} More\nsophisticated symplectic integration schemes are expected to exhibit even\ngreater performance.

From a\nco-design perspective, it encompasses versatile Processing-In-Memory (PIM)\nconfigurations to produce hardware-efficient models. Our solution space's\nscale, heterogeneity, and complexity pose several challenges, which we address\nby proposing various techniques for training and evaluating the supernet. Our\ncrafted models show promising results on three Click-Through Rates (CTR)\nprediction benchmarks, outperforming both manually designed and AutoML-crafted\nmodels with state-of-the-art performance when focusing solely on architecture\nsearch. From a co-design perspective, we achieve 2x FLOPs efficiency, 1.8x\nenergy efficiency, and 1.5x performance improvements in recommender models.",

However, these methods\nhave notable limitations: they require white-box access, which is not always\nfeasible, and involve high memory usage.

Nevertheless, multi-task strategies based No-Reference Image Quality\nAssessment (NR-IQA) methods encounter several challenges. First, existing\nmethods have not explicitly exploited texture details, which significantly\ninfluence the image quality. Second, multi-task methods conventionally\nintegrate features through simple operations such as addition or concatenation,\nthereby diminishing the network's capacity to accurately represent distorted\nfeatures. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-task NR-IQA\nframework. Our framework consists of three key components: a high-frequency\nextraction network, a quality estimation network, and a distortion-aware\nnetwork. The high-frequency extraction network is designed to guide the model's\nfocus towards high-frequency information, which is highly related to the\ntexture details. Meanwhile, the distortion-aware network extracts\ndistortion-related features to distinguish different distortion types. To\neffectively integrate features from different tasks, a feature fusion module is\ndeveloped based on an attention mechanism.

We formally introduce the concept of exogenous\nrandomness and identify two types of commonly existing randomness: Type I from\nfeature subsampling, and Type II from tie-breaking in tree-building processes.\nWe develop non-asymptotic expansions for the mean squared error (MSE) for both\nindividual trees and forests and establish sufficient and necessary conditions\nfor their consistency. In the special example of the linear regression model\nwith independent features, our MSE expansions are more explicit, providing more\nunderstanding of the random forests' mechanisms. It also allows us to derive an\nupper bound on the MSE with explicit consistency rates for trees and forests.\nGuided by our theoretical findings, we conduct simulations to further explore\nhow exogenous randomness enhances random forest performance. Our findings\nunveil that feature subsampling reduces both the bias and variance of random\nforests compared to individual trees, serving as an adaptive mechanism to\nbalance bias and variance. Furthermore, our results reveal an intriguing\nphenomenon: the presence of noise features can act as a \"blessing\" in enhancing\nthe performance of random forests thanks to feature subsampling.",

Recently, Haviv, Mattheus, Milojevi\\'{c} and Wigderson have\nimproved the lower bound on nearly orthogonal sets over finite fields, using\ncounting arguments and a hypergraph container lemma. They showed that for every\nprime $p$ and an integer $\\ell$, there is a constant $\\delta(p,\\ell)$ such that\nfor every field $\\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $d \\geq\nk \\geq \\ell + 1$, $\\mathbb{F}^d$ contains a $(k,\\ell)$-nearly orthogonal set of\nsize $d^{\\delta k / \\log k}$. This nearly matches an upper bound\n$\\binom{d+k}{k}$ coming from Ramsey theory. Moreover, they proved the same\nlower bound for the size of a largest set $A$ where for any two subsets of $A$\nof size $k+1$ each, there is a vector in one of the subsets orthogonal to a\nvector in the other one. We prove a common generalisation of this result,\nshowing that essentially the same lower bound holds for the size of a largest\nset $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}^d$ with the stronger property that given any family\nof subsets $A_1, \\ldots, A_{\\ell+1} \\subseteq A$, each of size $k+1$, we can\nfind a vector in each $A_i$ such that they are all pairwise orthogonal. Rather\nthan combining both counting and container arguments, we make use of a\nmultipartite asymmetric container lemma that allows for non-uniform co-degree\nconditions.

However, 3DGS can be inefficient in terms of storage and prone to\noverfitting by excessively growing Gaussians, particularly with limited views.\nThis paper proposes an efficient framework, dubbed HiCoM, with three key\ncomponents. First, we construct a compact and robust initial 3DGS\nrepresentation using a perturbation smoothing strategy. Next, we introduce a\nHierarchical Coherent Motion mechanism that leverages the inherent non-uniform\ndistribution and local consistency of 3D Gaussians to swiftly and accurately\nlearn motions across frames. Finally, we continually refine the 3DGS with\nadditional Gaussians, which are later merged into the initial 3DGS to maintain\nconsistency with the evolving scene. To preserve a compact representation, an\nequivalent number of low-opacity Gaussians that minimally impact the\nrepresentation are removed before processing subsequent frames. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on two widely used datasets show that our framework\nimproves learning efficiency of the state-of-the-art methods by about $20\\%$\nand reduces the data storage by $85\\%$, achieving competitive free-viewpoint\nvideo synthesis quality but with higher robustness and stability.

    "abstract": "While the Transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success across\nvarious domains, a thorough theoretical foundation explaining its optimization\ndynamics is yet to be fully developed. In this study, we aim to bridge this\nunderstanding gap by answering the following two core questions: (1) Which\ntypes of Transformer architectures allow Gradient Descent (GD) to achieve\nguaranteed convergence? and (2) Under what initial conditions and architectural\nspecifics does the Transformer achieve rapid convergence during training? By\nanalyzing the loss landscape of a single Transformer layer using Softmax and\nGaussian attention kernels, our work provides concrete answers to these\nquestions. Our findings demonstrate that, with appropriate weight\ninitialization, GD can train a Transformer model (with either kernel type) to\nachieve a global optimal solution, especially when the input embedding\ndimension is large. Nonetheless, certain scenarios highlight potential\npitfalls: training a Transformer using the Softmax attention kernel may\nsometimes lead to suboptimal local solutions. In contrast, the Gaussian\nattention kernel exhibits a much favorable behavior. Our empirical study\nfurther validate the theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Traffic accidents pose a significant threat to public safety, resulting in\nnumerous fatalities, injuries, and a substantial economic burden each year. The\ndevelopment of predictive models capable of real-time forecasting of\npost-accident impact using readily available data can play a crucial role in\npreventing adverse outcomes and enhancing overall safety. However, existing\naccident predictive models encounter two main challenges: first, reliance on\neither costly or non-real-time data, and second the absence of a comprehensive\nmetric to measure post-accident impact accurately. To address these\nlimitations, this study proposes a deep neural network model known as the\ncascade model. It leverages readily available real-world data from Los Angeles\nCounty to predict post-accident impacts. The model consists of two components:\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM\nmodel captures temporal patterns, while the CNN extracts patterns from the\nsparse accident dataset. Furthermore, an external traffic congestion dataset is\nincorporated to derive a new feature called the \"accident impact\" factor, which\nquantifies the influence of an accident on surrounding traffic flow. Extensive\nexperiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nhybrid machine learning method in predicting the post-accident impact compared\nto state-of-the-art baselines. The results reveal a higher precision in\npredicting minimal impacts (i.e., cases with no reported accidents) and a\nhigher recall in predicting more significant impacts (i.e., cases with reported\naccidents).",

    "abstract": "Model stealing, where a learner tries to recover an unknown model via\ncarefully chosen queries, is a critical problem in machine learning, as it\nthreatens the security of proprietary models and the privacy of data they are\ntrained on. In recent years, there has been particular interest in stealing\nlarge language models (LLMs). In this paper, we aim to build a theoretical\nunderstanding of stealing language models by studying a simple and\nmathematically tractable setting. We study model stealing for Hidden Markov\nModels (HMMs), and more generally low-rank language models.\n  We assume that the learner works in the conditional query model, introduced\nby Kakade, Krishnamurthy, Mahajan and Zhang. Our main result is an efficient\nalgorithm in the conditional query model, for learning any low-rank\ndistribution. In other words, our algorithm succeeds at stealing any language\nmodel whose output distribution is low-rank. This improves upon the previous\nresult by Kakade, Krishnamurthy, Mahajan and Zhang, which also requires the\nunknown distribution to have high \"fidelity\", a property that holds only in\nrestricted cases. There are two key insights behind our algorithm: First, we\nrepresent the conditional distributions at each timestep by constructing\nbarycentric spanners among a collection of vectors of exponentially large\ndimension. Second, for sampling from our representation, we iteratively solve a\nsequence of convex optimization problems that involve projection in relative\nentropy to prevent compounding of errors over the length of the sequence. This\nis an interesting example where, at least theoretically, allowing a machine\nlearning model to solve more complex problems at inference time can lead to\ndrastic improvements in its performance.",

    "abstract": "DNSSEC, a DNS security extension, is essential to accurately translating\ndomain names to IP addresses. Digital signatures provide the foundation for\nthis reliable translation, however, the evolution of 'Quantum Computers' has\nmade traditional digital signatures vulnerable. In light of this, NIST has\nrecently selected potential post-quantum digital signatures that can operate on\nconventional computers and resist attacks made with Quantum Computers. Since\nthese post-quantum digital signatures are still in their early stages of\ndevelopment, replacing pre-quantum digital signature schemes in DNSSEC with\npost-quantum candidates is risky until the post-quantum candidates have\nundergone a thorough security analysis. Given this, herein, we investigate the\nviability of employing 'Double-Signatures' in DNSSEC, combining a post-quantum\ndigital signature and a classic one. The rationale is that double-signatures\nwill offer protection against quantum threats on conventional signature schemes\nas well as unknown non-quantum attacks on post-quantum signature schemes, hence\neven if one fails the other provides security guarantees. However, the\ninclusion of two signatures in the DNSSEC response message doesn't bode well\nwith the maximum allowed size of DNSSEC responses (i.e., 1232B, a limitation\nenforced by MTU of physical links). To counter this issue, we leverage a way to\ndo application-layer fragmentation of DNSSEC responses with two signatures. We\nimplement our solution on top of OQS-BIND and through experiments show that the\naddition of two signatures in DNSSEC and application-layer fragmentation of all\nrelevant resource records and their reassembly does not have any substantial\nimpact on the efficiency of the resolution process and thus is suitable for the\ninterim period at least until the quantum computers are fully realized.",

    "abstract": "A stellar-mass black hole, embedded within the accretion disk of an active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN), has the potential to accrete gas at a rate that can\nreach approximately $\\sim 10^9$ times the Eddington limit. This study explores\nthe potential for nuclear burning in the rapidly accreting flow towards this\nblack hole and studies how nucleosynthesis affects metal production. Using\nnumerical methods, we have obtained the disk structure while considering\nnuclear burning and assessed the stability of the disk. In contrast to gas\naccretion onto the surface of a neutron star or white dwarf, the disk remains\nstable against the thermal and secular instabilities because advection cooling\noffsets the nuclear heating effects. The absence of a solid surface for a black\nhole prevents excessive mass accumulation in the inner disk region. Notably,\nnuclear fusion predominantly takes place in the inner disk region, resulting in\nsubstantial burning of $\\rm ^{12}C$ and $\\rm ^{3}He$, particularly for black\nholes around $M = 10\\, M_\\odot$ with accretion rates exceeding approximately\n$\\sim 10^7$ times the Eddington rate.

Herein, we investigated the effect\nof non-stoichiometry on the morphology and electrical properties of SnS thin\nfilms. Using a unique sputtering technique with a sulfur plasma supply, SnS\nfilms with precise sulfur content control, [S]/([Sn] + [S]) (xS) ranging from\n0.47 to 0.51, were fabricated. Systematic characterization revealed that\nnon-stoichiometry on the S-rich side led to a marked increase in the carrier\ndensity of p-type conduction, which was attributed to the formation of\nintrinsic acceptor-type defects. In contrast, non-stoichiometry on the S-poor\nside hardly affects the p-type electrical properties, apparently because of the\nself-compensation between the intrinsic acceptor- and donor-type defects. In\naddition, non-stoichiometry has been identified as the cause of thin-film\nmorphological changes, with non-stoichiometric films exhibiting rough and\nporous surfaces. Achieving a stoichiometric composition results in smooth and\ndense thin-film morphologies, which are crucial for optimizing SnS thin films\nfor device applications.

    "abstract": "The dynamic expansion of social media has led to an inundation of hateful\nmemes on media platforms, accentuating the growing need for efficient\nidentification and removal. Acknowledging the constraints of conventional\nmultimodal hateful meme classification, which heavily depends on external\nknowledge and poses the risk of including irrelevant or redundant content, we\ndeveloped Pen -- a prompt-enhanced network framework based on the prompt\nlearning approach. Specifically, after constructing the sequence through the\nprompt method and encoding it with a language model, we performed region\ninformation global extraction on the encoded sequence for multi-view\nperception. By capturing global information about inference instances and\ndemonstrations, Pen facilitates category selection by fully leveraging sequence\ninformation. This approach significantly improves model classification\naccuracy. Additionally, to bolster the model's reasoning capabilities in the\nfeature space, we introduced prompt-aware contrastive learning into the\nframework to improve the quality of sample feature distributions. Through\nextensive ablation experiments on two public datasets, we evaluate the\neffectiveness of the Pen framework, concurrently comparing it with\nstate-of-the-art model baselines. Our research findings highlight that Pen\nsurpasses manual prompt methods, showcasing superior generalization and\nclassification accuracy in hateful meme classification tasks.

Since their results were derived using the\nindirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection\nbetween halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational\nlensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density\naround CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of $11.3 < \\log\nM_*/{\\rm M_\\odot} < 11.7$, using the HSC shear catalog processed through the\nFourier\\_Quad pipeline.

However, experimental data are\noften sparse and noisy, while simulated data may lack credibility due to\ndiscrepancies with real-world configurations and parameters. This underscores\nthe need for field reconstruction and parameter inference from sparse, noisy\ndata, which constitutes inverse problems. Based on the physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs), the KH-PINN framework is established in this work to solve\nthe inverse problems of KHI flows. By incorporating the governing physical\nequations, KH-PINN reconstructs continuous flow fields and infer unknown\ntransport parameters from sparse, noisy observed data. The 2D unsteady\nincompressible flows with both constant and variable densities are studied. To\nour knowledge, this is the first application of PINNs to unsteady\nincompressible flows with variable densities. To address the spatiotemporal\nmultiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of small-scale\nstructures, the multiscale embedding (ME) strategy is adopted. To address the\nmagnitude multiscale issue and enhance the reconstruction accuracy of\nsmall-magnitude velocities, which are critical for KHI problems, the\nsmall-velocity amplification (SVA) strategy is proposed. The results\ndemonstrate that KH-PINN can accurately reconstruct the fields with complex,\nevolving vortices and infer unknown parameters across a broad range of Reynolds\nnumbers. Additionally, the energy-decaying and entropy-increasing curves are\naccurately obtained. The effectiveness of ME and SVA is validated through\ncomparative studies, and the anti-noise and few-shot learning capabilities of\nKH-PINN are also validated.

    "abstract": "To address the issues of insufficient robustness, unstable features, and data\nnoise interference in existing network attack detection and identification\nmodels, this paper proposes an attack traffic detection and identification\nmethod based on temporal spectrum. First, traffic data is segmented by a\nsliding window to construct a feature sequence and a corresponding label\nsequence for network traffic. Next, the proposed spectral label generation\nmethods, SSPE and COAP, are applied to transform the label sequence into\nspectral labels and the feature sequence into temporal features. Spectral\nlabels and temporal features are used to capture and represent behavioral\npatterns of attacks. Finally, the constructed temporal features and spectral\nlabels are used to train models, which subsequently detects and identifies\nnetwork attack behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to\ntraditional methods, models trained with the SSPE or COAP method improve\nidentification accuracy by 10%, and exhibit strong robustness, particularly in\nnoisy environments.",

Future wide-field cadenced surveys, such as the LSST, are anticipated\nto discover strong lenses across various scales. We generate mock catalogs of\nstrongly lensed QSOs and SNe on galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scales based on a\nhalo model that incorporates dark matter halos, galaxies, and subhalos. For the\nupcoming LSST survey, we predict that approximately 3500 lensed QSOs and 200\nlensed SNe with resolved multiple images will be discovered. Among these, about\n80 lensed QSOs and 10 lensed SNe will have maximum image separations larger\nthan 10 arcsec, which roughly correspond to cluster-scale strong lensing. We\nfind that adopting the Chabrier stellar IMF instead of the fiducial Salpeter\nIMF reduces the predicted number of strong lenses approximately by half, while\nthe distributions of lens and source redshifts and image separations are not\nsignificantly changed. In addition to mock catalogs of multiple-image lens\nsystems, we create mock catalogs of highly magnified systems, including both\nmultiple-image and single-image systems. We find that such highly magnified\nsystems are typically produced by massive galaxies, but non-negligible fraction\nof them are located in the outskirt of galaxy groups and clusters. Furthermore,\nwe compare subsamples of our mock catalogs with lensed QSO samples constructed\nfrom the SDSS and Gaia to find that our mock catalogs with the fiducial\nSalpeter IMF reproduce the observation quite well. In contrast, our mock\ncatalogs with the Chabrier IMF predict a significantly smaller number of lensed\nQSOs compared with observations, which adds evidence that the stellar IMF of\nmassive galaxies is Salpeter-like. Our python code SL-Hammocks as well as the\nmock catalogs are made available online. (abridged)",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel one-shot AES\nframework called AdaS&S, in which a supernet encompassing various candidate\nembeddings is built and AES is performed as searching network architectures\nwithin it. Our framework contains two main stages: In the first stage, we\ndecouple training parameters from searching embedding sizes, and propose the\nAdaptive Sampling method to yield a well-trained supernet, which further helps\nto produce stable AES results. In the second stage, to obtain embedding sizes\nthat benefits the model effect, we design a reinforcement learning search\nprocess which utilizes the supernet trained previously. Meanwhile, to adapt\nsearching to specific resource constraint, we introduce the resource\ncompetition penalty to balance the model effectiveness and memory cost of\nembeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets to show the\nsuperiority of AdaS&S. Our method could improve AUC by about 0.3% while saving\nabout 20% of model parameters.

This study aimed to\nenhance motion tracking precision in MRIgRT through an automatic real-time\nmarkerless tracking method using an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD)\nframework with automatic segmentation. Materials and Methods: We developed a\nnovel MRIgRT motion tracking and segmentation method by integrating the ETLD\nframework with an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The ETLD\nframework was upgraded for real-time cine MRI, including advanced image\npreprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow\ntracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. ICV was\nused for precise target volume coverage, refining the segmented region frame by\nframe using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. The method was\ntested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases. Results:\nEvaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions showed\nsub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and\n98% recall for all subjects in the Beam Eye View(BEV)/Beam Path View(BPV)\norientation. The ETLD+ICV method achieved a dice global score of more than 82%\nfor all subjects, demonstrating the method's extensibility and precise target\nvolume coverage. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an automatic\nreal-time markerless motion tracking method for MRIgRT that significantly\noutperforms current methods.

    "abstract": "In the past decade, an asymmetry in the large-scale distribution of galaxy\nspin directions has been observed in data from all relevant digital sky\nsurveys, all showing a higher number of galaxies rotating in the opposite\ndirection relative to the Milky Way as observed from Earth. Additionally, JWST\ndeep fields have shown that the asymmetry is clear and obvious, and can be\nsensed even by the naked human eye. These experiments were performed using two\nseparate statistical methods: standard binomial distribution and simple\n$\\chi^2$ statistics. Stiskalek \\& Desmond (2024) suggested that the asymmetry\nin the distribution of galaxy spin directions is due to the use of binomial or\n$\\chi^2$ statistics. Instead, they developed a new complex ad-hoc statistical\nmethod that shows random distribution in galaxy spin directions, and\nspecifically in data from HSC. Source code for the method was also made\navailable. The primary downside of the new method is that it is not able to\nidentify asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions. Even when the\nnew method is provided with synthetic data with extreme and obvious asymmetry,\nit still reports a null-hypothesis Universe with random distribution. That\nshows empirically that the method cannot sense asymmetry in the distribution of\nthe directions of rotation of galaxies. While this further concludes that the\ndistribution of galaxy spin direction as observed from Earth is not symmetric,\nit is not necessarily an indication of an anomaly in the large-scale structure.\nThe excessive number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative\nto the Milky Way can also be driven by the internal structure of galaxies and\nthe physics of galaxy rotation. The phenomenon can be related to other puzzling\nanomalies such the Ho tension. Data are publicly available, and no code is\nneeded to reproduce the results since only conventional statistics is used.",

We also give a simplified analysis of Dahlgaard, Knudsen and St\\\"ockel's\n$2k$-cycle detection algorithm (with a small polylogarithmic increase in the\nrunning time), which is helpful in analyzing our listing algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts, self-executing agreements directly encoded in code, are\nfundamental to blockchain technology, especially in decentralized finance\n(DeFi) and Web3. However, the rise of Ponzi schemes in smart contracts poses\nsignificant risks, leading to substantial financial losses and eroding trust in\nblockchain systems. Existing detection methods, such as PonziGuard, depend on\nlarge amounts of labeled data and struggle to identify unseen Ponzi schemes,\nlimiting their reliability and generalizability. In contrast, we introduce\nPonziSleuth, the first LLM-driven approach for detecting Ponzi smart contracts,\nwhich requires no labeled training data. PonziSleuth utilizes advanced language\nunderstanding capabilities of LLMs to analyze smart contract source code\nthrough a novel two-step zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique. Our\nextensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and real-world contracts\ndemonstrates that PonziSleuth delivers comparable, and often superior,\nperformance without the extensive data requirements, achieving a balanced\ndetection accuracy of 96.06% with GPT-3.5-turbo, 93.91% with LLAMA3, and 94.27%\nwith Mistral. In real-world detection, PonziSleuth successfully identified 15\nnew Ponzi schemes from 4,597 contracts verified by Etherscan in March 2024,\nwith a false negative rate of 0% and a false positive rate of 0.29%. These\nresults highlight PonziSleuth's capability to detect diverse and novel Ponzi\nschemes, marking a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for enhancing\nblockchain security and mitigating financial scams.",

To study\nthis setting, we develop RapidResponseBench, a benchmark that measures a\ndefense's robustness against various jailbreak strategies after adapting to a\nfew observed examples. We evaluate five rapid response methods, all of which\nuse jailbreak proliferation, where we automatically generate additional\njailbreaks similar to the examples observed. Our strongest method, which\nfine-tunes an input classifier to block proliferated jailbreaks, reduces attack\nsuccess rate by a factor greater than 240 on an in-distribution set of\njailbreaks and a factor greater than 15 on an out-of-distribution set, having\nobserved just one example of each jailbreaking strategy.

Traditional event logs (in XES format), which record\nprocess execution centred around the case notion, are restricted to a\nsingle-object perspective, making it difficult to capture the behaviour of\nmultiple objects and their interactions. To address this limitation,\nobject-centric event logs (OCEL) have been introduced to capture both the\nobjects involved in a process and their interactions with events. The\nobject-centric event data (OCED) metamodel extends the OCEL format by further\ncapturing dynamic object attributes and object-to-object relations. Recently\nOCEL 2.0 has been proposed based on OCED metamodel. Current research on\ngenerating OCEL logs requires specific input data sources, and resulting log\ndata often fails to fully conform to OCEL 2.0. Moreover, the generated OCEL\nlogs vary across different representational formats and their quality remains\nunevaluated. To address these challenges, a set of quality criteria for\nevaluating OCEL log representations is established. Guided by these criteria,\n$\\textit{Dirigo}$ is proposed -- a method for extracting event logs that not\nonly conforms to OCEL 2.0 but also extends it by capturing the temporal aspect\nof dynamic object-to-object relations. Object-role Modelling (ORM), a\nconceptual data modelling technique, is employed to describe the artifact\nproduced at each step of $\\textit{Dirigo}$. To validate the applicability of\n$\\textit{Dirigo}$, it is applied to a real-life use case, extracting an event\nlog via simulation.

In this paper, we present\nDiffOP, a Differentiable Optimization-based Policy for optimal control. In the\nproposed framework, control actions are derived by solving an optimization,\nwhere the control cost function and system's dynamics can be parameterized as\nneural networks. Our key technical innovation lies in developing a hybrid\noptimization algorithm that combines policy gradients with implicit\ndifferentiation through the optimization layer, enabling end-to-end training\nwith the actual cost feedback. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove\nDiffOP converges to stationary points at a rate of $O(1/K)$. Empirically,\nDiffOP achieves state-of-the-art performance in both nonlinear control tasks\nand real-world building control.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has revolutionized data analysis and pattern recognition,\nbut its resource-intensive training has limited accessibility. Machine Learning\nas a Service (MLaaS) simplifies this by enabling users to delegate their data\nsamples to an MLaaS provider and obtain the inference result using a\npre-trained model. Despite its convenience, leveraging MLaaS poses significant\nprivacy and reliability concerns to the client. Specifically, sensitive\ninformation from the client inquiry data can be leaked to an adversarial MLaaS\nprovider. Meanwhile, the lack of a verifiability guarantee can potentially\nresult in biased inference results or even unfair payment issues. While\nexisting trustworthy machine learning techniques, such as those relying on\nverifiable computation or secure computation, offer solutions to privacy and\nreliability concerns, they fall short of simultaneously protecting the privacy\nof client data and providing provable inference verifiability.\n  In this paper, we propose vPIN, a privacy-preserving and verifiable CNN\ninference scheme that preserves privacy for client data samples while ensuring\nverifiability for the inference. vPIN makes use of partial homomorphic\nencryption and commit-and-prove succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge\ntechniques to achieve desirable security properties. In vPIN, we develop\nvarious optimization techniques to minimize the proving circuit for homomorphic\ninference evaluation thereby, improving the efficiency and performance of our\ntechnique. We fully implemented and evaluated our vPIN scheme on standard\ndatasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10). Our experimental results show that vPIN\nachieves high efficiency in terms of proving time, verification time, and proof\nsize, while providing client data privacy guarantees and provable\nverifiability.",

In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate \\emph{quiver\nmutation} -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph)\ninto another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep\nconnections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster\nalgebras, the question of \\emph{mutation equivalence} is of fundamental\nconcern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be\ntransformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? In this paper, we\nuse graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to independently\ndiscover mutation equivalence criteria for quivers of type $\\tilde{D}$. Along\nthe way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model\ncaptures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to\nreconstruct known criteria from type $D$, adding to the growing evidence that\nmodern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and\nparsimonious rules from mathematical data.",

To address this, we introduce IdentifyMe, a\nnew benchmark for mention resolution presented in a multiple-choice question\n(MCQ) format, commonly used for evaluating LLMs. IdentifyMe features long\nnarratives and employs heuristics to exclude easily identifiable mentions,\ncreating a more challenging task. The benchmark also consists of a curated\nmixture of different mention types and corresponding entities, allowing for a\nfine-grained analysis of model performance. We evaluate both closed- and open\nsource LLMs on IdentifyMe and observe a significant performance gap (20-30%)\nbetween the state-of-the-art sub-10B open models vs. closed ones. We observe\nthat pronominal mentions, which have limited surface information, are typically\nmuch harder for models to resolve than nominal mentions. Additionally, we find\nthat LLMs often confuse entities when their mentions overlap in nested\nstructures. The highest-scoring model, GPT-4o, achieves 81.9% accuracy,\nhighlighting the strong referential capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs while\nalso indicating room for further improvement.",

Although some policies have been undertaken, they have been\ninsufficient to deplete high air pollutants. Environmental contingencies are\ncommonly imposed when the ozone concentration overpasses a certain threshold,\nwhich is well above the recommended maximum by the WHO. This work used a causal\nversion of a generalized Morlet wavelet to characterize the dynamics of daily\nozone concentration in the MCMA. The results indicated that the formation of\ndangerous ozone concentration levels is a consequence of accumulation and\nincomplete dissipation effects acting over a wide range of time scales. Ozone\ncontingencies occurred when the wavelet coefficient power is increasing, which\nwas linked to an inti-persistence behavior.

It would interfere with the top quark pair production, causing\ndifficulties in a clear definition of the $tW{\\bar b}$ events. The subtraction\nof the $t\\bar{t}$ contributions has been performed in the diagram removal or\ndiagram subtraction schemes for the tree-level processes. However, these\nschemes rely on the ability to identify the double resonant diagrams and thus\ncan not be extended to loop diagrams. We propose a new scheme to subtract the\n$t\\bar{t}$ contributions by power expansion of the squared amplitude in the\nresonant region. In order to cancel the infra-red divergences of the loop\namplitudes, a widely used method is to introduce the dipole counter-terms, an\ningredient in calculations of the full next-to-leading order QCD corrections.\nIn our scheme, these counter-terms are also power-expanded. As a proof of\nprinciple, we calculate the one-loop correction to the $d\\bar{d}\\to \\bar{b}Wt$\nprocess, and present the invariant mass distribution of the $W\\bar{b}$ system.",

    "abstract": "We assign every metric space $X$ the value $t_{D}HD(X)$, an ordinal number or\none of the symbols $-1$ or $\\Omega$, and we call it the $D$-variant of\ntransfinite Hausdorff dimension of $X$. This ordinal assignment is primarily\nconstructed by way of the $D$-dimension, a transfinite dimension function\nconsistent with the large inductive dimension on finite dimensional metric\nspaces while also addressing shortcomings of the large transfinite inductive\ndimension. Similar to Hausdorff dimension, $t_{D}HD(\\cdot)$ is monotone with\nrespect to subspaces, and is a bi-Lipschitz invariant. It is also\nnon-increasing with respect to Lipschitz maps and satisfies a coarse\nintermediate dimension property. We also show that this new transfinite\nHausdorff dimension function addresses the primary goal of transfinite\nHausdorff dimension functions; to classify metric spaces with infinite\nHausdorff dimension. In particular, we show that if $t_{D}HD\\geq \\omega_0$,\nthen $HD(X) = \\infty$. $t_{D}HD(X)<\\omega_1$ for any separable metric space,\nand that one can find a metrizable space with $t_{D}HD(X)$ bounded between a\ngiven ordinal and it's successive cardinal with topological dimension $0$.",

    "abstract": "The safe and reliable operation of complex electromechanical systems in\nnuclear power plants is crucial for the safe production of nuclear power plants\nand their nuclear power unit. Therefore, accurate and timely fault diagnosis of\nnuclear power systems is of great significance for ensuring the safe and\nreliable operation of nuclear power plants. The existing fault diagnosis\nmethods mainly target a single device or subsystem, making it difficult to\nanalyze the inherent connections and mutual effects between different types of\nfaults at the entire unit level. This article uses the AP1000 full-scale\nsimulator to simulate the important mechanical component failures of some key\nsystems in the primary and secondary circuits of nuclear power units, and\nconstructs a fault dataset. Meanwhile, a hierarchical multi granularity\nclassification fault diagnosis model based on the EfficientNet large model is\nproposed, aiming to achieve hierarchical classification of nuclear power\nfaults. The results indicate that the proposed fault diagnosis model can\neffectively classify faults in different circuits and system components of\nnuclear power units into hierarchical categories. However, the fault dataset in\nthis study was obtained from a simulator, which may introduce additional\ninformation due to parameter redundancy, thereby affecting the diagnostic\nperformance of the model.",

    "abstract": "Multiparty session types provide a type discipline for ensuring communication\nsafety, deadlock-freedom and liveness for multiple concurrently running\nparticipants. The original formulation of MPST takes the top-down approach,\nwhere a global type specifies a bird's eye view of the intended interactions\nbetween participants, and each distributed process is locally type-checked\nagainst its end-point projection. A more recent one takes the bottom-up\napproach, where a desired property $\\varphi$ of a set of participants is\nensured if the same property $\\varphi$ is true for an ensemble of end-point\ntypes (a typing context) inferred from each participant.\n  This paper compares these two main procedures of MPST, giving their detailed\ncomplexity analyses. To this aim, we build several new algorithms missing from\nthe bottom-up or top-down workflows by using graph representation of session\ntypes. We first propose a subtyping system based on type graphs, offering more\nefficient subtype-checking than the existing (exponential) inductive algorithm.\nNext for the top-down, we measure complexity of the four end-point projections\nfrom the literature. For bottom-up, we develop a novel type inference system\nfrom MPST processes which generates minimum type graphs, succinctly capturing\ncovariance of internal choice and contravariance of external choice. For\nproperty-checking of typing contexts, we achieve PSPACE-hardness by reducing it\nfrom the quantified Boolean formula problem, and prove membership in PSPACE.\nFinally, we calculate the total complexity of the top-down and the bottom-up\napproaches. Our analyses reveal that the top-down based on global types is more\nefficient than the bottom-up in many realistic cases; liveness checking for\ntyping contexts in the bottom-up has the highest complexity; and the type\ninference costs exponential against the size of a process, which impacts the\ntotal complexity.",

We provide a\ngeneral theory for the ZGV points and show that they form a subset (with\nequality in the generic case) of the 2D points $(\\lambda_0,\\mu_0)$, where\n$\\lambda_0$ is a multiple eigenvalue of the pencil $(A+\\mu_0 C)+\\lambda B$, or,\nequivalently, there exist nonzero $x$ and $y$ such that $(A+\\lambda_0 B+\\mu_0\nC)x=0$, $y^H(A+\\lambda_0 B+\\mu_0 C)=0$, and $y^HBx=0$.\n  We introduce three numerical methods for computing 2D and ZGV points. The\nfirst method calculates all 2D (ZGV) points from the eigenvalues of a related\nsingular two-parameter eigenvalue problem. The second method employs a\nprojected regular two-parameter eigenvalue problem to compute either all\neigenvalues or only a subset of eigenvalues close to a given target. The third\napproach is a locally convergent Gauss--Newton-type method that computes a\nsingle 2D point from an inital approximation, the later can be provided for all\n2D points via the method of fixed relative distance by Jarlebring, Kvaal, and\nMichiels. In our numerical examples we use these methods to compute\n2D-eigenvalues, solve double eigenvalue problems, determine ZGV points of a\nparameter-dependent quadratic eigenvalue problem, evaluate the distance to\ninstability of a stable matrix, and find critical points of eigencurves of a\ntwo-parameter Sturm-Liouville problem.",

However,\nright-sizing the function memory force developers to speculate performance and\nmake ad-hoc configuration decisions. Recent research has highlighted that a\nfunction's input characteristics, such as input size, type and number of\ninputs, significantly impact its resource demand, run-time performance and\ncosts with fluctuating workloads. This correlation further makes memory\nconfiguration a non-trivial task. On that account, an input-aware function\nmemory allocator not only improves developer productivity by completely hiding\nresource-related decisions but also drives an opportunity to reduce resource\nwastage and offer a finer-grained cost-optimised pricing scheme.
