    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed software engineering, but their\napplication to physical engineering domains remains underexplored. This paper\nevaluates LLMs' capabilities in high-powered rocketry design through\nRocketBench, a benchmark connecting LLMs to high-fidelity rocket simulations.\nWe test models on two increasingly complex design tasks: target altitude\noptimization and precision landing challenges. Our findings reveal that while\nstate-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate strong baseline engineering knowledge, they\nstruggle to iterate on their designs when given simulation results and\nultimately plateau below human performance levels. However, when enhanced with\nreinforcement learning (RL), we show that a 7B parameter model outperforms both\nSoTA foundation models and human experts. This research demonstrates that\nRL-trained LLMs can serve as effective tools for complex engineering\noptimization, potentially transforming engineering domains beyond software\ndevelopment.",

    "abstract": "Model Cascading, recently applied successfully to LLMs, is a simple but\npowerful technique that improves the efficiency of inference by selectively\napplying models of varying sizes. Models are used in sequence from smallest to\nlargest, only deferring samples to large, costly models when smaller models are\nnot sufficiently confident. Existing approaches to deferral use only limited\nsmall model confidence estimates because of the inaccessibility of the large\nmodel, although large model confidence is known to be important. We therefore\npropose a bi-directional approach to deferral that considers the confidence of\nsmall and large models in the cascade simultaneously through the use of a proxy\nfor the large model. This requires a richer representation of model confidence\nto enable comparative calibration: we use an analysis of hidden states to\nimprove post-invocation confidence of the small model, which in itself improves\ncascading results over prior approaches. We then combine this with a tiny proxy\nmodel to estimate pre-invocation confidence of the large model. We examine the\nproposed cascading system over challenging, multiple-choice datasets, finding\nimprovements over standard cascading baselines reflected in reductions in\ndeferrals to more costly models.",

Our method enables fast inference as it relies\nonly on feed-forward passes through the model. We first construct a coarse\nrepresentation of the actor in the canonical T-pose, which combines visual\nfeatures from individual partial observations and fills missing information\nusing learned prior knowledge. The coarse representation is complemented by\nfine-grained pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the observed views,\nwhich provide high-resolution appearance information. We show that HumMorph is\ncompetitive with the state-of-the-art when only a single input view is\navailable, however, we achieve results with significantly better visual quality\ngiven just 2 monocular observations. Moreover, previous generalized methods\nassume access to accurate body shape and pose parameters obtained using\nsynchronized multi-camera setups.

In this paper, we introduce GRADE (Grover-based Reliability\nAssessment for Device Evaluation), an open-source benchmarking toolkit to\nevaluate the reliability of quantum hardware using a generalized form of\nGrover's algorithm.\n  GRADE operates by implementing Grover's algorithm to search through a variety\nof primitive collections that are customizable by the user, analyzing the\nprobability distribution of the results to assess accuracy and stability.

This is in stark contrast to\nthe case where the input is a tournament, where Shen, Sheng, and Wu [SICOMP'03]\nshowed that a king can be found in $O(n^{3/2})$ queries.\n  - In an attempt to increase the \"fairness\" in the definition of tournament\nwinners, Ho and Chang [IPL'03] defined a strong king to be a king $k$ such\nthat, for every $v$ that dominates $k$, the number of length-$2$ paths from $k$\nto $v$ is strictly larger than the number of length-$2$ paths from $v$ to $k$.\nWe show that the query complexity of finding a strong king in a tournament is\n$\\Theta(n^2)$.

    "abstract": "Discrete time crystals (DTC) have emerged as a significant phase of matter\nfor out-of-equilibrium many-body systems. We study how long-range interactions\nand disorder contribute to the stability of the DTC phase. Generally, a stable\nDTC phase is believed to be realized in disordered systems with short-range\ninteractions. In this work, we study periodically driven quantum\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of Ising spin-glass in which all spins are\nrandomly coupled. We investigate the possibilities of DTC phase in the SK model\nwithin three different driving protocols and found that the quantum SK model\nexhibits a robust DTC phase despite the long-range nature of interactions. The\nDTC phase in quantum SK model persists for a larger range of parameters if the\n$XY$ coupling or a transverse field is also random. This suggests that disorder\nin the $XY$ coupling or transverse field is also crucial for stabilising a\nbroad DTC phase, despite the SK model's random couplings. Our analysis shows\nthat the stability of the DTC phase is determined by the non-ergodic nature of\nthe eigenstates of the quantum SK model, with the DTC order-parameter closely\nfollowing the Shannon entropy of eigenstates. We compare the periodically\ndriven SK model to alternative models of long-range interactions with uniform\ncoefficients and found that the DTC phase is absent in these models for most of\nthe driving protocols.",

Their excellent performance in benchmark\nproblems, such as numerical stability for modeling large deformations in\nnear-incompressible solids, makes them a promising choice for solving\nengineering problems. Explicit forms exist for various shape functions of\nfirst-order CSMFEs. In contrast, existing second-order CSMFEs evaluate shape\nfunctions using numerical integration. In this paper, we formulate second-order\nCSMFEs with explicit shape functions for the displacement gradient and stress\ntensor.

Covariant and contravariant Piola transformations\nare then applied to transform the shape functions to the physical space.\nMid-nodes and pseudo-nodes are used to enforce the continuity constraints for\nthe displacement gradient and stress tensor over the boundaries of elements.\nThe formulation of the proposed second-order CSMFEs and technical aspects\nregarding their implementation are discussed in detail. Several benchmark\nproblems are solved to compare the performance of CSMFEs with first-order\nCSMFEs and other second-order elements that rely on numerical integration.

Label-specific\nfeatures (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks\nwith label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label\nto re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks\ncan be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect\nintra-cluster relationships while neglecting interactions among distinct\nclusters. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information,\nrather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and\ncomprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may\narise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster\ninteractions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which\nenhances LIFT by integrating both distance and direction information of each\ninstance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label\nDistribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP),\nwhich unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF\nspaces into a cohesive label distribution. Extensive experiments on 15\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT-SAP over LIFT, as\nwell as the superiority of LDL-LIFT-SAP compared to seven other\nwell-established algorithms.",

In this paper, we identify a novel category of\nprivacy leakage in MLRMs: Adversaries can infer sensitive geolocation\ninformation, such as a user's home address or neighborhood, from user-generated\nimages, including selfies captured in private settings. To formalize and\nevaluate these risks, we propose a three-level visual privacy risk framework\nthat categorizes image content based on contextual sensitivity and potential\nfor location inference. We further introduce DoxBench, a curated dataset of 500\nreal-world images reflecting diverse privacy scenarios. Our evaluation across\n11 advanced MLRMs and MLLMs demonstrates that these models consistently\noutperform non-expert humans in geolocation inference and can effectively leak\nlocation-related private information. This significantly lowers the barrier for\nadversaries to obtain users' sensitive geolocation information. We further\nanalyze and identify two primary factors contributing to this vulnerability:\n(1) MLRMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities by leveraging visual clues in\ncombination with their internal world knowledge; and (2) MLRMs frequently rely\non privacy-related visual clues for inference without any built-in mechanisms\nto suppress or avoid such usage. To better understand and demonstrate\nreal-world attack feasibility, we propose GeoMiner, a collaborative attack\nframework that decomposes the prediction process into two stages: clue\nextraction and reasoning to improve geolocation performance while introducing a\nnovel attack perspective.

Gas disk masses from CO + N2H+ are on average\na factor 2.3(+0.7,-1.0) x lower than the kinematic disk masses, which could\nsuggest slightly lower N2 abundances and/or lower midplane ionization rates\nthan typically assumed.

Deep\nlearning methods have been extensively applied in the grading of diabetic\nretinopathy (DR). However, their performance declines significantly when\napplied to data outside the training distribution due to domain shifts. Domain\ngeneralization (DG) has emerged as a solution to this challenge. However, most\nexisting DG methods overlook lesion-specific features, resulting in\ninsufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enhances\nexisting DG methods by incorporating structural priors, inspired by the\nobservation that DR grading is heavily dependent on vessel and lesion\nstructures. We introduce Low-rank Adaptive Structural Priors (LoASP), a\nplug-and-play framework designed for seamless integration with existing DG\nmodels. LoASP improves generalization by learning adaptive structural\nrepresentations that are finely tuned to the complexities of DR diagnosis.\nExtensive experiments on eight diverse datasets validate its effectiveness in\nboth single-source and multi-source domain scenarios. Furthermore,\nvisualizations reveal that the learned structural priors intuitively align with\nthe intricate architecture of the vessels and lesions, providing compelling\ninsights into their interpretability and diagnostic relevance.",

By contrast, a strain-vorticity covariance mechanism\nproduces backscatter that contributes to the bottleneck effect in the\nsubinertial range of the energy cascade. We extend these analyses by using a\nnormality-based decomposition of filtered velocity gradients in forced\nisotropic turbulence to distinguish contributions from normal straining, pure\nshearing, and rigid rotation at a given scale. Our analysis of direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) data illuminates the importance of shear layers in the\ninertial range and (especially) the subinertial range of the cascade. Shear\nlayers contribute significantly to strain self-amplification and vortex\nstretching and play a dominant role in the backscatter mechanism responsible\nfor the bottleneck effect. Our concurrent analysis of large-eddy simulation\n(LES) data characterizes how different closure models affect the flow structure\nand energy transfer throughout the resolved scales. We thoroughly demonstrate\nthat the multiscale flow features produced by a mixed model closely resemble\nthose in a filtered DNS, whereas the features produced by an eddy viscosity\nmodel resemble those in an unfiltered DNS at a lower Reynolds number. This\nanalysis helps explain how small-scale shear layers, whose imprint is mitigated\nupon filtering, amplify the artificial bottleneck effect produced by the eddy\nviscosity model in the inertial range of the cascade.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the differential-geometric and topological properties\nof the Cayley condition in Poncelet porism for triangles, defined as the locus\nof pairs of non-degenerate conics that admit a Poncelet triangle. While the\nalgebraic condition for this porism, established by Cayley, is classical, the\ngeometric nature of the set of solutions has remained largely unexplored. We\ndemonstrate that this Cayley set is a smooth, connected, 9-dimensional complex\nmanifold. This is proven by showing it is an open subset of a smooth algebraic\nvariety endowed with a trivial fiber bundle structure over the space of\nnon-degenerate conics.\n  To further analyze its structure, we construct the moduli space of\ntransversely intersecting conic pairs under the action of\n$\\mathbb{P}GL_3(\\mathbb{C})$ and identify it with an open subset of\n$\\mathbb{CP}^2/S_3$. We compute the fundamental group of a generic orbit.\n  The elliptic j-invariant is then introduced as a holomorphic map on this\nspace of conics, which factors through this moduli space. We analyze the subset\nof the Cayley set where this map is a submersion - its regular part - which\ncorresponds to excluding points whose j-invariant is one of the critical values\n$0$ or $1728$. We prove that this regular part is the total space of a fiber\nbundle over $\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0,1728\\}$. This structure allows for the\ncomputation of the fundamental group via the long exact sequence of homotopy.\n  Finally, we provide a principal bundle formulation for the Poncelet\ncorrespondence itself over orbits of conic pairs.",

      "Alain Blanchard"
    ],
    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous arguments have emerged suggesting that the LCDM\n(Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model may be inconsistent with observational data,\nrequiring more or less radical revisions. Notable examples include the Hubble\ntension, the discrepancy between early and late-universe measurements of the\nHubble constant, as well as tensions in measurements of cosmic structure\ngrowth. These issues have led some to question the validity of the LCDM\nframework and consider possible modifications or alternative models.\n  However, upon closer inspection, many of these critiques stem from\nmethodological or interpretive disagreements rather than from clear\nfalsifications in the strict Popperian sense. Karl Popper proposed that\nscientific theories must be testable and falsifiable; in other words, a theory\nshould be rejected if it fails a specific, reproducible test. Yet, many of the\nalleged inconsistencies within LCDM, while statistically significant, are not\ndefinitive falsifications but rather indicators of areas needing refinement or\nmore complex modeling within the same framework.\n  Thus, I review the recent claims about LCDM's limitations and analyze why\nthey often reflect individual biases or philosophical preferences, rather than\nrigorous scientific falsifications. For example, alternative cosmological\nmodels such as MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) or models incorporating new\nphysics like quintessence or modified gravity are sometimes advocated based on\ntheoretical appeal rather than direct evidence from critical tests. In many\ncases, these arguments for falsifying LCDM reveal more about subjective\ninterpretations of data than about concrete observational contradictions.",

Although wearable cameras are increasingly used in assistive\nsystems, there has been no systematic, vantage-focused comparison to guide\ntheir design. This paper addresses that gap through a two-part investigation.\nFirst, we surveyed ten experienced blind cane users, uncovering navigation\nstrategies, pain points, and technology preferences. Participants stressed the\nimportance of multi-sensory integration, destination-focused travel, and\nassistive tools that complement (rather than replace) the cane's tactile\nutility. Second, we conducted controlled data collection with a blind\nparticipant navigating five real-world environments using synchronized head-\nand cane-mounted cameras, isolating vantage placement as the primary variable.\nTo assess how each vantage supports spatial perception, we evaluated SLAM\nperformance (for localization and mapping) and NeRF-based 3D reconstruction\n(for downstream scene understanding). Head-mounted sensors delivered superior\nlocalization accuracy, while cane-mounted views offered broader ground-level\ncoverage and richer environmental reconstructions. A combined (head+cane)\nconfiguration consistently outperformed both. These results highlight the\ncomplementary strengths of different sensor placements and offer actionable\nguidance for developing hybrid navigation aids that are perceptive, robust, and\nuser-aligned.",

This\npaper presents detailed calculations of accretion disk winds and their impact\non the observed spectrum of AGN, emphasizing recent observations of Mrk 817.\nThe model consists of a radial and time-dependent mass outflow rate with a\nhalf-ejection radius of 50Rg and a variability timescale of 100 days. The\nresulting spectral energy distribution (SED) is characterized by a large drop\nin the ionizing luminosity and less significant changes in the optical\nluminosity. The time-dependent intensities of the broad emission lines and the\nspectrum emitted by the wind material reflect these variations. For Mrk 817,\nthe variability timescale of the 1500-5500A continuum, the thermal time of the\ndisk at the locations where most of this radiation is emitted, and the range of\nradii over which most of the mass outflow is taking place are all in agreement\nwith the black hole mass and the radial-dependent accretion rate through the\ndisk. This suggests a general connection between time-dependent disk winds, SED\nshape, thermal timescale, and optical-UV variability in AGN.",

We\nanalyze one such structure in the Milky Way disk, OCSN-49, a coeval stellar\nstream with 257 identified members spanning approximately 30$^\\circ$ across the\nsky. We obtained high-resolution spectroscopic data for four members that span\nthe stream's extent, finding these four stars to have solar metallicities and\nremarkably homogeneous chemistry. Through a combination of isochrone fitting,\nlithium abundance analysis, and gyrochronology, we find a consistent stellar\nage of 400--600 Myr. Integrating stellar orbits backwards reveals that OCSN-49\nconverged to a single point at a much younger age. By integrating unbound model\nstars forward and comparing them to the current phase-space distribution of\nOCSN-49, we derive a dynamical age of 83$\\pm$1 Myr, inconsistent with the age\nof the stellar population. The discrepancy between the kinematic and stellar\nage indicators is naturally explained by a disruptive event that unbound\nOCSN-49 roughly 500 Myr into its lifetime. Based on rate estimates, disruption\ndue to a passing giant molecular cloud (GMC) is the most likely culprit.\nAssuming a single encounter, we find that a nearly head-on collision with a\nfairly massive GMC ($\\sim$10$^5$ M$_\\odot$) was necessary to unbind the\ncluster, although encounters with multiple GMCs may be responsible. To our\nknowledge, OCSN-49 serves as the first known remnant of a catastrophically\ndisrupted open cluster and therefore serves as a benchmark for further\ninvestigating cluster disruption in the Milky Way.",

In order to nonparametrically\napproximate these sampling distributions for purposes of inference, resampling\ncan be useful, but previous developments in spatial bootstrap have faced\nchallenges in the scope of their validity, specifically due to issues in\ncapturing the complex variances of spatial spectral averages. As a consequence,\nexisting frequency domain bootstraps for spatial data are highly restricted in\napplication to only special processes (e.g. Gaussian) or certain spatial\nstatistics. To address this limitation and to approximate a wide range of\nspatial spectral averages, we propose a practical hybrid-resampling approach\nthat combines two different resampling techniques in the forms of spatial\nsubsampling and spatial bootstrap.

Method: We propose an empirical study to examine\nGitHub repositories that incorporate UI testing in CI/CD workflows. Our\nexploratory evaluation will collect repositories that implement UI testing\nframeworks in configuration files for GitHub Actions workflows to inspect UI\ntesting-related and non-UI testing-related workflows. Moreover, we further plan\nto collect metrics related to repository development activity and GitHub\nActions workflows to conduct comparative and time series analyses exploring\nwhether UI testing integration and usage within CI/CD processes has an impact\non open-source development.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring safe navigation in complex environments requires accurate real-time\ntraversability assessment and understanding of environmental interactions\nrelative to the robot`s capabilities. Traditional methods, which assume\nsimplified dynamics, often require designing and tuning cost functions to\nsafely guide paths or actions toward the goal. This process is tedious,\nenvironment-dependent, and not generalizable. To overcome these issues, we\npropose a novel learned perceptive Forward Dynamics Model (FDM) that predicts\nthe robot`s future state conditioned on the surrounding geometry and history of\nproprioceptive measurements, proposing a more scalable, safer, and\nheuristic-free solution. The FDM is trained on multiple years of simulated\nnavigation experience, including high-risk maneuvers, and real-world\ninteractions to incorporate the full system dynamics beyond rigid body\nsimulation. We integrate our perceptive FDM into a zero-shot Model Predictive\nPath Integral (MPPI) planning framework, leveraging the learned mapping between\nactions, future states, and failure probability. This allows for optimizing a\nsimplified cost function, eliminating the need for extensive cost-tuning to\nensure safety. On the legged robot ANYmal, the proposed perceptive FDM improves\nthe position estimation by on average 41% over competitive baselines, which\ntranslates into a 27% higher navigation success rate in rough simulation\nenvironments. Moreover, we demonstrate effective sim-to-real transfer and\nshowcase the benefit of training on synthetic and real data.

Mathematically, the symplectic rank of a pure state is the number\nof symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix that are strictly larger\nthan the ones of the vacuum. Operationally, it (i) is easy to compute, (ii)\nemerges as the smallest number of modes onto which all the non-Gaussianity can\nbe compressed via Gaussian unitaries, (iii) lower bounds the non-Gaussian gate\ncomplexity of state preparation independently of the gate set, (iv) governs the\nsample complexity of quantum tomography, and (v) bounds the computational\ncomplexity of bosonic circuits. Crucially, the symplectic rank is\nnon-increasing under post-selected Gaussian operations, leading to strictly\nstronger no-go theorems for Gaussian conversion than those previously known.\nRemarkably, this allows us to show that the resource theory of non-Gaussianity\nis irreversible under exact Gaussian operations. Finally, we show that the\nsymplectic rank is a robust non-Gaussian measure, explaining how to witness it\nin experiments and how to exploit it to meaningfully benchmark different\nbosonic platforms.

In this study, we use calculations of the electronic structure of\nfirst principles to investigate for the first time the general reaction\nmechanism that leads to the main value-added by-products of HCOOH, CO, H$_3$COH\nand CH$_4$ byproducts, focusing on the reactions of adsorption, activation and\nreduction reactions of CO$_2$ molecules on the Ti-terminated CaTiO$_3$ (100)\nsurface.

In particular, activated CO$_2$ can also easily\nundergo decomposition, which facilitates CO production. Afterwards, we discuss\nthe possible reaction mechanisms of CO photoreduction towards H$_3$COH and\nCH$_4$ value-added products, taking into account the experimental evidence that\nonly CO and CH$_4$ have been detected.

    "abstract": "The advent of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has driven remarkable progress in\nlow-light image enhancement (LLIE), with diverse architectures (e.g., CNNs and\nTransformers) and color spaces (e.g., sRGB, HSV, HVI) yielding impressive\nresults. Recent efforts have sought to leverage the complementary strengths of\nthese paradigms, offering promising solutions to enhance performance across\nvarying degradation scenarios. However, existing fusion strategies are hindered\nby challenges such as parameter explosion, optimization instability, and\nfeature misalignment, limiting further improvements. To overcome these issues,\nwe introduce FusionNet, a novel multi-model linear fusion framework that\noperates in parallel to effectively capture global and local features across\ndiverse color spaces. By incorporating a linear fusion strategy underpinned by\nHilbert space theoretical guarantees, FusionNet mitigates network collapse and\nreduces excessive training costs. Our method achieved 1st place in the CVPR2025\nNTIRE Low Light Enhancement Challenge. Extensive experiments conducted on\nsynthetic and real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both\nquantitative and qualitative results, delivering robust enhancement under\ndiverse low-light conditions.",

    "abstract": "Gamification is an emerging technique to enhance motivation and performance\nin traditionally unengaging tasks like software testing. Previous studies have\nindicated that gamified systems have the potential to improve software testing\nprocesses by providing testers with achievements and feedback. However, further\nevidence of these benefits across different environments, programming\nlanguages, and participant groups is required. This paper aims to replicate and\nvalidate the effects of IntelliGame, a gamification plugin for IntelliJ IDEA to\nengage developers in writing and executing tests. The objective is to\ngeneralize the benefits observed in earlier studies to new contexts, i.e., the\nTypeScript programming language and a larger participant pool. The\nreplicability study consists of a controlled experiment with 174 participants,\ndivided into two groups: one using IntelliGame and one with no gamification\nplugin. The study employed a two-group experimental design to compare testing\nbehavior, coverage, mutation scores, and participant feedback between the\ngroups. Data was collected through test metrics and participant surveys, and\nstatistical analysis was performed to determine the statistical significance.\nParticipants using IntelliGame showed higher engagement and productivity in\ntesting practices than the control group, evidenced by the creation of more\ntests, increased frequency of executions, and enhanced utilization of testing\ntools. This ultimately led to better code implementations, highlighting the\neffectiveness of gamification in improving functional outcomes and motivating\nusers in their testing endeavors. The replication study confirms that\ngamification, through IntelliGame, positively impacts software testing behavior\nand developer engagement in coding tasks.",

However, the\nformation of de Sitter core during gravitational collapse remains an open\nquestion, particularly since ordinary baryonic matter does not naturally\ntransition into the exotic matter required to form a de Sitter core. In this\npaper, we investigate the gravitational collapse of baryonic matter and its\npotential to form well-known regular black hole solutions, such as those\nproposed by Dymnikova and Hayward. We model the collapse process as a\ntransition of baryonic matter into a new type of matter, accompanied by the\nrelease of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Using a generalized\ndynamical framework, we derive the energy density of the emitted radiation as a\nfunction of both the properties of the initial baryonic matter and the\nresulting exotic matter. Our findings demonstrate that the gravitational\ncollapse can lead to the formation of various types of regular black holes,\nproviding insights into the physical mechanisms underlying their creation.

However, achieving\ntrue Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) demands fundamentally new\narchitectures rather than merely scaling up existing models. Current approaches\nlargely depend on expanding model parameters, which improves task-specific\nperformance but falls short in enabling continuous, adaptable, and generalized\nlearning. Achieving AGI capable of continuous learning and personalization on\nresource-constrained edge devices is an even bigger challenge.\n  This paper reviews the state of continual learning and neuroscience-inspired\nAI, and proposes a novel architecture for Personalized AGI that integrates\nbrain-like learning mechanisms for edge deployment. We review literature on\ncontinuous lifelong learning, catastrophic forgetting, and edge AI, and discuss\nkey neuroscience principles of human learning, including Synaptic Pruning,\nHebbian plasticity, Sparse Coding, and Dual Memory Systems, as inspirations for\nAI systems. Building on these insights, we outline an AI architecture that\nfeatures complementary fast-and-slow learning modules, synaptic\nself-optimization, and memory-efficient model updates to support on-device\nlifelong adaptation.\n  Conceptual diagrams of the proposed architecture and learning processes are\nprovided. We address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, memory\nefficiency, and system scalability, and present application scenarios for\nmobile AI assistants and embodied AI systems like humanoid robots.

    "abstract": "We used 3D plane wave migration to image topography of the upper mantle\ndiscontinuities at 410 km and 660 km depth that defines the transition zone. We\nfind both discontinuities have topography variation at all resolvable scales.\nIn this paper we examine the dependency of discontinuity roughness on\ntomography models. We migrated a common USArray data set with a selection of\nregional, global, surface wave, and body wave tomography models to distinguish\ndifferent scales of roughness. The objective is to appraise what features are\npotential artifact from using an inaccurate velocity model. We find that the\nlargest-scale features depend on the choice of tomography model, while\nsmaller-scale features appear to be almost completely independent of current\ngeneration models. We suggest that this observation is additional evidence of\nthe existence of small-scale roughness on the upper mantle discontinuities not\ncaptured with the data sampling density of the USArray. We find all models\nbased only on body wave travel times alone do not remove a continent scale\noffset of both discontinuities that correlates with the edge of the craton. We\nconclude that offset is an artifact linked to underestimation of wave speed in\nthe upper mantle by pure body wave models. Models produced by joint inversion\nwith surface wave dispersion data are less prone to this apparent artifact. The\nlarge-scale topography variation is consistent with rigid plate motion models\nof the subducted Farallon slab underneath North American.

To design novel\nmaterials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how\nmaterial properties can be optimally controlled by applying external\nperturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the\ncontrol of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a\nnovel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control\nof active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active\nfield theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to\nour approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated\nonly during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the\npost-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically\nfeatures a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our\nversatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the\nscalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system\nsize. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation\nregulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite\nduration.",

    "abstract": "Super-Eddington accretion has been proposed to explain the existence of black\nholes (BHs) with masses exceeding a billion solar masses within the first\nbillion years after the Big Bang. We present a novel accretion disc-based\nsub-grid model for BH mass and spin evolution in the super-Eddington regime,\nimplemented in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO. In our model, motivated by results\nof radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion discs, the growth of the BH\nis mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc, comprising an inner photon-trapping\nregion described by simulation-based fitting formulae and an outer thin\n$\\alpha$-disc with three regions. We incorporate a self-consistent spin\nevolution prescription that transitions between the Bardeen-Petterson effect\nand inner thick-disc precession, depending on the accretion rate. We perform a\nsuite of idealised simulations of a BH embedded in a gaseous circumnuclear disc\nand a spherically distributed stellar component to explore the conditions under\nwhich super-Eddington accretion can be sustained in the environment of a\nrealistic galactic nucleus. Simulations with misaligned gas inflows onto an\ninitially aligned BH-disc system yield very high Eddington ratios, triggered by\nthe rapid removal of disc angular momentum via inflows. Mildly super-Eddington\naccretion can also be maintained when the BH is misaligned with the disc, as\nthe Lense-Thirring effect reduces the disc angular momentum. These results\nhighlight the importance of angular momentum misalignment in enabling\nsuper-Eddington accretion and suggest that such episodes are difficult to\ntrigger unless the system resides in a highly dynamical environment -- a\ncondition more likely to occur in high-redshift galaxies. Our model potentially\nprovides a way to grow moderate-mass BH seeds to the sizes required to explain\nthe bright high-redshift quasars.",

To address these issues and\noptimize classification performance, we propose a novel band selection strategy\nknown as Iterative Wavelet-based Gradient Sampling (IWGS). This method\nincrementally selects the most informative spectral bands by analyzing\ngradients within the wavelet-transformed domain, enabling efficient and\ntargeted dimensionality reduction. Unlike traditional selection methods, IWGS\nleverages the multi-resolution properties of wavelets to better capture subtle\nspectral variations relevant for classification. The iterative nature of the\napproach ensures that redundant or noisy bands are systematically excluded\nwhile maximizing the retention of discriminative features. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark HSI datasets: Houston\n2013 and Indian Pines.

These improvements make our method\nespecially suitable for deployment in edge devices or other\nresource-constrained environments, where memory and processing power are\nlimited.

However, manual annotation of such\ndata is often time-consuming and costly. Recent methods often adopt a\nself-rewarding approach, where the target model generates and annotates its own\npreference data, but this can lead to inaccuracies since the reward model\nshares weights with the target model, thereby amplifying inherent biases. To\naddress these issues, we propose Anyprefer, a framework designed to synthesize\nhigh-quality preference data for aligning the target model.

To\nthis end, we first study the multi-beam characteristic of a sparse uniform\nlinear array (S-ULA) in the wideband. Interestingly, we show that this leads to\na new beam pattern property, called rainbow blocks, where the S-ULA generates\nmultiple grating lobes and each grating lobe is further splitted into multiple\nversions in the wideband due to the well-known beam-split effect. As such, one\ndirectional beamformer based on S-ULA is capable of generating multiple rainbow\nblocks in the wideband, hence significantly extending the beam coverage. Then,\nby exploiting the beam-split effect in both the frequency and spatial domains,\nwe propose a new three-stage wideband beam training method for extremely\nlarge-scale array (XL-array) systems. Specifically, we first sparsely activate\na set of antennas at the central of the XL-array and judiciously design the\ntime-delay (TD) parameters to estimate candidate user angles by comparing the\nreceived signal powers at the user over subcarriers. Next, to resolve the\nangular ambiguity introduced by the S-ULA, we activate all antennas in the\ncentral subarray and design an efficient subcarrier selection scheme to\nestimate the true user angle. In the third stage, we resolve the user range at\nthe estimated user angle with high resolution by controlling the splitted beams\nover subcarriers to simultaneously cover the range domain. Finally, numerical\nresults are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed wideband beam\ntraining scheme, which only needs three pilots in near-field beam training,\nwhile achieving near-optimal rate performance.",

In this\nwork, we study the problem of minimizing the KL divergence and analyze the\nbehavior of gradient-based optimization algorithms under two dual coordinate\nsystems within the framework of information geometry$-$ the exponential family\n($\\theta$ coordinates) and the mixture family ($\\eta$ coordinates). We compare\nEuclidean gradient descent (GD) in these coordinates with the\ncoordinate-invariant natural gradient descent (NGD), where the natural gradient\nis a Riemannian gradient that incorporates the intrinsic geometry of the\nunderlying statistical model. In continuous time, we prove that the convergence\nrates of GD in the $\\theta$ and $\\eta$ coordinates provide lower and upper\nbounds, respectively, on the convergence rate of NGD. Moreover, under affine\nreparameterizations of the dual coordinates, the convergence rates of GD in\n$\\eta$ and $\\theta$ coordinates can be scaled to $2c$ and $\\frac{2}{c}$,\nrespectively, for any $c>0$, while NGD maintains a fixed convergence rate of\n$2$, remaining invariant to such transformations and sandwiched between them.\nAlthough this suggests that NGD may not exhibit uniformly superior convergence\nin continuous time, we demonstrate that its advantages become pronounced in\ndiscrete time, where it achieves faster convergence and greater robustness to\nnoise, outperforming GD.

A unified testing protocol is\nestablished, including crosssensor calibrations, standardized testing\nplatforms, and quality metrics to address differences in data modality. From an\nimaging standpoint, we evaluate the effects of sensor non-idealities, such as\nmotion-induced distortion, on the capture of structural information. For\nfunctional benchmarking, we examine task performance in corner detection and\nmotion estimation under different rotational speeds. Results indicate that EVS\nperforms well in highspeed, sparse scenarios and in modestly fast, complex\nscenes, but exhibits performance limitations in high-speed, cluttered settings\ndue to pixel-level bandwidth variations and event rate saturation. In\ncomparison, Tianmouc demonstrates consistent performance across sparse and\ncomplex scenarios at various speeds, supported by its global, precise,\nhigh-speed spatiotemporal gradient samplings. These findings offer valuable\ninsights into the applicationdependent suitability of BVS technologies and\nsupport further advancement in this area.",

Given a\nhorizontal partition of a table, a provenance sketch for a query Q records\nwhich fragments contain provenance. Once a provenance sketch has been captured\nfor a query, it can be used to speed-up subsequent queries by skipping data\nthat does not belong to a sketch. The size and, thus, also the effectiveness of\na provenance sketch is often quite sensitive to the choice of attribute(s) we\nare partitioning on. In this work, we develop sample-based estimation\ntechniques for the size of provenance sketches akin to a specialized form of\napproximate query processing.

A full Bayesian fit of the\nanalytic SGWB spectrum for this bounce scenario reveals, for the first time,\ntwo distinct posterior branches in $(\\rho_{s\\downarrow}^{1/4},w_1)$: one near\n$w_1\\approx0.3$ and one at $w_1\\gg1$, where $w_1$ is the contraction phase\nequation of state. We find that the bouncing model attains larger Bayes factors\nagainst each of six conventional SGWB sources (SMBHBs, inflationary GWs, cosmic\nstrings, domain walls, first order phase transitions, scalar induced GWs),\ndemonstrating strong preference of current PTA data for the bounce hypothesis.\nCompared to the more generic dual inflation bounce scenario, the concrete\nbounce realization yields smaller Bayes factors, indicating that PTA\nmeasurements impose tighter constraints when the bounce scale is explicit.\nMoreover, the two posterior branches illuminate distinct theoretical frontiers.\nThe right branch ($w_1\\gg1$) violates the dominant energy condition (DEC),\nthereby providing direct empirical impetus for models with novel early Universe\nphysics, e.g. ghost condensates, higher-derivative or modified gravity\noperators, and extra dimensional effects.

    "abstract": "The Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) posits that gravity must be the weakest\nforce in any consistent theory of quantum gravity. Originally formulated to\nconstrain the landscape of effective field theories arising from string theory,\nthe WGC suggests the existence of states with a charge-to-mass ratio larger\nthan that of extremal black holes. In this work, we revisit the WGC within the\nframework of Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity, a non-perturbative approach\nwhere gravitational and gauge couplings flow to a non-Gaussian ultraviolet (UV)\nfixed point. We construct a scale-dependent effective action, derive\nquantum-corrected Reissner--Nordstr\\\"om black hole solutions by incorporating\nposition-dependent renormalization scale identification, and compute leading\nquantum corrections to the extremality condition. Our key finding is that the\nquantum correction to the extremal charge-to-mass ratio is dominantly governed\nby the running of the gauge coupling, characterized by a correction parameter\n$\\delta \\sim \\epsilon_e (\\ell_P/r_+)^{2\\theta}$, where $\\epsilon_e$ captures\ndeviations from infrared behavior.

We benchmark a set of XAI\nmethods across two widely used object detectors (YOLOX and Faster R-CNN) and\nstandard datasets (MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC). Empirical results demonstrate that\nregion-based methods (e.g., D-CLOSE) achieve strong localization (PG = 88.49%)\nand high model faithfulness (OA = 0.863), though with substantial computational\noverhead (Time = 71.42s).

By comparing the scalar field behaviors across\nthese theories, we highlight the role of curvature, torsion, and non-metricity\nin shaping cosmic evolution. Our analysis reveals that, both in general\nrelativity and teleparallel gravity, the dilaton-inspired field can drive the\naccelerated expansion of the universe, effectively behaving as cosmological\nconstant at late times.

    "abstract": "Quantum neural networks hold promise for tackling computationally challenging\ntasks that are intractable for classical computers. However, their practical\napplication is hindered by significant optimization challenges, arising from\ncomplex loss landscapes characterized by barren plateaus and numerous local\nminima. These problems become more severe as the number of parameters or qubits\nincreases, hampering effective training. To mitigate these optimization\nchallenges, particularly for quantum machine learning applied to classical\ndata, we employ an approach of distributing overlapping local patches across\nmultiple quantum neural networks, processing each patch with an independent\nquantum neural network, and aggregating their outputs for prediction. In this\nstudy, we investigate how the number of parameters and patches affects the loss\nlandscape geometry of this distributed quantum neural network architecture via\nHessian analysis and loss landscape visualization. Our results confirm that\nincreasing the number of parameters tends to lead to deeper and sharper loss\nlandscapes. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing the number of patches\nsignificantly reduces the largest Hessian eigenvalue at minima. This finding\nsuggests that our distributed patch approach acts as a form of implicit\nregularization, promoting optimization stability and potentially enhancing\ngeneralization. Our study provides valuable insights into optimization\nchallenges and highlights that the distributed patch approach is a promising\nstrategy for developing more trainable and practical quantum machine learning\nmodels for classical data tasks.",

Here, we present finite-element\nsimulations that model nutrient transport, diffusion, and uptake within both\nsegmentation and peristaltic contractions along the small intestine for\nNewtonian and Non-Newtonian fluids.

The extent to which parameter estimates are\nconstrained by the quality and quantity of available data is known as parameter\nidentifiability, and it is widely understood that for many dynamical models the\nuncertainty in parameter estimates can vary over orders of magnitude as the\ntime points at which data are collected are varied. Here, we use both local\nsensitivity measures derived from the Fisher Information Matrix and global\nmeasures derived from Sobol' indices to explore how parameter uncertainty\nchanges as the number of measurements, and their placement in time, are varied.\nWe use these measures within an optimisation algorithm to determine the\nobservation times that give rise to the lowest uncertainty in parameter\nestimates.

Under advanced pipeline\nparallelism, even minor communication delays can induce significant training\nslowdowns. This occurs because (1) slow communication disrupts the pipeline\nschedule, creating cascading \"bubbles\" in a domino effect, and (2) current GPU\nkernel scheduling is susceptible to head-of-line blocking, where slow\ncommunication blocks subsequent computations, further adding to these bubbles.\nTo address these challenges, we present ADAPTRA, a straggler-resilient training\nsystem with two key optimizations. First, it optimally adapts the pipeline\nschedule in the presence of stragglers to absorb communication delays without\ninducing cascading bubbles, using a simple yet effective algorithm guided by an\nanalytical model. Second, upon detecting slow communication, ADAPTRA offloads\ncommunication operations from GPU to host memory and utilizes CPU-side RDMA for\ndata transfer. This eliminates head-of-line blocking as subsequent computation\nkernels can be scheduled immediately on GPUs. Together, these optimizations\neffectively reduce pipeline stalls in the presence of communication stragglers,\nimproving the training iteration time by 1.2-3.5x in our experiments under\nvarious settings.",

In such constantly changing network circumstances, the existence of\ndisturbances and uncertain dynamics may directly affect the performance of most\nexisting NE seeking algorithms. Moreover, the semi-Markov switching topologies\nmay cause communication uncertainty, which are considered in NE seeking for the\nfirst time. To accommodate the above concerns, the following targets require to\nbe reached simultaneously: (1) Disturbances and uncertain dynamics rejection in\nfinite time; (2) Distributed estimation on unknown information required for\nplayers' cost functions; (3) A reasonable estimation consensus protocol under\nsemi-Markov switching; (4) NE seeking for the second-order players. By\ncombining supertwisting-based Integral Sliding-Mode Control (ISMC) with average\nconsensus tracking, a novel robust NE seeking algorithm is constructed,\nincorporating an effective leader-follower consensus protocol. Furthermore, to\nlessen dispensable information transmission, a sampled-data-based\nevent-triggered mechanism is introduced.

    "abstract": "Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains,\nincluding medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as\na critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel\ndimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the\ndevelopment of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with\nlimited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address\nthis bottleneck, we introduce $\\textbf{CARL}$, a model for\n$\\textbf{C}$amera-$\\textbf{A}$gnostic $\\textbf{R}$epresentation\n$\\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging\nmodalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel\ndimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength\npositional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress\nspectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial\npre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired\nstrategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of\nmedical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our\nmodel's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets\nwith simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations.

Based on this, we offer a new method leading to a\nrepresentation of the series as a Riemann-Stieltjes integral or a tightly\ncoupled prime counting function. We rigorously analyze this integral by\ndecomposing it into principal and error terms, applying integration by parts in\nthe Stieltjes sense, and defining the error terms.

The study evaluates the 3dB focal resolution generated by the\ndipole array for two polarizations. Additionally, the feasibility of generating\ncircularly polarized focal points and the focal displacement under a limited\narray size are explored. Previous near-field focal synthesis methods primarily\nconsidered only the line-of-sight (LOS) channel. To enhance practicality, this\nstudy adopts a two-ray channel model to analyze near-field focal synthesis\nresults in the presence of a reflected path. Both two polarizations are\ndiscussed separately, with design guidelines provided for array placement and\nfocal point positioning. Finally, electromagnetic simulations are conducted\nwithin the linear array to validate the proposed design. These simulations\nhighlight the capability of the horizontal dipole array configuration to be\ndirectly applied without significant coupling effects between elements.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in sequential recommendation have underscored the\npotential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhancing item embeddings.\nHowever, existing approaches face three key limitations: 1) the degradation of\nthe semantic space when high-dimensional language embeddings are mapped to\nlower-dimensional ID embeddings, 2) the underutilization of language\nembeddings, and 3) the reliance on additional trainable parameters, such as an\nadapter, to bridge the gap between the semantic and behavior spaces. In this\npaper, we introduce AlphaFuse, a simple but effective language-guided learning\nstrategy that addresses these challenges by learning ID embeddings within the\nnull space of language embeddings. Specifically, we decompose the semantic\nspace of language embeddings via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD),\ndistinguishing it into a semantic-rich row space and a semantic-sparse null\nspace. Collaborative signals are then injected into the null space, while\npreserving the rich semantics of the row space. AlphaFuse prevents degradation\nof the semantic space, integrates the retained language embeddings into the\nfinal item embeddings, and eliminates the need for auxiliary trainable modules,\nenabling seamless adaptation to any sequential recommendation framework. We\nvalidate the effectiveness and flexibility of AlphaFuse through extensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets, including cold-start user and\nlong-tail settings, showcasing significant improvements in both discriminative\nand diffusion-based generative sequential recommenders.

Traditional transform-domain methods, such as\nfrequency-wavenumber (f-k) filtering and Radon transform filtering, often\nintroduce aliasing and artifacts, while time-domain filtering algorithms may\noversmooth effective signals. Although deep learning-based velocity filtering\nhas yet to be directly applied in practical seismic processing, studies have\ndemonstrated its potential in specific tasks, such as linear noise attenuation\nand VSP wavefield separation. However, the limited functionality of existing\nmodels poses challenges in addressing diverse velocity filtering tasks. To\ntackle this issue, We develop a deep learning velocity filtering algorithm\nbased on upgoing and downgoing wave separation. By employing linear\ntransformation, problems associated with arbitrary velocity differences are\ntransformed in terms of upgoing and downgoing wave separation tasks. A diverse\ntraining dataset was constructed, comprising 31 theoretical velocity models,\nover 200 forward modeling simulations, and 46 field seismic datasets. The model\ntrained on this dataset, combined with the proposed linear transformation\nstrategy, achieves results comparable to traditional f-k and Radon filtering\nwhile also supporting tasks such as median filtering through manual wavefield\npicking. Applications in VSP upgoing and downgoing wavefield separation,\ndistributed acoustic sensor (DAS) VSP P- and S-wave separation, post-stack\nmigration arc noise mitigation, DAS common mode noise attenuation, and\npre-stack CDP gather optimization demonstrate the method's versatility and\npracticality.

We\nanalyzed 60 open-source repositories belonging to four different domains -- web\ndevelopment, databases, machine learning and security -- using our framework\nand study the presence of verified commits in each repositories over five\nyears. Our analysis shows that only ~10% of all the commits in these 60\nrepositories are verified. Developers committing code to security-related\nrepositories are much more vigilant when it comes to signing commits by users.\n  We also analyzed different Git clients for the ease of commit signing, and\nfound that GitKraken provides the most convenient way of commit signing whereas\nGitHub Web provides the most accessible way for verifying commits. During our\nanalysis, we also identified an unexpected behavior in how GitHub handles\nunverified emails in user accounts preventing legitimate owner to use the email\naddress.

How to reduce\nelectricity costs while satisfying the deadline constraints of workflow\napplications is important in GDCs, which is determined by the execution time of\nservers, power, and electricity price. Determining the completion time of\nworkflows with different server frequencies can be challenging, especially in\nscenarios with heterogeneous computing resources in GDCs. Moreover, the\nelectricity price is also different in geographical locations and may change\ndynamically.

We first focus on bridgeless cubic graphs and define the\nparameter $T(G)$ as the minimum number of vertices that need to be expanded\ninto triangles so that the resulting cubic graph can be covered with four\nperfect matchings. We relate this parameter to the concept of shortest cycle\ncover. Furthermore, we show that if $5$-Cycle Double Cover Conejcture holds\ntrue, then $T(G)\\leq \\frac{2}{5} |V(G)|$. We conjecture a tighter bound,\n$T(G)\\leq \\frac{1}{10}|V(G)|$, which is optimal for the Petersen graph, and\nshow that this bound follows from major conjectures like the Petersen Coloring\nConjecture. In the second part of the paper, we introduce the parameter $t(G)$\nas the minimum number of vertex expansions needed for the graph to admit a\nperfect matching.

    "abstract": "Accurately identifying critical nodes with high spatial influence in road\nnetworks is essential for enhancing the efficiency of traffic management and\nurban planning. However, existing node importance ranking methods mainly rely\non structural features and topological information, often overlooking critical\nfactors such as origin-destination (OD) demand and route information. This\nlimitation leaves considerable room for improvement in ranking accuracy. To\naddress this issue, we propose HetGL2R, an attributed heterogeneous graph\nlearning approach for ranking node importance in road networks. This method\nintroduces a tripartite graph (trip graph) to model the structure of the road\nnetwork, integrating OD demand, route choice, and various structural features\nof road segments. Based on the trip graph, we design an embedding method to\nlearn node representations that reflect the spatial influence of road segments.\nThe method consists of a heterogeneous random walk sampling algorithm\n(HetGWalk) and a Transformer encoder. HetGWalk constructs multiple\nattribute-guided graphs based on the trip graph to enrich the diversity of\nsemantic associations between nodes. It then applies a joint random walk\nmechanism to convert both topological structures and node attributes into\nsequences, enabling the encoder to capture spatial dependencies more\neffectively among road segments. Finally, a listwise ranking strategy is\nemployed to evaluate node importance. To validate the performance of our\nmethod, we construct two synthetic datasets using SUMO based on simulated road\nnetworks. Experimental results demonstrate that HetGL2R significantly\noutperforms baselines in incorporating OD demand and route choice information,\nachieving more accurate and robust node ranking. Furthermore, we conduct a case\nstudy using real-world taxi trajectory data from Beijing, further verifying the\npracticality of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Recently, learning-based Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) methods have\ndemonstrated promising performance. However, existing learning-based methods\nstill face two challenges. 1) They rarely consider the inconsistent degradation\nlevels in different spatial regions and spectral bands simultaneously. 2) They\ntreat all regions equally, ignoring that the regions with high-frequency\ndetails are more difficult to reconstruct. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel UIE method based on spatial-spectral dual-domain adaptive\nlearning, termed SS-UIE. Specifically, we first introduce a spatial-wise\nMulti-scale Cycle Selective Scan (MCSS) module and a Spectral-Wise\nSelf-Attention (SWSA) module, both with linear complexity, and combine them in\nparallel to form a basic Spatial-Spectral block (SS-block). Benefiting from the\nglobal receptive field of MCSS and SWSA, SS-block can effectively model the\ndegradation levels of different spatial regions and spectral bands, thereby\nenabling degradation level-based dual-domain adaptive UIE. By stacking multiple\nSS-blocks, we build our SS-UIE network. Additionally, a Frequency-Wise Loss\n(FWL) is introduced to narrow the frequency-wise discrepancy and reinforce the\nmodel's attention on the regions with high-frequency details. Extensive\nexperiments validate that the SS-UIE technique outperforms state-of-the-art UIE\nmethods while requiring cheaper computational and memory costs.",

    "abstract": "Accurate localization is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles,\nparticularly in GPS-denied environments such as urban canyons and tunnels. In\nthese scenarios, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) offers a more\nrobust alternative to GPS-based positioning, enabling vehicles to determine\ntheir position using onboard sensors and surrounding environment's landmarks.\nAmong various vehicle SLAM approaches, Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF)\nstands out as one of the most widely adopted methods due to its efficient\nsolution with logarithmic complexity relative to the map size. RBPF\napproximates the posterior distribution of the vehicle pose using a set of\nMonte Carlo particles through two main steps: sampling and importance\nweighting. The key to effective sampling lies in solving a distribution that\nclosely approximates the posterior, known as the sampling distribution, to\naccelerate convergence. Existing methods typically derive this distribution via\nlinearization, which introduces significant approximation errors due to the\ninherent nonlinearity of the system. To address this limitation, we propose a\nnovel vehicle SLAM method called \\textit{N}atural Gr\\textit{a}dient\nGaussia\\textit{n} Appr\\textit{o}ximation (NANO)-SLAM, which avoids\nlinearization errors by modeling the sampling distribution as the solution to\nan optimization problem over Gaussian parameters and solving it using natural\ngradient descent. This approach improves the accuracy of the sampling\ndistribution and consequently enhances localization performance. Experimental\nresults on the long-distance Sydney Victoria Park vehicle SLAM dataset show\nthat NANO-SLAM achieves over 50\\% improvement in localization accuracy compared\nto the most widely used vehicle SLAM algorithms, with minimal additional\ncomputational cost.",

The\nresulting algorithm is demonstrated for the expectation value of the inverse of\nan operator and then generalized to the gradient of a logarithm-determinant.\nThe method scales as $O(\\tau TM/\\varepsilon^3)$ with a factor $M$ relating to\nthe number of digits of precision, $\\varepsilon$, and $\\tau$ the averaging\ntime. This is independent of the condition number of the input operator and\ndoes not require a quantum memory. There is a potential for a many-body\nlocalized state--which would increase the thermalization time--but many\ncircuits of practical interest are uniform enough to avoid this, and it is also\nexpected that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis holds beyond the\ncurrently available system sizes that are studied. The boundary where this\nalgorithm would be considered a classical versus quantum algorithm is also\nconsidered.",

This\nmethodology accurately captures the high-temperature paramagnetic state of UN,\naddressing the limitations of standard density functional theory (DFT) models.\nThe AIMD+DLM model consistently predicts a cubic crystal structure for UN\nacross all considered temperatures, aligning with experimental observations of\nits paramagnetic phase. Key thermophysical properties, including the lattice\nparameter and specific heat capacity, are computed and compared to experimental\ndata. The calculated lattice parameter is somewhat underestimated relative to\nthe empirical correlation, consistent with prior studies modeling UN as a\nferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AFM) material. The specific heat\ncapacity exhibits overestimation at low temperatures (300--500 K) and slight\nunderestimation at higher temperatures, while closely following the\nexperimental trend.

    "abstract": "Background. Effort-aware metrics (EAMs) are widely used to evaluate the\neffectiveness of software defect prediction models, while accounting for the\neffort needed to analyze the software modules that are estimated defective. The\nusual underlying assumption is that this effort is proportional to the modules'\nsize measured in LOC. However, the research on module analysis (including code\nunderstanding, inspection, testing, etc.) suggests that module analysis effort\nmay be better correlated to code attributes other than size.\n  Aim. We investigate whether assuming that module analysis effort is\nproportional to other code metrics than LOC leads to different evaluations.\n  Method. We show mathematically that the choice of the code measure used as\nthe module effort driver crucially influences the resulting evaluations. To\nillustrate the practical consequences of this, we carried out a demonstrative\nempirical study, in which the same model was evaluated via EAMs, assuming that\neffort is proportional to either McCabe's complexity or LOC.\n  Results. The empirical study showed that EAMs depend on the underlying effort\nmodel, and can give quite different indications when effort is modeled\ndifferently. It is also apparent that the extent of these differences varies\nwidely.\n  Conclusions. Researchers and practitioners should be aware that the\nreliability of the indications provided by EAMs depend on the nature of the\nunderlying effort model. The EAMs used until now appear to be actually\nsize-aware, rather than effort-aware: when analysis effort does not depend on\nsize, these EAMs can be misleading.",

The increasing\navailability of digital medical data, such as images, omics, biosignals, and\nelectronic health records, combined with advances in computing, has enabled AI\nmodels to approach expert-level performance. However, widespread clinical\nadoption remains limited, primarily due to challenges beyond technical\nperformance, including ethical concerns, regulatory barriers, and lack of\ntrust. To address these issues, AI systems must align with the principles of\nTrustworthy AI (TAI), which emphasize human agency and oversight, algorithmic\nrobustness, privacy and data governance, transparency, bias and discrimination\navoidance, and accountability. Yet, the complexity of healthcare processes\n(e.g., screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment) and the diversity of\nstakeholders (clinicians, patients, providers, regulators) complicate the\nintegration of TAI principles. To bridge the gap between TAI theory and\npractical implementation, this paper proposes a design framework to support\ndevelopers in embedding TAI principles into medical AI systems. Thus, for each\nstakeholder identified across various healthcare processes, we propose a\ndisease-agnostic collection of requirements that medical AI systems should\nincorporate to adhere to the principles of TAI. Additionally, we examine the\nchallenges and tradeoffs that may arise when applying these principles in\npractice.

Existing methods\noften rely on data augmentation strategies to create positive samples and\npromote representation invariance. Some strategies such as item reordering and\nitem substitution may inadvertently alter user intent. Supervised Contrastive\nLearning (SCL) based methods find an alternative to augmentation-based CL\nmethods by selecting same-target sequences (interaction sequences with the same\ntarget item) to form positive samples. However, SCL-based methods suffer from\nthe scarcity of same-target sequences and consequently lack enough signals for\ncontrastive learning. In this work, we propose to use similar sequences (with\ndifferent target items) as additional positive samples and introduce a Relative\nContrastive Learning (RCL) framework for sequential recommendation. RCL\ncomprises a dual-tiered positive sample selection module and a relative\ncontrastive learning module. The former module selects same-target sequences as\nstrong positive samples and selects similar sequences as weak positive samples.\nThe latter module employs a weighted relative contrastive loss, ensuring that\neach sequence is represented closer to its strong positive samples than its\nweak positive samples. We apply RCL on two mainstream deep learning-based SR\nmodels, and our empirical results reveal that RCL can achieve 4.88% improvement\naveragely than the state-of-the-art SR methods on five public datasets and one\nprivate dataset.",

However, traditional machine\nlearning methods generally have the black box problem, which makes it difficult\nto reveal the deep correlation between the model decision mechanism and the\ninteraction pattern between biological molecules. This study proposes a\nheterogeneous network drug target interaction prediction framework, integrating\ngraph neural network and multi scale signal processing technology to construct\na model with both efficient prediction and multi level interpretability. Its\ntechnical breakthroughs are mainly reflected in the following three\ndimensions:Local global feature collaborative perception module. Based on\nheterogeneous graph convolutional neural network (HGCN), a multi order neighbor\naggregation strategy is designed.Multi scale graph signal decomposition and\nbiological interpretation module. A deep hierarchical node feature transform\n(GWT) architecture is proposed.Contrastive learning combining multi dimensional\nperspectives and hierarchical representations. By comparing the learning\nmodels, the node representations from the two perspectives of HGCN and GWT are\naligned and fused, so that the model can integrate multi dimensional\ninformation and improve the prediction robustness. Experimental results show\nthat our framework shows excellent prediction performance on all datasets.

As nanoelectronic\napplications increasingly demand pure semiconducting nanotubes for use in\nfield-effect transistors and other optoelectronic devices, understanding the\nmechanistic basis of selective removal becomes critical. While etching\nselectivity is often attributed to electronic structure effects on tube walls,\nits relevance in the presence of catalyst nanoparticles remains unclear. Here,\nwe directly quantify the catalyst-mediated etching and growth rates of\nindividual single-walled carbon nanotubes using elaborate isotope labeling\nmethods. Surprisingly, in water vapor and methanol environments, catalytic\netching proceeds with negligible dependence on tube electronic type, in sharp\ncontrast to non-catalytic oxidation pathways. In-situ Raman analysis upon\nheating on nanotube ensembles also confirms metallicity-insensitive etching\nunder catalytic conditions, whereas sidewall oxidation without catalysts\nexhibits pronounced selectivity. Our growth kinetic model, which precisely\ndescribes the kinetics of catalytic etching process, motivates kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulations of nanotube edge dynamics, revealing the reciprocal nature of\nedge configuration during growth and etching.

Similarly as in univariate\ncase, the Fourier coefficients of multivariate exponential sums have a rational\nstructure and the multivariate exponential recovery problem can be reformulated\nas multivariate rational interpolation problem. We develop two approaches to\nsolve this special multivariate rational interpolation problem by reducing it\nto the several univariate ones, which are then solved again via the univariate\nAAA method. Our first approach is based on using indices of the Fourier\ncoefficients chosen from some sparse grid, which ensures efficient\nreconstruction using a respectively small amount of input data.

    "abstract": "The growing demand for Domain-Specific Architecture (DSA) has driven the\ndevelopment of Agile Hardware Development Methodology (AHDM). Hardware\nConstruction Language (HCL) like Chisel offers high-level abstraction features,\nmaking it an ideal language for HCL-Based AHDM. While Large Language Models\n(LLMs) excel in code generation tasks, they still face challenges with Chisel\ngeneration, particularly regarding syntax correctness and design variability.\nRecent reasoning models have significantly enhanced code generation\ncapabilities through test-time scaling techniques. However, we found that\nreasoning models without domain adaptation cannot bring substantial benefits to\nChisel code generation tasks. This paper presents ChiseLLM, a solution\ncomprising data processing and transformation, prompt-guided reasoning trace\nsynthesis, and domain-adapted model training. We constructed high-quality\ndatasets from public RTL code resources and guided the model to adopt\nstructured thinking patterns through prompt enhancement methods. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our ChiseLLM-7B and ChiseLLM-32B models improved syntax\ncorrectness by 18.85% and 26.32% respectively over base models, while\nincreasing variability design ability by 47.58% compared to baseline reasoning\nmodels. Our datasets and models are publicly available, providing\nhigh-performance, cost-effective models for HCL-Based AHDM, and offering an\neffective baseline for future research.

However, these methods often converge to local optima in complex\nenvironments, degrading the positioning performance. This paper presents a\nnovel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided progressive interference source\nlocalization method based on improved trust region optimization. By combining\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO),\nour proposed method can effectively enhance the success rate of localization.\nWe also propose a confidence quantification approach based on the UAV-to-ground\nchannel model. This approach considers the surrounding environmental\ninformation of the sampling points and dynamically adjusts the weight of the\nsampling data during the data fusion. As a result, the overall positioning\naccuracy can be significantly improved.

    "abstract": "Most large enterprises build predefined data pipelines and execute them\nperiodically to process operational data using SQL queries for various tasks. A\nkey issue in minimizing the overall makespan of these pipelines is the\nefficient scheduling of concurrent queries within the pipelines. Existing tools\nmainly rely on simple heuristic rules due to the difficulty of expressing the\ncomplex features and mutual influences of queries. The latest reinforcement\nlearning (RL) based methods have the potential to capture these patterns from\nfeedback, but it is non-trivial to apply them directly due to the large\nscheduling space, high sampling cost, and poor sample utilization.\n  Motivated by these challenges, we propose BQSched, a non-intrusive Scheduler\nfor Batch concurrent Queries via reinforcement learning. Specifically, BQSched\ndesigns an attention-based state representation to capture the complex query\npatterns, and proposes IQ-PPO, an auxiliary task-enhanced proximal policy\noptimization (PPO) algorithm, to fully exploit the rich signals of Individual\nQuery completion in logs. Based on the RL framework above, BQSched further\nintroduces three optimization strategies, including adaptive masking to prune\nthe action space, scheduling gain-based query clustering to deal with large\nquery sets, and an incremental simulator to reduce sampling cost. To our\nknowledge, BQSched is the first non-intrusive batch query scheduler via RL.\nExtensive experiments show that BQSched can significantly improve the\nefficiency and stability of batch query scheduling, while also achieving\nremarkable scalability and adaptability in both data and queries. For example,\nacross all DBMSs and scales tested, BQSched reduces the overall makespan of\nbatch queries on TPC-DS benchmark by an average of 34% and 13%, compared with\nthe commonly used heuristic strategy and the adapted RL-based scheduler,\nrespectively.",

Existing methods often fail to decouple\nshared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes,\ncausing feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose\nPhase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates\nphase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in\nthe Fourier domain, thus reinforcing shared structures while preserving\ncomplementary characteristics to improve fusion quality. Unlike prior\napproaches that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency\nspectra, PAD is the first to introduce explicit amplitude-phase decoupling for\nmulti-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase\nSpectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via\nconvolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude\nSpectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high-frequency and\nlow-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons,\nleveraging SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness.\nExtensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance.

Through this work, we identified five\nkey aspects to consider in a physical making process based on the capabilities\nof 3D generative AI. 1) Fabrication Constraints: Current text-to-3D models can\ngenerate a wide range of 3D designs, requiring fabrication methods that can\nadapt to the variability of generative AI outputs. 2) Time: While generative AI\ncan generate 3D models in seconds, fabricating physical objects can take hours\nor even days. Faster production could enable a closer iterative design loop\nbetween humans and AI in the making process. 3) Sustainability: Although\ntext-to-3D models can generate thousands of models in the digital world,\nextending this capability to the real world would be resource-intensive,\nunsustainable and irresponsible. 4) Functionality: Unlike digital outputs from\n3D generative AI models, the fabrication method plays a crucial role in the\nusability of physical objects. 5) Accessibility: While generative AI simplifies\n3D model creation, the need for fabrication equipment can limit participation,\nmaking AI-assisted creation less inclusive.

    "abstract": "There has long been a belief that high-level semantics learning can benefit\nvarious downstream computer vision tasks. However, in the low-light image\nenhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between\nlow-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information\nof different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer\nfrom severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep\nsemantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition\nfor LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic\nsegmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both\nimage-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a\nmultimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance\nfor LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the\nenhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance\nby leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic\nsegmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural\nlanguage semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a\nmulti-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic\nfeature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark\ndatasets.

To\naddress limitations of ICA, sparsity-based methods have been introduced, which\ndecompose source signals sparsely in a predefined dictionary. Morphological\nComponent Analysis (MCA), based on sparse representation theory, assumes that a\nsignal is a linear combination of components with distinct geometries, each\nsparsely representable in one dictionary and not in others.

    "abstract": "The planet-hunting ALMA large program exoALMA observed 15 protoplanetary\ndisks at ~0.15\" angular resolution and ~100 m/s spectral resolution,\ncharacterizing disk structures and kinematics in enough detail to detect\nnon-Keplerian features (NKFs) in the gas emission. As these features are often\nsmall and low-contrast, robust imaging procedures are critical for identifying\nand characterizing NKFs, including determining which features may be signatures\nof young planets. The exoALMA collaboration employed two different imaging\nprocedures to ensure the consistent detection of NKFs: CLEAN, the standard\niterative deconvolution algorithm, and regularized maximum likelihood (RML)\nimaging. This paper presents the exoALMA RML images, obtained by maximizing the\nlikelihood of the visibility data given a model image and subject to\nregularizer penalties. Crucially, in the context of exoALMA, RML images serve\nas an independent verification of marginal features seen in the fiducial CLEAN\nimages. However, best practices for synthesizing RML images of multi-channeled\n(i.e. velocity-resolved) data remain undefined, as prior work on RML imaging\nfor protoplanetary disk data has primarily addressed single-image cases. We\nused the open source Python package MPoL to explore RML image validation\nmethods for multi-channeled data and synthesize RML images from the exoALMA\nobservations of 7 protoplanetary disks with apparent NKFs in the 12CO J=3-2\nCLEAN images. We find that RML imaging methods independently reproduce the NKFs\nseen in the CLEAN images of these sources, suggesting that the NKFs are robust\nfeatures rather than artifacts from a specific imaging procedure.",

    "abstract": "As transistor sizes reach the mesoscopic scale, the limitations of\ntraditional methods in ensuring thermodynamic consistency have made power\ndissipation optimization in transistor amplifiers a critical challenge. Based\non stochastic thermodynamics, a transistor voltage amplifier model is first\nproposed as a new insight to investigate nonlinear relationships between the\npower dissipation and voltage gain for complementary symmetric voltage\namplifier circuits (CSVACs). Utilizing the proposed model, the phenomenon,\ni.e., the power dissipation exponentially increases with the increase of\nvoltage gain in CSVACs, is first clarified by an analytical expression to\nquantify the impact of voltage gain and input signal amplitude on the power\ndissipation. Considering the characteristic of power dissipation, a new\nmultistage architecture is proposed to reduce the power dissipation in CSVACs.\nTo optimize the power dissipation by adjusting the number of stages and the\nvoltage gain at each stage, an optimal multistage scheme is proposed for\nmultistage CSVACs. Simulation and experimental results show up to 99.36% and\n94.59% power dissipation reduction compared with traditional CSVACs by the\nproposed optimal multistage scheme, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Large reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1 and Deepseek-R1 have\nrecently attracted widespread attention due to their impressive task-solving\nabilities. However, the enormous model size and the generation of lengthy\nthought chains introduce significant reasoning costs and response latency.\nExisting methods for efficient reasoning mainly focus on reducing the number of\nmodel parameters or shortening the chain-of-thought length. In this paper, we\nintroduce Speculative Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which reduces reasoning latency\nfrom another perspective by accelerated average reasoning speed through large\nand small model collaboration. SCoT conducts thought-level drafting using a\nlightweight draft model. Then it selects the best CoT draft and corrects the\nerror cases with the target model. The proposed thinking behavior alignment\nimproves the efficiency of drafting and the draft selection strategy maintains\nthe prediction accuracy of the target model for complex tasks. Experimental\nresults on GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, CollegeMath and Olympiad datasets show that\nSCoT reduces reasoning latency by 48\\%$\\sim$66\\% and 21\\%$\\sim$49\\% for\nDeepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B while achieving\nnear-target-model-level performance.

Despite these impressive achievements in mathematics and\ncoding, the reasoning abilities of LLMs in domains requiring cryptographic\nexpertise remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CipherBank, a\ncomprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs\nin cryptographic decryption tasks. CipherBank comprises 2,358 meticulously\ncrafted problems, covering 262 unique plaintexts across 5 domains and 14\nsubdomains, with a focus on privacy-sensitive and real-world scenarios that\nnecessitate encryption. From a cryptographic perspective, CipherBank\nincorporates 3 major categories of encryption methods, spanning 9 distinct\nalgorithms, ranging from classical ciphers to custom cryptographic techniques.\nWe evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on CipherBank, e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and\ncutting-edge reasoning-focused models such as o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Our results\nreveal significant gaps in reasoning abilities not only between general-purpose\nchat LLMs and reasoning-focused LLMs but also in the performance of current\nreasoning-focused models when applied to classical cryptographic decryption\ntasks, highlighting the challenges these models face in understanding and\nmanipulating encrypted data. Through detailed analysis and error\ninvestigations, we provide several key observations that shed light on the\nlimitations and potential improvement areas for LLMs in cryptographic\nreasoning.

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is one of the key usage scenarios\nfor future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, where\ncommunication and sensing (C&S) services are simultaneously provided through\nshared wireless spectrum, signal processing modules, hardware, and network\ninfrastructure. Such an integration is strengthened by the technology trends in\n6G, such as denser network nodes, larger antenna arrays, wider bandwidths,\nhigher frequency bands, and more efficient utilization of spectrum and hardware\nresources, which incentivize and empower enhanced sensing capabilities. As the\ndominant waveform used in contemporary communication systems, orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is still expected to be a very\ncompetitive technology for 6G, rendering it necessary to thoroughly investigate\nthe potential and challenges of OFDM ISAC. Thus, this paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive tutorial overview of ISAC systems enabled by large-scale\nmulti-input multi-output (MIMO) and OFDM technologies and to discuss their\nfundamental principles, advantages, and enabling signal processing methods. To\nthis end, a unified MIMO-OFDM ISAC system model is first introduced, followed\nby four frameworks for estimating parameters across the spatial, delay, and\nDoppler domains, including parallel one-domain, sequential one-domain, joint\ntwo-domain, and joint three-domain parameter estimation. Next, sensing\nalgorithms and performance analyses are presented in detail for far-field\nscenarios where uniform plane wave (UPW) propagation is valid, followed by\ntheir extensions to near-field scenarios where uniform spherical wave (USW)\ncharacteristics need to be considered. Finally, this paper points out open\nchallenges and outlines promising avenues for future research on MIMO-OFDM\nISAC.",

One bar end is instrumented with finely\nsegmented micro-channel-plate photomultiplier tubes to record the light, while\nthe other end has a mirror attached to reflect the photons back to the\ninstrumented end.

Despite the success of classical semiparametric\nmethod/theory, establishing the $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality\nof the finite-dimensional parameter estimator in this context remains\nchallenging, mainly due to nonlinearity and potential tangent space\ndegeneration in DNNs.

The optimization properties of\ngeneral loss functions are analyzed, and the global convergence is guaranteed.\nInstead of studying the ``ideal'' solution to minimization of an objective\nfunction in most literature, we analyze the statistical properties of\nalgorithmic estimators, and establish nonparametric convergence and parametric\nasymptotic normality for a broad class of loss functions. These results hold\nwithout assuming the boundedness of the network output and even when the true\nfunction lies outside the specified function space.

    "abstract": "Based on a sample of $2.7\\times10^{9}$ $\\psi(3686)$ events collected by the\nBESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider, an analysis of the decay\n$\\psi(3686)\\to\\gamma\\chi_{cJ}, \\chi_{cJ}\\to\\eta\\eta\\eta^{\\prime}$ is performed.\nThe decay modes $\\chi_{c1}$ and $\\chi_{c2}\\to\\eta\\eta\\eta^{\\prime}$ are\nobserved for the first time, and their corresponding branching fractions are\ndetermined to be $\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c1}\\to\\eta\\eta\\eta^{\\prime}) = (1.40\\, \\pm\n0.13\\, (\\text{stat.}) \\pm 0.09\\, (\\text{sys.})) \\times 10^{-4}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c2}\\to\\eta\\eta\\eta^{\\prime}) = (4.18\\, \\pm 0.84\\,\n(\\text{stat.}) \\pm 0.48\\, (\\text{sys.})) \\times 10^{-5}$. An upper limit on the\nbranching fraction of $\\chi_{c0}\\to\\eta\\eta\\eta^{\\prime}$ is set as $2.59\n\\times 10^{-5}$ at 90\\% confidence level (CL). A partial wave analysis (PWA) of\nthe decay $\\chi_{c1}\\to\\eta\\eta\\eta^{\\prime}$ is performed to search for the\n$1^{-+}$ exotic state $\\eta_1(1855)$.

    "abstract": "Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection~(S-DGOD) aims to train an object\ndetector on a single source domain while generalizing well to diverse unseen\ntarget domains, making it suitable for multimedia applications that involve\nvarious domain shifts, such as intelligent video surveillance and VR/AR\ntechnologies. With the success of large-scale Vision-Language Models, recent\nS-DGOD approaches exploit pre-trained vision-language knowledge to guide\ninvariant feature learning across visual domains. However, the utilized\nknowledge remains at a coarse-grained level~(e.g., the textual description of\nadverse weather paired with the image) and serves as an implicit regularization\nfor guidance, struggling to learn accurate region- and object-level features in\nvarying domains. In this work, we propose a new cross-modal feature learning\nmethod, which can capture generalized and discriminative regional features for\nS-DGOD tasks. The core of our method is the mechanism of Cross-modal and\nRegion-aware Feature Interaction, which simultaneously learns both inter-modal\nand intra-modal regional invariance through dynamic interactions between\nfine-grained textual and visual features. Moreover, we design a simple but\neffective strategy called Cross-domain Proposal Refining and Mixing, which\naligns the position of region proposals across multiple domains and diversifies\nthem, enhancing the localization ability of detectors in unseen scenarios. Our\nmethod achieves new state-of-the-art results on S-DGOD benchmark datasets, with\nimprovements of +8.8\\%~mPC on Cityscapes-C and +7.9\\%~mPC on DWD over\nbaselines, demonstrating its efficacy.",

In these models, the dark Higgs boson plays a crucial\nrole in generating the mass of the new gauge boson, the dark photon ($A^{'}$),\nand in establishing the mass splitting between the excited ($\\chi_2$) and\nground ($\\chi_1$) states of DM. In particular, the Compton scattering $\\chi_1\nA' \\rightarrow \\chi_2^* \\rightarrow \\chi_1 A'$ and its $t$-channel crossed\nprocess, $\\chi_1 \\chi_1 \\rightarrow A' A'$, remain unitary for high energy\nlongitudunal dark photon, only if the contribution of the dark Higgs boson is\nincluded. However, experimental searches for the dark Higgs boson have received\nrelatively little attention. In particular, when the dark Higgs boson mass\nexceeds twice that of the DM excited state, its decay signatures become\nsemi-visible or invisible, making detection challenging with current light\nscalar search strategies. In this work, we explore the prospects for detecting\nthe elusive dark Higgs boson in inelastic DM models at Belle II via dark\nHiggs-strahlung and rare $B$ meson decay processes. Our analysis indicates that\nboth the inclusive signature of two displaced dilepton vertices and the\nadditional missing energy from dark Higgs boson decays serve as robust\nindicators of its presence.

    "abstract": "Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations are widely used for modeling plasma\nkinetics by tracking discrete particle dynamics. However, their computational\ncost remains prohibitively high, due to the need to simulate large numbers of\nparticles to mitigate statistical noise and the inefficiency in handling\ncomplex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PaRO-DeepONet, a\nparticle-informed reduced-order surrogate framework that integrates Proper\nOrthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Deep Operator Network (DeepONet). By\nperforming manifold sampling of particle evolution in PIC simulations and\nconstructing snapshot matrices from various particle states, PaRO-DeepONet\napplies POD projection to extract latent charge density features that are\nshared across similar plasma scenarios. These reduced features are fed into the\nbranch network of DeepONet, enabling efficient mapping from charge\ndistributions to electrostatic potential fields. We validate PaRO-DeepONet on\nfour representative benchmark cases. The model consistently achieves relative\nL2 errors below 3.5%, with the best case reaching as low as 0.82%. Notably,\nalthough the charge deposition becomes highly discrete due to particle\nsparsity, PaRO-DeepONet still reconstructs smooth and continuous potential\nfields, demonstrating strong robustness to sparse inputs and excellent\ngeneralization beyond traditional grid-based solvers. In terms of computational\nperformance, PaRO-DeepONet reduces total PIC simulation time by 68%-85% and\ncuts the Poisson solver runtime by up to 99.6%.

Evaluation results from a prototype\nimplemented on a set of decentralized nodes demonstrate that GenTorrent\nachieves a latency reduction of over 50% compared to the baseline design\nwithout overlay forwarding.

To\nperform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory\n(EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge\nfields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge\nfield, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a\ntriplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW\nproduction mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the\ngauge field background.

    "abstract": "Generative AI is reshaping art, gaming, and most notably animation. Recent\nbreakthroughs in foundation and diffusion models have reduced the time and cost\nof producing animated content. Characters are central animation components,\ninvolving motion, emotions, gestures, and facial expressions. The pace and\nbreadth of advances in recent months make it difficult to maintain a coherent\nview of the field, motivating the need for an integrative review. Unlike\nearlier overviews that treat avatars, gestures, or facial animation in\nisolation, this survey offers a single, comprehensive perspective on all the\nmain generative AI applications for character animation. We begin by examining\nthe state-of-the-art in facial animation, expression rendering, image\nsynthesis, avatar creation, gesture modeling, motion synthesis, object\ngeneration, and texture synthesis. We highlight leading research, practical\ndeployments, commonly used datasets, and emerging trends for each area. To\nsupport newcomers, we also provide a comprehensive background section that\nintroduces foundational models and evaluation metrics, equipping readers with\nthe knowledge needed to enter the field. We discuss open challenges and map\nfuture research directions, providing a roadmap to advance AI-driven\ncharacter-animation technologies. This survey is intended as a resource for\nresearchers and developers entering the field of generative AI animation or\nadjacent fields.

    "abstract": "The development of machine learning techniques for discovering software\nvulnerabilities relies fundamentally on the availability of appropriate\ndatasets. The ideal dataset consists of a large and diverse collection of\nreal-world vulnerabilities, paired so as to contain both vulnerable and patched\nversions of each program. Naturally, collecting such datasets is a laborious\nand time-consuming task. Within the specific domain of vulnerability discovery\nin binary code, previous datasets are either publicly unavailable, lack\nsemantic diversity, involve artificially introduced vulnerabilities, or were\ncollected using static analyzers, thereby themselves containing incorrectly\nlabeled example programs.\n  In this paper, we describe a new publicly available dataset which we dubbed\nBinpool, containing numerous samples of\n  vulnerable versions of Debian packages across the years. The dataset was\nautomatically curated, and contains both vulnerable and patched versions of\neach program, compiled at four different optimization levels. Overall, the\ndataset covers 603 distinct CVEs across 89 CWE classes, 162 Debian packages,\nand contains 6144 binaries. We argue that this dataset is suitable for\nevaluating a range of security analysis tools, including for vulnerability\ndiscovery, binary function similarity, and plagiarism detection.",
