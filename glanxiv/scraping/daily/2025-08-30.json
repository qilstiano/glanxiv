    "abstract": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and\nwidely used tools for molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry.\nHowever, the interpretation of NMR spectra to determine unknown molecular\nstructures remains a labor-intensive and expertise-dependent process,\nparticularly for complex or novel compounds. Although recent methods have been\nproposed for molecular structure elucidation, they often underperform in\nreal-world applications due to inherent algorithmic limitations and limited\nhigh-quality data. Here, we present NMR-Solver, a practical and interpretable\nframework for the automated determination of small organic molecule structures\nfrom $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra. Our method introduces an automated\nframework for molecular structure elucidation, integrating large-scale spectral\nmatching with physics-guided fragment-based optimization that exploits\natomic-level structure-spectrum relationships in NMR. We evaluate NMR-Solver on\nsimulated benchmarks, curated experimental data from the literature, and\nreal-world experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization, robustness,\nand practical utility in challenging, real-life scenarios. NMR-Solver unifies\ncomputational NMR analysis, deep learning, and interpretable chemical reasoning\ninto a coherent system. By incorporating the physical principles of NMR into\nmolecular optimization, it enables scalable, automated, and chemically\nmeaningful molecular identification, establishing a generalizable paradigm for\nsolving inverse problems in molecular science.",

    "abstract": "Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to\ncondition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation\nis rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate\nhealth assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because\noperational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces\nonly subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect\nshort-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the\nunderlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but\nthe residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in\nnoisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with\ndynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising\nframework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in\nslow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,\nwhile degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation\n(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)\nCDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a\nmulti-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a\nlearnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to\ncontrol degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces\nmonotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.\nThrough comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and\nsteady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively\ndisentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms\nresidual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable\ninference.",

We\ninvestigated two complementary backbones: (i) ConvNeXt-Small, pretrained on\nImageNet, and (ii) a histopathology-specific ViT from Lunit trained via\nself-supervision. To address the strong prevalence imbalance (9408 normal vs.\n1741 atypical), we synthesized additional atypical examples to approximate\nclass balance and compared models trained with real-only vs. real+synthetic\ndata. Using five-fold cross-validation, both backbones reached strong\nperformance (mean AUROC approximately 95 percent), with ConvNeXt achieving\nslightly higher peaks while Lunit exhibited greater fold-to-fold stability.\nSynthetic balancing, however, did not lead to consistent improvements. On the\norganizers' preliminary hidden test set, explicitly designed as an\nout-of-distribution debug subset, ConvNeXt attained the highest AUROC (95.4\npercent), whereas Lunit remained competitive on balanced accuracy. These\nfindings suggest that both ImageNet and domain-pretrained backbones are viable\nfor atypical mitosis classification, with domain-pretraining conferring\nrobustness and ImageNet pretraining reaching higher peaks, while naive\nsynthetic balancing has limited benefit.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its\nprivacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to\ncollaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its\ndistributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local\ntraining process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible\nto Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in\nmission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the\ndiverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem\nfrom benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior.\nExisting data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from\nnatural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering\nperformance.\n  To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation\n(RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and\nmitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system\nemploys code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical\nvariables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted\ntraining recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an\nattestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted\nto the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client\ntraining processes remain free from program behavior violation or data\nmanipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the\nglobal model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel\nensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime\nand memory overhead.",

    "abstract": "Near-duplicate text alignment is the task of identifying, among the texts in\na corpus, all the subsequences (substrings) that are similar to a given query.\nTraditional approaches rely on seeding-extension-filtering heuristics, which\nlack accuracy guarantees and require many hard-to-tune parameters. Recent\nmethods leverage min-hash techniques under a hash-based framework: group\nsubsequences by their min-hash, and for any query, find all sketches similar to\nthe query's sketch. These methods guarantee to report all subsequences whose\nestimated unweighted Jaccard similarity with the query exceeds a user-provided\nthreshold and are efficient. However, they fail to account for token importance\nor frequency, which limits their use in real scenarios where tokens carry\nweights, such as TF-IDF. To address this, we propose MONO, an approach that\nsupports weighted Jaccard similarity using consistent weighted sampling. MONO\nachieves optimality within the hash-based framework. For example, when token\nweights are proportional to frequencies, MONO generates O(n + n log f) groups\nin expectation for a text of length n, where f is the maximum token frequency.\nEach group takes O(1) space and represents a few subsequences sharing the same\nsampling. We prove this bound is tight: any algorithm must produce Omega(n + n\nlog f) groups in expectation in the worst case. Experiments show that MONO\noutperforms the state of the art by up to 26x in index construction time,\nreduces index size by up to 30 percent, and improves query latency by up to 3x,\nwhile scaling well.",

These abstract\nspecifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which\na state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This\ndesign enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state\ncaching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,\nNetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,\nlive video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,\nproducing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability.

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research\ntopic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research\nhas increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing\ntextual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast\ndiscrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal\narchitectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,\nresulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address\nthis modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment\nfor LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting\nframework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw\ntime series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive\nstatistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,\nproducing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context\nalignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling\nstrategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual\nembeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the\naligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together\nintegrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show\nthat, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability\nto harness complementary information from text and time series.

We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based\nclustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our\nfindings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau\nneurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual\ncomputational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather\nthan forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no\npreferential routing to specialists.

To better\nunderstand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we\nclassify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,\nrepresentation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on\ndownstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and\nself-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive\nevaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined\nrobust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of\nsimple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble\nfine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types\nwhile maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.",

While automated\nmethods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain\nlimited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time.\nTask 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion\nlocalizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal\npromptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg\nframework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking\nthrough point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the\nprovided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic\nlongitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially\nimproves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement\nof up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with\ninteractive prompting for robust lesion tracking.

The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer\nwith two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,\nposition-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval\nmechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are\ndynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly\ncombine local and global information for each token.

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning accelerators are designed to efficiently execute deep\nneural networks (DNNs) by optimizing data movement, memory hierarchy, and\ncompute throughput. However, emerging DNN models such as large language models,\nstate space models increasingly rely on compound operations-structured\ncompositions of multiple basic operations-which introduce new challenges for\ndataflow optimization and minimizing off-chip memory traffic. Moreover, as\nmodel size continues to grow, deployment across spatially distributed compute\nclusters becomes essential, requiring frequent and complex collective\ncommunication. Existing dataflow optimization frameworks and performance models\neither focus on single operations or lack explicit modeling of collective\ncommunication cost, limiting their applicability to modern workloads.\n  To address these limitations, we propose, a framework for modeling and\noptimizing dataflow for compound operations on machine learning accelerators.\nCOMET introduces a novel representation that explicitly models collective\ncommunication across spatial clusters, along with latency and energy cost\nmodels that account for both GEMM and non-GEMM operation level dependencies\nwithin compound operations. We demonstrate COMET's capabilities to analyze and\noptimize dataflows for compound operations such as GEMM--Softmax,\nGEMM--LayerNorm, and self-attention, across both edge and cloud accelerator\nconfigurations. Our collective-aware modeling enables exploration of a broader\nmapping space, leading to improved performance and energy efficiency.\nSpecifically, our optimized dataflows achieve up to 1.42$\\times$ speedup for\nGEMM-Softmax, 3.46$\\times$ for GEMM-LayerNorm and 1.82$\\times$ for\nself-attention compared to unfused baselines.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and\nlanguage, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional\nvisual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural\nimage domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the\nlimited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural\nand RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that\ndecouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at\nboth the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored\nstrategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)\nmodule, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global\nmodifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are\npartitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask\nproposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local\nscale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image\npatches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich\nthe text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual\nfeatures, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary\nsemantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a\nCross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual\ninformation from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module\nintegrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation\noutput, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across\nglobal and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).",

About two thirds of these\nwere ultimately executed, to observe 63 high-latitude fields in Pure Parallel\nmode. These have provided more than ten thousand near-infrared grism\nspectrograms of faint galaxies.\n  PASSAGE brings unique advantages in studying galaxy evolution: A) Unbiased\nspectroscopic search, without prior photometric pre-selection. By including the\nmost numerous galaxies, with low masses and strong emission lines, slitless\nspectroscopy is the indispensable complement to any pre-targeted spectroscopy;\nB) The combination of several dozen independent fields to overcome cosmic\nvariance; C) Near-infrared spectral coverage, often spanning the full range\nfrom 1.0--2.3 $\\mu$m, with minimal wavelength gaps, to measure multiple\ndiagnostic rest-frame optical lines, minimizing sensitivity to dust reddening;\nD) JWST's unprecedented spatial resolution, in some cases using two orthogonal\ngrism orientations, to overcome contamination due to blending of overlapping\nspectra; E) Discovery of rare bright objects especially for detailed JWST\nfollowup. PASSAGE data are public immediately, and our team plans to deliver\nfully-processed high-level data products.\n  In this PASSAGE overview, we describe the survey and data quality, and\npresent examples of these accomplishments in several areas of current interest\nin the evolution of emission-line galaxy properties, particularly at low\nmasses.",

In\nthis work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating\nthe perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear\nprobe to score prompts on a continuous scale from \"test-like\" to \"deploy-like\"\nand leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more\nnatural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using\nthis method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a\nstrategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of\nstate-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that\nrewritten \"deploy-like\" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in\nbehavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest\nresponses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses\nof 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,\nindicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that\nevaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly\ninfluences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or\ndeceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent\nneed for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model\nalignment before deployment.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly the case with modern time series that many data sets of\npractical interest contain abrupt changes in structure. These changes may occur\nin complex characteristics such as the extremal dependence structure, and\nidentifying such structural breaks remains a challenging problem. Many existing\nchange point detection algorithms focus on changes in dependence across the\nentire distribution, rather than the tails, and approaches that are tailored to\nextremes typically make strict parametric assumptions or they are only\napplicable to bivariate data. We propose a nonparametric MOving sum-based\napproach for detecting multiple changes in the Pairwise Extremal Dependence\n(MOPED) of multivariate regularly varying data. To avoid the classical problem\nof threshold selection in the study of multivariate extremes, we further\npropose a multiscale, multi-threshold variant of MOPED that pools change point\nestimates across choices of the threshold and the bandwidth used in local\nestimation. Good performance of MOPED is illustrated in a simulation study, and\nwe showcase its ability to identify subtle changes in tail dependence class in\nthe absence of correlation changes. We further demonstrate the usefulness of\nMOPED by identifying changes in the extremal connectivity of\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) signals of seizure-prone neonates.",

The proposed method\nintegrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into\nthe trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively\nmaintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The\nframework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and\nHDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC\ncomputation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the\nclosed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware\ntrajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations\nconducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,\nand comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as\nquintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines.

The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers\nfrom inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability\nguarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL\nagent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample\nefficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an\noptimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using\nonly a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some\ncontroller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges,\nensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also\napplied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The\ncontroller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot\nsimulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a\nconventional kinematic controller.",

To achieve optimal robust resource allocation, we address\nthe challenges posed by coupled optimization variables and bounded channel\nestimation errors by first applying the S-procedure to handle robustness\nagainst channel uncertainty. An alternating optimization (AO) framework is\nsubsequently proposed, where the active beamforming at the LEO satellite and\nthe passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS are jointly optimized, and a\npenalty-based strategy is incorporated to enforce the STAR-RIS beamforming\ndesign.

However, when we\nenjoy these speech applications, our speech may be collected by attackers for\nspeech synthesis. For example, an attacker generates some inappropriate\npolitical opinions with the characteristic of the victim's voice by obtaining a\npiece of the victim's speech, which will greatly influence the victim's\nreputation. Specifically, with the appearance of some zero-shot voice\nconversion methods, the cost of speech synthesis attacks has been further\nreduced, which also brings greater challenges to user voice security and\nprivacy. Some researchers have proposed the corresponding privacy-preserving\nmethods. However, the existing approaches have some non-negligible drawbacks:\nlow transferability and robustness, high computational overhead. These\ndeficiencies seriously limit the existing method deployed in practical\nscenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight, robust,\nplug-and-play privacy preservation method against speech synthesis attacks in a\nblack-box setting. Our method generates and adds a frequency-domain\nperturbation to the original speech to achieve privacy protection and high\nspeech quality. Then, we present a data augmentation strategy and noise\nsmoothing mechanism to improve the robustness of the proposed method. Besides,\nto reduce the user's defense overhead, we also propose a novel identity-wise\nprotection mechanism. It can generate a universal perturbation for one speaker\nand support privacy preservation for speech of any length. Finally, we conduct\nextensive experiments on 5 speech synthesis models, 5 speech verification\nmodels, 1 speech recognition model, and 2 datasets.

These applications place higher demands on model compression\nand inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,\ndue to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs\nface challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies\nlearned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To\naddress these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self\nAttention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier\nKAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.\nThrough the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift\nmechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves\nits nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational\ncomplexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based\non teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive\nweighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the\nstudent model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD\nachieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models\nand 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark\nmodels, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%\ndecrease in inference time.",

In this\nreview, we compare and contrast three theories being investigated in one such\nadversarial collaboration: Integrated Information Theory,\nNeurorepresentationalism, and Active Inference. We begin by presenting the core\nclaims of each theory, before comparing them in terms of (1) the phenomena they\nseek to explain, (2) the sorts of explanations they avail, and (3) the\nmethodological strategies they endorse. We then consider some of the inherent\nchallenges of theory testing, and how adversarial collaboration addresses some\nof these difficulties. More specifically, we outline the key hypotheses that\nwill be tested in this adversarial collaboration, and exemplify how contrasting\nempirical predictions may pertain to core and auxiliary components of each\ntheory. Finally, we discuss how the data harvested across disparate experiments\n(and their replicates) may be formally integrated to provide a quantitative\nmeasure of the evidential support accrued under each theory. We suggest this\napproach to theory comparison may afford a useful metric for tracking the\namount of scientific progress being made in consciousness research.",

Such systems are typically modeled as Delay Differential\nEquations (DDEs) that incorporate inertial effects. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the stability of pattern formation of active agents with inertia\nand time delays, in both uncoupled and coupled scenarios. We derive and analyze\na high-dimensional linear DDE model that characterizes the stability of such\nformations. Starting with the uncoupled scenario, where agents are driven only\nby a virtual leader, we describe the stability spectrum and provide conditions\nfor the delay-independent (absolute) stability of the formations, as well as\ndelay-dependent stability and unstable hyperbolic behavior. Different cases\ncorrespond to distinct universality classes of the corresponding spectrum. For\nthe coupled scenario, where agents are driven by both the virtual leader and\ninter-agent interactions, we consider both symmetric and non-symmetric coupling\ntopologies. Here we also provide an explicit spectrum classification, including\nthe absolute stability criterion. Additionally, we investigate interactions in\nthe large-delay limit, where delays affect inter-agent coupling, while local\nfeedback remains instantaneous. In this limit, we prove rigorously that the\nstability region in the complex plane of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian\nmatrix converges to a circle centered at the origin, a phenomenon previously\nobserved in delay-coupled networks. Our findings provide a universal framework\nfor understanding stable formations and motions of active agents with delayed\ninteractions.",

First, every square matrix whose\nentries are multivariable rational functions over a field $\\mathbb{F}$ has a\nBessmertny\\u{i} realization, i.e., is the Schur complement of an affine linear\nsquare matrix pencil with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}$. Second, if the matrix\nis also symmetric and the characteristic of the field $\\mathbb{F}$ is not two\nthen it has a symmetric Bessmertny\\u{i} realization (i.e., the pencil can be\nchosen to consist of symmetric matrices) and counterexamples are given to prove\nthis statement is false in general for fields of characteristic two. Third, for\nfields of characteristic two (e.g., binary or Boolean field), we completely\ncharacterize those functions that have a symmetric Bessmertny\\u{i} realization.\nFinally, analogous results hold when restricted to the class of homogeneous\ndegree-one rational functions. To solve these realization problems, i.e.,\nfinding such structured Bessmertny\\u{i} realizations for a given multivariate\nrational function, we use state-space methods from systems theory to produce\nrealizations for algebraic operations on Schur complements such as sums,\nproducts, inverses, and symmetrization, which become the elementary building\nblocks of our constructions. Further complications arise over fields of\ncharacteristic two, so a large part of the paper is devoted to developing\nadditional methods to decide if the symmetric realization problem can be solved\nand, if so, to construction the symmetric realization for a given symmetric\nrational matrix function. Our motivations are discussed in the context of\nmultidimensional linear systems theory on generalizing state-space\nrepresentations for rational functions including the Givone-Roesser and\nFornasini-Marchesini realizations.",

In contrast to other~(mostly phenomenological) approaches to\nLorentz violations with modified dispersions leading to drastic changes on the\nformation length for the cascade development in the atmosphere and in\ndetectors, there is the possibility that the dispersion effect in the present\nstring foam model avoids such modifications and the theory naturally escapes\nthe shower formation constraints from recent observations.",

In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion\nframework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference\nlatent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source\nfeatures in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating\ntarget content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables\nfine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal\nmodel modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,\nplug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based\narchitectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that\nour proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and\neditability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.\nAdditionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural\nfunction evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate\nvariables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be\ndirectly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing\nattack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the\nglobal model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private\nmodels, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by\nself-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by\ndeveloping a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to\ncause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated\nLearning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the\nperformance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own\nmodels within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named\nFedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading\nmodified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the\nprivate model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where\n\"divergence\" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that\nintegrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that\nour method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the\nattacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global\nmodel.",

In general, it is not possible to make definitive\nstatements about causality without some assumptions on the underlying model. To\ndistinguish between cause and effect, we propose a bivariate causal score based\non the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, using functions that possess\nthe density property on a compact real interval. We prove the identifiability\nof these causal scores under specific conditions. These conditions can be\neasily tested. Gaussianity of the noise in the causal model equations is not\nassumed, only that the noise is low. The well-studied class of cubic splines\npossesses the density property on a compact real interval. We propose LCUBE as\nan instantiation of the MDL-based causal score utilizing cubic regression\nsplines. LCUBE is an identifiable method that is also interpretable, simple,\nand very fast. It has only one hyperparameter. Empirical evaluations compared\nto state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that LCUBE achieves superior precision\nin terms of AUDRC on the real-world Tuebingen cause-effect pairs dataset.

To address this issue, Zwetsloot et al. proposed a Shewhart\nchart for bivariate TBE data that updates the process status as individual\nobservations arrive.

    "abstract": "Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning\nof newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By\nabstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and\nprototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed\ncatastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature\nEntanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,\nand Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing\ntechniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to\ndistinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these\nissues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework\n(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language\nmodels (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features\nthrough Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual\nBackground Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new\nprototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,\nwhile the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based\nsupervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating\nsoft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the\ncapability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in\nmulti-step scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework for lifting smooth paths via the exponential\nmap on semi-Riemannian manifolds, addressing the long-standing difficulties\nposed by its singularities. We prove that every smooth path -- up to a\nnondecreasing reparametrization -- can be (partially) lifted to a curve which\nis inextensible in the domain of definition of the exponential map. Under a\nnatural and purely topological condition -- the so-called path-continuation\nproperty for the exponential map -- we also establish the existence of global\nlifts, leading to a general path-lifting theorem.\n  This lifting approach yields new, alternative proofs of (generalizations of)\na number of foundational results in semi-Riemannian geometry: the Hopf--Rinow\ntheorem and Serre's classic theorem about multiplicity of connecting geodesics\nin the Riemannian case, as well as the Avez--Seifert theorem for globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes in Lorentzian geometry. More broadly, our results reveal\nthe central role of the continuation property in obtaining geodesic\nconnectivity across a wide range of semi-Riemannian geometries. This offers a\nunifying geometric principle that is complementary to the more traditional\nanalytic, variational methods used to investigate geodesic connectedness, and\nprovides new insight into the structure of geodesics, both on geodesically\ncomplete and non-complete manifolds.\n  We also briefly point out how the lifting theory developed here can extend to\nmore general flow-inducing maps on the tangent bundle other than the geodesic\nflow, suggesting broader geometric applicability beyond the exponential map.",

However, current Large Language Models (LLMs)\npowered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised\nFine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary\nclassification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for\nthose built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for\ncomplex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations,\nrendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this\ndilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise\nreranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance\nscenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and\ntrain the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which\nsignificantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further\nrefined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived\nreward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient\npointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR,\nTREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and\nrobustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT\nbenchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant\nreaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.",

Unfortunately, most\nprevious studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling\nspatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which\nhave neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial\ncorrelations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies\nfail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and\nRegional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic\nforecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion\nframework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to\ncapture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective\nfrom the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with\npositive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional\nnetwork based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a\nregional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with\nregional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional\nheterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded\nin the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike\nstatic prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach\nemphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A\nSubclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user\nand an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through\nGA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts\nand task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm\nIntelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and\nexchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive\nsignatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence\ncapable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the\ntheoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,\nKU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge\nconsolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an\narchitectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned\ncollective AI.",

To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box\nDistillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under\nrealistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on\nlarge-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot\npredictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant\nsensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented\noptimally at different scales, a limitation termed the \"curse of resolution\".\nOur method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by\nleveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for\nblack-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to\nidentify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective\ndistillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box\nsupervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API\npredictions.

    "abstract": "Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,\nresulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style\ngap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images\nfrom a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target\ndomain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.\nHowever, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the\nmost relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned\nwith the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a\ntoken-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while\ntransferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and\nstyle remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we\nintroduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a\ndata view--selecting \"suitable\" target tokens corresponding to each source\ntoken, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal\" target tokens for the\ndownstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject\nauxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with\ndownstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate\nthat TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and\ndownstream task performance.",

This report\nexplores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and\ncarrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective\nwas to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify\na more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each\nadditive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled\nconditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the\nprogression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and\nanalysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure\neven after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of\na stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen\nand subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating\nimproved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the\ndifferent stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some\noffering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.\nOverall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly\nused food additives in ice cream formulation.

    "abstract": "Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing\ninterest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically\nencode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per\nsecond. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per\nsecond, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders\nefficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech\nrepresentations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,\nwhile semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level\nresolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic\naggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.\nA speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on\nlarge-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive\nentropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed\nby a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By\nadjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the\nrepresentations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text\ntranslation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed\nrepresentations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "The classic method for computing the spectral decomposition of a real\nsymmetric matrix, the Jacobi algorithm, can be accelerated by using mixed\nprecision arithmetic. The Jacobi algorithm is aiming to reduce the off-diagonal\nentries iteratively using Givens rotations. We investigate how to use the low\nprecision to speed up this algorithm based on the approximate spectral\ndecomposition in low precision.\n  We first study two different index choosing techniques, classical and\ncyclic-by-row, for the Jacobi algorithm. Numerical testing suggests that\ncyclic-by-row is more efficient. Then we discuss two different methods of\northogonalizing an almost orthogonal matrix: the QR factorization and the polar\ndecomposition. For polar decomposition, we speed up the Newton iteration by\nusing the one-step Schulz iteration. Based on numerical testing, using the\npolar decomposition approach (Newton--Schulz iteration) is not only faster but\nalso more accurate than using the QR factorization.\n  A mixed precision algorithm for computing the spectral decomposition of a\nreal symmetric matrix at double precision is provided. In doing so we compute\nthe approximate eigenvector matrix $Q_\\ell$ of $A$ in single precision using\n$\\texttt{eig}$ and $\\texttt{single}$ in MATLAB. We then use the Newton--Schulz\niteration to orthogonalize the eigenvector matrix $Q_\\ell$ into an orthogonal\nmatrix $Q_d$ in double precision. Finally, we apply the cyclic-by-row Jacobi\nalgorithm on $Q_d^TAQ_d$ and obtain the spectral decomposition of $A$. At this\nstage, we will see, from the testings, the cyclic-by-row Jacobi algorithm only\nneed less than 10 iterations to converge by utilizing the quadratic\nconvergence. The new mixed precision algorithm requires roughly 30\\% of the\ntime used by the Jacobi algorithm on its own.",

To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal\ninterleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified\nframework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group\ninteractions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual\nfeatures and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval\nscenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it\nmay require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH\n(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle\nthis difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature\nintegration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model\nto jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We\nconducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH\nand M-STVH can achieve excellent results.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuations in phase angle and frequency under large disturbances can lead\nto loss of synchronism (LOS) in grid-following (GFL) converters. The power\nangle and frequency of synchronous generators (SGs) correspond to rotor\nposition and speed, whereas those of converters lack a direct physical\ncounterpart in the real world and can thus be directly adjusted by control\nmethods to prevent loss of synchronization. In this paper, an improved\nphase-locked loop (PLL) design with reset control for GFL converters is\nproposed to enhance transient stability. The stability domain (SD) of a GFL\nconverter is first analyzed, and three forms of SD are identified under\ndifferent short circuit ratios. Secondly, based on the characteristics of the\nthree SD forms, two PLL-reset methods are proposed, including omega reset and\nomega&delta reset. Thirdly, to provide the triggering conditions for the\nPLL-reset control, the Lyapunov function of the GFL converter is constructed\nbased on three methods: the approximation-based Lyapunov method, the Zubov\nmethod, and the analytical trajectory reversing method. All these methods are\nimmune to the negative damping problem of PLL dynamics, which makes traditional\nenergy-perspective Lyapunov functions invalid. Finally, the estimation accuracy\nof the three Lyapunov-based methods is analyzed, and the effectiveness of the\nPLL-reset control is verified in single-machine and multi-machine case studies.",

In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends\nto emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard\nautoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing\nstages.

This\nprotocol effectively makes it an open quantum system and drives it into a\nunique nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). We analytically and numerically\ncharacterize the NESS, uncovering a conditionally independent and identically\ndistributed (CIID) structure in the joint probability density function (JPDF)\nof the positions. The JPDF in the CIID structure is a product of Gaussians with\na common random variance, which is then averaged with respect to its\ndistribution, making the JPDF non-factorizable, giving rise to long-range\nemergent dynamical correlations. The average density profile of the gas shows\nsignificant deviations from the initial Gaussian shape. We further compute the\norder and the gap statistics, revealing universal scaling in both bulk and edge\nregimes.

    "abstract": "Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration ([Ox]_{tot}) in\nnon-thermal plasma (NTP)-treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge\ndue to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the\nsubjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]_{tot}\ndetermination. This study introduces a novel, color-based computer analysis\n(CBCA) method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning\n(ML) to quantify colorimetric shifts in potassium iodide (KI) solutions during\noxidation. First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured\nhigh-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during\noxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments\nwas monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames\nwere processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV,\nand Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated,\nand the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured\n[Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and\nblue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the\nextracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among\nthem, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest\npredictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature\nset from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved\nprediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting. Finally, comparison of\nthe model predictions with real titration measurements revealed that the CBCA\nsystem successfully predicts the [Ox]_{tot} in KI solution with high accuracy\n(R^2 > 0.998) even with a reduced number of features.",

Driven by the growing\nneed for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the\nfirst demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces\noperating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the\nKirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated\nphotonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from\na metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical\nframework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation\nwith unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral\ndirectional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective\ndecoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal\nsymmetry at thermal wavelengths.",

    "abstract": "As generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools become widely adopted, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) are increasingly involved on both sides of\ndecision-making processes, ranging from hiring to content moderation. This dual\nadoption raises a critical question: do LLMs systematically favor content that\nresembles their own outputs? Prior research in computer science has identified\nself-preference bias -- the tendency of LLMs to favor their own generated\ncontent -- but its real-world implications have not been empirically evaluated.\nWe focus on the hiring context, where job applicants often rely on LLMs to\nrefine resumes, while employers deploy them to screen those same resumes. Using\na large-scale controlled resume correspondence experiment, we find that LLMs\nconsistently prefer resumes generated by themselves over those written by\nhumans or produced by alternative models, even when content quality is\ncontrolled. The bias against human-written resumes is particularly substantial,\nwith self-preference bias ranging from 68% to 88% across major commercial and\nopen-source models. To assess labor market impact, we simulate realistic hiring\npipelines across 24 occupations. These simulations show that candidates using\nthe same LLM as the evaluator are 23% to 60% more likely to be shortlisted than\nequally qualified applicants submitting human-written resumes, with the largest\ndisadvantages observed in business-related fields such as sales and accounting.\nWe further demonstrate that this bias can be reduced by more than 50% through\nsimple interventions targeting LLMs' self-recognition capabilities. These\nfindings highlight an emerging but previously overlooked risk in AI-assisted\ndecision making and call for expanded frameworks of AI fairness that address\nnot only demographic-based disparities, but also biases in AI-AI interactions.",

In its\ncurrent version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but\ncan readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under\nthe assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the\nresponse to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band\nperturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent\nexcitations.

But this also raises a\nkey issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is\nprone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to\nthe lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To\naddress these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework\nthat efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture\ninterconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the\ngraph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs\nfrom local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing\nthe difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic\nobjects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce\nhierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former\nuncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while\nthe latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from\nthe former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms\nthe baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.",

Its generalization, the Multi-Path\nTSP, has recently been used in the best known algorithm for path TSP by Traub\nand Vygen [Cambridge University Press, 2024]. The best known approximation\nfactor for this problem is $2.214$ by B\\\"{o}hm, Friggstad, M\\\"{o}mke and\nSpoerhase [SODA 2025]. In this paper we show that for the case of graphic\nmetrics, a significantly better approximation guarantee of $2$ can be attained.\nOur algorithm is based on sampling paths from a decomposition of the flow\ncorresponding to the optimal solution to the LP for the problem, and connecting\nthe left-out vertices with doubled edges. The cost of the latter is twice the\noptimum in the worst case; we show how the cost of the sampled paths can be\nabsorbed into it without increasing the approximation factor. Furthermore, we\nprove that any below-$2$ approximation algorithm for the special case of the\nproblem where each source is the same as the corresponding sink yields a\nbelow-$2$ approximation algorithm for Graphic Multi-Path TSP.\n  We also show that our ideas can be utilized to give a factor\n$1.791$-approximation algorithm for Ordered TSP in graphic metrics, for which\nthe aforementioned paper [SODA 2025] and Armbruster, Mnich and N\\\"agele [APPROX\n2024] give a $1.868$-approximation algorithm in general metrics.",

We introduce NEWSAGENT, a\nbenchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw\ncontents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news\narticle by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction\nand firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are\ntasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,\nretrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical\nsummarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available\nand must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in\nreal-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived\nfrom real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model\ncompatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used\nagentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of\nretrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative\nintegration.

    "abstract": "Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a fundamental task in\nnetwork analysis with wide-ranging applications across domains. While deep\nlearning has advanced node influence detection, existing supervised approaches\nremain constrained by their reliance on labeled data, limiting their\napplicability in real-world scenarios where labels are scarce or unavailable.\nWhile contrastive learning demonstrates significant potential for performance\nenhancement, existing approaches predominantly rely on multiple-embedding\ngeneration to construct positive/negative sample pairs. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose ReCC (\\textit{r}egular \\textit{e}quivalence-based\n\\textit{c}ontrastive \\textit{c}lustering), a novel deep unsupervised framework\nfor influential node identification. We first reformalize influential node\nidentification as a label-free deep clustering problem, then develop a\ncontrastive learning mechanism that leverages regular equivalence-based\nsimilarity, which captures structural similarities between nodes beyond local\nneighborhoods, to generate positive and negative samples. This mechanism is\nintegrated into a graph convolutional network to learn node embeddings that are\nused to differentiate influential from non-influential nodes. ReCC is\npre-trained using network reconstruction loss and fine-tuned with a combined\ncontrastive and clustering loss, with both phases being independent of labeled\ndata. Additionally, ReCC enhances node representations by combining structural\nmetrics with regular equivalence-based similarities. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that ReCC outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across several\nbenchmarks.",

Recent breakthroughs combine SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) to achieve exceptional reconstruction fidelity. However, existing\n3DGS-SLAM systems provide insufficient throughput due to the need for multiple\ntraining iterations per frame and the vast number of Gaussians.\n  In this paper, we propose AGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to\nboost the efficiency of 3DGS-SLAM based on the intuition that SLAM systems\nprocess frames in a streaming manner, where adjacent frames exhibit high\nsimilarity that can be utilized for acceleration. On the software level: 1) We\npropose a coarse-then-fine-grained pose tracking method with respect to the\nrobot's movement. 2) We avoid redundant computations of Gaussians by sharing\ntheir contribution information across frames. On the hardware level, we propose\na frame covisibility detection engine to extract intermediate data from the\nvideo CODEC. We also implement a pose tracking engine and a mapping engine with\nworkload schedulers to efficiently deploy the AGS algorithm.

Explicit forms are provided for three fundamental\ntransformations: rotation, scaling, and shearing. Rotation introduces a gauge\nfield coupled to angular momentum, while scaling and shearing produce geometric\npotentials that lift degeneracies in non-circular cross sections.

Furthermore, band structure calculations on\nMo$_2$AA$'$O materials demonstrate that increasing the difference in atomic\nnumber ($\\Delta$Z) between A and A$'$ site atoms effectively enhances valley\npolarization.

From a cognitive science perspective, an\ninformative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through\nexplicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can\nreliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We\naddress this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits\nnaturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two\nexplicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror\nadult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,\nand enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and\nsentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are\nsufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang\ntasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,\ncreating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving\nquestions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental\nresults show that GPT-5 achieves 98\\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\\% in\nCamlang, far below human performance at 87\\%, while other state-of-the-art\nreasoning LLMs perform even worse.

Solving the dynamics of an OQS\nin a quantum many-body bath has been considered a computationally hard problem\nbecause of the dimensionality curse. Here, considering that full knowledge of\nthe bath dynamics is unnecessary for describing the reduced dynamics of an OQS,\nwe prove a polynomial complexity theorem, that is, the number of independent\nequations required to fully describe the dynamics of an OQS increases at most\nlinearly with the evolution time and polynomially with the bath size.\nTherefore, efficient computational algorithms exist for solving the dynamics of\na small-sized OQS (such as a qubit or an atom). We further prove that, when the\ndynamics of an OQS and the bath is represented by a tensor network, a tensor\ncontraction procedure can be specified such that the bond dimension (i.e., the\nrange of tensor indices contracted in each step) increases only linearly\n(rather than exponentially) with the evolution time, providing explicitly\nefficient algorithms for a wide range of OQS's. We demonstrate the theorems and\nthe tensor-network algorithm by solving two widely encountered OQS problems,\nnamely, a spin in a Gaussian bath (the spin-boson model) and a central spin\ncoupled to many environmental spins (the Gaudin model).

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can\nbe seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly\naccelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the\ninference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and\npropose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve\nmodel efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce\ntokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping\na few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at\nreducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache\ncompression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.\nExperimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance\nwhen only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance\nwhen keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\\times$ the network\nthroughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\\times$. LightVLM also makes\nlarge VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to\ninfer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),\nhopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text\nsequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by\n3.21$\\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.",

This paper proposes that quantum algorithms may\npossess inherent noise resilience characteristics that could reduce\nimplementation barriers. We investigate Shor's algorithm by applying\ncircuit-level noise models directly to the original algorithm circuit. Our\nfindings reveal that Shor's algorithm demonstrates superior fault tolerance\nunder Z noise compared to X and Y noise. Focusing on the modular exponentiation\ncircuit which is the core component of the algorithm, we conduct fault-tolerant\nposition statistics on circuits with bit lengths from 4 to 9. The results show\nthat under Z noise, fault-tolerant positions grow with the same quartic\npolynomial order as potential error positions as the problem scale increases.\nIn contrast, fault tolerance under X and Y noise exhibits a strong dependence\non the composite number N and the parameter a. Based on these findings, we\ndevelop an extrapolation method predicting that the minimum probability of a\ncorrect output of the modular exponentiation circuit to factor 2048 bit\nintegers under biased noise is approximately 1.417*{10}^{-17}.",

Due to the limited availability of suitable\nchiral-crystal materials, their unconventional superconductivity (SC) remains\nlargely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of unconventional SC in the\nLa(Rh,Ir)Si family of materials by combining muon-spin spectroscopy,\nband-structure calculations, and perturbation theory. This family,\ncharacterized by a double-helix chiral structure, hosts exotic multifold\nfermions that are absent in other topological chiral crystals. While LaRhSi\nbehaves as a fully-gapped superconductor, the substitution of 4$d$-Rh by\n5$d$-Ir significantly enhances the SOC and leads to the emergence of\ntopological nodal-line SC in LaIrSi. The developed model shows that the\nnodal-line SC arises from an isotropic SOC with a specific strength. Such an\nexotic mechanism expands our conventional understanding of material candidates\nfor unconventional SC, which typically rely on a significantly anisotropic SOC\nto promote the triplet pairing. Our work establishes a new type of phase\ndiagram, which provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering\nunconventional SC in chiral crystals.

In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for\neach bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health\nintervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term\ndiscounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves\naccording to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The\nstate of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals\nare observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that\nbandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are\nassumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent\nthrough the budget constraint.\n  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable\nrestless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,\nfinite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian\nbounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of\nLagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout\npolicy.

Accordingly, the standard $z$-expansion of hadronic\nform factors, commonly referred to as the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed approach [2-5],\nis modified by including simultaneously the dispersive bounds related to the\npair-production and to the sub-threshold regions. For the latter one the\neffects of above-threshold poles are described through a new resonance model\nand the possible choices of the outer function outside the pair-production\nregion are discussed. A detailed numerical analysis of the experimental data or\nlattice QCD results in the spacelike region for the charged kaon form factor is\npresented as a direct application of the procedure of double dispersive bound.\nThe comparison with other methodologies present in literature and with the\n$z$-expansion based on the single, total dispersive bound clearly shows that\nthe $z$-expansion including the double dispersive bound provides the most\nprecise extrapolation at large momentum transfer as well as the most stable\nresults with respect to the choice of the outer function outside the\npair-production region.",

This further constraint is not usually\ntaken into account in the phenomenological applications of the BGL\n$z$-expansion. We show that it brings to a formulation of the BGL approach\nfully equivalent to the Dispersion Matrix (DM) method [5], which describes\nhadronic form factors in a completely model-independent and non-perturbative\nway. The second key ingredient is represented by the introduction of suitable\nkernel functions in the evaluation of unitarity bounds, leading to the\napplication of multiple dispersive bounds to hadronic form factors, whenever\ndata and/or (non-)perturbative techniques allow to do so. This idea may be\nuseful for the investigation of many physical processes, from the analysis of\nthe electromagnetic form factors of mesons and baryons to the study of weak\nsemileptonic decays of hadrons.

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular\nvideos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained\ndynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel\nviewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the\navatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,\nwe propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to\ngenerate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional\nsupervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously\nunseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to\nmitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to\nenhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we\ninject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For\nhigher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm\nis employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nrecent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our\nproposed strategies.",

    "abstract": "Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nacross distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data\nheterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation\npersonalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from\nclients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model\nstates. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid\noverfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even\ncollapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce\ntheir own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.\nTo this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called\nCurriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the\nclient side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges\nfor training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first\nto easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,\nclient-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased\npatterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,\nthe curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic\nknowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves\nweighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained\nstructural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive\nexperiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior\nperformance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Kang-Min-Ku/CUFL.git.",

Decision trees (DTs) are\nparticularly well-suited for these tasks due to their interpretability and\ncompatibility with data-plane architectures, i.e., match-action tables (MATs).\nHowever, existing in-network DT implementations are constrained by the need to\ncompute all input features upfront, forcing models to rely on a small, fixed\nset of features per flow. This significantly limits model accuracy and\nscalability under stringent hardware resource constraints.\n  We present SPLIDT, a system that rethinks DT deployment in the data plane by\nenabling partitioned inference over sliding windows of packets. SPLIDT\nintroduces two key innovations: (1) it assigns distinct, variable feature sets\nto individual sub-trees of a DT, grouped into partitions, and (2) it leverages\nan in-band control channel (via recirculation) to reuse data-plane resources\n(both stateful registers and match keys) across partitions at line rate. These\ninsights allow SPLIDT to scale the number of stateful features a model can use\nwithout exceeding hardware limits. To support this architecture, SPLIDT\nincorporates a custom training and design-space exploration (DSE) framework\nthat jointly optimizes feature allocation, tree partitioning, and DT model\ndepth. Evaluation across multiple real-world datasets shows that SPLIDT\nachieves higher accuracy while supporting up to 5x more stateful features than\nprior approaches (e.g., NetBeacon and Leo). It maintains the same low\ntime-to-detection (TTD) as these systems, while scaling to millions of flows\nwith minimal recirculation overhead (<0.05%).",

However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced\nimaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we\npresent a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights\nof a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint\ncontroller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of\ntrainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full\nfine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining\nall model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.\nSpecifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer\nConstraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the\npre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an\napproximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property\ninto the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction\nfrom low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in\nthe latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature\nrepresentations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,\nultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical\nreconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the\nmost suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.\nExperiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset\ndemonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose\nreduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving\nvaluable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.",

However, existing\napplications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often\nconflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain\ncollaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability\nto model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose\n\\textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the\nfirst diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge.\nDPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific\ncomponents, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This\ndisentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates\nnegative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.",

Various methods have\nimplemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the\nrobustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying\nperturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently\nminimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the\nadversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in\nenhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has\nbeen largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we\npropose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial\nperturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and\nimproving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation\noperations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified\nframework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a\nunified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and\nadversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using\ndifferent backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly\nimproves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,\noutperforming existing methods.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple\nfactual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions\ninto sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence\nfrom diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers\nas Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are\nfundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP\nformulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)\nfail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often\nintroduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural\ndepth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for\nsynthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to\nrecursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring\nintermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into\nnatural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also\nenables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,\nand reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that\nmodels trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a\nchallenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass\nmuch larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),\nwhile achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).\nBy preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,\nInfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound\nreward design and trajectory-level exploration.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D\ntextual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,\ndue to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a\nchallenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual\nmodels to 3D domains through \"high-to-low\" mapping, these approaches often lead\nto the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for\nadapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly\nleverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any\nmodality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive\nPoint-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a\nmodest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without\nheterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by\naggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear\nlayers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the\ninherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of\nimages and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the\nrelative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched\nwith location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate\nself-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce\ncomputational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights\nwith the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without\nadding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen\nfoundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating\nfor the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.",

Both the angular velocities of material line and surface\nelements comprise a classical contribution driven by volume-element rotation\n(equal to half the local vorticity), and a strain-rate-induced specific angular\nvelocity. Then, two direction-dependent vorticity decompositions (DVDs) are\nconstructed, revealing the rigid rotation and spin modes of vorticity. We\nderive intrinsic coupling relations for orthogonal line-surface element pair,\nelucidating their complementary kinematic and geometric roles. Notably, we\nrigorously prove that the spin mode (in the surface-element-based DVD) is\nidentical to the relative vorticity in the generalized Caswell formula, thereby\nfaithfully accounting for surface shear stress in Newtonian fluids. Next,\nwithin a field-theoretic framework, vorticity decompositions are proposed based\non streamline and streamsurface using differential geometry. The physical roles\nof the six rotational invariants in the characteristic algebraic description\n(including the the normal-nilpotent decomposition (NND) of the velocity\ngradient tensor (VGT) and the resulting invariant vorticity decomposition\n(IVD)) are clarified through unified analysis with the DVD, Caswell formula,\nand Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. ... It is found that physical admissible DVD\nvorticity modes must be bounded by IVD modes in phase space, whereas enforcing\na minimization principle naturally yields the Liutex formula. Finally, the\neffectiveness of theory is validated across diverse flows, from simple to\ncomplex. Results show that a coupled IVD-DVD analysis could enhance physical\nunderstanding of complex vortical flows under both algebraic and\nfield-theoretic frameworks.",

Nevertheless, $\\mathcal{T}$ can be also\nbroken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or\naltermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light\nof this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such\nanomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest\nferromagnetic one, i.e. within a minimal unit cell containing only one magnetic\ncite. We show that such presentation is possible due to the special form of the\nspin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice\nhosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry, combined with the lattice\ntranslations, imposes a severe constraint on the form of the SO interaction,\nwhich becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\\{ \\mathcal{S}| {\\bf t}\n\\}$, combining the $180^{\\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\\mathcal{S}$) with the\nlattice shift ${\\bf t}$, connecting antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices.\nThis is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets,\nwhich justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to\nthe local coordinate frame with one magnetic cite per cell. It naturally\nexplains the emergence of AHE and OM, and provides transparent expressions for\nthese properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating\nbetween nearest neighbors as well as the orthorhombic strain of the\nnext-nearest-neighbor hoppings.

Previous 3D simulations and analytic\npredictions for the propagation of a convection zone into a stable region have\ndemonstrated that the rapid rotation of gas giants can significantly slow\nconvective mixing, but not enough to stop it. Another piece of the puzzle is\nluminosity. Gas giants cool as they age, and with that comes a declining heat\nflux over time. Recent ideas suggest that when this declining luminosity is\ncombined with rotational effects, convection may stall. We explore this\npossibility using 3D hydrodynamic simulations that include both rotation and a\nsurface cooling flux that decreases as $1/t$. Our results demonstrate that,\neven without rotation, a declining luminosity can suppress mixing sufficiently\nto preserve an initial compositional gradient in the deep interior of gas\ngiants.

The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,\nwhich can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the\nphysical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such\nphysical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.\nThis paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address\nthese challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and\ndata-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a\nU-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain\nand applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components\nduring the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the\nfeature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the\nsingular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,\nallowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different\nscenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that\nadaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs.

Numeral examples suggested that integrating\nsuch residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction\nin the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence\nrates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational\nprecision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and\ncannot be adequately explained.\n  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical\nperspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz\ncontinuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the\nloss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a\nset of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.\n  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory\nprediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results\nconfirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently\nachieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate\nthe practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where\ncorner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves\npredictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making\ncapabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.\nHowever, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of\nwell-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of\ngeneralization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations\nof offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often\nstruggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,\nwe propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances\ngeneralization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method\nincorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide\npolicy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based\nprompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge\nbase to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode\ntrajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral\npatterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as\nconditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling\nthe RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods\non unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and\nadaptability in diverse settings.",

The existing shrinking methods such as Lasso-type estimation can not\nsuitably reveal such property. A new method recently suggested, called by {\\it\nsignal lasso} (or its updating version: adaptive signal lasso) was proposed to\nsolve the network reconstruction problem, where the signal parameter can be\nshrunk to either 0 or 1 in two different directions. The signal lasso or\nadaptive signal lasso employed the additive penalty of signal and non-signal\nterms which is a convex function and easily to complementation in computation.\nHowever their methods need tuning the one or two parameters to find an optimal\nsolution, which is time cost for large size network. In this paper we propose\nnew signal lasso method based on two penalty functions to estimate the signal\nparameter and uncovering network topology in complex network with a small\namount of observations. The penalty functions we introduced are non-convex\nfunction, thus coordinate descent algorithms are suggested. We find in this\nmethod the tuning parameter can be set to a large enough values such that the\nsignal parameter can be completely shrunk either 0 or 1. The extensive\nsimulations are conducted in linear regression models with different\nassumptions, the evolutionary-game-based dynamic model and Kuramoto model of\nsynchronization problem. The advantage and disadvantage of each method are\nfully discussed in various conditions. Finally a real example comes from\nbehavioral experiment is used for illustration.

Although it can be posed as\na nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of\nmodern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this\ncontext, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF.\nWe encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit\n(PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with\na second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled\nexpectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by\nminimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second\nPQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients\nof the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are\nupdated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal\nvariables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them\nto be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system\nusing Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational\nquantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions.

To explain this apparent\nparadox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is\nbetter understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein\nGradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time\nstochastic differential equation. Under this view, the \"probability flow\"\narises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke\nreverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains\nsuccessful even when the neural vector field is not a true score.

    "abstract": "Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and\npersonalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks,\nparticularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This\npaper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition\nsystem with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of\nfacial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature\nextraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We\nintroduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support\nhigher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the\nmultiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of\nthese networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face\nrecognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and\nincreases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural\nnetworks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face\nrecognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/human-analysis/CryptoFace.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time\ncompute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,\nsequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a\nsignificant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation\noffers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an\ninherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy\nitself, a phenomenon we term \"Tunnel Vision\", where a model's imperfect initial\nsteps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce\na new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an\nend-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning\npaths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By\nexploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively\nsidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning\npotential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)\nis a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling\nsequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves\nsubstantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%\nfor 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible\nlatency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger\ncounterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient\ndimension for scaling future LLMs.",

This lack of mechanistic insight is a\ncentral challenge for deploying learned policies in real-world robotics, where\nrobustness and explainability are critical. Motivated by advances in\nmechanistic interpretability for large language models, we introduce the first\nframework for interpreting and steering VLAs via their internal\nrepresentations, enabling direct intervention in model behavior at inference\ntime. We project feedforward activations within transformer layers onto the\ntoken embedding basis, identifying sparse semantic directions - such as speed\nand direction - that are causally linked to action selection.

We evaluate this method on two recent open-source\nVLAs, Pi0 and OpenVLA, and demonstrate zero-shot behavioral control in\nsimulation (LIBERO) and on a physical robot (UR5).

To that end, we developed a 6\nDegrees-of-Freedom (6DoF) magnetic tracking based gait analysis system as a\nstep in this direction. The system is portable, minimally intrusive, wireless\nand power efficient. As a proof-of-concept, the system was used for the task of\nHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) to classify four tasks - walking (W), walking\nwith weight (WW), jogging (J) and marching on the spot (M). Gait data of 12\nparticipants was collected. The classification performance of two deep learning\n(DL) classifiers - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term\nMemory (LSTM) - was compared. The performance of the magnetic tracking based\ngait analysis system was also compared with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)\n+ magnetometer based system. The magnetic tracking based system showed an\noverall classification accuracy of 92\\% compared to 86.69\\% for the IMU +\nmagnetometer system. Moreover, the magnetic tracking system showed an\nimprovement of about 8\\% in being able to differentiate between W and WW.

    "abstract": "Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including\nhigh perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and\nlimited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion\nPlanning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or\neven in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete\naction sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In\nthis paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs,\nreferred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different\nscenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph,\nwhich expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop\nmotion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence,\nTMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a\ncertain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate\nfor unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled\nautonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii)\nbounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of\nunfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative\npaths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We\nuse a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous\nrobots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of\nchallenges in the benchmarks.",

A thermodynamically consistent damage and fracture model\nfor elastomers is developed, incorporating elements of polymer chain\nstatistical mechanics. This approach enables the direct incorporation of\npolymer chain response into a continuum gradient enhanced damage formulation,\nthat in turn allows a physically meaningful description of diffuse chain damage\nand corresponding fracture events. Through a series of numerical experiments,\nwe simulate crack propagation and extract the fracture energy as an output of\nthe model, while keeping track of the micromechanical signatures of diffuse\nchain damage that accommodate fracture propagation. Furthermore, we investigate\nflaw sensitivity and demonstrate that when flaw sizes are smaller than a\ncritical length scale, the material response becomes largely insensitive to\nnotch size. Finally, by combining the fracture toughness and the work to\nrupture, we identify a fractocohesive length of the material, corresponding to\nthe full width of the damage zone and representing the region where the\nirreversible dissipation process (i.e., bond scission) is happening. As this\nregion is dictated in the proposed FED model through the introduction of a\nlength scale associated with the non-local nature of the damage and fracture\nprocess, the emerging relationship of the two length scales is discussed,\neffectively connecting the microscopic characteristics of damage to the\neffective macroscopic response.",

We\nconsider the case where it is difficult to correctly specify a single\nparametric model for the propensity scores (PS). For example, the target\npopulation is formed from heterogeneous sources with different treatment\nassignment mechanisms. We propose a novel high-dimensional empirical likelihood\nweighting method under soft covariate balancing constraints to combine multiple\nworking PS models. An extended set of calibration functions is used, and a\nregularized augmented outcome regression is developed to correct the bias due\nto non-exact covariate balancing. Those two approaches provide a new way to\nconstruct the Neyman orthogonal score of the ATE. The proposed confidence\ninterval for the ATE achieves asymptotically valid nominal coverage under\nhigh-dimensional covariates if any of the PS models, their linear combination,\nor the outcome regression model is correctly specified. The proposed method is\nextended to generalized linear models for the outcome variable. Specifically,\nwe consider estimating the ATE for data with unknown clusters, where multiple\nworking PS models can be fitted based on the estimated clusters. Our proposed\napproach enables robust inference of the ATE for clustered data.

Motivated by this, we hypothesize that\nexplicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial\norganization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are\nresilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided\nGeneralization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,\nand nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning\nframework.

Speculative decoding offers a\npromising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the\nstructured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely\nunexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM\ntest-time scaling.

This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating\nn-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance\nacceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling.

While both approaches prove\neffective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to\ndistillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation\nreveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length\nCollapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF\ntraining, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score\ndrops followed by gradual recovery.

    "abstract": "Constructing optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs that attain the Singleton-type bound\nis an active and important research direction, particularly due to their\npractical applications in distributed storage systems. In this paper, we focus\non the construction of optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs with flexible minimum\ndistances, especially for the case $\\delta \\geq 3$. We first extend a general\nframework -- originally proposed by Li \\textit{et al.} (IEEE Trans. Inf.\nTheory, vol. 65, no. 1, 2019) and Ma and Xing (J. Comb. Theory Ser. A., vol.\n193, 2023) -- for constructing optimal $r$-LRCs via automorphism groups of\nelliptic function fields to the case of $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs. This newly extended\ngeneral framework relies on certain conditions concerning the group law of\nelliptic curves. By carefully selecting elliptic function fields suitable for\nthis framework, we arrive at several families of explicit $q$-ary optimal\n$(r,3)$-LRCs and $(2,\\delta)$-LRCs with lengths slightly less than $q +\n2\\sqrt{q}$. Next, by employing automorphism groups of hyperelliptic function\nfields of genus $2$, we develop a framework for constructing optimal\n$(r,3)$-LRCs and obtain a family of explicit $q$-ary optimal $(4,3)$-LRCs with\ncode lengths slightly below $q+4\\sqrt{q}$. We then consider the construction of\noptimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs via hyperelliptic function fields of arbitrary genus\n$g \\geq 2$, yielding a class of explicit $q$-ary optimal $(g+1-g',g+1+g')$-LRCs\nfor $0 \\leq g' \\leq g-1$ with lengths up to $q + 2g\\sqrt{q}$. Finally, applying\ncertain superelliptic curves derived from modified Norm-Trace curves, we\nconstruct two families of explicit optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs with even longer\ncode lengths and more flexible parameters. Notably, many of the newly\nconstructed optimal $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs attain the largest known lengths among\nexisting constructions with flexible minimum distances.",

    "abstract": "As modern systems increasingly rely on GPUs for computationally intensive\ntasks such as machine learning acceleration, ensuring the integrity of GPU\ncomputation has become critically important. Recent studies have shown that GPU\nkernels are vulnerable to both traditional memory safety issues (e.g., buffer\noverflow attacks) and emerging microarchitectural threats (e.g., Rowhammer\nattacks), many of which manifest as anomalous execution behaviors observable\nthrough side-channel signals. However, existing golden model based validation\napproaches that rely on such signals are fragile, highly sensitive to\ninterference, and do not scale well across GPU workloads with diverse\nscheduling behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ShadowScope, a\nmonitoring and validation framework that leverages a composable golden model.\nInstead of building a single monolithic reference, ShadowScope decomposes\ntrusted kernel execution into modular, repeatable functions that encode key\nbehavioral features. This composable design captures execution patterns at\nfiner granularity, enabling robust validation that is resilient to noise,\nworkload variation, and interference across GPU workloads. To further reduce\nreliance on noisy software-only monitoring, we introduce ShadowScope+, a\nhardware-assisted validation mechanism that integrates lightweight on-chip\nchecks into the GPU pipeline. ShadowScope+ achieves high validation accuracy\nwith an average runtime overhead of just 4.6%, while incurring minimal hardware\nand design complexity. Together, these contributions demonstrate that\nside-channel observability can be systematically repurposed into a practical\ndefense for GPU kernel integrity.",

This spatiotemporal Gouy phase\ndepends on the ellipticity of the wave packets and the group velocity\ndispersion (GVD) of the media. The phase, as a function of propagation\ndistance, is categorized into three distinct regimes: normal dispersion,\nanomalous dispersion, and zero dispersion. Interestingly, in the regime of\nanomalous dispersion, the non-monotonic behavior induces to both distortion and\nrevival of the intensity distribution, thereby establishing a phase-locked\nmechanism that is analogous to the Talbot effect.",

Whereas oscillator circuits offered only one or\nvery few pulse shapes, modular cascaded power electronics solved a\nlong-standing problem for the first time and enabled arbitrary software-based\nsynthesis of the temporal shape of stimuli. However, synthesizing arbitrary\nstimuli with a high output quality requires a large number of modules. We\npropose an alternative solution that achieves high-resolution pulse shaping\nwith fewer modules by implementing high-power wide-bandwidth voltage asymmetry.\nRather than equal voltage steps, our system strategically assigns different\nvoltages to each module to achieve a near-exponential improvement in\nresolution. The module voltage sequence does also not use just a simple binary\npattern other work might suggest but adapts it to the output. Additionally, we\nintroduce a switched-capacitor charging mechanism that allows the modules to\ncharge to different voltages through a single dc power supply. We validated our\ndesign in a head-to-head comparison with the state of the art on experimental\nprototypes. Our three-module prototype reduces total voltage distortion by\n13.4% compared to prior art with three modules, and by 4.5% compared to prior\nart with six -- twice as many -- modules.

    "abstract": "Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,\nall producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used\nto identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,\nsuch as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural\ndisasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and\ndifficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for\nidentifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an\nincident, as well as understanding the different components which define an\nincident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the\ncauses of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and\nintensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create\nSIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal\nUrban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary\nworld knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in\nurban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize\nevidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and\nhuman-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This\norganized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,\nobservations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce\nreasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV\nimages, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents\noccurring at the same time and location.",

The expanding demand for\nhigh-bandwidth services and the proliferation of mega satellite constellations\nhighlight the limitations of traditional exclusive satellite spectrum\nallocation approaches. Cognitive Radio (CR) leading to Cognitive Satellite\n(CogSat) networks through Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM), which enables the\ndynamic adaptability of radio equipment to environmental conditions for optimal\nperformance, presents a promising solution for the emerging spectrum scarcity.\nIn this survey, we explore the adaptation of intelligent DSM methodologies to\nSatCom, leveraging satellite network integrations. We discuss contributions and\nhurdles in regulations and standardizations in realizing intelligent DSM in\nSatCom, and deep dive into DSM techniques, which enable CogSat networks.\nFurthermore, we extensively evaluate and categorize state-of-the-art Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) methods leveraged for DSM while\nexploring operational resilience and robustness of such integrations. In\naddition, performance evaluation metrics critical for adaptive resource\nmanagement and system optimization in CogSat networks are thoroughly\ninvestigated.

    "abstract": "Radioembolization is a localized liver cancer treatment that delivers\nradioactive microspheres (30 micron) to tumors via a catheter inserted in the\nhepatic arterial tree. The goal is to maximize therapeutic efficacy while\nminimizing damage to healthy liver tissue. However, optimization is challenging\ndue to complex hepatic artery anatomy, variable blood flow, and uncertainty in\nmicrosphere transport. The creation of dynamic, patient-specific digital twins\nmay provide a transformative solution to these challenges. This work outlines a\nframework for a liver radioembolization digital twin using high-fidelity\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or recent physics-informed machine\nlearning approaches. The CFD approach involves microsphere transport\ncalculations in the hepatic arterial tree with individual patient data, which\nenables personalized treatment planning. Although accurate, traditional CFD is\ncomputationally expensive and limits clinical applicability.\n  To accelerate simulations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their\ngenerative extensions play an increasingly important role. PINNs integrate\ngoverning equations, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, directly into the\nneural network training process, enabling mesh-free, data-efficient\napproximation of blood flow and microsphere transport. Physics-informed\ngenerative adversarial networks (PI-GANs), diffusion models (PI-DMs), and\ntransformer-based architectures further enable uncertainty-aware, temporally\nresolved predictions with reduced computational cost. These AI surrogates not\nonly maintain physical fidelity but also support rapid sampling of diverse flow\nscenarios, facilitating real-time decision support.\n  Together, CFD and physics-informed AI methods form the foundation of dynamic,\npatient-specific digital twin to optimize radioembolization planning and\nultimately improve clinical outcomes.",
