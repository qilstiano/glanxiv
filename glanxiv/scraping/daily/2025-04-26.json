Such quantities can be exponentially small, even on undirected\nunit-weighted graphs. However, their nonnegativity suggests that they can be\napproximated entrywise, leading to a stronger notion of approximation than\nvector norm-based error.\n  Under this notion of error, existing Laplacian solvers and fast matrix\nmultiplication approaches have bit complexities of $mn^2$ and $n^{\\omega+1}$,\nrespectively, where $m$ is the number of nonzero entries in the matrix, $n$ is\nits size, and $\\omega$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.\n  We present algorithms that compute entrywise $\\exp(\\epsilon)$-approximate\ninverses of row diagonally dominant $L$-matrices (RDDL) in two settings: (1)\nwhen the matrix entries are given in floating-point representation; (2) when\nthey are given in fixed-point representation.\n  For floating-point inputs, we present a cubic-time algorithm and show that it\nhas an optimal running time under the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP)\nconjecture.\n  For fixed-point inputs, we present several algorithms for solving linear\nsystems and inverting RDDL and SDDM matrices, all with high probability.\n  Omitting logarithmic factors:\n  (1) For SDDM matrices, we provide an algorithm for solving a linear system\nwith entrywise approximation guarantees using $\\tilde{O}(m\\sqrt{n})$ bit\noperations, and another for computing an entrywise approximate inverse using\n$\\tilde{O}(mn)$ bit operations.\n  (2) For RDDL matrices, we present an algorithm for solving a linear system\nusing $\\tilde{O}(mn^{1+o(1)})$ bit operations, and two algorithms for computing\nan entrywise approximate inverse: one using $\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega+0.5})$ bit\noperations, and the other using $\\tilde{O}(mn^{1.5+o(1)})$ bit operations.",

This\npaper proposes calibrating hypothesis likelihoods with translation quality from\na distribution view by directly optimizing their Pearson correlation -- thereby\nenhancing the effectiveness of translation decoding. With our method,\ntranslation on large language models (LLMs) improves substantially after\nlimited training (2K instances per direction).

Because each\nsequence-function map can be written as a weighted sum over subsequences in\nmultiple ways, meaningfully interpreting these weights requires\n``gauge-fixing,'' i.e., defining a unique representation for each map. Recent\nwork has established that most existing gauge-fixed representations arise as\nthe unique solutions to $L_2$-regularized regression in an overparameterized\n``weight space'' where the choice of regularizer defines the gauge. Here, we\nestablish the relationship between regularized regression in overparameterized\nweight space and Gaussian process approaches that operate in ``function\nspace,'' i.e.~the space of all real-valued functions on a finite set of\nsequences. We disentangle how weight space regularizers both impose an implicit\nprior on the learned function and restrict the optimal weights to a particular\ngauge. We show how to construct regularizers that correspond to arbitrary\nexplicit Gaussian process priors combined with a wide variety of gauges and\ncharacterize the implicit function space priors associated with the most common\nweight space regularizers.

The recently introduced Graph Language Model (GLM) offers\na way to simultaneously process graph-structured data and text. This paper\nproposes GLaMoR (Graph Language Model for Reasoning), a reasoning pipeline that\ntransforms OWL ontologies into graph-structured data and adapts the GLM\narchitecture for consistency checking. We evaluate GLaMoR on ontologies from\nthe NCBO BioPortal repository, converting them into triples suitable for model\ninput. Our results show that the GLM outperforms all baseline models, achieving\n$95\\%$ accuracy while being 20 times faster than classical reasoners.\n  The Code is accessible under: https://github.com/JustinMuecke/GLaMoR",

    "abstract": "We consider a class of stochastic interdiction games between an upper-level\ndecision-maker (referred to as a leader) and a lower-level decision-maker\n(referred to as a follower), where uncertainty lies in the follower's objective\nfunction coefficients. Specifically, the follower's profits (or costs) in our\nmodel comprise a random vector, whose probability distribution is estimated\nindependently by the leader and the follower, based on their own data. To\naddress the distributional uncertainty, we formulate a distributionally robust\ninterdiction (DRI) model, where both decision-makers solve conventional\ndistributionally robust optimization problems based on the Wasserstein metric.\nFor this model, we prove asymptotic consistency and derive a polynomial-size\nmixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reformulation. Furthermore, in our\nbilevel optimization context, the leader may face uncertainty due to its\nincomplete knowledge of the follower's data. In this regard, we propose two\ndistinct approximations of the true DRI model, where the leader has incomplete\nor no information about the follower's data. The first approach employs a\npessimistic approximation, which turns out to be computationally challenging\nand requires the design of a specialized Benders decomposition algorithm. The\nsecond approach leverages a robust optimization approach from the leader's\nperspective. To address the resulting problem, we propose a scenario-based\nouter approximation that admits a potentially large single-level MILP\nreformulation and satisfies asymptotic robustness guarantees. Finally, for a\nclass of randomly generated instances of the packing interdiction problem, we\nevaluate numerically how the information asymmetry and the decision-makers'\nrisk preferences affect the models' out-of-sample performance.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) align with societal\nstandards is of increasing interest, as these models are still prone to\nadversarial jailbreaks that bypass their safety mechanisms. Identifying these\nvulnerabilities is crucial for enhancing the robustness of LLMs against such\nexploits. We propose Graph of ATtacks (GoAT), a method for generating\nadversarial prompts to test the robustness of LLM alignment using the Graph of\nThoughts framework [Besta et al., 2024]. GoAT excels at generating highly\neffective jailbreak prompts with fewer queries to the victim model than\nstate-of-the-art attacks, achieving up to five times better jailbreak success\nrate against robust models like Llama. Notably, GoAT creates high-quality,\nhuman-readable prompts without requiring access to the targeted model's\nparameters, making it a black-box attack. Unlike approaches constrained by\ntree-based reasoning, GoAT's reasoning is based on a more intricate graph\nstructure. By making simultaneous attack paths aware of each other's progress,\nthis dynamic framework allows a deeper integration and refinement of reasoning\npaths, significantly enhancing the collaborative exploration of adversarial\nvulnerabilities in LLMs. At a technical level, GoAT starts with a graph\nstructure and iteratively refines it by combining and improving thoughts,\nenabling synergy between different thought paths.

This method\nextends to class functions of $G \\wr S_n$ where $G$ is a finite abelian group.\nWe give a number of applications, including decomposing tensor powers of the\ndefining representation, along with a combinatorial proof of the\nMurnaghan-Nakayama rule for $Z_k \\wr S_n$.\n  Our main application is to the study of the linear action of $Z_k \\wr S_n$ on\nbigraded affine semigroup algebras arising from the product of projective toric\nvarieties. In the case of the product of projective spaces, our methods give\nthe decomposition of these bigraded characters into irreducible characters,\nthus deriving equivariant generalizations of Euler-Mahonian identities.",

    "abstract": "Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to\ngrowing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer\na fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a\ncomplex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external\nenvironments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it\ncrucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems\nobeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning\nframework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased\nattention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic\nuncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between\nthe cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using\nthis, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly\nfrom the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a\nTUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other\nmethods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions\nfor previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to\nper-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far\nfrom its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is\nstraightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy\nproduction estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between\ndiffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in\nstochastic thermodynamics.",

    "abstract": "In decentralized optimization over networks, synchronizing the updates of all\nnodes incurs significant communication overhead. For this reason, much of the\nrecent literature has focused on the analysis and design of asynchronous\noptimization algorithms where nodes can activate anytime and contact a single\nneighbor to complete an iteration together. However, most works assume that the\nneighbor selection is done at random based on a fixed probability distribution\n(e.g., uniform), a choice that ignores the optimization landscape at the moment\nof activation. Instead, in this work we introduce an optimization-aware\nselection rule that chooses the neighbor providing the highest dual cost\nimprovement (a quantity related to a dualization of the problem based on\nconsensus). This scheme is related to the coordinate descent (CD) method with\nthe Gauss-Southwell (GS) rule for coordinate updates; in our setting however,\nonly a subset of coordinates is accessible at each iteration (because each node\ncan communicate only with its neighbors), so the existing literature on GS\nmethods does not apply. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a new\nanalytical framework for smooth and strongly convex functions that covers our\nnew class of setwise CD algorithms -- a class that applies to both\ndecentralized and parallel distributed computing scenarios -- and we show that\nthe proposed setwise GS rule can speed up the convergence in terms of\niterations by a factor equal to the size of the largest coordinate set. We\nanalyze extensions of these algorithms that exploit the knowledge of the\nsmoothness constants when available and otherwise propose an algorithm to\nestimate these constants. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through\nextensive simulations.",

In\naddition to altering the nonlinear properties, the Mo layer caused a\nsignificant increase in the critical current at low temperatures (up to 2 times\nin the case of a 5 nm thick Mo layer). The increased nonlinearity of $L_k$ can\nbe explained by two factors: i) a reduction of the critical supervelocity at\nwhich the superconducting state becomes unstable with respect to vortex\nformation when a Mo layer is deposited on NbN, and ii) a higher sensitivity of\nthe induced superconductivity in Mo to supervelocity/supercurrent.

Specifically, candidate models are\nassociated with a set of coefficients that linearly scale their fine-tuned\nparameters. Bayesian optimization is applied to dynamically adjust these\ncoefficients, aiming to maximize overall performance on validation sets. Each\niteration of this process integrates parameter importance based on the Fisher\ninformation conditioned by the coefficients. Experimental results show that\nDF-Merge outperforms strong baselines across models of different sizes and a\nvariety of tasks. Our analysis shows that the effectiveness of DF-Merge arises\nfrom the unified view of merging and that near-optimal performance is\nachievable in a few iterations, even with minimal validation data.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous waves are ubiquitous during early brain development and are\nhypothesized to drive the development of receptive fields (RFs). Different\nstages of spontaneous waves in the retina have been observed to coincide with\nthe development of the retinotopic map, ON-OFF segregation, and orientation\nselectivity in the early visual pathway of mammals, and can be characterized by\ndifferent activity patterns in the retina and downstream areas. Stage II waves,\nwhich occur in rodents right after birth, have been implicated in a possible\nsynaptic pruning process, relating these stage II retinal waves to the\nrefinement of the retinotopic map. However, the mechanisms underlying the\nactivity-dependent effects of retinal waves on synapses into the primary visual\ncortex (V1) are poorly understood. In this work, we build a\nbiologically-constrained model of the development of thalamocortical synapses\nof V1 cells driven by stage II retinal waves using a spike-timing dependent\ntriplet learning rule. Using this model, together with a reduced rate-based\nmodel, we propose mechanisms underlying such a pruning process and predict how\ncharacteristics of the retinal waves may lead to different RF structures,\nincluding periodic RFs. We introduce gap junctions into the V1 network and show\nthat such a coupling can serve to promote precise local retinotopy. Finally, we\ndiscuss how the spatial distribution of synaptic weights at the end of stage II\nmay affect the emergence of orientation selectivity of V1 neurons during stage\nIII waves. The mechanisms uncovered in this work may be useful in understanding\nsynaptic structures that emerge across cortical regions during development.",

    "abstract": "While latent diffusion models achieve impressive image editing results, their\napplication to iterative editing of the same image is severely restricted. When\ntrying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they\naccumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and\nlatent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by\nperforming the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing\nflexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion\nediting operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even\nafter many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing:\nusers can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation\nbuilding on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based\noperations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of\nREED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and\nmask-based editing frameworks. In addition, we show how REED-VAE enhances the\noverall editability of images, increasing the likelihood of successful and\nprecise edit operations.

However, in numerical\ncalculations often compactified coordinates in the physical space are used to\nreach these infinities. In this note, we discuss the conformal Einstein\nequations in spherical symmetry coupled to a massless scalar field and compare\nthem with corresponding equations using a compactified coordinate in physical\nspacetime. The derivation of the field equations is based on metrics, in which\nthe radial coordinate is an affine parameter along outgoing null rays. We show\nthat the conformal equations within an affine-null metric formulation can be\ncast in a natural hierarchical form after the introduction of suitable\nauxiliary fields. The system of partial differential equations associated with\nthe resulting (unphysical) conformal field equations proves to be identical to\na system that employs a compactified coordinate in physical space along with\nwell-constructed regularized fields. The reason for this equivalence is the\nintroduction of new regularized fields in the physical spacetime after\ncoordinate compactification to obtain a regular system of equations on the\ncomplete domain of the compactified coordinate. As part of this work, we also\npresent the solution of the conformal field equations in affine-null\ncoordinates near the conformal boundary, where the Bondi mass loss formula for\na massless scalar field is recovered.

However, there is currently no consensus\non the mechanism driving this effect. In this work, we explore whether the\ninterplay between AGN activity and the Ram Pressure Stripping (RPS) can\ninfluence the metallicity distributions of nearby (z < 0.07) galaxies. To this\naim, we measure the spatially resolved gas-phase oxygen abundances of 10\nstripped AGN hosts from the GASP survey, as well as 52 AGN hosts found in the\nfield, which are undisturbed by the effects of ram pressure, drawn from the\nMaNGA DR15. We find that the metal distributions in these two samples do not\ndiffer significantly. Only 2 out of the 10 RP-stripped AGNs present lower\noxygen abundances at any given radius than the rest of the AGN sample. Overall,\nthis result highlights that the AGN-RPS interplay does not play a significant\nrole in shaping the metallicity distributions of stripped galaxies within 1.5\ntimes the galaxy's effective radius (r < 1.5 Re). However, larger samples are\nrequired to draw more definitive conclusions. By including a control sample of\nSF galaxies, we observe that the AGN hosts are more metal-enriched than SF\ngalaxies at any given radius. More than that, the steepness of the gradients in\nthe nuclear regions (r < 0.5 Re) is greater in AGN hosts than in SF galaxies.\nThese results favor the hypothesis that the AGN activity is causing metal\npollution in the galaxy's nuclear regions.",

Existing emotion\nrecognition datasets often rely on limited modalities or controlled conditions,\nthereby missing the richness and variability found in real-world scenarios.\n  In this work, we introduce Advancing Face-to-Face Emotion Communication\n(AFFEC), a multimodal dataset designed to address these gaps.

The adoption of sparse proposals streamlines the pipeline by\neliminating the need for proposal generators and post-processing for\noverlapping predictions. The proposed BAPs enrich object representation by\nintegrating ship and background features, allowing the model to learn their\ncontextual relationships for more accurate distinction of ships in complex\nenvironments. To complement BAPs, we propose Dual-Context Pooling (DCP), a\nnovel strategy that jointly extracts ship and background features in a single\nunified operation. This unified design improves efficiency by eliminating\nredundant computation inherent in separate pooling. Moreover, by ensuring that\nship and background features are pooled from the same feature map level, DCP\nprovides aligned features that improve contextual relationship learning.\nFinally, as a core component of contextual relationship learning in R-Sparse\nR-CNN, we design a dedicated transformer-based Interaction Module. This module\ninteracts pooled ship and background features with corresponding proposal\nfeatures and models their relationships. Experimental results show that\nR-Sparse R-CNN delivers outstanding accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art\nmodels by margins of up to 12.8% and 11.9% on SSDD and RSDD-SAR inshore\ndatasets, respectively.

Motivated by empirical evidence of regime-dependent volatility behavior\nand perceptual time dilation during financial crises, we develop a\nregime-switching framework based on the Modified Lognormal Power-Law\ndistribution. Analysis of the FCIX from January 1990 to December 2023\nidentifies three distinct market regimes, low-chaos, intermediate-chaos, and\nhigh-chaos, each characterized by differing levels of systemic stress,\nstatistical dispersion and persistence characteristics. Building upon the\nsegmented regime structure, we further examine the informational forces that\nshape forward-looking market expectations. Using sentiment-based predictors\nderived from the Equity Market Volatility tracker, we employ an elastic net\nregression model to forecast implied volatility, as proxied by the VIX index.\nOur findings indicate that shifts in macroeconomic, financial, policy, and\ngeopolitical uncertainty exhibit strong predictive power for volatility\ndynamics across regimes.

A\ncombination of two mitigating approaches has been considered in the literature:\ni) to use hybrid beamforming to reduce the number of ADCs, and ii) to use\nlow-resolution ADCs to reduce per ADC power consumption. Lowering the number\nand resolution of the ADCs naturally reduces the communication rate of the\nsystem, leading to a tradeoff between ADC power consumption and communication\nrate. Prior works have shown that optimizing over the hybrid beamforming matrix\nand ADC thresholds may reduce the aforementioned rate-loss significantly.

This research addresses\nthese gaps, focusing on Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) as a highly\nnon-linear procedure. Methods: Urologists of varying expertise were grouped and\ntasked to indicate the surgical phase for RAPN on both single frames and video\nsnippets using a custom-made web platform. Participants reported their\nconfidence levels and the visual landmarks used in their decision-making. AI\narchitectures without and with temporal context as trained and benchmarked on\nthe Cholec80 dataset were subsequently trained on this RAPN dataset. Results:\nVideo snippets and presence of specific visual landmarks improved phase\nclassification accuracy across all groups. Surgeons displayed high confidence\nin their classifications and outperformed novices, who struggled discriminating\nphases. The performance of the AI models is comparable to the surgeons in the\nsurvey, with improvements when temporal context was incorporated in both cases.\nConclusion: SPR is an inherently complex task for expert surgeons and computer\nvision, where both perform equally well when given the same context.\nPerformance increases when temporal information is provided.

    "abstract": "Ensuring the safe operation of aerospace systems within their prescribed\nflight envelope is a fundamental requirement for modern flight control systems.\nFlight envelope protection prevents violations of aerodynamic, structural, and\nperformance constraints, mitigating risks such as stall, excessive loads, and\nloss of control. Conventional FEP approaches, such as reference clipping via\nsaturation functions and model-based command filtering, impose constraints at\nthe reference input level but often fail to account for closed-loop system\ndynamics, potentially leading to constraint violations during transients. This\npaper introduces a new approach to the flight envelope protection problem by\nemploying a quadratic programming-based safety filter using control barrier\nfunctions to dynamically enforce flight envelope constraints while preserving\ncontrol performance. Unlike traditional reference filtering methods, the\ncontrol barrier function-based safety filter actively ensures strict forward\ninvariance of the safe flight envelope set, integrating seamlessly with\nexisting control architectures. The proposed framework is implemented in a\nnonlinear missile flight control system and evaluated in a simulated\nenvironment. The results demonstrate its ability to prevent constraint\nviolations while minimizing conservatism, offering a robust alternative to\nexisting flight envelope protection methodologies.",

With this in mind we consider several passages from\nWittgenstein's published as well as unpublished writings to build a whole\npicture of a formal counterpart to 'meaning is use' based on the idea that\nexplanations of consequences via 'movements within language' ought to be taken\nas a central aspect to Wittgenstein's shift from 'interpretation of symbols in\na state of affairs' to 'use of symbols' which underpins his 'meaning is use'\nparadigm. As in the Investigations \"every interpretation hangs in the air\ntogether with what it interprets, and cannot give it any support.\nInterpretations by themselves do not determine meaning\", as well as in a remark\nfrom his transitional period (1929-30): \"Perhaps one should say that the\nexpression 'interpretation of symbols' is misleading and one should instead say\n'the use of symbols'.\" Significantly, we wish the present examination of the\nsearchable Nachlass can make a relevant step towards a formal counterpart to\nthe 'meaning is use' dictum, while highlighting an important common thread from\nWittgenstein's very early to very late writings.",

Additionally, current simulation platforms face challenges in dynamic\npedestrian modeling, scene editability, and synchronization between virtual and\nreal assets. These limitations hinder real world robot deployment and feedback.\nTo address these challenges, we propose DVS (Dynamic Virtual-Real Simulation\nPlatform), a platform for dynamic virtual-real synchronization in mobile\nrobotic tasks. DVS integrates a random pedestrian behavior modeling plugin and\nlarge-scale, customizable indoor scenes for generating annotated training\ndatasets.

Experimental validation shows that DVS supports tasks such as\npedestrian trajectory prediction, robot path planning, and robotic arm\ngrasping, with potential for both simulation and real world deployment. In this\nway, DVS represents more than just a versatile robotic platform; it paves the\nway for research in human intervention in robot execution tasks and real-time\nfeedback algorithms in virtual-real fusion environments.

We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode\ncauses the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further\nenhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our\nstudy also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production,\ngravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly\nmodify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space\nwhere superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid\nGW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those\nachieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that\nmultiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM\nproduction from PBHs in the early universe.",

    "abstract": "We study the dynamics of a binary system orbiting a rotating supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH). Using Fermi-Walker transport, we construct a local inertial\nreference frame in the Kerr spacetime and set up a Newtonian binary system.\nAssuming the binary moves on a spherical orbit with constant radius around the\nblack hole, we derive the equations of motion governing its dynamics.\n  We focus on von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) oscillations, which arise when the\nbinary is compact and its initial inclination exceeds a critical angle. In our\nprevious work on a circular orbit in the equatorial plane, we found that for\nhard binary systems, these oscillations in eccentricity and inclination follow\na regular pattern, whereas in soft binaries, they exhibit chaotic behavior with\nirregular periods and amplitudes, yet remain stable.\n  In this study, we extend our analysis to a spherical orbit in the Kerr\nbackground. The libration of the binary's orbit in the latitudinal direction\naffects the vZLK oscillations: as the libration angle increases, the\noscillation period shortens, and the maximum eccentricity grows, particularly\nwhen the oscillations become chaotic. Notably, when the binary is sufficiently\nsoft yet remains stable, the oscillation period is reduced to the dynamical\ntimescale rather than the secular timescale. This effect arises due to the\ninteraction between the SMBH spin and the binary's angular momentum. As the\nKerr rotation parameter increases or the radius of the spherical orbit\ndecreases, both the enhancement of maximum eccentricity and the reduction in\noscillation period become more pronounced.",

    "abstract": "Compression has been a critical lens to understand the success of\nTransformers. In the past, we have typically taken the target distribution as a\ncriterion to evaluate a model's compression performance. Nevertheless,it often\nremains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression\nand to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of\nthe target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is\ntypically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In\nthis work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We\nfind that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression:\nbeyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning\nlower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the\nmodel size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly\naligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its\ninformation content. Furthermore, we show that the FFN module plays a critical\nrole in driving this bias. In addition, while models remove informational\nredundancy from data during compression, they also exhibit redundancy within\ntheir parameters, which enables compression and can be characterized through\ndynamic sparsity. However, the dynamic sparsity patterns in Transformers,\nparticularly in attention and FFN modules, demand further exploration. As for\nthis, we show that larger Transformers show stronger preferences for bypassing\nattention computations via residual connections and have lower proportion of\nactive neurons. Interestingly, we also find that training instability in larger\nmodels strongly correlates with sudden increases in dead neurons. Our work\ncontributes to a deeper understanding of Transformers from the lens of entropy\nand dynamic sparsity.",

For the first time, a dedicated temporal and\nspectral study of the blazar 4C +27.50 has been performed in this work to\nunderstand the nature of this object. We used the Bayesian block algorithm to\nidentify four flaring states and one quiet state in the 2-year-long Fermi-LAT\nlight curve. Simultaneous broadband flaring episodes have been observed, and a\nsignificant correlation is seen between optical and $\\gamma$-ray emission,\nsuggesting the co-spatial origin of the broadband emission. The variation of\nfractional variability amplitude with respect to frequency shows a nearly\ndouble hump structure similar to broadband SED. The fastest flux doubling time\nin the 1-day binned $\\gamma$-ray light curve is found to be about 7.8 hours. A\ncurvature in $\\gamma$-ray spectra has been observed, possibly caused by a\nstochastic particle acceleration process rather than radiative cooling. No\nevident correlation was found in the $\\gamma$-ray flux-index plot, but a clear\nharder-when-brighter trend is observed in the X-ray flux-index plot. A one-zone\nleptonic model has been implemented to understand broadband emission during the\nquiet and flaring states, and the variation of the jet parameters is been\ninvestigated. A gradual increment in BLR and Disk energy density has been\nobserved from a quiet to the flaring state. Broadband SED modeling suggested\nthat an enhancement in the magnetic field, particle energy, and bulk Lorentz\nfactor might have caused the flaring events.",

Building upon the established deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) method, our approach decomposes 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and a\ncanonical 3DGS component, which are then compressed using Neural Voxel\nContextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC),\nrespectively.

Next,\nwe employ a codebook to store spherical harmonics information from canonical\n3DGS as quantized vectors, which are then losslessly compressed by using VQCC\nwith the auxiliary learned hyperpriors for contextual coding, thereby reducing\nredundancy within the codebook. By integrating NVCC and VQCC, our contextual\ncoding framework, 4DGS-CC, enables multi-rate 4DGS data compression tailored to\nspecific storage requirements.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the state reconstruction problem for discrete-time\ncyber-physical systems when some of the sensors can be arbitrarily corrupted by\nmalicious attacks where the attacked sensors belong to an unknown set. We first\nprove that the state is $s$-error correctable if the system under consideration\nis $s$-sparse observable where $s$ denotes the maximum number of attacked\nsensors. Then, two state reconstruction methods are presented where the first\nmethod is based on searching elements with the same value in a set and the\nsecond method is developed in terms of searching element satisfying a given\ncondition. In addition, after establishing and analyzing the conditions that\nthe proposed state reconstruction methods are not effective, we address that it\nis very hard to prevent the state reconstruction when either state\nreconstruction method proposed in this paper is used. The correctness and\neffectiveness of the proposed methods are examined via an example of\nfour-dimensional dynamic systems and a real-world example of three-inertia\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Pattern matching is a popular feature in functional, imperative and\nobject-oriented programming languages. Language designers should therefore\ninvest effort in a good design for pattern matching. Most languages choose a\nfirst-match semantics for pattern matching; that is, clauses are tried in the\norder in which they appear in the program until the first one matches. As a\nconsequence, the order in which the clauses appear cannot be arbitrarily\nchanged, which results in a less declarative programming model. The declarative\nalternative to this is an order-independent semantics for pattern matching,\nwhich is not implemented in most programming languages since it requires more\nverbose patterns. The reason for this verbosity is that the syntax of patterns\nis usually not expressive enough to express the complement of a pattern. In\nthis paper, we show a principled way to make order-independent pattern matching\npractical. Our solution consists of two parts: First, we introduce a boolean\nalgebra of patterns which can express the complement of a pattern. Second, we\nintroduce default clauses to pattern matches. These default clauses capture the\nessential idea of a fallthrough case without sacrificing the property of\norder-independence.",

Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware\nML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate\nindependently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to\nthe lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in\nbalancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a\nthird-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel\nFL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable.\nAlternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local\nmodels directly, which requires significant computational resources for\nvalidation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and\nresource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we\ndevelop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called UnifyFL, which uses\ndecentralized orchestration and distributed storage. UnifyFL provides\nflexibility to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and\nasynchronous modes to handle stragglers.

We show simulations of a proposed device that\ngives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated\nreadout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave\ntone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a\nsingle long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the\nstate of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit\ncoupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot\nreadout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the\ninterface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of\nbounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially\ncomputed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the\ncircuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three\ndegrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each\nLJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed\nquantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics.\nCalculations give backaction on the qubit at $\\leq 0.1\\%$.",

Several studies propose robust\nwatermarking methods to track the copyright of Screen-Camera (SC) images,\nfacilitating post-hoc certification against infringement. These techniques\ntypically employ heuristic mathematical modeling or supervised neural network\nfitting as the noise layer, to enhance watermarking robustness against SC.\nHowever, both strategies cannot fundamentally achieve an effective\napproximation of SC noise. Mathematical simulation suffers from biased\napproximations due to the incomplete decomposition of the noise and the absence\nof interdependence among the noise components. Supervised networks require\npaired data to train the noise-fitting model, and it is difficult for the model\nto learn all the features of the noise. To address the above issues, we propose\nSimulation-to-Real (S2R). Specifically, an unsupervised noise layer employs\nunpaired data to learn the discrepancy between the modeled simulated noise\ndistribution and the real-world SC noise distribution, rather than directly\nlearning the mapping from sharp images to real-world images. Learning this\ntransformation from simulation to reality is inherently simpler, as it\nprimarily involves bridging the gap in noise distributions, instead of the\ncomplex task of reconstructing fine-grained image details.

VNFs are software-based\ncounterparts of traditional hardware devices that facilitate flexible and\nscalable service provisioning. Service Function Chains (SFCs), structured as\nordered sequences of VNFs, are pivotal in orchestrating complex network\nservices. Nevertheless, partitioning SFCs across multi-domain network\ninfrastructures presents substantial challenges due to stringent latency\nconstraints and limited resource availability. Conventional optimization-based\nmethods typically exhibit low scalability, whereas existing data-driven\napproaches often fail to adequately balance computational efficiency with the\ncapability to effectively account for dependencies inherent in SFCs.

Both integrated\nplanning and innovative technologies are needed to radically reduce adverse\nenvironmental impacts and enhance sustainability across transport, waste,\nwater, and communication sectors.",

The I/O relation plays a crucial role in performance evaluation and\nalgorithm development for transceiver implementation. In this paper, we derive\ndiscrete DD domain closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise\ncovariance in Zak-OTFS. We derive these expressions for sinc and Gaussian pulse\nshaping DD filters at the transmitter (Tx). On the receiver (Rx) side, three\ntypes of DD filters are considered, viz., $(i)$ Rx filter identical to Tx\nfilter (referred to as `identical filtering'), $(ii)$ Rx filter matched to the\nTx filter (referred to as `matched filtering'), and $(iii)$ Rx filter matched\nto both Tx filter and channel response (referred to as `channel matched\nfiltering'). For all the above cases, except for the case of sinc identical\nfiltering, we derive exact I/O relation and noise covariance expressions in\nclosed-form. For the sinc identical filtering case, we derive approximate\nclosed-form expressions which are shown to be accurate. Using the derived\nclosed-form expressions, we evaluate the bit error performance of Zak-OTFS for\ndifferent Tx/Rx filter configurations.

In the second stage, we\ntrain a model named CAN-D, which utilizes an isotonic output layer to directly\nmodel uplift effects, thereby eliminating the reliance on the regularization\ncomponents. CAN-D adaptively corrects the errors estimated by CAN-U through\nreinforcing the factual samples, while avoiding the negative impacts associated\nwith the aforementioned regularizations. Additionally, we introduce a\nContext-Aware Attention Layer throughout the two-stage process to manage the\ninteractions between treatment, merchant, and contextual features, thereby\nmodeling the varying treatment effect in different contexts. We conduct\nextensive experiments on two real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness\nof TSCAN. Ultimately, the deployment of our model for real-world merchant\ndiagnosis on one of China's largest online food ordering platforms validates\nits practical utility and impact.",

To\nincentivize the agents to participate, the principal assigns each agent $i\\in\nS$ a share $\\rho_i\\in [0,1]$ of the project's final value (i.e., designs $n$\nlinear contracts). The shares must be feasible -- their sum should not exceed\n$1$. It is well-understood how to design these contracts to maximize the\nprincipal's own expected utility, but what if the goal is to coordinate the\nagents toward maximizing social welfare?\n  We initiate a systematic study of multi-agent contract design with objectives\nbeyond principal's utility, including welfare maximization, for various classes\nof value functions $f$. Our exploration reveals an arguably surprising fact: If\n$f$ is up to XOS in the complement-free hierarchy of functions, then the\noptimal principal's utility is a constant-fraction of the optimal welfare. This\nis in stark contrast to the much larger welfare-utility gaps in auction design,\nand no longer holds above XOS in the hierarchy, where the gap can be unbounded.\n  A constant bound on the welfare-utility gap immediately implies that existing\nalgorithms for designing contracts with approximately-optimal principal's\nutility also guarantee approximately-optimal welfare. The downside of reducing\nwelfare to utility is the loss of large constants. To obtain better guarantees,\nwe develop polynomial-time algorithms directly for welfare, for different\nclasses of value functions. These include a tight $2$-approximation to the\noptimal welfare for symmetric XOS functions.\n  Finally, we extend our analysis beyond welfare to the project's value under\ngeneral feasibility constraints.

Mainly, two effects are further taken into\naccount: strange quark and confinement coded through Polyakov loop. Model\nparameters are chosen to consistently reproduce the pseudocritical temperature\nfrom lattice QCD, $T_{\\rm C}\\sim 156~ {\\rm MeV}$, and the baryon chemical\npotential at the critical end point (CEP) from FRG-QCD, $\\mu_{\\rm B(CEP)}\\sim\n635~ {\\rm MeV}$.

Thus, the FRG-QCD results can still not be well\nunderstood, especially why the CEP should locate at the entrances of moat\nregimes for $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ mesons. Nevertheless, some basic features can be\nunderstood qualitatively, and it is consistent that the pole energies are\nincreasing functions of momenta in the whole $T-\\mu_{\\rm B}$ plane.

In\nthe finite case, an analogous extension was introduced by this author; this is\na rather special case, but no monotonicity was assumed. In this note we show\nthat Choquet's integral formula can be applied to all submodular setfunctions,\nand the resulting functional is still convex.

Although Latent Adversarial Training (LAT) attempts to\nimprove robustness by introducing noise during training, a key question\nremains: How does this noise-based training affect the underlying\nrepresentation of refusal behavior? Understanding this encoding is crucial for\nevaluating LAT's effectiveness and limitations, just as the discovery of linear\nrefusal directions revealed vulnerabilities in traditional supervised safety\nfine-tuning (SSFT).\n  Through the analysis of Llama 2 7B, we examine how LAT reorganizes the\nrefusal behavior in the model's latent space compared to SSFT and embedding\nspace adversarial training (AT). By computing activation differences between\nharmful and harmless instruction pairs and applying Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD), we find that LAT significantly alters the refusal\nrepresentation, concentrating it in the first two SVD components which explain\napproximately 75 percent of the activation differences variance - significantly\nhigher than in reference models. This concentrated representation leads to more\neffective and transferable refusal vectors for ablation attacks: LAT models\nshow improved robustness when attacked with vectors from reference models but\nbecome more vulnerable to self-generated vectors compared to SSFT and AT.

    "abstract": "In their final stages before undergoing a core-collapse supernova, massive\nstars may experience mergers between internal shells where carbon (C) and\noxygen (O) are consumed as fuels for nuclear burning. This interaction, known\nas a C-O shell merger, can dramatically alter the internal structure of the\nstar, leading to peculiar nucleosynthesis and potentially influencing the\nsupernova explosion and the propagation of the subsequent supernova shock. Our\nunderstanding of the frequency and consequences of C-O shell mergers remains\nlimited. This study aims to identify for the first time early diagnostics in\nthe stellar structure which will lead to C-O shell mergers in more advanced\nstages. We also assess their role in shaping the chemical abundances in the\nmost metal poor stars of the Galaxy. We analyze a set of 209 of stellar\nevolution models available in the literature, with different initial progenitor\nmasses and metallicities. We then compare the nucleosynthetic yields from a\nsubset of these models with the abundances of odd-Z elements in metal-poor\nstars. We find that the occurrence of C-O shell mergers in stellar models can\nbe predicted with good approximation based on the outcomes of the central He\nburning phase, specifically, from the CO core mass ($\\rm M_{CO}$) and the $\\rm\n^{12}C$ central mass fraction ($\\rm X_{C12}$): 90$\\%$ of models with a C-O\nmerger have $\\rm X_{C12}< 0.277$ and $\\rm M_{CO}< 4.90 M_{\\odot}$, with average\nvalues $\\rm M_{CO} = 4.02 M_{\\odot}$ and $\\rm X_{C12}= 0.176$. Additionally, we\nconfirm that the Sc-rich and K-rich yields from models with C-O mergers would\nsolve the long-standing underproduction of these elements in massive stars. Our\nresults emphasize the crucial role of C-O shell mergers in enriching the\ninterstellar medium, particularly in the production of odd-Z elements.",

At the Ising criticality, we\nobserve two percolation transitions as $p$ increases: starting from a\ndisordered phase with only small clusters, the percolation system enters into a\nstable critical phase that persists over a wide range $p_{c_1} < p < p_{c_2}$,\nand then develops a long-ranged percolation order with giant clusters for both\nup and down spins.

It provides\nan evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how\nreliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o).\n  Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data\nfrom academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025.\nFactual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were\ngrouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error\ndistributions.\n  Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions.

    "abstract": "Stress analysis is an important part of material design. For materials with\ncomplex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material\nfailure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in\ntwo-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the\nprediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical\nengineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are\nlimited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep\nlearning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions.\nExisting Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven\nsupervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints,\nwhich provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed\na stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed\nMultiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution\nmaterial microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the\nmicrostructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive\nprediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed\nNeural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed.

    "abstract": "Material stress analysis is a critical aspect of material design and\nperformance optimization. Under dynamic loading, the global stress evolution in\nmaterials exhibits complex spatiotemporal characteristics, especially in\ntwo-phase random materials (TRMs). Such kind of material failure is often\nassociated with stress concentration, and the phase boundaries are key\nlocations where stress concentration occurs. In practical engineering\napplications, the spatiotemporal resolution of acquired microstructural data\nand its dynamic stress evolution is often limited. This poses challenges for\ndeep learning methods in generating high-resolution spatiotemporal stress\nfields, particularly for accurately capturing stress concentration regions. In\nthis study, we propose a framework for global stress generation and\nspatiotemporal super-resolution in TRMs under dynamic loading. First, we\nintroduce a diffusion model-based approach, named as Spatiotemporal Stress\nDiffusion (STS-diffusion), for generating global spatiotemporal stress data.\nThis framework incorporates Space-Time U-Net (STU-net), and we systematically\ninvestigate the impact of different attention positions on model accuracy.\nNext, we develop a physics-informed network for spatiotemporal\nsuper-resolution, termed as Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Physics-Informed\nOperator (ST-SRPINN). The proposed ST-SRPINN is an unsupervised learning\nmethod. The influence of data-driven and physics-informed loss function weights\non model accuracy is explored in detail. Benefiting from physics-based\nconstraints, ST-SRPINN requires only low-resolution stress field data during\ntraining and can upscale the spatiotemporal resolution of stress fields to\narbitrary magnifications.",

Traditional gradient descent\nmethods often suffer from oscillatory updates and slow convergence in\nhigh-dimensional, noisy landscapes. TFGD addresses these limitations by\nincorporating a tempered memory mechanism, where historical gradients are\nweighted by fractional coefficients $|w_j| = \\binom{\\alpha}{j}$ and\nexponentially decayed via a tempering parameter $\\lambda$. Theoretical analysis\nestablishes TFGD's convergence guarantees: in convex settings, it achieves an\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ rate with alignment coefficient $d_{\\alpha,\\lambda} = (1 -\ne^{-\\lambda})^{-\\alpha}$, while stochastic variants attain\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/k^\\alpha)$ error decay. The algorithm maintains $\\mathcal{O}(n)$\ntime complexity equivalent to SGD, with memory overhead scaling as\n$\\mathcal{O}(d/\\lambda)$ for parameter dimension $d$. Empirical validation on\nthe Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset demonstrates TFGD's superiority, achieving\n98.25\\% test accuracy (vs. 92.11\\% for SGD) and 2$\\times$ faster convergence.\nThe tempered memory mechanism proves particularly effective in medical\nclassification tasks, where feature correlations benefit from stable gradient\naveraging.

To keep\npace with the status quo, this survey probes the core challenges that the rise\nof LLMs poses for evaluation. We identify and analyze two pivotal transitions:\n(i) from task-specific to capability-based evaluation, which reorganizes\nbenchmarks around core competencies such as knowledge, reasoning, instruction\nfollowing, multi-modal understanding, and safety; and (ii) from manual to\nautomated evaluation, encompassing dynamic dataset curation and\n\"LLM-as-a-judge\" scoring.\n  Yet, even with these transitions, a crucial obstacle persists: the evaluation\ngeneralization issue. Bounded test sets cannot scale alongside models whose\nabilities grow seemingly without limit. We will dissect this issue, along with\nthe core challenges of the above two transitions, from the perspectives of\nmethods, datasets, evaluators, and metrics.

    "abstract": "The combinatorial approach to knot theory treats knots as diagrams modulo\nReidemeister moves. Many constructions of knot invariants (e.g., index\npolynomials, quandle colorings, etc.) use elements of diagrams such as arcs and\ncrossings by assigning invariant labels to them. The universal invariant\nlabels, which carry the most information, can be thought of as equivalence\nclasses of arcs and crossings modulo the relation, which identifies\ncorresponding elements of diagrams connected by a Reidemeister move. We can\ncall these equivalence classes the arcs and crossings of the knot. In the\npaper, we give a topological description of sets of these classes as the\nisotopy classes of probes of diagram elements.\n  In the second part of the paper, we discuss the homotopy classes of diagram\nelements. We demonstrate that the sets of these classes are fundamental for the\nalgebraic objects that are responsible for coloring diagrams of tangles on a\ngiven surface. For arcs, these algebraic objects are quandles; for regions,\nthey are partial ternary quasigroups; for semiarcs, they are biquandloids; and\nfor crossings, they are crossoids. The definitions of the last three algebraic\nstructures are given in the paper.\n  Additionally, we introduce the multicrossing complex of a tangle and define\nthe crossing homology class. In a sense, the multicrossing complex unifies\ntribracket, biquandle and crossoid homologies; and the tribracket, biquandle\nand crossoid cycle invariants are actually the result of pairing a tribracket\n(biquangle, crossoid) cocycle with the crossing homology class.",

The LP-ALT method can shorten the life test time through\nearly life prediction. Test results on the same open-source life test dataset\nof PEMFCs show that the acceleration ratio of the LP-ALT method can reach 30\ntimes under the premise of ensuring that the minimum R^2 of the prediction\nresults of different aging indicators, including limiting current, total mass\ntransport resistance, and electrochemically active surface area, is not less\nthan 0.89.

Although theories and laws of many system\ndynamics have been derived from rigorous first principles, there are still a\nconsiderable number of complex dynamics that have not yet been discovered and\ncharacterized, which hinders the progress of science in corresponding fields.\nTo address these challenges, artificial intelligence for science (AI4S) has\nemerged as a burgeoning research field. In this paper, a Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetwork (KAN)-based AI4S framework named FiberKAN is proposed for scientific\ndiscovery and dynamic characterization of nonlinear fiber optics. Unlike the\nclassic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure, the trainable and transparent\nactivation functions in KAN make the network have stronger physical\ninterpretability and nonlinear characterization abilities. Multiple KANs are\nestablished for fiber-optic system dynamics under various physical effects.\nResults show that KANs can well discover and characterize the explicit,\nimplicit, and non-analytical solutions under different effects, and achieve\nbetter performance than MLPs with the equivalent scale of trainable parameters.\nMoreover, the effectiveness, computational cost, interactivity, noise\nresistance, transfer learning ability, and comparison between related\nalgorithms in fiber-optic systems are also studied and analyzed.

Developing such skills requires a large-scale and\nhigh-quality dataset that covers numerous grasp types (i.e., at least those\ncategorized by the GRASP taxonomy), but collecting such data is extremely\nchallenging. Existing automatic grasp synthesis methods are often limited to\nspecific grasp types or object categories, hindering scalability. This work\nproposes an efficient pipeline capable of synthesizing contact-rich,\npenetration-free, and physically plausible grasps for any grasp type, object,\nand articulated hand. Starting from a single human-annotated template for each\nhand and grasp type, our pipeline tackles the complicated synthesis problem\nwith two stages: optimize the object to fit the hand template first, and then\nlocally refine the hand to fit the object in simulation. To validate the\nsynthesized grasps, we introduce a contact-aware control strategy that allows\nthe hand to apply the appropriate force at each contact point to the object.\nThose validated grasps can also be used as new grasp templates to facilitate\nfuture synthesis. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms\nprevious type-unaware grasp synthesis baselines in simulation. Using our\nalgorithm, we construct a dataset containing 10.7k objects and 9.5M grasps,\ncovering 31 grasp types in the GRASP taxonomy.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a wave-entity perspective of the electron spin qubit,\ntreating the electron as a continuous physical wave rather than a point-like\nparticle. In this theoretical framework, each spin qubit corresponds to a\ndistinct current density configuration, offering a resolution to the paradox of\na particle appearing to spin both up and down simultaneously. We further\npredict the existence of a persistent, azimuthally asymmetric magnetic field\nassociated with the wave-spin qubit, an effect not anticipated by the\nconventional particle-spin model. Notably, the qubit's relative phase governs\nthe orientation of both the current and the magnetic field, suggesting a\nmechanism for direct, local interactions between qubits. This phase-dependent\ncoupling could form the basis for inherently parallel quantum computing\narchitectures, in contrast to the sequential operations of gate-based logic.\nWhile this framework is grounded in theoretical analysis, it yields testable\npredictions -- particularly regarding the magnetic field structure -- that\ninvite experimental verification. By treating the electron wave as the\nfundamental physical entity, rather than a probabilistic abstraction, we\nexplore a quantum model that is deterministic, local, causal, and fully\nconsistent with special relativity.",

This manual process\ntakes weeks to complete and is error-prone, which is fundamentally unscalable\nfor large-scale PIC systems. Existing automation solutions have adopted\nforce-directed placement on small benchmarks with tens of components, with\nlimited routability and scalability.

    "abstract": "Talking face video generation with arbitrary speech audio is a significant\nchallenge within the realm of digital human technology. The previous studies\nhave emphasized the significance of audio-lip synchronization and visual\nquality. Currently, limited attention has been given to the learning of visual\nuncertainty, which creates several issues in existing systems, including\ninconsistent visual quality and unreliable performance across different input\nconditions. To address the problem, we propose a Joint Uncertainty Learning\nNetwork (JULNet) for high-quality talking face video generation, which\nincorporates a representation of uncertainty that is directly related to visual\nerror. Specifically, we first design an uncertainty module to individually\npredict the error map and uncertainty map after obtaining the generated image.\nThe error map represents the difference between the generated image and the\nground truth image, while the uncertainty map is used to predict the\nprobability of incorrect estimates. Furthermore, to match the uncertainty\ndistribution with the error distribution through a KL divergence term, we\nintroduce a histogram technique to approximate the distributions. By jointly\noptimizing error and uncertainty, the performance and robustness of our model\ncan be enhanced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking face video\ngeneration compared to previous methods.",

To enhance the\nflexibility and imaging performance of the optical systems, metasurfaces\ncomposed of subwavelength structural units provide a powerful optimization\napproach, enabling advanced applications in quantum state modulation and\nhigh-precision imaging. Conventional phase contrast imaging is fundamentally\nconstrained by its single-phase modulation scheme, precluding adaptive\nswitching between imaging modalities. Therefore, the development of\nhigh-contrast imaging techniques that can be used in any combination of phases\nhas been a challenge in the field of optical imaging.

The GALPROP models were found to agree with observations of\nthe diffuse gamma rays in the TeV regime by H.E.S.S., and the PeV regime by\nLHAASO, extending the demonstrated accuracy of GALPROP into the TeV--PeV\nregime. The results will also inform the next generation of experiments, such\nas the Cherenkov telescope array (CTA), on possible observation strategies and\nbackground considerations. It was also found that the proposed CTA Galactic\nplane survey will be sensitive enough to observe the large-scale diffuse\ngamma-ray emission in the TeV regime.",

    "abstract": "Computing derivatives is a crucial subroutine in computer science and related\nfields as it provides a local characterization of a function's steepest\ndirections of ascent or descent. In this work, we recognize that derivatives\nare often not computed in isolation; conversely, it is quite common to compute\na \\textit{sequence} of derivatives, each one somewhat related to the last.\nThus, we propose accelerating derivative computation by reusing information\nfrom previous, related calculations-a general strategy known as\n\\textit{coherence}. We introduce the first instantiation of this strategy\nthrough a novel approach called the Web of Affine Spaces (WASP) Optimization.\nThis approach provides an accurate approximation of a function's derivative\nobject (i.e. gradient, Jacobian matrix, etc.) at the current input within a\nsequence. Each derivative within the sequence only requires a small number of\nforward passes through the function (typically two), regardless of the number\nof function inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach\nthrough several numerical experiments, comparing it with alternative derivative\ncomputation methods on benchmark functions. We show that our method\nsignificantly improves the performance of derivative computation on small to\nmedium-sized functions, i.e., functions with approximately fewer than 500\ncombined inputs and outputs. Furthermore, we show that this method can be\neffectively applied in a robotics optimization context. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of the limitations and implications of our work.

The last few decades\nhave seen the emergence of structured light beams that may possess a complex\nphase and amplitude structure in both their transverse and longitudinal\ndirections. This paper provides a historical overview of radiation pressure,\ntracing its discovery and experimental validation, and examines how\ntransitioning to structured light from a plane wave can influence it. In\nparticular, we elucidate the difference in radiation pressure force for\nstructured light fields and how this differs from that of a plane wave at an\nidentical frequency. In particular, the well-known Gouy phase is shown to\ncontribute to a reduction in the radiation pressure force exerted on a flat\nmirror in comparison to a plane wave for both HG and LG modes. As an\nillustrative example, we compute that the radiation pressure force for LG modes\ndiffers from that of a plane wave by approximately $20$ fN/W for each unit of\norbital angular momentum. A detailed experimental proposal to quantify this\nvariance in radiation pressure is described, and we demonstrate that this\nmeasurement is within the realm of current metrological techniques.",

To further\nensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update\nstrategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for\nhistorical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing\nstate-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES,\nICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in\nhandling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations.

Traditional failure localization approaches based on small models\nlack the flexibility to adapt to diverse failure scenarios, while recent\nLLM-based methods suffer from two major limitations: they often rely on rigid\ninvocation workflows that constrain the model's ability to dynamically explore\noptimal localization paths, and they require resource-intensive inference,\nmaking them cost-prohibitive for real-world deployment.

We begin with an empirical study to identify three key\ncapabilities essential for accurate localization.

The rate of topographic evolution\ndepends on the rheology of the ice shell, the difference in density between the\nshell and potential global subsurface oceans, the ice shell thickness\ndistribution, as well as the rate of tidal heat dissipation in the shell. Here\nwe analyze relaxation of topography starting from the Stokes equations for\nviscous fluid flow. We write out the shallow-shell models (with and without a\nrigid crust) and compare the resulting time scales to previous work. Using\nthree-dimensional linearized flow for small-amplitude topographic\nperturbations, we recover the time scales of relaxation from the shallow models\nas well as shells that are not shallow. For a shell of constant viscosity, we\nfind that the topographic relaxation time scale is constant for wavelengths\nlarger than the ice thickness, an idea that runs contrary to the existing\nparadigm. For a shell with a viscosity that decreases exponentially with depth,\nwe show numerically that there is a regime where the larger viscosity outer\ncrust acts as a nearly rigid boundary. In this case, the relaxation time scale\ndepends on the wavelength. For the largest spatial scales, the time scale\nbecomes independent of wavelength again and the value is set by the average\nshell viscosity. However, the spatial scale that this transition occurs at\nbecomes larger as the viscosity contrast increases, limiting the applicability\nof the scale-independent relaxation rate. These results for the relaxation of\ntopography have implications for interpreting relaxed crater profiles,\ninferences of ice shell thickness from topography, and upcoming observations\nfrom missions to the outer solar system.",

    "abstract": "Heteroatom doping is an important method for engineering graphene nanoribbons\n(GNRs) because of its ability to modify electronic properties by introducing\nextra electrons or vacancies. However, precisely integrating oxygen atoms into\nthe lattice of GNRs is unexplored, and the resulting electronic properties\nremain elusive. Here, we achieve the precise embedding of oxygen atoms into the\nlattice of GNRs via in situ formation of pyrans, synthesizing two types of\noxygen-doped GNRs (O-doped chevron-GNR and O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR). Using\nscanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, and density\nfunctional theory calculations, the atomic structures and electronic properties\nof O-doped GNRs are determined, demonstrating that both GNRs are direct bandgap\nsemiconductors with different sensitivities to oxygen dopants. Oxygen dopants\nhave a minor impact on the bandgap of chevron-GNR but a significant effect on\nthe bandgap of chiral (2,1)-GNR, which is attributed to the difference in\ndensity of states near the Fermi level between substituted intrinsic carbon\natoms and their pristine counterparts. Compared with the pristine chiral\n(2,1)-GNR, the band structure of O-doped chiral (2,1)-GNR exhibits unexpected\nband edges transition, which is ascribed to sp2-hybridized oxygen atoms which\nintroduces additional electrons to the conduction band of chiral (2,1)-GNR,\nleading to the upward shift of Fermi surface.",

Our main result provides a complete classification of\nnon-Einstein weakly Einstein curvature tensors in dimension four, naturally\ndividing them into three disjoint five-dimensional families of algebraic types.\nThese types are explicitly constructed using bases that simultaneously\ndiagonalize both the Einstein tensor and the (anti)self-dual Weyl tensors,\nwhich consequently proves that such simultaneous diagonalizability follows from\nthe weakly Einstein property.

    "abstract": "Spiral perturbations in a gravitationally unstable accretion disk regulate\ndisk evolution through angular-momentum transport and heating and provide an\nobservational signature of gravitational instability (GI). We use global 3D\nsimulations to systematically characterize and understand these spiral\nperturbations. The spiral perturbations and the resulting transport are overall\ninsensitive to the cooling type, with the exception that radiative cooling,\nespecially in the optically thick regime, reduces the amplitude of temperature\nperturbations. Spiral perturbations are localized around corotation, allowing\ntransport to be approximated by a local $\\alpha$ viscosity to zeroth order in\naspect ratio ($H/R$), but only after averaging over multiple orbits in time\nand/or multiple scale heights in space. Meanwhile, large-amplitude\nperturbations from strong gravitoturbulence can cause $\\mathcal\nO(\\alpha^{1/2})$ deviation in the cooling rate of the disk. We develop\nempirical prescriptions for the angular-momentum transport, heating, and\ncooling in a gravitoturbulent disk that capture the deviation from a viscous,\nunperturbed disk to first order in $H/R$ and $\\alpha^{1/2}$. The spiral\nperturbations in saturated gravitoturbulence are clumpy, with dense clumps\nforming through the nonlinear coupling between multiple modes at different $m$.\nObservationally, the clumpy gravitoturbulence produced by saturated GI can be\nmistaken with observational noise or embedded companions, especially under\nfinite resolution. Meanwhile, grand-design spirals with $m$-fold symmetry may\nbe uncommon among disks in saturated gravitoturbulence, and we speculate that\nthey may instead be a signature of recently triggered or decaying GI.",

    "abstract": "We consider the logistics network of an e-commerce retailer, specifically the\nso-called \"middle mile\" network, that routes inventory from supply warehouses\nto distribution stations to be ingested into the terminal (\"last mile\")\ndelivery network. The speed of packages through this middle mile network is a\nkey determinant for the ultimate delivery speed to the end user. An important\ntarget for a retailer is to maximize the fraction of user orders that can be\nserviced within one day, i.e., next-day delivery. As such, we formulate the\nmaximization of expected next-day delivery coverage within the middle-mile\nnetwork as an optimization problem, involving a set of temporal and\ncapacity-based constraints on the network and requiring the use of a black-box\nmodel to evaluate the objective function. We design both exact constraint\nprogramming (CP) and heuristic random-key optimizer (RKO) approaches, the\nformer of which uses a proxy objective function. We perform experiments on\nlarge-scale, real-world problem instances and show that both approaches have\nmerit, in that they can match or outperform the baseline solution, a bespoke\ngreedy solver with integrated local search, in expected next-day delivery\ncoverage. Our experiments focus on two high-level problem definitions, starting\nwith a base problem and then adding more complexity, and also explore the\ngeneralization of the solvers across a range of problem instance sizes. We find\nthat a hybrid model using RKO and a bespoke local search protocol performs best\non the full problem definition with respect to expected next-day delivery\n(increase of +50 basis points [bps] over baseline) but can take days to run,\nwhereas the hybrid model using CP and local search is slightly less competitive\n(+20 bps) but takes only hours to run.",
