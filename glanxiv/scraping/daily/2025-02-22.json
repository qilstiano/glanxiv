    "abstract": "Linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts are encoded\nas linear directions in the representation spaces of LLMs. Park et al. (2024)\nformalize this notion by unifying multiple interpretations of linear\nrepresentation, such as 1-dimensional subspace representation and\ninterventions, using a causal inner product. However, their framework relies on\nsingle-token counterfactual pairs and cannot handle ambiguous contrasting\npairs, limiting its applicability to complex or context-dependent concepts. We\nintroduce a new notion of binary concepts as unit vectors in a canonical\nrepresentation space, and utilize LLMs' (neural) activation differences along\nwith maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to compute concept directions (i.e.,\nsteering vectors). Our method, Sum of Activation-base Normalized Difference\n(SAND), formalizes the use of activation differences modeled as samples from a\nvon Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, providing a principled approach to derive\nconcept directions. We extend the applicability of Park et al. (2024) by\neliminating the dependency on unembedding representations and single-token\npairs. Through experiments with LLaMA models across diverse concepts and\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that our lightweight approach offers greater\nflexibility, superior performance in activation engineering tasks like\nmonitoring and manipulation.",

In addition, we prove a theorem\nshowing that a certain edge weight re-normalization procedure in a prior\nresearch work for Ricci flows for edge-weighted graphs has the undesirable\noutcome of modifying the edge-weights to negative numbers, thereby rendering\nthe procedure impossible to use.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has been playing important roles in drug discovery in\nthe past years by providing (pre-)screening tools for prioritising chemical\ncompounds to pass through wet lab experiments. One of the main ML tasks in drug\ndiscovery is to build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)\nmodels, associating the molecular structure of chemical compounds with an\nactivity or property. These properties -- including absorption, distribution,\nmetabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) -- are essential to model compound\nbehaviour, activity and interactions in the organism. Although several methods\nexist, the majority of them do not provide an appropriate model's\npersonalisation, yielding to bias and lack of generalisation to new data since\nthe chemical space usually shifts from application to application. This fact\nleads to low predictive performance when completely new data is being tested by\nthe model. The area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) emerged aiming to\nsolve this issue, outputting tailored ML algorithms to the data at hand.\nAlthough an important task, AutoML has not been practically used to assist\ncheminformatics and computational chemistry researchers often, with just a few\nworks related to the field. To address these challenges, this work introduces\nAuto-ADMET, an interpretable evolutionary-based AutoML method for chemical\nADMET property prediction. Auto-ADMET employs a Grammar-based Genetic\nProgramming (GGP) method with a Bayesian Network Model to achieve comparable or\nbetter predictive performance against three alternative methods -- standard GGP\nmethod, pkCSM and XGBOOST model -- on 12 benchmark chemical ADMET property\nprediction datasets. The use of a Bayesian Network model on Auto-ADMET's\nevolutionary process assisted in both shaping the search procedure and\ninterpreting the causes of its AutoML performance.",

We begin with IL on a mobile robot, leveraging easily accessible\nteacher policies to train a foundational model that combines a world model with\na mobility policy. Building on this base, we employ residual RL to fine-tune\nembodiment-specific policies, exploiting pre-trained representations to improve\nsampling efficiency in handling various physical constraints and sensor\nmodalities. Finally, policy distillation merges these embodiment-specialist\npolicies into a single robust cross-embodiment policy.\n  We empirically demonstrate that COMPASS scales effectively across diverse\nrobot platforms while maintaining adaptability to various environment\nconfigurations, achieving a generalist policy with a success rate approximately\n5X higher than the pre-trained IL policy. The resulting framework offers an\nefficient, scalable solution for cross-embodiment mobility, enabling robots\nwith different designs to navigate safely and efficiently in complex scenarios.",

To address this\nissue, the task of concept erasure has been introduced, aiming to erase any\nundesired concepts that the models can generate. Previous methods, whether\ntraining-based or training-free, have primarily focused on the input side,\ni.e., texts. However, they often suffer from incomplete erasure due to\nlimitations in the generalization from limited prompts to diverse image\ncontent. In this paper, motivated by the notion that concept erasure on the\noutput side, i.e., generated images, may be more direct and effective, we\npropose Concept Corrector. It checks target concepts based on visual features\nprovided by final generated images predicted at certain time steps. Further, it\nincorporates Concept Removal Attention to erase generated concept features. It\novercomes the limitations of existing methods, which are either unable to\nremove the concept features that have been generated in images or rely on the\nassumption that the related concept words are contained in input prompts. In\nthe whole pipeline, our method changes no model parameters and only requires a\ngiven target concept as well as the corresponding replacement content, which is\neasy to implement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first erasure\nmethod based on intermediate-generated images, achieving the ability to erase\nconcepts on the fly. The experiments on various concepts demonstrate its\nimpressive erasure performance.",

Optimal decumulation can be viewed as a problem\nin optimal stochastic control.

An intuitive specification of reward is the total withdrawals\nover the retirement period. Most retirees view risk as the possibility of\nrunning out of savings. This paper investigates several possible left tail risk\nmeasures, in conjunction with DC plan decumulation. The risk measures studied\ninclude (i) expected shortfall (ii) linear shortfall and (iii) probability of\nshortfall. We establish that, under certain assumptions, the set of optimal\ncontrols associated with all expected reward and expected shortfall Pareto\nefficient frontier curves is identical to the set of optimal controls for all\nexpected reward and linear shortfall Pareto efficient frontier curves. Optimal\nefficient frontiers are determined computationally for each risk measure, based\non a parametric market model.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial\nintelligence technologies, data has become an important strategic resource in\nthe new era. However, the growing demand for data has exacerbated the issue of\n\\textit{data silos}. Existing data pricing models primarily focus on single\nfactors such as data quality or market demand, failing to adequately address\nissues such as data seller monopolies and the diverse needs of buyers,\nresulting in biased pricing that cannot meet the complexities of evolving\ntransaction scenarios. To address these problems, this paper proposes a\nmulti-party data pricing model based on the Rubinstein bargaining model. The\nmodel introduces buyer data utility indicators and data quality assessments,\ncomprehensively considering factors such as the utility, accuracy, and\ntimeliness of data sets, to more accurately evaluate their value to buyers. To\novercome the limitations of single-factor models, this paper innovatively\nintroduces the buyer data set satisfaction indicator, which reflects the\noverall satisfaction of buyers with data sets by integrating both data utility\nand quality assessments. Based on this, the model uses the Rubinstein\nbargaining model to simulate the pricing process between multiple sellers and\nmultiple buyers, yielding pricing results that better align with market\ndemands. Experimental results show that the proposed model effectively\naddresses the pricing imbalance caused by data monopolies and demonstrates good\napplicability and accuracy in multi-seller, multi-buyer transaction\nenvironments. This research provides an effective pricing mechanism for complex\ndata trading markets and has significant theoretical and practical value in\nsolving pricing issues in actual data transactions.",

    "abstract": "In-cylinder flow structures and turbulence characteristics are investigated\nusing direct numerical simulations (DNS) in a laboratory-scale engine at\ntechnically relevant engine speeds (1500 and 2500 rpm at full load). The data\nis computed for 12 compression-expansion cycles at each engine speed with\ninitial conditions derived from precursor large eddy simulations (LES)\nvalidated against experimental data. Analysis of the tumble ratio indicates\nsignificant cycle-to-cycle variation, with lower variability found at higher\nengine speed. The process of tumble breakdown, quantified by the evolution of\nmean and turbulent kinetic energy, reveals distinct features between operating\nconditions, with delayed turbulence peaks observed at lower engine speed.\nAnalysis of the Reynolds stress tensor demonstrates higher stress values at\nhigher engine speed, with pronounced anisotropy near the walls and higher\nvalues around the tumble vortex core. Examination of the anisotropic Reynolds\nstress invariants through Lumley triangles reveals predominantly isotropic\nturbulence during mid-compression, transitioning to distinct anisotropic states\nnear top dead center (TDC). The lower engine speed exhibits a stronger tendency\ntoward one-component turbulence due to partial tumble dissipation, while the\nhigher speed maintains a more balanced anisotropy. These findings extend\nprevious numerical and experimental studies on turbulence development and\nin-cylinder flow structures during the compression stroke, providing insights\nfor improving turbulence modeling in practical engine simulations.",

We develop verification protocols that certify the\ncorrectness of a classifier by disclosing a few nonresponsive documents.\n  We introduce a combinatorial notion called the Leave-One-Out dimension of a\nfamily of classifiers and show that the number of nonresponsive documents\ndisclosed by our protocol is at most this dimension in the realizable setting,\nwhere a perfect classifier exists in this family. For linear classifiers with a\nmargin, we characterize the trade-off between the margin and the number of\nnonresponsive documents that must be disclosed for verification. Specifically,\nwe establish a trichotomy in this requirement: for $d$ dimensional instances,\nwhen the margin exceeds $1/3$, verification can be achieved by revealing only\n$O(1)$ nonresponsive documents; when the margin is exactly $1/3$, in the worst\ncase, at least $\\Omega(d)$ nonresponsive documents must be disclosed; when the\nmargin is smaller than $1/3$, verification requires $\\Omega(e^d)$ nonresponsive\ndocuments.

The magnetic truncation of the disk\naround a rapidly rotating T Tauri star is initially exterior to the corotation\nradius and ``propeller\" accretion is accompanied by an inner magnetized wind,\nshielding the disk from X-rays. Because rotation varies little due to angular\nmomentum exchange with the disk, stellar contraction causes the truncation\nradius to migrate inside the corotation radius, the inner wind to disappear,\nand photoevaporation to erode a gap in the disk, accelerating its dissipation.\nThis X-ray attenuation scenario explains the trend of the longer lifetime,\nreduced structure, and compact size of disks around lower-mass stars. It also\nexplains an observed lower bound and scatter in the distribution of disk\naccretion rates. Disks that experience early photoevaporation and form gaps can\nefficiently trap solids at a pressure bump at 1--10 au, triggering giant planet\nformation, while those with later-forming gaps or indeed no gaps form multiple\nsmaller planets on close-in orbits, a pattern that is consistent with observed\nexoplanet demographics.",

This task presents a challenge: balancing \"equity\" (i.e.,\nprioritizing orders that have been waiting longer) with \"efficiency\" (i.e.,\nmaximizing the number of orders served). Although the current CCSO policy is\nhighly efficient, a significant fraction of eviction orders miss their\ndeadline. Motivated by the CCSO's operations, we study a model of eviction\nenforcement planning and propose a policy that dynamically prioritizes orders\nbased on their type (deadline or no deadline), location, and waiting time. Our\napproach employs a budgeted prize-collecting vehicle routing problem (VRP) for\ndaily planning, where the \"prizes\" are determined by solving a stochastic\ncontrol problem. This stochastic control problem, which relies on the VRP for\ndetermining feasible actions at each decision point, is high-dimensional due to\nits spatial nature, leading to the curse of dimensionality. We overcome this\nchallenge by building on recent advances in high-dimensional stochastic control\nusing deep neural networks. We compare the performance of our proposed policy\nwith two practical benchmark policies, including one that mimics the current\nCCSO policy, using data from CCSO. Similar to the CCSO policy, our proposed\npolicy leads to efficient resource utilization, but it also reduces the\npercentage of orders that miss their deadline by 72.38% without degrading the\noverall service effort for either type of orders. In a counterfactual study, we\nshow that increasing the service capacity or extending the enforcement deadline\nfurther reduces the fraction of orders missing their deadline.",

Initially\nconsidered as taking values in a compact semisimple Lie Group G, the WZW model\nalso has a \"dual\" formulation where the group $G$ is replaced by the homogenous\nspace $G^{\\mathbb{C}}/G$, where $G^{\\mathbb{C}}$ is the complexification of\n$G$, and it has been argued that the former can be (re-)constructed from the\nlatter.

We propose a new\nmethod that leverages recent advancements in large language models and game\ntheory to predict dynamic multilateral coalition formation in Diplomacy, a\nstrategic multi-agent game where agents negotiate coalitions using natural\nlanguage. The method consists of two stages. The first stage extracts the set\nof agreements discussed by two agents in their private dialogue, by combining a\nparsing-based filtering function with a fine-tuned language model trained to\npredict player intents. In the second stage, we define a new metric using the\nconcept of subjective rationalizability from hypergame theory to evaluate the\nexpected value of an agreement for each player. We then compute this metric for\neach agreement identified in the first stage by assessing the strategic value\nof the agreement for both players and taking into account the subjective belief\nof one player that the second player would honor the agreement. We demonstrate\nthat our method effectively detects potential coalition structures in online\nDiplomacy gameplay by assigning high values to agreements likely to be honored\nand low values to those likely to be violated. The proposed method provides\nfoundational insights into coalition formation in multi-agent environments with\nlanguage-based negotiation and offers key directions for future research on the\nanalysis of complex natural language-based interactions between agents.",

Traditional approaches focus on maximizing\nthe biologically effective dose (BED) to the target while constraining BED to\norgans-at-risk (OAR), which may lead to insufficient BED for complete tumor\ncell kill. This work proposes a formulation that ensures adequate BED delivery\nto the target while minimizing BED to the OAR. Approach: A spatiotemporal\noptimization model is developed that incorporates an inequality constraint to\nguarantee sufficient BED for tumor cell kill while minimizing BED to the OAR.\nThe model accounts for tumor proliferation dynamics, including lag time (delay\nbefore proliferation begins) and doubling time (time for tumor volume to\ndouble), to optimize dose fractionation. Results: The performance of our\nformulation is evaluated for varying lag and doubling times. The results show\nthat mean BED to the target consistently meets the minimum requirement for\ntumor cell kill. Additionally, the mean BED to OAR varies based on tumor\nproliferation dynamics. In the prostate case with lag time of 7 days and\ndoubling time of 2 days, it is observed that mean BED delivered to femoral head\nis lowest at around 20 fractions, making this an optimal choice. While in the\nhead-and-neck case, mean BED to OAR decreases as the number of fractions\nincreases, suggesting that a higher number of fractions is optimal.\nSignificance: A spatiotemporal optimization model is presented that minimizes\nBED to the OAR while ensuring sufficient BED for tumor cell kill. By\nincorporating tumor lag and doubling time, the approach identifies optimal\nnumber of fractions.

Methods: Three minibeam-pLATTICE methods\nare introduced.

Results: Three minibeam-pLATTICE methods are\nvalidated to demonstrate the feasibility of minibeam-pLATTICE for head-and-neck\ncases.

    "abstract": "Failure of machine learning models to generalize to new data is a core\nproblem limiting the reliability of AI systems, partly due to the lack of\nsimple and robust methods for comparing new data to the original training\ndataset. We propose a standardized approach for assessing data similarity in a\nmodel-agnostic manner by constructing a supervised autoencoder for\ngeneralizability estimation (SAGE). We compare points in a low-dimensional\nembedded latent space, defining empirical probability measures for k-Nearest\nNeighbors (kNN) distance, reconstruction of inputs and task-based performance.\nAs proof of concept for classification tasks, we use MNIST and CIFAR-10 to\ndemonstrate how an ensemble output probability score can separate deformed\nimages from a mixture of typical test examples, and how this SAGE score is\nrobust to transformations of increasing severity. As further proof of concept,\nwe extend this approach to a regression task using non-imaging data (UCI\nAbalone). In all cases, we show that out-of-the-box model performance increases\nafter SAGE score filtering, even when applied to data from the model's own\ntraining and test datasets. Our out-of-distribution scoring method can be\nintroduced during several steps of model construction and assessment, leading\nto future improvements in responsible deep learning implementation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Multi-collimator proton minibeam radiation therapy (MC-pMBRT) has\nrecently emerged as a versatile technique for dose shaping, enabling\npeak-valley dose patterns in organs-at-risk (OAR) while maintaining a uniform\ndose distribution in tumor. MC-pMBRT leverages a set of generic multi-slit\ncollimators (MSC) with varying center-to-center distances. However, the current\nmethod for minibeam aperture optimization (MAO), i.e., the selection of MSC per\nbeam angle, is manual and heuristic, resulting in computational inefficiencies\nand no guarantee of optimality. This work introduces a novel mixed integer\nprogramming (MIP) approach to MAO for optimizing MC-pMBRT plan quality.\nMethods: The proposed MIP approach jointly optimizes dose distributions,\npeak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR), and selects the optimal set of MSC per beam\nangle. The optimization problem includes decision variables for MSC selection\nper beam angle and spot weights. The proposed MIP approach is a two-step\nprocess: Step1: the binary variables are optimally determined to select MSC for\neach beam angle; Step 2: the continuous variables are solved to determine the\nspot weights. Both steps utilize iterative convex relaxation and the\nalternating direction method of multipliers to solve the problems. Results: The\nproposed MIP method for MAO (MIP-MAO) was validated against the conventional\nheuristic method (CONV) for MC-pMBRT treatment planning. Results indicate that\nMIP-MAO enhances the conformity index (CI) for the target and improves PVDR for\nOAR. For instance, in a head-and-neck case, CI improved from 0.61 (CONV) to\n0.70 (MIP-MAO); in an abdomen case, CI improved from 0.78 (CONV) to 0.83\n(MIP-MAO). Additionally, MIP-MAO reduced mean doses in the body and OAR.\nConclusions: A novel MIP approach for MAO in MC-pMBRT is presented, showing\ndemonstrated improvements in plan quality and PVDR compared to the heuristic\nmethod.",

While most existing methods primarily\naddress Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) for protein and DNA sequences, there\nremains a significant gap in alignment methodologies for numerical time series.\nAdditionally, conventional approaches typically focus on pairwise alignment,\nwhereas our proposed method aligns all signals in a multiple manner (all the\nsignals are aligned together at once). This innovation not only enhances\nalignment efficiency but also significantly improves computational speed. By\ndecomposing into piece-wise linear sections, we introduce varying levels of\ncomplexity into the warping function.

The utilization of a deep convolutional network allows\nus to employ a new loss function, addressing some limitations of Dynamic Time\nWarping (DTW).

We focus on passing\nplays with receivers in motion at the snap and running a route, and define the\nsnap timing as the time between the moment a receiver begins motioning and the\nball snap event. We assume a Gamma distribution for the play-level snap timing\nand model the mean parameter with player and team random effects, along with\nrelevant fixed effects such as the motion type identified via a Gaussian\nmixture model. Most importantly, we model the shape parameter with quarterback\nrandom effects, which enables us to estimate the differences in snap timing\nvariability among NFL quarterbacks. We demonstrate that higher variability in\nsnap timing is beneficial for the passing game, as it relates to facing less\nhavoc created by the opposing defense. We also obtain a quarterback leaderboard\nbased on our snap timing variability measure, and Patrick Mahomes stands out as\nthe top player.",

    "abstract": "During a solar flare, electrons are accelerated to non-thermal energies as a\nresult of magnetic reconnection. These electrons then propagate upwards and\ndownwards from the energy release site along magnetic field lines and produce\nradio and X-ray emission. On 11 November 2022, an M5.1 solar flare was observed\nby the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter\ntogether with various ground- and space-based radio instruments. The flare was\nassociated with several fine hard X-ray (HXR) structures and a complex set of\nmetric radio bursts (type III, J, and narrowband). By studying the evolution of\nX-ray, extreme ultraviolet, and radio sources, we aim to study the trajectories\nof the flare-accelerated electrons in the lower solar atmosphere and low\ncorona. We used observations from the STIX on board Solar Orbiter to study the\nevolution of X-ray sources. Using radio imaging from the Nan\\c{c}ay Radio\nheliograph (NRH) and the Newkirk density model, we constructed 3D trajectories\nof 14 radio bursts. Imaging of the HXR fine structures shows several sources at\ndifferent times. The STIX and NRH imaging shows correlated changes in the\nlocation of the HXR and radio source at the highest frequency during the most\nintense impulsive period. Imaging and 3D trajectories of all the bursts show\nthat electrons are getting accelerated at different locations and along several\ndistinct field lines. The longitude and latitude extent of the trajectories are\n~30 arcsec and ~ 152 arcsec. We find that the electrons producing HXR and radio\nemission have similar acceleration origins. Importantly, our study supports the\nscenario that the flare acceleration process is temporally and spatially\nfragmentary, and during each of these small-scale processes, the electron beams\nare injected into a very fibrous environment and produce complex HXR and radio\nemission.",

Previous 3D scene segmentation methods rely on video segmentation\nmodels to address inconsistencies across views, but the absence of spatial\ninformation often leads to object misassociation when object temporarily\ndisappear and reappear. Furthermore, in the process of 3D scene reconstruction,\nsegmentation and optimization are often treated as separate tasks. As a result,\noptimization typically lacks awareness of semantic category information, which\ncan result in floaters with ambiguous segmentation. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce CCGS, a method designed to achieve both view\nconsistent 2D segmentation and a compact 3D Gaussian segmentation field. CCGS\nincorporates pointmap association and a piecewise-plane constraint. First, we\nestablish pixel correspondence between adjacent images by minimizing the\nEuclidean distance between their pointmaps. We then redefine object mask\noverlap accordingly. The Hungarian algorithm is employed to optimize mask\nassociation by minimizing the total matching cost, while allowing for partial\nmatches. To further enhance compactness, the piecewise-plane constraint\nrestricts point displacement within local planes during optimization, thereby\npreserving structural integrity. Experimental results on ScanNet and Replica\ndatasets demonstrate that CCGS outperforms existing methods in both 2D panoptic\nsegmentation and 3D Gaussian segmentation.",

    "abstract": "The accurate representation of epistemic uncertainty is a challenging yet\nessential task in machine learning. A widely used representation corresponds to\nconvex sets of probabilistic predictors, also known as credal sets. One popular\nway of constructing these credal sets is via ensembling or specialized\nsupervised learning methods, where the epistemic uncertainty can be quantified\nthrough measures such as the set size or the disagreement among members. In\nprinciple, these sets should contain the true data-generating distribution. As\na necessary condition for this validity, we adopt the strongest notion of\ncalibration as a proxy. Concretely, we propose a novel statistical test to\ndetermine whether there is a convex combination of the set's predictions that\nis calibrated in distribution. In contrast to previous methods, our framework\nallows the convex combination to be instance dependent, recognizing that\ndifferent ensemble members may be better calibrated in different regions of the\ninput space. Moreover, we learn this combination via proper scoring rules,\nwhich inherently optimize for calibration. Building on differentiable,\nkernel-based estimators of calibration errors, we introduce a nonparametric\ntesting procedure and demonstrate the benefits of capturing instance-level\nvariability on of synthetic and real-world experiments.",

We evaluate TimePFN on several benchmark\ndatasets and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art\nmodels for MTS forecasting in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Notably,\nfine-tuning TimePFN with as few as 500 data points nearly matches full dataset\ntraining error, and even 50 data points yield competitive results. We also find\nthat TimePFN exhibits strong univariate forecasting performance, attesting to\nits generalization ability.

Users may be interested in only specific\ntypes of connections in the similarity definition, represented as meta-paths,\ni.e., a sequence of node and edge types. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural\nNetwork (HGNN)-based similarity search methods may accommodate meta-paths, but\nrequire retraining for different meta-paths.

This limitation results\nin a significant oversight of quantum mechanical effects, such as quantized\n(discrete) energy level structures, which offer a more accurate estimation of\nmolecular energy and can be experimentally measured through energy spectra. In\nthis paper, we propose to utilize the energy spectra to enhance the\npre-training of 3D molecular representations (MolSpectra), thereby infusing the\nknowledge of quantum mechanics into the molecular representations.\nSpecifically, we propose SpecFormer, a multi-spectrum encoder for encoding\nmolecular spectra via masked patch reconstruction.

While prior research\nprimarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted\nlearning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found\nthat independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance\ncan become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental\nquestions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal\nlearning.

Through a comprehensive\nempirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment\nand its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data\ncharacteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree\nof similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and\nunique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that\nalignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance\nvaries depending on the dataset and task.

Earlier works have shown that the transition into this state is\nabrupt and discontinuous. Here, we study the transition to the inverse cascade\nin the case where the inverse energy flux is dissipated before it reaches the\nsystem scale, suppressing the LSV formation. We demonstrate how this can be\nachieved in direct numerical simulations by using an adapted form of\nhypoviscosity on the horizontal manifold. We find that in the absence of the\nLSV, the transition to the inverse cascade becomes continuous.

    "abstract": "With the advent of the 6G mobile communication network era, the existing\nnon-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) technology faces the challenge of high\nsuccessive interference in multi-user scenarios, which limits its ability to\nsupport more user access. To address this, this paper proposes a novel\npower-domain sparse-dimensional constellation multiple-access scheme\n(PD-SDCMA). Through the signal space dimension selection strategy\n(S2D-strategy), this scheme sparsely superposes low-dimensional constellations\nonto high-dimensional signal spaces, and reduces the high-order interference\ncaused by SC by taking advantage of the non-correlation between dimensions.\nSpecifically, PD-SDCMA reduces the successive interference between users by\nsparsifying the dimension allocation of constellation superposition and designs\na sparse superposition method based on the theory of vector space signal\nrepresentation. Simulation results show that, under the AWGN channel, PD-SDCMA\nsignificantly outperforms the traditional PD-NOMA in terms of the number of\nsupported users under QPSK and 16QAM modulations, and also has better BER\nperformance. This paper provides a new solution for efficient spectrum\nutilization in future scenarios with large-scale user access.",

Our work has been motivated by low resolution biomolecular\nchain RNA where only some prominent atomic bonds can be well identified. Here,\nwe propose a new modelling strategy for such constrained shape analysis\nstarting with a product of polar coordinates (polypolars), where, due to\nconstraints, for example, some radial coordinates should be omitted, leaving\nproducts of spheres (polyspheres).

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with 1-bit phase resolution suffers\nfrom high side lobe levels (SLLs) in the near field and pronounced quantization\nlobe levels (QLLs) in the far field, which is detrimental for the quality of\nwireless communication. RIS design is further challenging in the mm-wave bands,\nwhere typically large bandwidths are required. To address these limitations,\nthis work proposes a novel wideband 5G mm-Wave RIS with 2-bit phase\nquantization, capable of covering the entire 5G n258 band. The proposed unit\ncell design is a combination of a grounded main slot, a parasitic slot, and a\ncoupling patch, utilizing only two PIN diodes. This design achieves a 2-bit\nbandwidth (BW) of 24.1--27.7 GHz (13.9\\%) and an effective 1-bit BW of\n20.0--28.9 GHz (36.4\\%). The unit cell features a compact size of 0.39$\\lambda$\n$\\times$ 0.39$\\lambda$, providing decent angular stability of $\\pm30^\\circ$ as\nwell as eliminating the grating lobes. Based on this unit cell design, a 20\n$\\times$ 20 RIS array has been designed, fabricated, and experimentally\ncharacterized. The measured results demonstrate that, within the 5G n258 band,\nthe proposed 2-bit 5G mm-Wave RIS achieves an SLL of -15.4 dB in the near\nfield, representing a 7.6 dB improvement compared to its 1-bit counterpart.\nFurthermore, it has almost negligible QLL (-14.6 dB) in the far field,\nproviding a suppression of 13.3 dB relative to the 1-bit design. Thus, the\nproposed 2-bit mm-Wave RIS offers wideband performance, low SLL, negligible\nQLL, decent angular stability, and a broad beam scanning range of 50$^\\circ$,\nmaking it a promising solution for high-resolution and low-interference mm-Wave\nwireless communication systems.",

To address this, we introduce the\nconcept of epistemic uncertainty to indirectly define how efficiently a model\nuses the training knowledge.

    "abstract": "The variability in ECG readings influenced by individual patient\ncharacteristics has posed a considerable challenge to adopting automated ECG\nanalysis in clinical settings. A novel feature fusion technique termed SACC\n(Self Attentive Canonical Correlation) was proposed to address this. This\ntechnique is combined with DPN (Dual Pathway Network) and depth-wise separable\nconvolution to create a robust, interpretable, and fast end-to-end arrhythmia\nclassification model named rECGnition_v2.0 (robust ECG abnormality detection).\nThis study uses MIT-BIH, INCARTDB and EDB dataset to evaluate the efficiency of\nrECGnition_v2.0 for various classes of arrhythmias. To investigate the\ninfluence of constituting model components, various ablation studies were\nperformed, i.e. simple concatenation, CCA and proposed SACC were compared,\nwhile the importance of global and local ECG features were tested using DPN\nrECGnition_v2.0 model and vice versa. It was also benchmarked with\nstate-of-the-art CNN models for overall accuracy vs model parameters, FLOPs,\nmemory requirements, and prediction time. Furthermore, the inner working of the\nmodel was interpreted by comparing the activation locations in ECG before and\nafter the SACC layer. rECGnition_v2.0 showed a remarkable accuracy of 98.07%\nand an F1-score of 98.05% for classifying ten distinct classes of arrhythmia\nwith just 82.7M FLOPs per sample, thereby going beyond the performance metrics\nof current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by utilizing MIT-BIH Arrhythmia\ndataset. Similarly, on INCARTDB and EDB datasets, excellent F1-scores of 98.01%\nand 96.21% respectively was achieved for AAMI classification. The compact\narchitectural footprint of the rECGnition_v2.0, characterized by its lesser\ntrainable parameters and diminished computational demands, unfurled several\nadvantages including interpretability and scalability.",

It is well established that impact\nfollows a square-root impact as a function of traded volume. However, the\nmicroscopic origin of such a law remains elusive: empirical studies are\nparticularly challenging due to the anonymity of orders in public data. Indeed,\nthere is ongoing debate about whether price impact has a mechanical origin or\nwhether it is primarily driven by information, as suggested by many economic\ntheories. In this paper, we revisit this question using a very detailed dataset\nprovided by the Japanese stock exchange, containing the trader IDs for all\norders sent to the exchange between 2012 and 2018. Our central result is that\nsuch a law has in fact microscopic roots and applies already at the level of\nsingle child orders, provided one waits long enough for the market to \"digest\"\nthem. The mesoscopic impact of metaorders arises from a \"double\" square-root\neffect: square-root in volume of individual impact, followed by an inverse\nsquare-root decay as a function of time. Since market orders are anonymous, we\nexpect and indeed find that these results apply to any market orders, and the\nimpact of synthetic metaorders, reconstructed by scrambling the identity of the\nissuers, is described by the very same square-root impact law. We conclude that\nprice impact is essentially mechanical, at odds with theories that emphasize\nthe information content of such trades to explain the square-root impact law.",

Contrastive learning methods have been widely adopted\namong intra-domain (intra-CL) and inter-domain (inter-CL) users/items for their\nrepresentation learning and knowledge transfer during the matching stage of\nCDR. However, we observe that directly employing contrastive learning on\nmixed-up intra-CL and inter-CL tasks ignores the difficulty of learning from\ninter-domain over learning from intra-domain, and thus could cause severe\ntraining instability. Therefore, this instability deteriorates the\nrepresentation learning process and hurts the quality of generated embeddings.\nTo this end, we propose a novel framework named SCCDR built up on a separated\nintra-CL and inter-CL paradigm and a stop-gradient operation to handle the\ndrawback. Specifically, SCCDR comprises two specialized curriculum stages:\nintra-inter separation and inter-domain curriculum scheduling. The former stage\nexplicitly uses two distinct contrastive views for the intra-CL task in the\nsource and target domains, respectively. Meanwhile, the latter stage\ndeliberately tackles the inter-CL tasks with a curriculum scheduling strategy\nthat derives effective curricula by accounting for the difficulty of negative\nsamples anchored by overlapping users. Empirical experiments on various\nopen-source datasets and an offline proprietary industrial dataset extracted\nfrom a real-world recommender system, and an online A/B test verify that SCCDR\nachieves state-of-the-art performance over multiple baselines.",

As a result, developing\ninterpretability methods for MLLMs is crucial for improving alignment quality\nand efficiency. In text-only LLMs, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have gained\nattention for their ability to interpret latent representations.

The classical\ntest proposed by Alan Turing focuses on behavior, requiring that an artificial\nagent's behavior be indistinguishable from that of a human. While behavioral\nsimilarity provides a strong starting point, two systems with very different\ninternal representations can produce the same outputs. Thus, in modeling\nbiological intelligence, the field of NeuroAI often aims to go beyond\nbehavioral similarity and achieve representational convergence between a\nmodel's activations and the measured activity of a biological system. This\nposition paper argues that the standard definition of the Turing Test is\nincomplete for NeuroAI, and proposes a stronger framework called the ``NeuroAI\nTuring Test'', a benchmark that extends beyond behavior alone and\n\\emph{additionally} requires models to produce internal neural representations\nthat are empirically indistinguishable from those of a brain up to measured\nindividual variability, i.e. the differences between a computational model and\nthe brain is no more than the difference between one brain and another brain.\nWhile the brain is not necessarily the ceiling of intelligence, it remains the\nonly universally agreed-upon example, making it a natural reference point for\nevaluating computational models. By proposing this framework, we aim to shift\nthe discourse from loosely defined notions of brain inspiration to a systematic\nand testable standard centered on both behavior and internal representations,\nproviding a clear benchmark for neuroscientific modeling and AI development.",

Our results suggest a\nsub-picosecond timescale for the photodissociation dynamics, and an excited\nstate lifetime of about 230 femtoseconds.

The\nbranching ratio of the C3 channel to the C2 channel where ethene and ketene are\nproduced, is estimated to be approximately 5:3. Our data suggest that the C3\nand C2 channels account for approximately 80% of the photoproducts, with the\nremaining 20% exhibiting ring-opened structures. It is found that the timescale\nassociated with the dissociation process in the C2 channel is shorter compared\nto that in the C3 channel.

    "abstract": "With the popularity of cloud computing and data-intensive applications such\nas machine learning, datacenter networks have become a critical infrastructure\nfor our digital society. Given the explosive growth of datacenter traffic and\nthe slowdown of Moore's law, significant efforts have been made to improve\ndatacenter network performance over the last decade. A particularly innovative\nsolution is reconfigurable datacenter networks (RDCNs): datacenter networks\nwhose topologies dynamically change over time, in either a demand-oblivious or\na demand-aware manner. Such dynamic topologies are enabled by recent optical\nswitching technologies and stand in stark contrast to state-of-the-art\ndatacenter network topologies, which are fixed and oblivious to the actual\ntraffic demand. In particular, reconfigurable demand-aware and 'self-adjusting'\ndatacenter networks are motivated empirically by the significant spatial and\ntemporal structures observed in datacenter communication traffic. This paper\npresents an overview of reconfigurable datacenter networks. In particular, we\ndiscuss the motivation for such reconfigurable architectures, review the\ntechnological enablers, and present a taxonomy that classifies the design space\ninto two dimensions: static vs. dynamic and demand-oblivious vs. demand-aware.\nWe further present a formal model and discuss related research challenges. Our\narticle comes with complementary video interviews in which three leading\nexperts, Manya Ghobadi, Amin Vahdat, and George Papen, share with us their\nperspectives on reconfigurable datacenter networks.",

The Lov\\'asz number is a well-known semidefinite programming\nupper bound on the independence number. Circulant graphs, an example of a\nCayley graph, are highly structured vertex-transitive graphs on integers modulo\n$n$, where the connectivity of pairs of vertices depends only on the difference\nbetween their labels. While for random circulant graphs the asymptotics of\nfundamental quantities such as the clique and the chromatic number are\nwell-understood, characterizing the exact behavior of the Lov\\'asz number\nremains open. In this work, we provide upper and lower bounds on the expected\nvalue of the Lov\\'asz number and show that it scales as the square root of the\nnumber of vertices, up to a log log factor. Our proof relies on a reduction of\nthe semidefinite program formulation of the Lov\\'asz number to a linear program\nwith random objective and constraints via diagonalization of the adjacency\nmatrix of a circulant graph by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This leads\nto a problem about controlling the norms of vectors with sparse Fourier\ncoefficients, which we study using results on the restricted isometry property\nof subsampled DFT matrices.",

    "abstract": "We study the two-dimensional viscous Boussinesq equations, which model the\nmotion of stratified flows in a circular domain influenced by a general\ngravitational potential $f$. First, we demonstrate that the Boussinesq\nequations admit steady-state solutions only in the form of hydrostatic\nequilibria, given by $(\\mathbf{u},\\rho,p)=(0,\\rho_s,p_s)$, where the pressure\ngradient satisfies $\\nabla p_s=-\\rho_s\\nabla f$. Subsequently, we establish\nthat any hydrostatic equilibrium satisfying the condition $\\nabla \\rho_s=\\delta\n(x,y)\\nabla f$ is linearly unstable if $\\delta(x,y)$ is positive at some point\n$(x,y)=(x_0,y_0)$, This instability corresponds to the well-known\nRayleigh-Taylor instability. Thirdly, by employing a series of regularity\nestimates, we reveal that although the presence of the Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability increases the velocity, the system ultimately converges to a state\nof hydrostatic equilibrium. This result is achieved by analyzing perturbations\naround any state of hydrostatic equilibrium, including both stable and unstable\nconfigurations. Specifically, the state of hydrostatic equilibrium can be\nexpressed as $\\rho=-\\gamma f+\\beta$,where $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ are positive\nconstants, provided that the global perturbation satisfies additional\nconditions.

However, it has\ntwo notable weaknesses. First, the selection of the supervectors, sub-vectors\nthat form the core of BAT-MCS, is overly simplistic, potentially affecting\noverall performance. Second, the calculation of the approximate reliability is\ncomplicated, which limits its strength in reducing variance. In this study, a\nnew BAT-MCS called cBAT-MCS is proposed to enhance the performance of the\nBAT-MCS. The approach reduces the complexity of MCS.

It accomplishes\nthis by transferring knowledge from well-established source domains to a less\nfamiliar target domain. However, traditional transfer learning methods often\nface difficulties due to rigid model assumptions and the need for a high degree\nof similarity between source and target domain models. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel method for transfer learning called Transfer learning through\nEnhanced Sufficient Representation (TESR). Our approach begins by estimating a\nsufficient and invariant representation from the source domains. This\nrepresentation is then enhanced with an independent component derived from the\ntarget data, ensuring that it is sufficient for the target domain and adaptable\nto its specific characteristics. A notable advantage of TESR is that it does\nnot rely on assuming similar model structures across different tasks. For\nexample, the source domain models can be regression models, while the target\ndomain task can be classification. This flexibility makes TESR applicable to a\nwide range of supervised learning problems. We explore the theoretical\nproperties of TESR and validate its performance through simulation studies and\nreal-world data applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in finite sample\nsettings.",

For QREM\nand QD model, $W_c(n)$ grows as a power law of $n$ (with logarithmic\ncorrections), in agreement with analytical predictions $W_c^{\\rm QREM}(n) \\sim\nn^{1/2} \\ln n$ and $W_c^{\\rm QD}(n) \\gtrsim n^{3/4} \\ln^{1/2} n$. This growth\nis in stark contrast to the 1D model, where $W_c(n)$ is essentially independent\nof $n$, consistent with the analytic expectation $W_c^{\\rm 1D}(n\\to \\infty)=\n{\\rm const}$. We also determine the scaling of the transition width $\\Delta W\n(n) / W_c(n)$ and estimate the system size $n$ needed to study the asymptotic\nscaling behavior. While these values of $n$ are not accessible to exact\nsimulations on a classical computer, they are within the reach of quantum\nsimulators. Our results indicate feasibility of experimental studies of $n$-$W$\nphase diagrams and scaling properties of MBL transitions in models of 1D and QD\ntype and in their extensions to other spatial geometry or distance-dependent\ninteractions.",

In this work, we propose a general approach to\ngenerating multi-component structures with two-dimensional altermagnetism,\nbased on symmetry analysis. Specifically, by analyzing the space group of the\ncrystal structures and their subgroups, we systematically categorize equivalent\natomic positions and arrange them into orbits based on symmetry operations.\nChemical elements are then allowed to occupy all atomic positions on these\norbits, generating candidate structures with specific symmetries. We present a\ngeneral technique for generating collinear-compensated magnetic order,\ncharacterized by the symmetrical interconnection between opposite-spin\nsublattices, and employ first-principles calculations to determine magnetic\nground states of multi-component materials. This approach integrates symmetry\nanalysis with the screening of altermagnetic configurations to evaluate the\nlikelihood of candidates possessing altermagnetism. To verify the methodology,\nwe provide examples of previously unreported 2D altermagnets, such as\nCr2Si2S3Se3, Fe2P2S3Se3, and V2O2BrI3, and evaluate their dynamical stability\nby calculating the phonon spectrum.

For this reason, we propose Cross- and Sub-band Mamba (CSMamba).\nTo assist the SSM in handling different sub-band features flexibly, we propose\na band split block that splits the full-band into four sub-bands with different\nwidths based on their information similarity. We then allocate independent\nweights to each sub-band, thereby reducing the inference burden on the SSM.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the forgetting of low-energy information in the\nhigh-frequency bands by the SSM, we introduce a spectrum restoration block that\nenhances the representation of the cross-band features from multiple\nperspectives. Experimental results on the DNS Challenge 2021 dataset\ndemonstrate that CSMamba outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech\nenhancement methods in three objective evaluation metrics with fewer\nparameters.",

    "abstract": "This manuscript presents a multilevel analysis of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We\nfocus on the plateau phase, which is often observed in the light curves (LCs)\nof GRBs. We discuss its observational properties and then thoroughly examine\npossible theoretical models to explain them. Inspired by the limitations of\nmany currently known models, we introduce a novel scenario of an LC powered by\nthe kinetic energy of a rotating black hole (BH). We investigate observational\ncorrelations between the properties of GRBs across the gamma, X-ray, and\noptical bands during the prompt and plateau phases of their LCs. Our analysis\nincludes all GRBs with known redshifts detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift\nObservatory (Swift) and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi), as well as\nground-based optical telescopes. We identify a tight correlation with the R^2\ncoefficient of ~0.89 for the three-dimensional Dainotti relation between the\nluminosity at the end of the plateau, its duration measured by Swift, and the\npeak luminosity measured by Fermi in the 10-1000 keV band. When accounting for\nredshift evolution, we achieve very small intrinsic scatter\n$\\sigma_{int}=0.25\\pm0.04$ (~43% reduction compared to the previous results).\nAdditionally, we explore correlations involving the optical luminosity at the\nend of the plateau, yielding promising results. We investigate the clustering\nof different classes of GRBs in the investigated parameter space and discuss\nits impact on the aforementioned correlations as well as $E_{iso}$-$E^*_{peak}$\ncorrelation. Notably, we demonstrate how to use the correlations as a powerful\nclass discriminator. Finally, we discuss the theory supporting the evidence of\nthe plateau emission. We present a new paradigm for the GRB plateau: energy\nextraction from a quickly rotating black hole (BH) via spin-down by a\nmagnetically arrested disk (MAD).

    "abstract": "A critical stage in the evolving landscape of VLSI design is the design phase\nthat is transformed into register-transfer level (RTL), which specifies system\nfunctionality through hardware description languages like Verilog. Generally,\nevaluating the quality of an RTL design demands full synthesis via electronic\ndesign automation (EDA) tool is time-consuming process that is not well-suited\nto rapid design iteration and optimization. Although recent breakthroughs in\nmachine Learning (ML) have brought early prediction models, these methods\nusually do not provide robust and generalizable solutions with respect to a\nwide range of RTL designs. This paper proposes a pre-synthesis framework that\nmakes early estimation of power, performance and area (PPA) metrics directly\nfrom the hardware description language (HDL) code making direct use of library\nfiles instead of toggle files. The proposed framework introduces a bit-level\nrepresentation referred to as the simple operator graph (SOG), which uses\nsingle-bit operators to generate a generalized and flexible structure that\nclosely mirrors the characteristics of post synthesis design. The proposed\nmodel bridges the RTL and post-synthesis design, which will help in precisely\npredicting key metrics. The proposed tree-based ML framework shows superior\npredictive performance PPA estimation. Validation is carried out on 147\ndistinct RTL designs. The proposed model with 147 different designs shows\naccuracy of 98%, 98%, and 90% for WNS, TNS and power, respectively, indicates\nsignificant accuracy improvements relative to state-of-the-art methods.",

Drawing\ninspiration from research in robotics, a viable solution to manage this\ncomplexity is the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although the use\nof LLMs in network orchestration has recently gained attention, existing\nsolutions have not sufficiently addressed LLM hallucinations or their\nadaptation to network dynamics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a\nframework called Autonomous Reinforcement Coordination (ARC) for a\nSemCom-enabled SAGIN.

ARC decomposes orchestration into two tiers, utilizing LLMs for\nhigh-level planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for low-level\ndecision-making, in alignment with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept. The\nLLMs utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for few-shot learning, empowered\nby contrastive learning, while the RL agents employ replay buffer management\nfor continual learning, thereby achieving efficiency, accuracy, and\nadaptability.

(2) To further\nintegrate the estimation results, we introduce a novel fusion approach that\nemploys a learned model to predict the weights of the selected estimators and\nthen applies a weighted sum to merge them. By combining these strategies, the\nproposed AdaNDV fundamentally distinguishes itself from previous works that\ndirectly estimate NDV. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on real-world\ndatasets, with the number of individual columns being several orders of\nmagnitude larger than in previous studies, demonstrate the superior performance\nof our method.",

We\npropose the concept and formulas of the shared visibility window for satellites\ntoward two ground devices. Our analysis covers cross-correlation results with\nvarying spreading factors (SF) for no-Doppler and with-Doppler cases. We find\nthe maximum cross-correlation with different SFs and the mean cross-correlation\nare immune to the Doppler effect. However, the maximum cross-correlation with\nthe same SFs is only immune to high Doppler shift, with its value fluctuating\nbetween 0.6 and 1 under high Doppler rate. We interpret this fluctuation by\nintroducing the relationship between transmission start time and\ncross-correlation. We provide a parameter analysis for orbit height, ground\ndevice distance, and inclination angle. Additionally, we analyze the bit error\nrate (BER) for LoRa signals and observe worse performance under high Doppler\nshift or interference with same SF. Increasing the SNR or the SIR improves the\nBER only when Doppler effect is below a frequency threshold. Notably, under\nDoppler effect, the performance behaviors of BER no longer align with those of\nmaximum cross-correlation. Finally, our results lead to two recommendations: 1)\nTo mitigate Doppler impact on cross-correlation, we recommend utilizing low\nSFs, high orbit height, short ground device distance, and the transmission\nstart time with high Doppler shift; 2) To mitigate Doppler impact on BER, we\nrecommend employing low SFs, high bandwidth, and transmission start time with\nhigh Doppler rate. These conflicting recommendations regarding transmission\nstart time highlight the necessity of Doppler shift compensation techniques to\nhelp operate LoRa in space properly.",

Experiments were conducted using the Stanford\nSentiment Treebank (SST-2) corpora on the DistilBERT base uncased finetuned\nSST-2 English sentiment analysis model, and the results show that the HNN model\ncan achieve up to 82.5% of the accuracy of the plain model while maintaining\nfull privacy and security.",

While modern instruction-finetuned LLMs incorporate alignment\nduring training, they still frequently require moderation tools to prevent\nunsafe behavior. The most common approach to moderation are guard models that\nflag unsafe inputs. However, guards require costly training and are typically\nlimited to fixed-size, pre-trained options, making them difficult to adapt to\nevolving risks and resource constraints. We hypothesize that\ninstruction-finetuned LLMs already encode safety-relevant information\ninternally and explore training-free safety assessment methods that work with\noff-the-shelf models. We show that simple prompting allows models to recognize\nharmful inputs they would otherwise mishandle. We also demonstrate that safe\nand unsafe prompts are distinctly separable in the models' latent space.\nBuilding on this, we introduce the Latent Prototype Moderator (LPM), a\ntraining-free moderation method that uses Mahalanobis distance in latent space\nto assess input safety. LPM is a lightweight, customizable add-on that\ngeneralizes across model families and sizes. Our method matches or exceeds\nstate-of-the-art guard models across multiple safety benchmarks, offering a\npractical and flexible solution for scalable LLM moderation.",

    "abstract": "In the past three decades, a wide array of computational methodologies and\nsimulation frameworks has emerged to address the complexities of modeling\nmulti-phase flow and transport processes in fractured porous media. The\nconformal mesh approaches which explicitly align the computational grid with\nfracture surfaces are considered by many to be the most accurate. However, such\nmethods require excessive fine-scale meshing, rendering them impractical for\nlarge or complex fracture networks. In this work, we propose to learn the\ncomplex multi-phase flow and transport dynamics in fractured porous media with\ngraph neural networks (GNN). GNNs are well suited for this task due to the\nunstructured topology of the computation grid resulting from the Embedded\nDiscrete Fracture Model (EDFM) discretization. We propose two deep learning\narchitectures, a GNN and a recurrent GNN. Both networks follow a two-stage\ntraining strategy: an autoregressive one step roll-out, followed by a\nfine-tuning step where the model is supervised using the whole ground-truth\nsequence. We demonstrate that the two-stage training approach is effective in\nmitigating error accumulation during autoregressive model rollouts in the\ntesting phase. Our findings indicate that both GNNs generalize well to unseen\nfracture realizations, with comparable performance in forecasting saturation\nsequences, and slightly better performance for the recurrent GNN in predicting\npressure sequences. While the second stage of training proved to be beneficial\nfor the GNN model, its impact on the recurrent GNN model was less pronounced.\nFinally, the performance of both GNNs for temporal extrapolation is tested. The\nrecurrent GNN significantly outperformed the GNN in terms of accuracy, thereby\nunderscoring its superior capability in predicting long sequences.",

To alleviate the hallucinations and lack of knowledge issues of\nLLMs, existing methods often retrieve the question-related information from KGs\nto enrich the input context. However, most methods focus on retrieving the\nrelevant information while ignoring the importance of different types of\nknowledge in reasoning, which degrades their performance. To this end, this\npaper reformulates the KGQA problem as a graphical model and proposes a\nthree-stage framework named the Evidence Path Enhanced Reasoning Model (EPERM)\nfor KGQA. In the first stage, EPERM uses the fine-tuned LLM to retrieve a\nsubgraph related to the question from the original knowledge graph. In the\nsecond stage, EPERM filters out the evidence paths that faithfully support the\nreasoning of the questions, and score their importance in reasoning. Finally,\nEPERM uses the weighted evidence paths to reason the final answer. Since\nconsidering the importance of different structural information in KGs for\nreasoning, EPERM can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs in KGQA tasks.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that EPERM achieves\nsuperior performances in KGQA tasks.",

In recent years, the development of machine learning and deep\nlearning has greatly bolstered the power of computational pathology. However,\nthere still remains the issue of data scarcity and data imbalance, which can\nhave an adversarial effect on any computational method. In this paper, we\nintroduce an efficient and effective data augmentation strategy to generate new\npathology images from the existing pathology images and thus enrich datasets\nwithout additional data collection or annotation costs. To evaluate the\nproposed method, we employed two sets of colorectal cancer datasets and\nobtained improved classification results, suggesting that the proposed simple\napproach holds the potential for alleviating the data scarcity and imbalance in\ncomputational pathology.",

    "abstract": "Visually-situated text parsing (VsTP) has recently seen notable advancements,\ndriven by the growing demand for automated document understanding and the\nemergence of large language models capable of processing document-based\nquestions. While various methods have been proposed to tackle the complexities\nof VsTP, existing solutions often rely on task-specific architectures and\nobjectives for individual tasks. This leads to modal isolation and complex\nworkflows due to the diversified targets and heterogeneous schemas. In this\npaper, we introduce OmniParser V2, a universal model that unifies VsTP typical\ntasks, including text spotting, key information extraction, table recognition,\nand layout analysis, into a unified framework. Central to our approach is the\nproposed Structured-Points-of-Thought (SPOT) prompting schemas, which improves\nmodel performance across diverse scenarios by leveraging a unified\nencoder-decoder architecture, objective, and input\\&output representation. SPOT\neliminates the need for task-specific architectures and loss functions,\nsignificantly simplifying the processing pipeline. Our extensive evaluations\nacross four tasks on eight different datasets show that OmniParser V2 achieves\nstate-of-the-art or competitive results in VsTP. Additionally, we explore the\nintegration of SPOT within a multimodal large language model structure, further\nenhancing text localization and recognition capabilities, thereby confirming\nthe generality of SPOT prompting technique.

The core problem of multi-teacher KD is how\nto balance distillation strengths among various teachers. Most existing methods\noften develop weighting strategies from an individual perspective of teacher\nperformance or teacher-student gaps, lacking comprehensive information for\nguidance. This paper proposes Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation with\nReinforcement Learning (MTKD-RL) to optimize multi-teacher weights. In this\nframework, we construct both teacher performance and teacher-student gaps as\nstate information to an agent. The agent outputs the teacher weight and can be\nupdated by the return reward from the student. MTKD-RL reinforces the\ninteraction between the student and teacher using an agent in an RL-based\ndecision mechanism, achieving better matching capability with more meaningful\nweights. Experimental results on visual recognition tasks, including image\nclassification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrate\nthat MTKD-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the existing\nmulti-teacher KD works.",

    "abstract": "In computational pathology, researchers often face challenges due to the\nscarcity of labeled pathology datasets. Data augmentation emerges as a crucial\ntechnique to mitigate this limitation. In this study, we introduce an efficient\ndata augmentation method for pathology images, called USegMix. Given a set of\npathology images, the proposed method generates a new, synthetic image in two\nphases. In the first phase, USegMix constructs a pool of tissue segments in an\nautomated and unsupervised manner using superpixels and the Segment Anything\nModel (SAM). In the second phase, USegMix selects a candidate segment in a\ntarget image, replaces it with a similar segment from the segment pool, and\nblends them by using a pre-trained diffusion model. In this way, USegMix can\ngenerate diverse and realistic pathology images. We rigorously evaluate the\neffectiveness of USegMix on two pathology image datasets of colorectal and\nprostate cancers. The results demonstrate improvements in cancer classification\nperformance, underscoring the substantial potential of USegMix for pathology\nimage analysis.",

This paradox, in which error generation continues despite high-quality\ntraining data, calls for a deeper understanding of the underlying LLM\nmechanisms. To address it, we propose a novel concept: knowledge overshadowing,\nwhere model's dominant knowledge can obscure less prominent knowledge during\ntext generation, causing the model to fabricate inaccurate details. Building on\nthis idea, we introduce a novel framework to quantify factual hallucinations by\nmodeling knowledge overshadowing. Central to our approach is the log-linear\nlaw, which predicts that the rate of factual hallucination increases linearly\nwith the logarithmic scale of (1) Knowledge Popularity, (2) Knowledge Length,\nand (3) Model Size. The law provides a means to preemptively quantify\nhallucinations, offering foresight into their occurrence even before model\ntraining or inference. Built on overshadowing effect, we propose a new decoding\nstrategy CoDa, to mitigate hallucinations, which notably enhance model\nfactuality on Overshadow (27.9%), MemoTrap (13.1%) and NQ-Swap (18.3%). Our\nfindings not only deepen understandings of the underlying mechanisms behind\nhallucinations but also provide actionable insights for developing more\npredictable and controllable language models.",

    "abstract": "Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for Sequential Recommendation (SR), which\nlearns a continuous distribution for each user-item interaction sequence rather\nthan a determinate embedding, is robust against data deficiency and achieves\nsignificant performance. However, existing VAE-based SR models assume a\nunimodal Gaussian distribution as the prior distribution of sequence\nrepresentations, leading to restricted capability to capture complex user\ninterests and limiting recommendation performance when users have more than one\ninterest. Due to that it is common for users to have multiple disparate\ninterests, we argue that it is more reasonable to establish a multimodal prior\ndistribution in SR scenarios instead of a unimodal one. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose a novel VAE-based SR model named SIGMA. SIGMA assumes that\nthe prior of sequence representation conforms to a Gaussian mixture\ndistribution, where each component of the distribution semantically corresponds\nto one of multiple interests. For multi-interest elicitation, SIGMA includes a\nprobabilistic multi-interest extraction module that learns a unimodal Gaussian\ndistribution for each interest according to implicit item hyper-categories.\nAdditionally, to incorporate the multimodal interests into sequence\nrepresentation learning, SIGMA constructs a multi-interest-aware ELBO, which is\ncompatible with the Gaussian mixture prior. Extensive experiments on public\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SIGMA. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/libeibei95/SIGMA.",

Precise canopy\nmapping is essential for Agri-UGVs to plan efficient routes and avoid protected\nzones. The motion control of Agri-UGVs, tasked with impurity removal and other\noperations, depends heavily on accurate estimation of rice canopy height and\nstructure. To achieve this, the proposed algorithm integrates real-time RGB-D\nsensor data with kinematic and inertial measurements, enabling efficient\nmapping and proprioceptive localization. The algorithm produces grid-based\nelevation maps that reflect the probabilistic distribution of canopy contours,\naccounting for motion-induced uncertainties. It is implemented on a\nhigh-clearance Agri-UGV platform and tested in various environments, including\nboth controlled and dynamic rice field settings. This approach significantly\nenhances the mapping accuracy and operational reliability of Agri-UGVs,\ncontributing to more efficient autonomous agricultural operations.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of blockchain technology has driven the widespread\napplication of decentralized applications (DApps) across various fields.\nHowever, DApps cannot directly access external data and rely on oracles to\ninteract with off-chain data. As a bridge between blockchain and external data\nsources, oracles pose potential risks of malicious behavior, which may inject\nincorrect or harmful data, leading to trust and security issues. Additionally,\nwith the surge in data requests, the disparity in oracle trustworthiness and\ncosts has increased, making the dynamic selection of the most suitable oracle\nfor each request a critical challenge. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a Trust-Aware and Cost-Optimized Blockchain Oracle Selection Model\nwith Deep Reinforcement Learning (TCO-DRL). The model incorporates a\ncomprehensive trust management mechanism to evaluate oracle reputation from\nmultiple dimensions and employs an improved sliding time window to monitor\nreputation changes in real time, enhancing resistance to malicious attacks.\nMoreover, TCO-DRL uses deep reinforcement learning algorithms to dynamically\nadapt to fluctuations in oracle reputation, ensuring the selection of\nhigh-reputation oracles while optimizing node selection, thereby reducing costs\nwithout compromising data quality. We implemented and validated TCO- DRL on\nEthereum. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, TCO-DRL\nreduces the allocation rate to malicious oracles by more than 39.10% and saves\nover 12.00% in costs. Furthermore, simulated experiments on various malicious\nattacks further validate the robustness and effectiveness of TCO-DRL",

    "abstract": "The study of Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is a nascent field\nof research that involves the automated recognition of facial expressions in\nvideo data. Although existing research has primarily focused on learning\nrepresentations under noisy and hard samples, the issue of the coexistence of\nboth types of samples remains unresolved. In order to overcome this challenge,\nthis paper proposes a robust method of distinguishing between hard and noisy\nsamples. This is achieved by evaluating the prediction agreement of the model\non different sampled clips of the video. Subsequently, methodologies that\nreinforce the learning of hard samples and mitigate the impact of noisy samples\ncan be employed. Moreover, to identify the principal expression in a video and\nenhance the model's capacity for representation learning, comprising a key\nexpression re-sampling framework and a dual-stream hierarchical network is\nproposed, namely Robust Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (RDFER). The key\nexpression re-sampling framework is designed to identify the key expression,\nthereby mitigating the potential confusion caused by non-target expressions.\nRDFER employs two sequence models with the objective of disentangling\nshort-term facial movements and long-term emotional changes. The proposed\nmethod has been shown to outperform current State-Of-The-Art approaches in DFER\nthrough extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets such as DFEW and\nFERV39K. A comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights and observations\nregarding the proposed agreement. This work has significant implications for\nthe field of dynamic facial expression recognition and promotes the further\ndevelopment of the field of noise-consistent robust learning in dynamic facial\nexpression recognition.

A\nunified framework is proposed for the stratification phenomena in systems that\nfeature size or shape dispersity on the basis of two processes: diffusion and\ndiffusiophoresis. In general, diffusion favors the accumulation of particles\nthat diffuse more slowly at the evaporation front. However, particles with\nlarger surface areas have larger diffusiophoretic mobilities and are more\nlikely to be driven away from the evaporation front by the concentration\ngradients of other particles with smaller surface areas. In the case of a\nbidisperse colloidal suspension containing small and large solid spheres\nstudied in most of the work reported in the literature, the competition between\nthe two leads to the so-called \"small-on-top\" stratification when the\nsuspension is rapidly dried, as diffusiophoresis dominates near the interface.\nHere we employ a computational model of composite particles that mimics the\nRouse model of polymers, where the diffusion coefficient of a particle is\ninversely proportional to its mass. For a mixture of solid spheres and\naspherical particles or hollow spheres with similar masses, the diffusion\ncontrast is reduced and the solid spheres are always enriched at the\nevaporation front, as they have the smallest surface area for a given mass and\ntherefore the lowest diffusiophoretic mobility. The unified framework is\nfurther corroborated with a case study of a mixture of solid and hollow spheres\nhaving the same outer radius and thus the same surface area. In this case, the\ndiffusiophoretic contrast is suppressed and the solid spheres, which have a\nlarger mass and thus a smaller diffusion coefficient, are found to accumulate\nat the evaporation front.",

Pre-processing-based defense, which is one of\nthe most important defense paradigms, typically focuses on input\ntransformations or backdoor trigger inversion (BTI) to deactivate or eliminate\nembedded backdoor triggers during the inference process. However, these methods\nsuffer from inherent limitations: transformation-based defenses often fail to\nbalance model utility and defense performance, while BTI-based defenses\nstruggle to accurately reconstruct trigger patterns without prior knowledge. In\nthis paper, we propose REFINE, an inversion-free backdoor defense method based\non model reprogramming. REFINE consists of two key components: \\textbf{(1)} an\ninput transformation module that disrupts both benign and backdoor patterns,\ngenerating new benign features; and \\textbf{(2)} an output remapping module\nthat redefines the model's output domain to guide the input transformations\neffectively.

However, existing FL frameworks struggle to address statistical and\nmodel heterogeneity, which severely impacts model performance. While\nHeterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) introduces prototype-based strategies\nto address the challenges, current approaches face limitations in achieving\noptimal separation of prototypes. This paper presents FedORGP, a novel HtFL\nalgorithm designed to improve global prototype separation through orthogonality\nregularization, which not only encourages intra-class prototype similarity but\nalso significantly expands the inter-class angular separation. With the\nguidance of the global prototype, each client keeps its embeddings aligned with\nthe corresponding prototype in the feature space, promoting directional\nindependence that integrates seamlessly with the cross-entropy (CE) loss. We\nprovide theoretical proof of FedORGP's convergence under non-convex conditions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FedORGP outperforms seven\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 10.12\\% accuracy improvement in\nscenarios where statistical and model heterogeneity coexist.",

    "abstract": "Kinks (or domain walls) are localized transitions between distinct ground\nstates associated with a topological invariant, and are central to many\nphenomena across physics, from condensed matter to cosmology. While phonon\n(i.e., small-amplitude vibration) wave packets have been theorized to\ndeterministically interact with kinks and initiate their movement, this\ninteraction has remained elusive in experiments, where only uncontrollable\nstochastic kink motion generated by thermal phonons or dislocation glide by\nlow-frequency quasi-static loading have been observed. This is partly because\nall physical systems that support kinks are, at some level, discrete, making\ndeterministic phonon control of kinks extremely challenging due to the\nexistence of Peierls-Nabarro (PN) barrier. Here, we demonstrate, for the first\ntime, experimental observation of phonon-mediated control and generation of\nmechanical kinks, which we enable using a topological metamaterial that\nconstitutes an elastic realization of the Kane-Lubensky chain model. Our\nmetamaterial overcomes the PN barrier by supporting a single, topologically\nprotected kink that requires zero energy to form and move. Using simulations\nthat show close agreement with our experimental observations, we also reveal\nunique dynamics of phonon interplay with highly discrete kinks, including\nlong-duration motion and a continuous family of internal modes, features absent\nin other discrete nonlinear systems. This work introduces a new paradigm for\ntopological kink control, with potential applications in material stiffness\ntuning, shape morphing, locomotion, and robust signal transmission.",

However, many existing models fail to fully exploit the\nextensive atmospheric information available, relying primarily on precipitation\ndata alone. This study introduces two novel deep learning architectures,\nSmaAt-fUsion and SmaAt-Krige-GNet, specifically designed to enhance\nprecipitation nowcasting by integrating multi-variable weather station data\nwith radar datasets. By leveraging additional meteorological information, these\nmodels improve representation learning in the latent space, resulting in\nenhanced nowcasting performance. The SmaAt-fUsion model extends the SmaAt-UNet\nframework by incorporating weather station data through a convolutional layer,\nintegrating it into the bottleneck of the network. Conversely, the\nSmaAt-Krige-GNet model combines precipitation maps with weather station data\nprocessed using Kriging, a geo-statistical interpolation method, to generate\nvariable-specific maps. These maps are then utilized in a dual-encoder\narchitecture based on SmaAt-GNet, allowing multi-level data integration.\nExperimental evaluations were conducted using four years (2016--2019) of\nweather station and precipitation radar data from the Netherlands. Results\ndemonstrate that SmaAt-Krige-GNet outperforms the standard SmaAt-UNet, which\nrelies solely on precipitation radar data, in low precipitation scenarios,\nwhile SmaAt-fUsion surpasses SmaAt-UNet in both low and high precipitation\nscenarios. This highlights the potential of incorporating discrete weather\nstation data to enhance the performance of deep learning-based weather\nnowcasting models.",

    "abstract": "To deploy machine learning models in the real world, researchers have\nproposed many OOD detection algorithms to help models identify unknown samples\nduring the inference phase and prevent them from making untrustworthy\npredictions. Unlike methods that rely on extra data for outlier exposure\ntraining, post hoc methods detect Out-of-Distribution (OOD) samples by\ndeveloping scoring functions, which are model agnostic and do not require\nadditional training. However, previous post hoc methods may fail to capture the\ngeometric cues embedded in network representations. Thus, in this study, we\npropose a novel score function based on the optimal transport theory, named\nOTOD, for OOD detection. We utilize information from features, logits, and the\nsoftmax probability space to calculate the OOD score for each test sample. Our\nexperiments show that combining this information can boost the performance of\nOTOD with a certain margin. Experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100\nbenchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method. Notably, OTOD\noutperforms the state-of-the-art method GEN by 7.19% in the mean FPR@95 on the\nCIFAR-10 benchmark using ResNet-18 as the backbone, and by 12.51% in the mean\nFPR@95 using WideResNet-28 as the backbone.

We examined facial features,\nincluding eye movements, head position, facial landmarks, and facial action\nunits, and used self-reported survey data to establish ground truth for\nmulticlass (anxious, neutral, non-anxious) and binary (e.g., anxious vs.\nneutral) classifications. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest\nclassifier trained on the top 20% of features achieved the highest accuracy of\n91.0% for multiclass classification and an average accuracy of 92.33% across\nbinary classifications. Notably, head position and facial landmarks yielded the\nbest performance for individual facial regions, achieving 85.0% and 88.0%\naccuracy, respectively, in multiclass classification, and 89.66% and 91.0%\naccuracy, respectively, across binary classifications. This study introduces a\nnon-intrusive, cost-effective solution that can be seamlessly integrated into\neveryday smartphones for continuous anxiety monitoring, offering a promising\npathway for early detection and intervention.",

Current research\npredominantly focuses on examining the connection between individual neurons\nand the model's final predictions. Which suffers from challenges in\ninterpreting the internal workings of the model, particularly when neurons\nencode multiple unrelated features. In this paper, we propose a novel framework\nthat transitions the focus from analyzing individual neurons to investigating\ngroups of neurons, shifting the emphasis from neuron-output relationships to\nfunctional interaction between neurons. Our automated framework, NeurFlow,\nfirst identifies core neurons and clusters them into groups based on shared\nfunctional relationships, enabling a more coherent and interpretable view of\nthe network's internal processes. This approach facilitates the construction of\na hierarchical circuit representing neuron interactions across layers, thus\nimproving interpretability while reducing computational costs. Our extensive\nempirical studies validate the fidelity of our proposed NeurFlow. Additionally,\nwe showcase its utility in practical applications such as image debugging and\nautomatic concept labeling, thereby highlighting its potential to advance the\nfield of neural network explainability.",

Meta learning based label correction methods have\ndemonstrated remarkable performance in LNL by designing various meta label\nrectification tasks. However, extra clean validation set is a prerequisite for\nthese methods to perform label correction, requiring extra labor and greatly\nlimiting their practicality. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel noisy\nmeta label correction framework STCT, which counterintuitively uses noisy data\nto correct label noise, borrowing the spirit in the saying ``Set a Thief to\nCatch a Thief''. The core idea of STCT is to leverage noisy data which is\ni.i.d. with the training data as a validation set to evaluate model performance\nand perform label correction in a meta learning framework, eliminating the need\nfor extra clean data. By decoupling the complex bi-level optimization in meta\nlearning into representation learning and label correction, STCT is solved\nthrough an alternating training strategy between noisy meta correction and\nsemi-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of STCT,\nparticularly in high noise rate scenarios. STCT achieves 96.9% label correction\nand 95.2% classification performance on CIFAR-10 with 80% symmetric noise,\nsignificantly surpassing the current state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "We report the emergence of an uncharted phenomenon, termed $d$-wave\npolarization-spin locking (PSL), in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets. This\nphenomenon arises from nontrivial Berry connections, resulting in perpendicular\nelectronic polarizations in the spin-up and spin-down channels.\nSymmetry-protected $d$-wave PSL occurs exclusively in $d$-wave altermagnets\nwith tetragonal layer groups. To identify 2D altermagnets capable of exhibiting\nthis phenomenon, we propose a symmetry-eigenvalue-based criterion, and a rapid\nmethod by observing the spin-momentum locking. Using first-principles\ncalculations, monolayer Cr$_2$X$_2$O (X = Se, Te) characterizes promising\ncandidates for $d$-wave PSL, driven by the unusual charge order in these\nmonolayers. This unique polarization-spin interplay leads to spin-up and\nspin-down electrons accumulating at orthogonal edges, enabling potential\napplications as spin filters or splitters in spintronics. Furthermore, $d$-wave\nPSL introduces an unexpected spin-driven ferroelectricity in conventional\nantiferromagnets. Such magnetoelectric coupling positions $d$-wave PSL as an\nideal platform for fast antiferromagnetic memory devices.

However, LLMs\nstruggle to handle misleading retrievals and often fail to maintain their own\nreasoning when exposed to conflicting or selectively-framed evidence, making\nthem vulnerable to real-world misinformation. In such real-world retrieval\nscenarios, misleading and conflicting information is rampant, particularly in\nthe political domain, where evidence is often selectively framed, incomplete,\nor polarized. However, existing RAG benchmarks largely assume a clean retrieval\nsetting, where models succeed by accurately retrieving and generating answers\nfrom gold-standard documents. This assumption fails to align with real-world\nconditions, leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce RAGuard, a fact-checking dataset designed to evaluate\nthe robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior\nbenchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our dataset constructs its retrieval\ncorpus from Reddit discussions, capturing naturally occurring misinformation.\nIt categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and\nirrelevant, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how\nwell RAG systems navigate different retrieval information. Our benchmark\nexperiments reveal that when exposed to misleading retrievals, all tested\nLLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no\nretrieval at all), highlighting their susceptibility to noisy environments. To\nthe best of our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically\nassess RAG robustness against misleading evidence.

The\nsolution to the coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations for the fermion and Higgs\nmasses indicates that fourth generation quarks $t'$ and $b'$ with the Yukawa\ncouplings above the threshold $g_Q^c\\approx 9.1$ form condensates. This\ncritical coupling, greater than the value $g_Y^f\\approx 7$ at the ultraviolet\nfixed point of the renormalization-group evolution in the SM4, implies the\nexistence of an electroweak symmetric phase at a high energy. The $t'$ and $b'$\nYukawa couplings evolve as the energy decreases, and exceed $g_Q^c$ at a lower\nscale. The Higgs potential with the dynamical symmetry breaking effect from\nheavy quark condensates plus the one-loop temperature-dependent correction from\nthe heavy scalars formed by $t'$ and $b'$ quarks allow the first-order phase\ntransition characterized by the ratio $\\phi_c/T_c\\approx 0.9$, where $\\phi_c$\nis the location of the Higgs potential minimum at the critical temperature\n$T_c$.

Recently, it has gained\nsignificant attention, with encoder-decoder models serving as the backbone for\ngenerating meaningful captions. The encoder extracts essential visual features\nfrom the input image, transforming them into a compact representation, while\nthe decoder utilizes this representation to generate coherent textual\ndescriptions. Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant\npopularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and\ncontextual information.

However, optimizing the\nencoder is crucial as it directly influences the richness of extracted\nfeatures, which in turn affects the quality of generated captions. To address\nthis gap, we systematically evaluate twelve different convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) architectures within a transformer-based encoder framework to\nassess their effectiveness in RSIC. The evaluation consists of two stages:\nfirst, a numerical analysis categorizes CNNs into different clusters, based on\ntheir performance. The best performing CNNs are then subjected to human\nevaluation from a human-centric perspective by a human annotator. Additionally,\nwe analyze the impact of different search strategies, namely greedy search and\nbeam search, to ensure the best caption. The results highlight the critical\nrole of encoder selection in improving captioning performance, demonstrating\nthat specific CNN architectures significantly enhance the quality of generated\ndescriptions for remote sensing images.

In this study, we propose a method for the bracing\nmotion and extension of the range of motion using the environment for the\nmusculoskeletal humanoid. Here, it is necessary to recognize the stability of\nthe body when contacting the environment, and we develop a method to measure it\nby using the change in sensor values of the body when actively vibrating a part\nof the body. Experiments are conducted using the musculoskeletal humanoid\nMusashi, and the effectiveness of this method is confirmed.",

    "abstract": "Edge inference (EI) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address the\ngrowing limitations of cloud-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference\nservices, such as high response latency, limited scalability, and severe data\nprivacy exposure. However, deploying DNN models on resource-constrained edge\ndevices introduces additional challenges, including limited computation/storage\nresources, dynamic service demands, and heightened privacy risks. To tackle\nthese issues, this paper presents a novel privacy-aware optimization framework\nthat jointly addresses DNN model deployment, user-server association, and model\npartitioning, with the goal of minimizing long-term average inference delay\nunder resource and privacy constraints. The problem is formulated as a complex,\nNP-hard stochastic optimization. To efficiently handle system dynamics and\ncomputational complexity, we employ a Lyapunov-based approach to transform the\nlong-term objective into tractable per-slot decisions. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a coalition formation game to enable adaptive user-server association\nand design a greedy algorithm for model deployment within each coalition.\nExtensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly\nreduces inference delay and consistently satisfies privacy constraints,\noutperforming state-of-the-art baselines across diverse scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Research on large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable performance in\ndomains such as mathematics, programming, and literary creation. However, most\nstudies have focused on semantic memory-based question answering, neglecting\nLLMs' potential to handle episodic memory (EM)-related queries. This oversight\nhas led to suboptimal performance in applications requiring EM, including\nemotional companionship, personal AI assistants, and AI teachers. To address\nthis gap, we introduce Echo, a LLM enhanced with temporal episodic memory. We\npropose a Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework that guides the model in\ngenerating multi-turn, complex scenario episodic memory dialogue data\n(EM-Train). Temporal information is innovatively incorporated into the LLM\ntraining process, and Echo is trained using the EM-Train. Furthermore, We\ndevelop an EM-Test benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' episodic\nmemory capabilities. The EM-Test assesses performance across various time spans\nand difficulty levels, providing a comprehensive evaluation of multi-turn\nepisodic memory dialogues. Our experiments demonstrate that Echo significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on EM-Test. Additionally, a qualitative\nanalysis reveals Echo's potential to exhibit human-like episodic memory\ncapabilities. We will open-source all datasets, code, and model weights.",

Increasing evidence suggests that\ninsects possess the ability to detect and respond to noxious stimuli,\nexhibiting behaviors indicative of pain perception. This study investigates the\nrelationship between pain stimuli and physiological responses in crickets\n(Gryllidae), focusing on heart rate (ECG) and brain wave (EEG) patterns. We\napplied a range of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to\ncrickets, recording ECG and EEG data while employing a deep learning-based\nmodel to classify pain levels. Our findings revealed significant heart rate\nchanges and EEG fluctuations in response to various stimuli, with the highest\nintensity stimuli inducing marked physiological stress. The AI-based analysis,\nutilizing AlexNet for EEG signal classification, achieved 90% accuracy in\ndistinguishing between resting, low-pain, and high-pain states. While no social\nsharing of pain was observed through ECG measurements, these results contribute\nto the growing body of evidence supporting insect nociception and offer new\ninsights into their physiological responses to external stressors.

    "abstract": "Using data samples with a total integrated luminosity of 253 $\\rm pb^{-1}$\ncollected by the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider, the\ndifferential cross-sections of inclusive $\\pi^\\pm$ and $K^\\pm$ production, as a\nfunction of momentum and normalized by the total hadronic cross-section, are\nmeasured at center-of-mass energies from 2.000 to 3.671 GeV. The measured\n$\\pi^{\\pm}$ cross sections are consistent with the previously reported\n$\\pi^{0}$ cross-sections by BESIII, while the $K^{\\pm}$ cross sections are\nsystematically higher than the $K^0_S$ cross sections by a factor of\napproximately 1.4. These new results are in agreement with state-of-the-art QCD\nanalyses at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy, particularly in the large\nhadron momentum region at energy scales down to 3 GeV. These findings support\nthe validity of isospin symmetry in parton fragmentation processes.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning framework\nthat allows collaborative learning of a global model across decentralized\ndevices without uploading their local data. However, in real-world FL\nscenarios, the conventional synchronous FL mechanism suffers from inefficient\ntraining caused by slow-speed devices, commonly known as stragglers, especially\nin heterogeneous communication environments. Though asynchronous FL effectively\ntackles the efficiency challenge, it induces substantial system overheads and\nmodel degradation. Striking for a balance, semi-asynchronous FL has gained\nincreasing attention, while still suffering from the open challenge of stale\nmodels, where newly arrived updates are calculated based on outdated weights\nthat easily hurt the convergence of the global model. In this paper, we present\n{\\em SEAFL}, a novel FL framework designed to mitigate both the straggler and\nthe stale model challenges in semi-asynchronous FL. {\\em SEAFL} dynamically\nassigns weights to uploaded models during aggregation based on their staleness\nand importance to the current global model. We theoretically analyze the\nconvergence rate of {\\em SEAFL} and further enhance the training efficiency\nwith an extended variant that allows partial training on slower devices,\nenabling them to contribute to global aggregation while reducing excessive\nwaiting times. We evaluate the effectiveness of {\\em SEAFL} through extensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat {\\em SEAFL} outperforms its closest counterpart by up to $\\sim$22\\% in\nterms of the wall-clock training time required to achieve target accuracy.",

From these individual explanations, we developed a mental model for\nexplanations, which was validated and revised through a qualitative study\n(n=12).

The findings are: F1: Explanation\ncontent for data scientists comes from the application domain, system domain,\nand AI domain. F2: Explanation content can be complex and should be organized\nsequentially and/or in hierarchies (novelty claim). F3: Explanation content\nincludes context, inputs, evidence, attributes, ranked list, interim results,\nefficacy principle, and input/output relationships (novelty claim).

We demonstrate that, after\nsuitable reformulation, the likelihood expression is consistent with the path\nintegral required to be computed in the theory of false vacuum decay. In\ncontrast to the saddle-point approximation, the application of the saddle-point\nexpansion necessitates more nuanced considerations, particularly concerning the\ntreatment of the negative eigenvalues of the second derivative of the action at\nthe saddle point. We illustrate that a similar issue arises in the likelihood\ncalculation, which requires approximating the original integral contour through\nthe combination of the steepest descent contours in the field space. As a\nconcrete example, we focus on calculating the EFT likelihood under a Gaussian\ndistribution and propose a general procedure for computing the likelihood using\nthe saddle-point expansion method for arbitrary partition functions. Precise\ncomputation of the likelihood will benefit Bayesian forward modeling, thereby\nenabling more reliable theoretical predictions.",

As an incumbent seeking re-election amid a rapidly\ndeclining economy, the COVID-19 pandemic, and widespread uncertainty, Trump\nfaced heightened negative perceptions fueled by dissatisfaction with his\nhandling of the economy, race relations, the pandemic, and his leadership\nstyle. These factors galvanized younger, educated Democrats and Independents to\nvote against him in unprecedented numbers.

We show that under suitable assumptions, the\nsolutions of any infinite-horizon Markov exchange economy (i.e., recursive\nRadner equilibria -- RRE) can be formulated as the solution to a concave Markov\npseudo-game, thus establishing the existence of RRE and providing first-order\nmethods for approximating RRE.

    "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed a substantial increase in the number of\nstartups and companies offering AI-based solutions for clinical decision\nsupport in medical institutions. However, the critical nature of medical\ndecision-making raises several concerns about relying on external software. Key\nissues include potential variations in image modalities and the medical devices\nused to obtain these images, potential legal issues, and adversarial attacks.\nFortunately, the open-source nature of machine learning research has made\nfoundation models publicly available and straightforward to use for medical\napplications. This accessibility allows medical institutions to train their own\nAI-based models, thereby mitigating the aforementioned concerns. Given this\ncontext, an important question arises: how much data do medical institutions\nneed to train effective AI models? In this study, we explore this question in\nrelation to breast cancer detection, a particularly contested area due to the\nprevalence of this disease, which affects approximately 1 in every 8 women.\nThrough large-scale experiments on various patient sizes in the training set,\nwe show that medical institutions do not need a decade's worth of MRI images to\ntrain an AI model that performs competitively with the state-of-the-art,\nprovided the model leverages foundation models. Furthermore, we observe that\nfor patient counts greater than 50, the number of patients in the training set\nhas a negligible impact on the performance of models and that simple ensembles\nfurther improve the results without additional complexity.",

In\nthis paper, we focus on the Multi-Modal Cross-Domain Recommendation (MMCDR)\nproblem where different items have multi-modal information while few users are\noverlapped across domains. MMCDR is particularly challenging in two aspects:\nfully exploiting diverse multi-modal information within each domain and\nleveraging useful knowledge transfer across domains. However, previous methods\nfail to cluster items with similar characteristics while filtering out inherit\nnoises within different modalities, hurdling the model performance. What is\nworse, conventional CDR models primarily rely on overlapped users for domain\nadaptation, making them ill-equipped to handle scenarios where the majority of\nusers are non-overlapped. To fill this gap, we propose Joint Similarity Item\nExploration and Overlapped User Guidance (SIEOUG) for solving the MMCDR\nproblem. SIEOUG first proposes similarity item exploration module, which not\nonly obtains pair-wise and group-wise item-item graph knowledge, but also\nreduces irrelevant noise for multi-modal modeling. Then SIEOUG proposes\nuser-item collaborative filtering module to aggregate user/item embeddings with\nthe attention mechanism for collaborative filtering. Finally SIEOUG proposes\noverlapped user guidance module with optimal user matching for knowledge\nsharing across domains. Our empirical study on Amazon dataset with several\ndifferent tasks demonstrates that SIEOUG significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models under the MMCDR setting.",

The findings indicate that shock waves\ngenerated from the hotspot can initiate detonation through heterogeneous and\nhomogeneous reactions, with contributions from both methane and particle\ncombustion. Coal particle surface reactions provide the dominant energy for\ndetonation initiation, whereas gas-phase reactions enhance detonation stability\nduring propagation. The difficulty of achieving detonation initiation exhibits\na non-linear dependence on particle concentrations and gas equivalence ratios.\nAn optimal particle concentration and gas equivalence ratio for successful DDI\nis identified.

Key processes in DDI of two-phase mixtures are identified,\nincluding particle heating, methane combustion, and particle burning. Three DDI\nmodes, critical, stable, and cell-free, are observed based on particle\nconcentration.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach, named as Model-aware\nParametric Batch-wise Mixup (MPBM), to tackle the challenge of SDG. MPBM\ndeploys adversarial queries generated with stochastic gradient Langevin\ndynamics, and produces model-aware augmenting instances with a parametric\nbatch-wise mixup generator network that is carefully designed through an\ninnovative attention mechanism. By exploiting inter-feature correlations, the\nparameterized mixup generator introduces additional versatility in combining\nfeatures across a batch of instances, thereby enhancing the capacity to\ngenerate highly adaptive and informative synthetic instances for specific\nqueries. The synthetic data produced by this adaptable generator network,\nguided by informative queries, is expected to significantly enrich the\nrepresentation space covered by the original training dataset and subsequently\nenhance the prediction model's generalizability across diverse and previously\nunseen domains. To prevent excessive deviation from the training data, we\nfurther incorporate a real-data alignment-based adversarial loss into the\nlearning process of MPBM, regularizing any tendencies toward undesirable\nexpansions. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets. The\nempirical results demonstrate that by augmenting the training set with\ninformative synthesis data, our proposed MPBM method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance for single domain generalization.",

However, our systematic evaluation\nhighlights significant room for improvement in their accuracy when uncovering\ncausal structures. We identify a fundamental limitation: neural networks cannot\nreliably distinguish between existing and non-existing causal relationships in\nthe finite sample regime. Our experiments reveal that neural networks, as used\nin contemporary causal discovery approaches, lack the precision needed to\nrecover ground-truth graphs, even for small graphs and relatively large sample\nsizes. Furthermore, we identify the faithfulness property as a critical\nbottleneck: (i) it is likely to be violated across any reasonable dataset size\nrange, and (ii) its violation directly undermines the performance of neural\ndiscovery methods. These findings lead us to conclude that progress within the\ncurrent paradigm is fundamentally constrained, necessitating a paradigm shift\nin this domain.",

However, SOC analysts face challenges in handling adaptive adversarial\ntactics, requiring intelligent decision-support frameworks. We propose a\nCognitive Hierarchy Theory-driven Deep Q-Network (CHT-DQN) framework that\nmodels interactive decision-making between SOC analysts and AI-driven APT bots.\nThe SOC analyst (defender) operates at cognitive level-1, anticipating attacker\nstrategies, while the APT bot (attacker) follows a level-0 policy. By\nincorporating CHT into DQN, our framework enhances adaptive SOC defense using\nAttack Graph (AG)-based reinforcement learning. Simulation experiments across\nvarying AG complexities show that CHT-DQN consistently achieves higher data\nprotection and lower action discrepancies compared to standard DQN. A\ntheoretical lower bound further confirms its superiority as AG complexity\nincreases. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk\n(MTurk) reveals that SOC analysts using CHT-DQN-derived transition\nprobabilities align more closely with adaptive attackers, leading to better\ndefense outcomes. Moreover, human behavior aligns with Prospect Theory (PT) and\nCumulative Prospect Theory (CPT): participants are less likely to reselect\nfailed actions and more likely to persist with successful ones.

Treatment of boundaries of this\nnature is cumbersome due to the difficulty in explicitly tracking boundaries\nthat may exhibit topological transitions and high curvature. Such conditions\ncan also lead to numerical instability. Diffuse boundary methods such as the\nphase field method are an attractive way to describe systems with complex\nboundaries, but coupling such methods to hydrodynamic flow solvers is\nnontrivial. This work presents a systematic approach for coupling flow to\narbitrary implicitly-defined diffuse domains. It is demonstrated that all\nboundary conditions of interest can be expressed as suitable fluxes, noting\nthat angular momentum flux is necessary in order to account for cases such as\nthe no-slip condition. Moreover, it is shown that the diffuse boundary\nformulation converges exactly to the sharp interface solution, resulting in a\nwell-defined error bound. The method is applied in a viscous compressible flow\nsolver with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement, and the convergence\nproperties are shown. Finally, the efficacy of the method is demonstrated by\ncoupling to other classical flow problems (vortex shedding), problems in\nsolidification (coupling to dendritic growth), and flow through eroding media\n(coupling to the Allen Cahn equation).",

One of the most prominent\nadversarial attack methods is the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), which\nperturbs images in the direction of the loss gradient to deceive the model.\n  This paper presents a novel approach for detecting and filtering FGSM\nadversarial attacks in image processing tasks. Our proposed method evaluates\n10,000 images, each subjected to five different levels of perturbation,\ncharacterized by $\\epsilon$ values of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2. These\nperturbations are applied in the direction of the loss gradient. We demonstrate\nthat our approach effectively filters adversarially perturbed images,\nmitigating the impact of FGSM attacks.\n  The method is implemented in Python, and the source code is publicly\navailable on GitHub for reproducibility and further research.",

We further\ninvestigate the factors influencing feature quantity, revealing that model\nchoice and search strategy play critical roles in generating a richer and more\ndiverse feature set.

In the past two years, the rapid development of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) has provided an alternative solution for medium-range (1-10\ndays) weather forecasting. Bi et al.

In their work, Bi23\nmade notable claims regarding its effectiveness in extreme weather predictions.\nHowever, this claim lacks persuasiveness because the extreme nature of the two\ntropical cyclones (TCs) examples presented in Bi23, namely Typhoon Kong-rey and\nTyphoon Yutu, stems primarily from their intensities rather than their moving\npaths. Their claim may mislead into another meaning which is that Pangu-Weather\nworks well in predicting unusual typhoon paths, which was not explicitly\nanalyzed. Here, we reassess Pangu-Weather's ability to predict extreme TC\ntrajectories from 2020-2024. Results reveal that while Pangu-Weather overall\noutperforms NWP models in predicting tropical cyclone (TC) tracks, it falls\nshort in accurately predicting the rarely observed sudden-turning tracks, such\nas Typhoon Khanun in 2023.

    "abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology that enables new forms of decentralized\nsoftware architectures, where distributed components can reach agreements on\nshared system states without trusting a central integration point. Blockchain\nprovides a shared infrastructure to execute programs, called smart contracts,\nand to store data. Since blockchain technologies are at an early stage, there\nis a lack of a systematically organized knowledge providing a holistic view on\ndesigning software systems that use blockchain. We view blockchain as a\ncomponent of a bigger software system, which requires patterns for using\nblockchain in the design of the software architecture. In this paper, we\ncollect a list of patterns for blockchain-based applications. The pattern\ncollection is categorized into five categories, including interaction with\nexternal world patterns, data management patterns, security patterns,\nstructural patterns of contracts, and user interaction patterns. Some patterns\nare designed considering the nature of blockchain and how blockchains can be\nspecifically introduced within real-world applications. Others are variants of\nexisting design patterns applied in the context of blockchain-based\napplications and smart contracts.",

    "abstract": "Pulsar timing arrays recently found evidence for a gravitational wave\nbackground (GWB), likely the stochastic overlap of GWs from many supermassive\nblack hole binaries. Anticipating a continuous gravitational wave (CW)\ndetection from a single binary soon to follow, we examine how well current\nBayesian methods can detect CWs and characterize their binary properties by\nmodeling the response of the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar timing array to simulated\nbinary populations. We run Markov Chain Monte Carlo searches for CWs in these\ndatasets and compare them to quicker detection statistics including the optimal\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N), matched filter detection statistic, and reduced\nlog-likelihood ratio between the signal and noise models calculated at the\ninjected parameters. The latter is the best proxy for Bayesian detection\nfractions, corresponding to a 50% detection fraction (by Bayes factors > 10\nfavoring a CW detection over noise-only model) at an S/N = 4.6. Source\nconfusion between the GWB and a CW, or between multiple CWs, can cause false\ndetections and unexpected dismissals. 53% of realistic binary populations\nconsistent with the recently observed GWB have successful CW detections. 82% of\nthese CWs are in the 4th or 5th frequency bin of the 16.03 yr dataset (6.9 and\n10.8 nHz), with 95th percentile regions spanning 4-12nHz frequencies,\n0.7-20$\\times10^9 M_\\odot$ chirp masses, 60Mpc-8Gpc luminosity distances, and\n18-13,000 sq. deg 68% confidence localization areas. These successful\ndetections often poorly recover the chirp mass, with only 29% identifying the\nchirp mass accurately to within 1 dex with a 68% posterior width also narrower\nthan 1 dex.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential to\naccelerate drug discovery. However, the specialized nature of biochemical data\noften necessitates costly domain-specific fine-tuning, posing critical\nchallenges. First, it hinders the application of more flexible general-purpose\nLLMs in cutting-edge drug discovery tasks. More importantly, it impedes the\nrapid integration of the vast amounts of scientific data continuously generated\nthrough experiments and research. To investigate these challenges, we propose\nCLADD, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-empowered agentic system tailored\nto drug discovery tasks. Through the collaboration of multiple LLM agents,\nCLADD dynamically retrieves information from biomedical knowledge bases,\ncontextualizes query molecules, and integrates relevant evidence to generate\nresponses -- all without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. Crucially,\nwe tackle key obstacles in applying RAG workflows to biochemical data,\nincluding data heterogeneity, ambiguity, and multi-source integration. We\ndemonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of this framework across a\nvariety of drug discovery tasks, showing that it outperforms general-purpose\nand domain-specific LLMs as well as traditional deep learning approaches.",

    "abstract": "ARPES studies have established that the high-$T_c$ cuprates with single and\ndouble CuO$_2$ layers evolve from the Mott insulator to the pseudogap state\nwith a Fermi arc, on which the superconducting (SC) gap opens. In four- to\nsix-layer cuprates, on the other hand, small hole Fermi pockets are formed in\nthe innermost CuO$_2$ planes, indicating antiferromagnetism. Here, we performed\nARPES studies on the triple-layer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\\delta}$ over\na wide doping range, and found that, although the doping level of the inner\nCuO$_2$ plane was extremely low in underdoped samples, the $d$-wave SC gap was\nenhanced to the unprecedentedly large value of $\\Delta_0\\sim$100 meV at the\nantinode and persisted well above $T_{{c}}$ without the appearance of a Fermi\narc, indicating a robust ``nodal metal''. We attribute the nodal metallic\nbehavior to the unique local environment of the inner clean CuO$_2$ plane in\nthe triple-layer cuprates, sandwiched by nearly optimally-doped two outer\nCuO$_2$ planes and hence subject to strong proximity effect from both sides. In\nthe nodal metal, quasiparticle peaks showed electron-hole symmetry, suggesting\n$d$-wave pairing fluctuations. Thus the proximity effect on the innermost\nCuO${_2}$ plane is the strongest in the triple-layer cuprates, which explains\nwhy the $T_c$ reaches the maximum at the layer number of three in every\nmulti-layer cuprate family.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to deep learning models,\nparticularly in safety-critical applications like healthcare and autonomous\ndriving. Recently, patch based attacks have demonstrated effectiveness in\nreal-time inference scenarios owing to their 'drag and drop' nature. Following\nthis idea for Semantic Segmentation (SS), here we propose a novel Expectation\nOver Transformation (EOT) based adversarial patch attack that is more realistic\nfor autonomous vehicles. To effectively train this attack we also propose a\n'simplified' loss function that is easy to analyze and implement. Using this\nattack as our basis, we investigate whether adversarial patches once optimized\non a specific SS model, can fool other models or architectures. We conduct a\ncomprehensive cross-model transferability analysis of adversarial patches\ntrained on SOTA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such PIDNet-S,\nPIDNet-M and PIDNet-L, among others. Additionally, we also include the\nSegformer model to study transferability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). All of\nour analysis is conducted on the widely used Cityscapes dataset. Our study\nreveals key insights into how model architectures (CNN vs CNN or CNN vs.\nTransformer-based) influence attack susceptibility. In particular, we conclude\nthat although the transferability (effectiveness) of attacks on unseen images\nof any dimension is really high, the attacks trained against one particular\nmodel are minimally effective on other models. And this was found to be true\nfor both ViT and CNN based models. Additionally our results also indicate that\nfor CNN-based models, the repercussions of patch attacks are local, unlike\nViTs. Per-class analysis reveals that simple-classes like 'sky' suffer less\nmisclassification than others.
