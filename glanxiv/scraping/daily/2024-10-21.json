Applying\nthis formalism, we show that the ERG flow of density matrices is given by a\nLindblad master equation. The Lindbladian consists of a \"Hamiltonian\" term\nwhich is the sum of a scaling and a coarse-graining (disentangling) operator,\nand a dissipative term with absorption and emission rates for each momentum\nmode. We consider as examples the flow of Gaussian states and the perturbative\nground state of $\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory, and highlight the role of the\ndissipative terms in generating the correct flow of couplings. Integrating the\nLindblad master equation, we find that a finite ERG flow of density matrices is\ndescribed by a quantum channel. It follows from the data processing inequality\nthat any distinguishability measure of states is an ERG monotone.",

In this\nwork, we present PEtra, an open-source and versatile piezoelectric loop tracer.\nPEtra employs a transimpedance amplifier (LMP7721, TI) to convert\npicoampere-level currents into measurable voltages, covering a frequency range\nof 0.1 Hz to 5 Hz for a gain setting of 10^7 V/A, and 0.1 Hz to 200 Hz for gain\nsettings between 10^3 V/A to 10^6 V/A (10-fold increments). We demonstrate\nthrough simulations and experimental validations that PEtra achieves a\nsensitivity down to 2 pA, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional\ncharge measurement methods. Compared to the Sawyer-Tower circuit, PEtra\ndirectly amplifies currents without the need for a reference capacitor.

The number of predictors can be nearly exponentially\nlarge relative to the sample size. We put a conjugate normal prior initially\ndisregarding sparsity, but for making an inference, instead of the original\nmultivariate normal posterior, we use the posterior distribution induced by a\nmap transforming the vector of regression coefficients to a sparse vector\nobtained by minimizing the sum of squares of deviations plus a suitably scaled\n$\\ell_1$-penalty on the vector.

We first show\nhow the collisional Raman frequency shift perturbation arises in three\ndifferent physical setups. We then show by numerical simulations with a\nperturbed nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) model that transmission in waveguides\nwith weak frequency-independent linear gain is unstable. The radiative\ninstability is stronger than the radiative instabilities that were observed in\nearlier studies for soliton transmission in the presence of weak linear gain,\ncubic loss, and various frequency-shifting physical mechanisms. In particular,\nthe Fourier spectrum of the radiation is significantly more spiky and broadband\nthan the radiation's Fourier spectra in earlier studies. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate by numerical simulations with another perturbed NLS model that\ntransmission in waveguides with weak frequency-dependent linear gain-loss,\ncubic loss, and the collisional Raman frequency shift is stable. Despite the\nstronger radiative instability in the corresponding waveguide setup with weak\nlinear gain, stabilization occurs via the same generic mechanism that was\nsuggested in earlier studies. More precisely, the collisional Raman frequency\nshift experienced by the soliton leads to the separation of the soliton's and\nthe radiation's Fourier spectra, while the frequency-dependent linear gain-loss\nleads to efficient suppression of radiation emission. Thus, our study\ndemonstrates the robustness of the proposed generic soliton stabilization\nmethod, which is based on the interplay between perturbation-induced shifting\nof the soliton's frequency and frequency-dependent linear gain-loss.",

We integrate large language models (LLMs) into\nthe evolutionary optimization framework (LLM-EO) and apply it in both single-\nand multi-objective optimization for TMCs.

These simulations utilize time stepping schemes, where\neach solution is derived from the solutions of previous time steps. Although\neach time step involves relatively straightforward computations, the high\ndimensionality of the problem can significantly increase the overall\ncomputational time.\n  This work introduces a reduced order model (ROM) for finite element method in\ntime domain (FEMTD) simulations, specifically applied to microwave devices. The\nproposed methodology, called ROMTD, enables efficient analysis of time\nevolution in electromagnetic problems while substantially reducing\ncomputational demands. Its main advantage is the use of a much smaller number\nof degrees of freedom (DoFs) to capture the same electromagnetic dynamics,\ncompared to the large number of DoFs typically required by traditional methods\nsuch as finite difference in time domain (FDTD) and FEMTD. To construct the ROM\nbasis, a novel criterion for selecting FEMTD solutions is introduced, ensuring\nthat only the most relevant snapshots are retained.\n  The capabilities of the ROMTD approach are demonstrated through various\nexamples, including a quad-mode dielectric resonator filter, a side-coupled\nfour-pole filter in quarter-mode substrate integrated waveguide technology, and\na microstrip dual-band bandpass planar filter.

    "abstract": "We investigate two-dimensional crystal assemblies formed by a binary mixture\nof colloidal particles with a size ratio of 0.88 and driven by short-ranged\ndepletion interactions. Our experiments show that the orientational order of\nthe assembly decreases with an increasing fraction of impurity particles,\nreaching up to 18% reduction in a 1:1 binary mixture compared to a monodisperse\nsuspension. We observe slower growth rate and arrested dynamics in the binary\nmixture, whereas the monodisperse sample follows a two-step nucleation and\ngrowth mechanism. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the\nminimum energy states for different size ratios and number ratios of the binary\nmixture. The simulation results predict a compromised translational order but\nsustained orientational order in a binary mixture with a size ratio as high as\n0.88. From the combined experimental and numerical results, we conclude that\nthe disordered assemblies found in a binary mixture originate from the\nfrustration in assembly kinetics rather than topological frustration when there\nis a marginal mismatch between the two particle sizes.",

    "abstract": "The possibility of extracting more work from a physical system thanks to the\ninformation obtained from measurements has been a topic of fundamental interest\nin the context of thermodynamics since the formulation of the Maxwell's demon\nthought experiment. We here consider this problem from the perspective of an\nopen quantum battery interacting with an environment that can be continuously\nmeasured. By modeling it via a continuously monitored collisional model, we\nshow how to implement the corresponding dynamics as a quantum circuit,\nincluding the final conditional feedback unitary evolution that allows to\nenhance the amount of work extracted. By exploiting the flexibility of IBM\nquantum computers and by properly modelling the corresponding quantum circuit,\nwe experimentally simulate the work extraction protocol showing how the\nobtained experimental values of the daemonic extracted work are close to their\ntheoretical upper bound quantified by the so-called daemonic ergotropy. We also\ndemonstrate how by properly modelling the noise affecting the quantum circuit,\none can improve the work extraction protocol by optimizing the corresponding\nextraction unitary feedback operation.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the trade-off between short-term revenue generation\nand long-term social welfare optimization in online food delivery platforms. We\nfirst develop a static model that captures the equilibrium interactions among\nrestaurants, consumers, and delivery workers, using Gross Merchandise Value\n(GMV) as a proxy for immediate performance. Building on this, we extend our\nanalysis to a dynamic model that integrates evolving state variables,such as\nplatform reputation and participant retention-to capture long-term behavior. By\napplying dynamic programming techniques, we derive optimal strategies that\nbalance GMV maximization with social welfare enhancement. Extensive multi-agent\nsimulations validate our theoretical predictions, demonstrating that while a\nGMV-focused approach yields strong initial gains, it ultimately undermines\nlong-term stability. In contrast, a social welfare-oriented strategy produces\nmore sustainable and robust outcomes. Our findings provide actionable insights\nfor platform operators and policymakers seeking to harmonize rapid growth with\nlong-term",

    "abstract": "Video capsule endoscopy has transformed gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE)\ndiagnostics by offering a non-invasive method for capturing detailed images of\nthe gastrointestinal tract, enabling early disease detection. However, its\npotential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging\nprocedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1\nmillion images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability\nof these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity\nof large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of\ncurrent medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel\nlarge GIE dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging ten existing public\nand private datasets, ensuring patient integrity across splits. EndoExtend24\nincludes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which\nallow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity,\nsupporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to\nleverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models trained with\nself-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE\nmedical image diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the\nViT architecture and trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using\nEVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the EndoExtend24 dataset to\nachieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024\nChallenge dataset. Our model demonstrates robust performance, securing third\nplace in the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge. We achieved a macro AUC of 0.762\nand a balanced accuracy of 37.1% on the test set. These results emphasize the\neffectiveness of our domain-adaptive pre-training approach and the enriched\nEndoExtend24 dataset in advancing gastrointestinal endoscopy diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "This research presents a novel approach to predicting option movements by\nanalyzing residual transactions, which are trades that deviate from standard\nhedging activities. Unlike traditional methods that primarily focus on open\ninterest and trading volume, this study argues that residuals can reveal\nnuanced insights into institutional sentiment and strategic positioning. By\nexamining these deviations, the model identifies early indicators of market\ntrends, providing a refined framework for forecasting option prices. The\nproposed model integrates classical machine learning and regression techniques\nto analyze patterns in high frequency trading data, capturing complex, non\nlinear relationships. This predictive framework allows traders to anticipate\nshifts in option values, enhancing strategies for better market timing, risk\nmanagement, and portfolio optimization. The model's adaptability, driven by\nreal time data processing, makes it particularly effective in fast paced\ntrading environments, where early detection of institutional behavior is\ncrucial for gaining a competitive edge. Overall, this research contributes to\nthe field of options trading by offering a strategic tool that detects early\nmarket signals, optimizing trading decisions based on predictive insights\nderived from residual trading patterns. This approach bridges the gap between\nconventional metrics and the subtle behaviors of institutional players, marking\na significant advancement in options market analysis.",

    "abstract": "Operationalizing AI ethics and safety principles and frameworks is essential\nto realizing the potential benefits and mitigating potential harms caused by AI\nsystems. To that end, actors across industry, academia, and regulatory bodies\nhave created formal taxonomies of harm to support operationalization efforts.\nThese include novel holistic methods that go beyond exclusive reliance on\ntechnical benchmarking. However, our paper argues that such taxonomies must\nalso be transferred into local categories to be readily implemented in\nsector-specific AI safety operationalization efforts, and especially in\nunderresourced or high-risk sectors. This is because many sectors are\nconstituted by discourses, norms, and values that \"refract\" or even directly\nconflict with those operating in society more broadly. Drawing from emerging\nanthropological theories of human rights, we propose that the process of\n\"vernacularization\"--a participatory, decolonial practice distinct from\ndoctrinary \"translation\" (the dominant mode of AI safety\noperationalization)--can help bridge this gap. To demonstrate this point, we\nconsider the education sector, and identify precisely how vernacularizing a\nleading holistic taxonomy of harm leads to a clearer view of how harms AI\nsystems may cause are substantially intensified when deployed in educational\nspaces. We conclude by discussing the generalizability of vernacularization as\na useful AI safety methodology.",

One potential tool for influencing human decision making is performance\npressure, which hasn't been much studied in interaction with human-AI decision\nmaking. In this work, we examine how pressure and explainable AI (XAI)\ntechniques interact with AI advice-taking behavior. Using an inherently\nlow-stakes task (spam review classification), we demonstrate effective and\nsimple methods to apply pressure and influence human AI advice-taking behavior\nby manipulating financial incentives and imposing time limits. Our results show\ncomplex interaction effects, with different combinations of pressure and XAI\ntechniques either improving or worsening AI advice taking behavior.

Due to such a\ndensity locking, quantum droplets can be efficiently described by using an\nextended Gross--Pitaevskii equation within the single-mode approximation. Here,\nwe find that this single-mode description necessarily breaks down in the deep\nquantum droplet regime, when the attractive inter-species scattering length\n$a_{12}$ significantly deviates away from the threshold of mean-field collapse\n(i.e., $-\\sqrt{a_{11}a_{22}}$). By applying a bosonic pairing theory, we show\nthat the density ratio is allowed to fluctuate in a sizable interval. Most\nimportantly, the optimal density ratio would be very different from\n$\\sqrt{a_{11}/a_{22}}$, in the case of unequal intra-species scattering lengths\n($a_{11}\\neq a_{22}$). Our finding might provide a plausible microscopic\nexplanation of the puzzling low critical particle number of quantum droplets,\nas experimentally observed.

A prominent example is confinement,\nresponsible for bounding quarks inside hadrons such as protons or neutrons.\nWhen quark-antiquark pairs are separated, the energy stored in the string of\ngluon fields connecting them grows linearly with their distance, until there is\nenough energy to create new pairs from the vacuum and break the string. While\nsuch phenomena are ubiquitous in LGTs, simulating the resulting dynamics is a\nchallenging task. Here, we report the observation of string breaking in\nsynthetic quantum matter using a programmable quantum simulator based on\nneutral atom arrays. We show that a (2+1)D LGT with dynamical matter can be\nefficiently implemented when the atoms are placed on a Kagome geometry, with a\nlocal U(1) symmetry emerging from the Rydberg blockade, while long-range\nRydberg interactions naturally give rise to a linear confining potential for a\npair of charges, allowing us to tune both their masses as well as the string\ntension. We experimentally map out the corresponding phase diagram by\nadiabatically preparing the ground state of the atom array in the presence of\ndefects, and observe substructure of the confined phase, distinguishing regions\ndominated by fluctuating strings or by broken string configurations. Finally,\nby harnessing local control over the atomic detuning, we quench string states\nand observe string breaking dynamics exhibiting a many-body resonance\nphenomenon.

Persistence is\nchallenging to compute in parallel because it relies on global connectivity of\nthe data. We propose a new algorithm to compute persistent cohomology in the\ndistributed setting.

However, most existing deep-learning-based methods\nutilize only information within the RGB bands, neglecting the important role of\nthe depth band in plane instance segmentation. Based on EfficientSAM, a fast\nversion of SAM, we propose a plane instance segmentation network called\nPlaneSAM, which can fully integrate the information of the RGB bands (spectral\nbands) and the D band (geometric band), thereby improving the effectiveness of\nplane instance segmentation in a multimodal manner. Specifically, we use a\ndual-complexity backbone, with primarily the simpler branch learning D-band\nfeatures and primarily the more complex branch learning RGB-band features.\nConsequently, the backbone can effectively learn D-band feature representations\neven when D-band training data is limited in scale, retain the powerful\nRGB-band feature representations of EfficientSAM, and allow the original\nbackbone branch to be fine-tuned for the current task. To enhance the\nadaptability of our PlaneSAM to the RGB-D domain, we pretrain our\ndual-complexity backbone using the segment anything task on large-scale RGB-D\ndata through a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on imperfect\npseudo-labels. To support the segmentation of large planes, we optimize the\nloss function combination ratio of EfficientSAM. In addition, Faster R-CNN is\nused as a plane detector, and its predicted bounding boxes are fed into our\ndual-complexity network as prompts, thereby enabling fully automatic plane\ninstance segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed PlaneSAM\nsets a new SOTA performance on the ScanNet dataset, and outperforms previous\nSOTA approaches in zero-shot transfer on the 2D-3D-S, Matterport3D, and\nICL-NUIM RGB-D datasets, while only incurring a 10% increase in computational\noverhead compared to EfficientSAM.",

Manual labeling of such datasets requires domain expertise and is\nlabor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. To overcome this\nbottleneck, we developed an ensemble LLMs method and demonstrated its\neffectiveness in two real-world tasks: (1) labeling a large-scale unlabeled ECG\ndataset in MIMIC-IV; (2) identifying social determinants of health (SDOH) from\nthe clinical notes of EHR. Trading off benefits and cost, we selected a pool of\ndiverse open source LLMs with satisfactory performance. We treat each LLM's\nprediction as a vote and apply a mechanism of majority voting with minimal\nwinning threshold for ensemble. We implemented an ensemble LLMs application for\nEHR data labeling tasks. By using the ensemble LLMs and natural language\nprocessing, we labeled MIMIC-IV ECG dataset of 623,566 ECG reports with an\nestimated accuracy of 98.2%. We applied the ensemble LLMs method to identify\nSDOH from social history sections of 1,405 EHR clinical notes, also achieving\ncompetitive performance. Our experiments show that the ensemble LLMs can\noutperform individual LLM even the best commercial one, and the method reduces\nhallucination errors. From the research, we found that (1) the ensemble LLMs\nmethod significantly reduces the time and effort required for labeling\nlarge-scale EHR data, automating the process with high accuracy and quality;\n(2) the method generalizes well to other text data labeling tasks, as shown by\nits application to SDOH identification; (3) the ensemble of a group of diverse\nLLMs can outperform or match the performance of the best individual LLM; and\n(4) the ensemble method substantially reduces hallucination errors.

Inside the extended exhaust, both the\nreconnection-generated plasma jets and the accelerated protons propagated\ntoward the Sun, unambiguously establishing their origin from HCS reconnection\nsites located beyond PSP. Within the core of the exhaust, PSP detected stably\ntrapped energetic protons up to ~400 keV, which is approximately 1000 times\ngreater than the available magnetic energy per particle. The differential\nenergy spectrum of the accelerated protons behaved as a pure power-law with\nspectral index of about -5. Supporting simulations using the kglobal model\nsuggest that the trapping and acceleration of protons up to ~400 keV in the\nreconnection exhaust is likely facilitated by merging magnetic islands with a\nguide field between ~0.2-0.3 of the reconnecting magnetic field, consistent\nwith the observations. These new results, enabled by PSP's proximity to the\nSun, demonstrate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is a significant new\nsource of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind.

Current AI models prioritize task\noptimization over safety, leading to risks of unintended harm. These risks are\ndifficult to address due to the competing interests of governments, businesses,\nand advocacy groups, all of which have different priorities in the AI race.\nCurrent alignment methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF), focus on extrinsic behaviors without instilling a genuine understanding\nof human values. These models are vulnerable to manipulation and lack the\nsocial intelligence necessary to infer the mental states and intentions of\nothers, raising concerns about their ability to safely and responsibly make\nimportant decisions in complex and novel situations. Furthermore, the\ndivergence between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations in AI introduces the\nrisk of deceptive or harmful behaviors, particularly as systems become more\nautonomous and intelligent.

This paper introduces the QIXAI Framework\n(Quantum-Inspired Explainable AI), a novel approach for enhancing neural\nnetwork interpretability through quantum-inspired techniques. By utilizing\nprinciples from quantum mechanics, such as Hilbert spaces, superposition,\nentanglement, and eigenvalue decomposition, the QIXAI framework reveals how\ndifferent layers of neural networks process and combine features to make\ndecisions.\n  We critically assess model-agnostic methods like SHAP and LIME, as well as\ntechniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), highlighting their\nlimitations in providing a comprehensive view of neural network operations. The\nQIXAI framework overcomes these limitations by offering deeper insights into\nfeature importance, inter-layer dependencies, and information propagation. A\nCNN for malaria parasite detection is used as a case study to demonstrate how\nquantum-inspired methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA), and Mutual Information (MI) provide interpretable\nexplanations of model behavior. Additionally, we explore the extension of QIXAI\nto other architectures, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformers, and Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) models, and its application to generative models and\ntime-series analysis. The framework applies to both quantum and classical\nsystems, demonstrating its potential to improve interpretability and\ntransparency across a range of models, advancing the broader goal of developing\ntrustworthy AI systems.",

The goals and objectives of both the service\nprovider and service consumer agents are relevant to the goals of the\nrespective citizens (end users). The provider agents often pursue selfish goals\nthat can make the service quality highly volatile, contributing towards the\nnon-stationary nature of the environment. The number of active service\nproviders tends to change over time resulting in an open environment. This\nnecessitates a rapid and continual assessment of the Trust and Reputation.

This paper addresses the problem\nof multi-agent Trust and Reputation Assessment in a non-stationary environment\ninvolving transactions between providers and consumers. In this setting, the\nobserver agents carry out the assessment and communicate their assessed trust\nscores with each other over a network. We propose a novel Distributed Online\nLife-Long Learning (DOL3) algorithm that involves real-time rapid learning of\ntrust and reputation scores of providers.

Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of\nNonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing\nequations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct\nadvantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the\nSINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of\nestablished approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This\nfacilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and\ncoefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise\nparameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear\ncharacteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or\npolynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy.

The results demonstrate significant improvements in\nidentifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of\nconcurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by\nnonlinear parameters.

    "abstract": "We introduce a dynamic spatiotemporal volatility model that extends\ntraditional approaches by incorporating spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal\nspillover effects, along with volatility-specific observed and latent factors.\nThe model offers a more general network interpretation, making it applicable\nfor studying various types of network spillovers. The primary innovation lies\nin incorporating volatility-specific latent factors into the dynamic\nspatiotemporal volatility model. Using Bayesian estimation via the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) method, the model offers a robust framework for analyzing\nthe spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal effects of a log-squared outcome\nvariable on its volatility. We recommend using the deviance information\ncriterion (DIC) and a regularized Bayesian MCMC method to select the number of\nrelevant factors in the model. The model's flexibility is demonstrated through\ntwo applications: a spatiotemporal model applied to the U.S. housing market and\nanother applied to financial stock market networks, both highlighting the\nmodel's ability to capture varying degrees of interconnectedness. In both\napplications, we find strong spatial/network interactions with relatively\nstronger spillover effects in the stock market.",

    "abstract": "For classical discrete systems under constant composition, canonical average\nprovides equilibrium configuration from a set of many-body interactions, which\ntypically acts as nonlinear map. The nonlinearity has recently been\ninvestigated in terms of configurational geometry, where two measures for the\nnonlinearity as vector field on configuration space and divergence on\nstatistical manifold are introduced. Then, concepts of these measures are\nfurther unified through stochastic thermodynamic treatment. While these studies\nprovide deeper insight into understanding the nonlinearity, thermodynamic\ntreatment for non-separability in structural degrees of freedom (NS), still\nremains difficult due mainly to nonexistence of the corresponding CDOS. Our\nrecent study partially overcome the problem, by considering additional\ninformation of non-commutativity for the nonlinearity (NC). The present study\nfocuses on the basic behavior of the NC, in terms of the geometric information\nabout configurational geometry, much more easily-accesible information than NC.\nFor this purpose, we here employ the coarse-grained state model (CSM) that can\nqualitatively capture the nonlinearity information through the coarse-grained\nconfiguration space with tractable numbers of parameters, where the present CSM\ncan implicitly include the difference in coordination numbers on real lattice.\nWe find that (i) the NC exhibit positive correlation with asymmetric Hausdorff\ndistance in configurational polyhedra between of pracitcal and separable\nsystems in terms of SDFs, especially for partically-ordered-state-rich region,\n(ii) the NC take lower value when the difference in coordination number becomes\nsmall, indicating that we can obtain better thermodynamic bound for NS in such\nsystems, and (iii) the positive correlation can be further modified when we\nadditionally include information about nonseparability in the practical CDOS.",

This\napproach is motivated by the argument that such a partial gradient is close to\nthe true one, with precision growing only with the square root of the batch\nsize. A theoretical justification is with the help of stochastic approximation\ntheory. However, the conditions for the validity of this theory are not\nsatisfied in the usual learning rate schedules. Batch processing is also\ndifficult to combine with efficient second-order optimization methods. This\nproposal is based on another hypothesis: the loss minimum of the training set\ncan be expected to be well-approximated by the minima of its subsets. Such\nsubset minima can be computed in a fraction of the time necessary for\noptimizing over the whole training set. This hypothesis has been tested with\nthe help of the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 image classification benchmarks,\noptionally extended by training data augmentation.

Nevertheless, the precise location,\nduration, and operation of CR acceleration in young SNRs are open questions.\nHere, we report on multi-epoch X-ray observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), a\n350-year-old SNR, in the 15-50 keV band that probes the most energetic CR\nelectrons. The observed X-ray flux decrease $(15\\pm1\\%)$, contrary to the\nexpected $>$90\\% decrease based on previous radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray\nobservations, provides unambiguous evidence for CR electron acceleration\noperating in Cas A. A temporal model for the radio and X-ray data accounting\nfor electron cooling and continuous injection finds that the freshly injected\nelectron spectrum is significantly harder (exponential cutoff power law index\n$q=2.15$), and its cutoff energy is much higher ($E_{cut}=36$ TeV) than the\nrelic electron spectrum ($q=2.44\\pm0.03$, $E_{cut}=4\\pm1$ TeV). Both electron\nspectra are naturally explained by the recently developed modified nonlinear\ndiffusive shock acceleration (mNLDSA) mechanism. The CR protons producing the\nobserved gamma rays are likely accelerated at the same location by the same\nmechanism as those for the injected electron. The Cas A observations and\nspectral modeling represent the first time radio, X-ray, gamma ray and CR\nspectra have been self-consistently tied to a specific acceleration mechanism\n-- mNLDSA -- in a young SNR.",

Existing works on\ninterpretable reinforcement learning have shown promise in extracting decision\ntree (DT) based policies from DRL policies with most focus on the single-agent\nsettings while prior attempts to introduce DT policies in multi-agent scenarios\nmainly focus on heuristic designs which do not provide any quantitative\nguarantees on the expected return. In this paper, we establish an upper bound\non the return gap between the oracle expert policy and an optimal decision tree\npolicy. This enables us to recast the DT extraction problem into a novel\nnon-euclidean clustering problem over the local observation and action values\nspace of each agent, with action values as cluster labels and the upper bound\non the return gap as clustering loss. Both the algorithm and the upper bound\nare extended to multi-agent decentralized DT extractions by an\niteratively-grow-DT procedure guided by an action-value function conditioned on\nthe current DTs of other agents. Further, we propose the\nReturn-Gap-Minimization Decision Tree (RGMDT) algorithm, which is a\nsurprisingly simple design and is integrated with reinforcement learning\nthrough the utilization of a novel Regularized Information Maximization loss.\nEvaluations on tasks like D4RL show that RGMDT significantly outperforms\nheuristic DT-based baselines and can achieve nearly optimal returns under given\nDT complexity constraints (e.g., maximum number of DT nodes).",

For this reason, self-supervised\nimage-only pretraining is still the go-to method for many dense vision\napplications (e.g. depth estimation, semantic segmentation), despite the lack\nof explicit supervisory signals. In this paper, we close this gap between\nimage-text and self-supervised learning, by proposing a novel general-purpose\nimage-text model, which can be effectively used off the shelf for dense and\nglobal vision tasks. Our method, which we refer to as Text-Image Pretraining\nwith Spatial awareness (TIPS), leverages two simple and effective insights.\nFirst, on textual supervision: we reveal that replacing noisy web image\ncaptions by synthetically generated textual descriptions boosts dense\nunderstanding performance significantly, due to a much richer signal for\nlearning spatially aware representations. We propose an adapted training method\nthat combines noisy and synthetic captions, resulting in improvements across\nboth dense and global understanding tasks. Second, on the learning technique:\nwe propose to combine contrastive image-text learning with self-supervised\nmasked image modeling, to encourage spatial coherence, unlocking substantial\nenhancements for downstream applications. Building on these two ideas, we scale\nour model using the transformer architecture, trained on a curated set of\npublic images. Our experiments are conducted on 8 tasks involving 16 datasets\nin total, demonstrating strong off-the-shelf performance on both dense and\nglobal understanding, for several image-only and image-text tasks.

The wavelength\nrange for biosignatures used by the HabEx and LUVOIR mission concept studies\nwas 200 nm to 2 microns and, as such, this is a candidate wavelength range for\nHWO. The visible wavelength range (500-1000 nm) provides for detection of\nwater, oxygen, and Raleigh scattering; the near-ultraviolet is valuable for\ndetection of ozone; and the near-infrared enables detection of carbon dioxide\nand methane for Earth-like atmospheres.

However, the challenge of the NUV, in addition\nto the technological and engineering challenges of starlight suppression in the\nNUV, is the drop in flux of host stars. In the NIR, the challenge is the\ngeometric access to the habitable zone due to the wavelength dependency of the\ninner working angle limit of coronagraphs. For these reasons, exoplanet yields\nare lower in the NUV and NIR than in the visible (Morgan et al. 2023, Morgan et\nal. 2024) and some instrument parameters are more critical for improving NUV\nand NIR yields than others.

However, disregarding the potential of LLMs also overlooks their\npattern recognition capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce\n\\textit{LLM-TS Integrator}, a novel framework that effectively integrates the\ncapabilities of LLMs into traditional TS modeling. Central to this integration\nis our \\textit{mutual information} module. The core of this \\textit{mutual\ninformation} module is a traditional TS model enhanced with LLM-derived\ninsights for improved predictive abilities. This enhancement is achieved by\nmaximizing the mutual information between traditional model's TS\nrepresentations and LLM's textual representation counterparts, bridging the two\nmodalities. Moreover, we recognize that samples vary in importance for two\nlosses: traditional prediction and mutual information maximization. To address\nthis variability, we introduce the \\textit{sample reweighting} module to\nimprove information utilization. This module assigns dual weights to each\nsample: one for prediction loss and another for mutual information loss,\ndynamically optimizing these weights via bi-level optimization.

    "abstract": "Real-world object manipulation has been commonly challenged by physical\nuncertainties and perception limitations. Being an effective strategy, while\ncaging configuration-based manipulation frameworks have successfully provided\nrobust solutions, they are not broadly applicable due to their strict\nrequirements on the availability of multiple robots, widely distributed\ncontacts, or specific geometries of robots or objects.\n  Building upon previous sensorless manipulation ideas and uncertainty handling\napproaches, this work proposes a novel framework termed Caging in Time to allow\ncaging configurations to be formed even with one robot engaged in a task. This\nconcept leverages the insight that while caging requires constraining the\nobject's motion, only part of the cage actively contacts the object at any\nmoment. As such, by strategically switching the end-effector configuration and\ncollapsing it in time, we form a cage with its necessary portion active\nwhenever needed.\n  We instantiate our approach on challenging quasi-static and dynamic\nmanipulation tasks, showing that Caging in Time can be achieved in general cage\nformulations including geometry-based and energy-based cages. With extensive\nexperiments, we show robust and accurate manipulation, in an open-loop manner,\nwithout requiring detailed knowledge of the object geometry or physical\nproperties, or real-time accurate feedback on the manipulation states. In\naddition to being an effective and robust open-loop manipulation solution,\nCaging in Time can be a supplementary strategy to other manipulation systems\naffected by uncertain or limited robot perception.",

    "abstract": "When the interaction between a molecular system and confined light modes in\nan optical or plasmonic cavity is strong enough to overcome the dissipative\nprocess, hybrid light-matter states (polaritons) emerge as the fundamental\nexcitations in the system. Mixing the light and matter characters modifies\nmolecules' photophysical and photochemical properties. It was reported that\npolaritonic states can be employed to control photochemical reactions, charge\nand energy transfer, and other processes. In addition, according to recent\nstudies, vibrational strong coupling can be employed to enhance thermally\nactivated chemical reactions resonantly. This work adopts a coherent\nstate-based many-body state as the basis function to expand the light-matter\nHamiltonian. The corresponding nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics scheme is\nderived and implemented in the NEXMD package based on the semiclassical Ab\nInitio Multiple Cloning (AIMC) protocol. The scheme is demonstrated via a model\nsystem, pyridine, to demonstrate its validity. Our numerical results show that\ncoherence and decoherence processes are distinguishable during the initial\nrelaxation time in the AIMC simulations, while such dynamics are missing in the\nmixed quantum-classical surface hopping approach. Additionally, our results\nshow that the light-matter coupling has smaller impact on the dynamics in\nsurface hopping simulations. In the AIMC simulations, on the other hand, the\nrelaxation time is increased, leading to a slower internal conversion and\ndecreased equilibrium population build-up in the lowest electronically excited\nstate. This highlights the importance of proper treatment of coherence in\nsimulating exciton polaritons dynamics.",

Robust Fine-Tuning (\\texttt{RFT}\n)~\\citep{wortsman2021robust}, which interpolates between the \\textit{zero-shot}\nand \\textit{fine-tuned} models, has been proposed to address this issue.\nHowever, understanding when \\texttt{RFT} actually improves OOD error remains\nlimited. In this work, we empirically investigate the robustness of\n\\texttt{RFT} in CLIP models, with a focus on the \\textit{sharpness} of the CLIP\nmodel during interpolation. First, we demonstrate that while sharpness may not\nserve as a reliable indicator for predicting the generalization of modern\narchitectures like CLIP on OOD data, this challenges the conventional belief in\nthe generalization benefits of flat minima in foundation models. However, by\nexamining the role of the \\textit{straggler layer} phenomenon, we show that,\nunlike overall sharpness, the \\textit{layer-wise} sharpness of\n\\textit{straggler} layers can reliably capture the generalization performance\nof interpolated CLIP models on OOD data.

Since finding the optimal feature subset is computationally\nintensive, heuristic and metaheuristic approaches are commonly employed to\nidentify near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time frame. Recently, the\nquantum computing paradigm quantum annealing (QA) has been deployed to find\nsolutions to complex optimization problems.

Although\nseveral strategies have been proposed for feature subset selection using a QA\nmachine, little exploration has been done regarding the viability of a QA\nmachine for feature subset selection in software defect prediction. This study\ninvestigates the potential of D-Wave QA system for this task, where we\nformulate a mutual information (MI)-based filter approach as an optimization\nproblem and utilize a D-Wave Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) solver as a QA\nsolver for feature subset selection. We evaluate the performance of this\napproach using multiple software defect datasets from the AEEM, JIRA, and NASA\nprojects. We also utilize a D-Wave classical solver for comparative analysis.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that QA-based feature subset selection can\nenhance software defect prediction.

The molecular hydrogen mass is calculated as\nM(H2)=(1.89+/-0.24)e11 Msun, the SFR as 1.63+/-0.72 Msun/yr and the stellar\nmass as (4.83 +/- 1.52)e11 Msun, which gives a star formation efficiency (SFE =\nSFR/M(H2)) of (8.67+/-4.20)e12/yr. This indicates that UGC 2885 has an\nextremely high molecular gas content when compared to known samples of star\nforming galaxies (~100 times more) and a relatively low SFR for its current gas\ncontent. We conclude that UGC 2885 has gone through cycles of star formation\nperiods, which increased its stellar mass and metallicity to its current state.\nThe mechanisms that are fueling the current molecular gas reservoir and keeping\nthe galaxy from producing stars remain uncertain. We discuss the possibility\nthat a molecular bar is quenching star forming activity.",

    "abstract": "The immersed interface method (IIM) for models of fluid flow and\nfluid-structure interaction imposes jump conditions that capture stress\ndiscontinuities generated by forces that are concentrated along immersed\nboundaries. Most prior work using the IIM for fluid dynamic applications has\nfocused on smooth interfaces, but boundaries with sharp features such as\ncorners and edges can appear in practical analyses, particularly on engineered\nstructures. The present study builds on our work to integrate finite\nelement-type representations of interface geometries with the IIM. Initial\nrealizations of this approach used a continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element\ndiscretization for the boundary, but as we show herein, these approaches\ngenerate large errors near sharp geometrical features. To overcome this\ndifficulty, this study introduces an IIM approach using discontinuous Galerkin\n(DG) representation of the jump conditions. Numerical examples explore the\nimpacts of different interface representations on accuracy for both smooth and\nsharp boundaries, particularly flows interacting with fixed interface\nconfigurations. We demonstrate that using a DG approach provides accuracy that\nis comparable to the CG method for smooth cases. Further, we identify a time\nstep size restriction for the CG representation that is directly related to the\nsharpness of the geometry. In contrast, time step size restrictions imposed by\nDG representations are demonstrated to be insensitive to the presence of sharp\nfeatures.",

Thus, there has been significant research work in AI agents that\ninteract with the internet through web browsing.

In this paper we ask -- what if we\nwere to take tasks traditionally tackled by Browsing Agents, and give AI agents\naccess to APIs? To do so, we propose two varieties of agents: (1) an\nAPI-calling agent that attempts to perform online tasks through APIs only,\nsimilar to traditional coding agents, and (2) a Hybrid Agent that can interact\nwith online data through both web browsing and APIs. In experiments on\nWebArena, a widely-used and realistic benchmark for web navigation tasks, we\nfind that API-Based Agents outperform web Browsing Agents. Hybrid Agents\nout-perform both others nearly uniformly across tasks, resulting in a more than\n24.0% absolute improvement over web browsing alone, achieving a success rate of\n38.9%, the SOTA performance among task-agnostic agents.

We find that for unlearning methods with utility\nconstraints, the unlearned model retains an average of 21\\% of the intended\nforgotten knowledge in full precision, which significantly increases to 83\\%\nafter 4-bit quantization. ...

    "abstract": "Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an effective algorithm for\nmultivariate data analysis, including applications to feature selection,\npattern recognition, and computer vision. Its variant, Semi-Nonnegative Matrix\nFactorization (SNF), extends the ability of NMF to render parts-based data\nrepresentations to include mixed-sign data. Graph Regularized SNF builds upon\nthis paradigm by adding a graph regularization term to preserve the local\ngeometrical structure of the data space. Despite their successes, SNF-related\nalgorithms to date still suffer from instability caused by the Frobenius norm\ndue to the effects of outliers and noise. In this paper, we present a new\n$L_{2,1}$ SNF algorithm that utilizes the noise-insensitive $L_{2,1}$ norm. We\nprovide monotonic convergence analysis of the $L_{2,1}$ SNF algorithm. In\naddition, we conduct numerical experiments on three benchmark mixed-sign\ndatasets as well as several randomized mixed-sign matrices to demonstrate the\nperformance superiority of $L_{2,1}$ SNF over conventional SNF algorithms under\nthe influence of Gaussian noise at different levels.",

Prior works\nhave shown that in high dimensions, the majority of the compute and data\nresources are spent on recovering the low-dimensional projection; once this\nsubspace is recovered, the remainder of the target can be learned independently\nof the ambient dimension. However, implications of feature learning in\nadversarial settings remain unexplored. In this work, we take the first steps\ntowards understanding adversarially robust feature learning with neural\nnetworks. Specifically, we prove that the hidden directions of a multi-index\nmodel offer a Bayes optimal low-dimensional projection for robustness against\n$\\ell_2$-bounded adversarial perturbations under the squared loss, assuming\nthat the multi-index coordinates are statistically independent from the rest of\nthe coordinates. Therefore, robust learning can be achieved by first performing\nstandard feature learning, then robustly tuning a linear readout layer on top\nof the standard representations. In particular, we show that adversarially\nrobust learning is just as easy as standard learning.

The spectra\nof these matrices are notoriously highly sensitive to small perturbations. In\nthis work, we analyze the spectrum of a banded Toeplitz matrix perturbed by a\nrandom matrix with iid entries of variance $\\sigma_n^2 / n$ in the asymptotic\nof high dimension and $\\sigma_n$ converging to $\\sigma \\geq 0$. Our results\ncomplement and provide new proofs on recent progresses in the case $\\sigma =\n0$. For any $\\sigma \\geq 0$, we show that the point process of outlier\neigenvalues is governed by a low-dimensional random analytic matrix field,\ntypically Gaussian, alongside an explicit deterministic matrix that captures\nthe algebraic structure of the resonances responsible for the outlier\neigenvalues. On our way, we prove a new functional central limit theorem for\ntrace of polynomials in deterministic and random matrices and present new\nvariations around Szego's strong limit theorem.",

Due to the high variability\nand weak information of lip movements, VSR tasks require effectively utilizing\nany information from any source and at any level. In this paper, we propose a\nVSR method based on audio-visual cross-modal alignment, named AlignVSR. The\nmethod leverages the audio modality as an auxiliary information source and\nutilizes the global and local correspondence between the audio and visual\nmodalities to improve visual-to-text inference. Specifically, the method first\ncaptures global alignment between video and audio through a cross-modal\nattention mechanism from video frames to a bank of audio units. Then, based on\nthe temporal correspondence between audio and video, a frame-level local\nalignment loss is introduced to refine the global alignment, improving the\nutility of the audio information. Experimental results on the LRS2 and\nCNVSRC.Single datasets consistently show that AlignVSR outperforms several\nmainstream VSR methods, demonstrating its superior and robust performance.",

When such\nlasers are brought above threshold, the field intensity grows away from an\nunstable equilibrium, exhibiting transient relaxation oscillations with\nfluctuations due to noise. In this work, we focus on the first peak in the\nintensity during this transient phase in the presence of noise, and calculate\nits probability distribution using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB)\napproximation.

While this is not\npossible with humans, generative models allow us to easily visualize and\ncompare generated images, or their distribution, evoked by a textual prompt.\nTherefore, we characterize the semantic similarity between two textual\nexpressions simply as the distance between image distributions they induce, or\n'conjure.'

This is partly due to challenges\nin multimodal health data: obtaining data across many patients is difficult and\ncostly, there is a lot of inter-subject variability, and modalities are often\nheterogeneously informative across downstream tasks. Here, we explore these\nchallenges in the PhysioNet 2018 dataset. We use a masked autoencoding\nobjective to pretrain a multimodal model. We show that the model learns\nrepresentations that can be linearly probed for a diverse set of downstream\ntasks. We hypothesize that cross-modal reconstruction objectives are important\nfor successful multimodal training, as they encourage the model to integrate\ninformation across modalities. We demonstrate that modality dropout in the\ninput space improves performance across downstream tasks. We also find that\nlate-fusion models pretrained with contrastive learning objectives are less\neffective across multiple tasks. Finally, we analyze the model's\nrepresentations, showing that attention weights become more cross-modal and\ntemporally aligned with our pretraining strategy. The learned embeddings also\nbecome more distributed in terms of the modalities encoded by each unit.\nOverall, our work demonstrates the utility of multimodal foundation models with\nhealth data, even across diverse physiological data sources. We further argue\nthat explicit methods for inducing cross-modality may enhance multimodal\npretraining strategies.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference offers a robust framework for updating prior beliefs based\non new data using Bayes' theorem, but exact inference is often computationally\ninfeasible, necessitating approximate methods. Though widely used, these\nmethods struggle to estimate marginal likelihoods accurately, particularly due\nto the rigid functional structures of deterministic models like Gaussian\nprocesses and the limitations of small sample sizes in stochastic models like\nthe ensemble Kalman method. In this work, we introduce BI-EqNO, an equivariant\nneural operator framework for generalized approximate Bayesian inference,\ndesigned to enhance both deterministic and stochastic approaches. BI-EqNO\ntransforms priors into posteriors conditioned on observation data through\ndata-driven training. The framework is flexible, supporting diverse prior and\nposterior representations with arbitrary discretizations and varying numbers of\nobservations. Crucially, BI-EqNO's architecture ensures (1) permutation\nequivariance between prior and posterior representations, and (2) permutation\ninvariance with respect to observational data. We demonstrate BI-EqNO's utility\nthrough two examples: (1) as a generalized Gaussian process (gGP) for\nregression, and (2) as an ensemble neural filter (EnNF) for sequential data\nassimilation. Results show that gGP outperforms traditional Gaussian processes\nby offering a more flexible representation of covariance functions.\nAdditionally, EnNF not only outperforms the ensemble Kalman filter in\nsmall-ensemble settings but also has the potential to function as a \"super\"\nensemble filter, capable of representing and integrating multiple ensemble\nfilters for enhanced assimilation performance.

    "abstract": "The Integrated Timetabling and Vehicle Scheduling (TTVS) problem has\nextensive applications in all sorts of transit networks. Recently, the emerging\nmodular autonomous vehicles composed of modular autonomous units have made it\npossible to dynamically adjust on-board capacity to better match space-time\nimbalanced passenger flows. In this paper, we introduce an integrated framework\nfor the TTVS problem within a dynamically capacitated and modularized bus\nnetwork, taking the time-varying and uncertain passenger demand patterns into\naccount. The fixed-line modularized bus network operates units that can be\n(de)coupled and rerouted across different lines within the network at various\ntimes and locations to respond to the time-varying demand, providing passengers\nwith the opportunity to make in-vehicle transfers. We formulate a stochastic\nprogramming model to jointly determine the optimal robust timetable, dynamic\nformations of vehicles, and cross-line circulations of these units, aiming to\nminimize the weighted sum of operational and passengers' costs. To obtain\nhigh-quality solutions of realistic instances, we propose a tailored integer\nL-shaped method coupled with valid inequalities to solve the stochastic\nmixed-integer programming model dynamically through a rolling-horizon\noptimization algorithm. An extensive computational study based on the\nreal-world data of the Beijing bus network shows the effectiveness of the\nproposed approaches. Our method outperforms the two-step optimization method\ninvolving sequential decision-making for timetables and vehicle schedules.\nFurthermore, the computational results illustrate that our approaches are able\nto find timetables and vehicle schedules requiring fewer units and lower\noperational costs compared with using fixed-formation vehicles.",

Its central component, the exchange-correlation energy\nfunctional, has been approximated with increasing levels of complexity ranging\nfrom strictly local approximations to nonlocal and orbital-dependent\nexpressions with many tuned parameters. In this paper, we formulate a general\nway of rewriting complex density functionals using deep neural networks in a\nway that allows for simplified computation of Kohn-Sham potentials as well as\nhigher functional derivatives through automatic differentiation, enabling\naccess to highly nonlinear response functions and forces. These goals are\nachieved by using a recently developed class of robust neural network models\ncapable of modeling functionals, as opposed to functions, with explicitly\nenforced spatial symmetries. Functionals treated in this way are then called\nglobal density approximations and can be seamlessly integrated with existing\nDFT workflows. Tests are performed for a dataset featuring a large variety of\nmolecular structures and popular meta-generalized gradient approximation\ndensity functionals, where we successfully eliminate orbital dependencies\ncoming from the kinetic energy density, and discover a high degree of\ntransferability to a variety of physical systems.

While it is not possible to achieve cogenesis in this minimal setup due\nto structure formation constraints on relic allowed DM parameter space, we show\nthe viability of successful cogenesis in the resonant leptogenesis regime. We\nalso show that successful cogenesis can be achieved in a simple baryogenesis\nmodel without taking the leptogenesis route. Due to the possibility of\ngenerating asymmetry even below the sphaleron decoupling era, the direct\nbaryogenesis route opens up new parameter space of memory-burdened PBH.

When the theory is defined on a manifold with open boundaries, however,\nmany interesting conformal boundary conditions will fully or partially break\nsuch global symmetry. In this work, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking\nboundaries or interfaces when the system is out of equilibrium. We show that\nthe boundary or interface symmetry-breaking can be detected by the time\nevolution of string order parameters, which are constructed from the symmetry\noperators that implement the symmetry transformations. While the string order\nparameters are independent of time if the symmetry is preserved over the whole\nsystem, they evolve in time in a universal way if the boundary or interface\nbreaks the symmetry. More explicitly, in the presence of boundary or interface\nsymmetry-breaking, the string order parameters decay exponentially in time\nafter a global quantum quench, and decay as a power-law in time after a local\nquantum quench. We also generalize our study to the case when the string order\nparameters are defined in a subsystem, which are related to the full counting\nstatistics. It is found there are also universal features in the time evolution\nof string order parameters in this case. We verify our field theory results by\nstudying the time evolution of these two different types of string order\nparameters in lattice models.",

Recent works have\nprovided empirical and theoretical evidence for the bias of particular variants\nof SGD (such as label noise SGD) toward flatter regions of the loss landscape.\nDespite the folklore intuition that flat solutions are 'simple', the connection\nwith the simplicity of the final trained model (e.g. low-rank) is not well\nunderstood. In this work, we take a step toward bridging this gap by studying\nthe simplicity structure that arises from minimizers of the sharpness for a\nclass of two-layer neural networks. We show that, for any high dimensional\ntraining data and certain activations, with small enough step size, label noise\nSGD always converges to a network that replicates a single linear feature\nacross all neurons; thereby, implying a simple rank one feature matrix. To\nobtain this result, our main technical contribution is to show that label noise\nSGD always minimizes the sharpness on the manifold of models with zero loss for\ntwo-layer networks. Along the way, we discover a novel property -- a local\ngeodesic convexity -- of the trace of Hessian of the loss at approximate\nstationary points on the manifold of zero loss, which links sharpness to the\ngeometry of the manifold.

To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper proposes enhancing systems like METIS by integrating\nGPTs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and\nAugmented Reality (AR). The idea is to allow astronauts to interact with their\ndata more intuitively, using natural language queries and visualizing real-time\ninformation through AR. KGs will be used to easily access live telemetry and\nmultimodal data, ensuring that astronauts have the right information at the\nright time. By combining AI, KGs, and AR, this new system will empower\nastronauts to work more autonomously, safely, and efficiently during future\nspace missions.",

We view scaffolded LMs as semi-parametric\nmodels wherein we train non-parametric variables, including the prompt, tools,\nand scaffold's code. In particular, they interpret instructions, use tools, and\nreceive feedback all in language. Recent works use an LM as an optimizer to\ninterpret language supervision and update non-parametric variables according to\nintricate objectives. In this survey, we refer to this paradigm as training of\nscaffolded LMs with language supervision. A key feature of non-parametric\ntraining is the ability to learn from language. Parametric training excels in\nlearning from demonstration (supervised learning), exploration (reinforcement\nlearning), or observations (unsupervised learning), using well-defined loss\nfunctions. Language-based optimization enables rich, interpretable, and\nexpressive objectives, while mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting and\nsupporting compatibility with closed-source models. Furthermore, agents are\nincreasingly deployed as co-workers in real-world applications such as Copilot\nin Office tools or software development.

The study addresses several critical\nissues encountered in the estimation process and proposes innovative solutions\nto enhance accuracy and efficiency. In Chapter 2, the focus lies on the MGND\nmodel and its estimation via expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and\ngeneralized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithms. A thorough exploration\nreveals a degeneracy issue when estimating the shape parameter. Several\nalgorithms are proposed to overcome this critical issue. Chapter 3 extends the\ntheoretical perspective by applying the MGND model on several stock market\nindices. A two-step approach is proposed for identifying turmoil days and\nestimating returns and volatility. Chapter 4 introduces constrained mixture of\ngeneralized normal distributions (CMGND), enhancing interpretability and\nefficiency by imposing constraints on parameters. Simulation results highlight\nthe benefits of constrained parameter estimation. Finally, Chapter 5 introduces\ngeneralized normal distribution-hidden Markov models (GND-HMMs) able to capture\nthe dynamic nature of financial returns. This manuscript contributes to the\nstatistical modelling of financial returns by offering flexible, parsimonious,\nand interpretable frameworks. The proposed mixture models capture complex\npatterns in financial data, thereby facilitating more informed decision-making\nin financial analysis and risk management.",

    "abstract": "Most of the dynamical mass loss from star clusters is thought to be caused by\nthe time-variability of the tidal field (``tidal shocks''). Systematic studies\nof tidal shocks have been hampered by the fact that each tidal history is\nunique, implying both a reproducibility and a generalisation problem. Here we\naddress these issues by investigating how star cluster evolution depends on the\nstatistical properties of its tidal history. We run a large suite of direct\nN-body simulations of clusters with tidal histories generated from power\nspectra of a given slope and with different normalisations, which determine the\ntime-scales and amplitudes of the shocks, respectively. At fixed normalisation\n(i.e. the same median tidal field strength), the dissolution time-scale is\nnearly independent of the power spectrum slope. However, the dispersion in\ndissolution time-scales, obtained by repeating simulations for different\nrealisations of statistically identical tidal histories, increases with the\npower spectrum slope. This result means that clusters experiencing\nhigh-frequency shocks have more similar mass loss histories than clusters\nexperiencing low-frequency shocks. The density-mass relationship of the\nsimulated clusters follows a power-law with slope between 1.08 and 1.45, except\nfor the lowest normalisations (for which clusters effectively evolve in a\nstatic tidal field). Our findings suggest that star cluster evolution can be\ndescribed statistically from a time-series analysis of its tidal history, which\nis an important simplification for describing the evolution of the star cluster\npopulation during galaxy formation and evolution.",

Graph open-set learning (GOL) and out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetection aim to address this challenge by training models that can accurately\nclassify known, in-distribution (ID) classes while identifying and handling\npreviously unseen classes during inference. It is critical for high-stakes,\nreal-world applications where models frequently encounter unexpected data,\nincluding finance, security, and healthcare. However, current GOL methods\nassume access to many labeled ID samples, which is unrealistic for large-scale\ngraphs due to high annotation costs. In this paper, we propose LEGO-Learn\n(Label-Efficient Graph Open-set Learning), a novel framework that tackles\nopen-set node classification on graphs within a given label budget by selecting\nthe most informative ID nodes. LEGO-Learn employs a GNN-based filter to\nidentify and exclude potential OOD nodes and then select highly informative ID\nnodes for labeling using the K-Medoids algorithm. To prevent the filter from\ndiscarding valuable ID examples, we introduce a classifier that differentiates\nbetween the C known ID classes and an additional class representing OOD nodes\n(hence, a C+1 classifier). This classifier uses a weighted cross-entropy loss\nto balance the removal of OOD nodes while retaining informative ID nodes.\nExperimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that LEGO-Learn\nsignificantly outperforms leading methods, with up to a 6.62% improvement in ID\nclassification accuracy and a 7.49% increase in AUROC for OOD detection.",

In this paper, we\ndevelop an approach to design autonomous cyber defense agents using behavior\ntrees with learning-enabled components, which we refer to as Evolving Behavior\nTrees (EBTs). We learn the structure of an EBT with a novel abstract cyber\nenvironment and optimize learning-enabled components for deployment. The\nlearning-enabled components are optimized for adapting to various cyber-attacks\nand deploying security mechanisms. The learned EBT structure is evaluated in a\nsimulated cyber environment, where it effectively mitigates threats and\nenhances network visibility. For deployment, we develop a software architecture\nfor evaluating EBT-based agents in computer network defense scenarios. Our\nresults demonstrate that the EBT-based agent is robust to adaptive\ncyber-attacks and provides high-level explanations for interpreting its\ndecisions and actions.",

A possible way to connect both realms is by studying\nthe oldest stars in the Milky Way (i.e., the proto-Galaxy). We use the\n$APOGEE$-$Gaia$ surveys to perform a purely chemical dissection of Milky Way\n(MW) stellar populations, and identify samples of stars likely belonging to\nproto-Galactic fragments. The metallicity dependence of the distribution of old\nMW stars in the [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] enables the distinction of at least two\npopulations in terms of their star formation histories: a rapidly evolved\npopulation likely associated with the main progenitor system of the proto-MW;\nand populations characterised by less efficient, slower, star formation. In the\nSolar neighbourhood less efficient star forming populations are dominated by\nthe $Gaia$-$Enceladus$/$Sausage$ accretion debris. In the inner Galaxy, they\nare largely associated with the $Heracles$ structure. We model the density of\nchemically defined proto-Galaxy populations, finding that they are well\nrepresented by a Plummer model with a scale radius of $a\\sim3.5$ kpc, and an\noblate ellipsoid with flattening parameters [$p\\sim0.8$; $q\\sim0.6$]; this\nfinding indicates that the MW plausibly hosts a low-mass, metal-poor, bulge\ncomponent.

The current\nparametrization used for energy correlators, however, is based on redundant\npairwise angles with complex phase space restrictions. In this Letter, we\nintroduce a new parametrization of energy correlators that features a simpler\nphase space structure and preserves information about the orientation of jet\nconstituents. Further, our parametrization drastically reduces the\ncomputational cost to compute energy correlators on experimental data; whereas\nthe time to compute a traditional projected $N$-point energy correlator scales\nas $M^N/N!$ on a jet with $M$ particles, our new parametrization achieves a\nscaling of $M^2 \\log M$, remarkably independently of N. Even for N=3, this\nimproved scaling is particularly important for studies of heavy ion collisions,\nand higher values of $N$ will enable new qualitative understanding of gauge\ntheories. Theoretical calculations for our new energy correlators differ from\nthose of traditional parametrizations only at next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy and beyond, and we expect that our simpler phase space\nstructure will simplify those calculations. We also discuss how to extend our\nparametrization to resolved $N$-point energy correlators that encode angular\ndistances between greater numbers of particles, yielding intuitive\nvisualizations of jet substructure that are qualitatively different for\ndifferent jet samples.

    "abstract": "Classifying ionised nebulae in nearby galaxies is crucial to studying stellar\nfeedback mechanisms and understanding the physical conditions of the\ninterstellar medium. This classification task is generally performed by\ncomparing observed line ratios with photoionisation simulations of different\ntypes of nebulae (HII regions, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants).\nHowever, due to simplifying assumptions, such simulations are generally unable\nto fully reproduce the line ratios in observed nebulae. This discrepancy limits\nthe performance of the classical machine-learning approach, where a model is\ntrained on the simulated data and then used to classify real nebulae. For this\nstudy, we used a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) to bridge the gap\nbetween photoionisation models (source domain) and observed ionised nebulae\nfrom the PHANGS-MUSE survey (target domain). The DANN is an example of a\ndomain-adaptation algorithm, whose goal is to maximise the performance of a\nmodel trained on labelled data in the source domain on an unlabelled target\ndomain by extracting domain-invariant features. Our results indicate a\nsignificant improvement in classification performance in the target domain when\nemploying the DANN framework compared to a classical neural network (NN)\nclassifier. Additionally, we investigated the impact of adding noise to the\nsource dataset, finding that noise injection acts as a form of regularisation,\nfurther enhancing the performances of both the NN and DANN models on the\nobservational data. The combined use of domain adaptation and noise injection\nimproved the classification accuracy in the target domain by 23%. This study\nhighlights the potential of domain adaptation methods in tackling the\ndomain-shift challenge when using theoretical models to train machine-learning\npipelines in astronomy.",

Understanding how models of stellar and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) feedback affect baryon behavior across different halo masses and\nredshifts is essential. Using the SIMBA and IllustrisTNG suites from the\nCosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project,\nwe explore the effect of parameters governing the subgrid implementation of\nstellar and AGN feedback. We find that while IllustrisTNG shows higher\ncumulative feedback energy across all halos, SIMBA demonstrates a greater\nspread of baryons, quantified by the closure radius and circumgalactic medium\n(CGM) gas fraction. This suggests that feedback in SIMBA couples more\neffectively to baryons and drives them more efficiently within the host halo.\nThere is evidence that different feedback modes are highly interrelated in\nthese subgrid models. Parameters controlling stellar feedback efficiency\nsignificantly impact AGN feedback, as seen in the suppression of black hole\nmass growth and delayed activation of AGN feedback to higher mass halos with\nincreasing stellar feedback efficiency in both simulations. Additionally, AGN\nfeedback efficiency parameters affect the CGM gas fraction at low halo masses\nin SIMBA, hinting at complex, non-linear interactions between AGN and SNe\nfeedback modes.

The size-mass relation is measured\nin four redshift bins, across all NIRCam bands. We find that, the slope and\nintrinsic scatter of the rest-optical size-mass relation are constant across\nthis redshift range and consistent with previous HST-based studies at low-z.\nWhen comparing the relations across different wavelengths, the average\nrest-optical and rest-UV relations are consistent with each other up to $z=6$,\nbut the intrinsic scatter is largest in rest-UV wavelengths compared to\nrest-optical and redder bands. This behaviour is independent of redshift and we\nspeculate that it is driven by bursty star-formation in $z>4$ galaxies.\nAdditionally, for $3\\leqslant z<4$ star-forming galaxies at $\\rm M_* > 10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$, we find smaller rest-$\\rm 1\\rm\\,\\mu m$ sizes in comparison to\nrest-optical (and rest-UV) sizes, suggestive of colour gradients. When\ncomparing to simulations, we find agreement over $\\rm M_* \\approx 10^{9} -\n10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ but beyond this mass, the observed size-mass relation is\nsignificantly steeper. Our results show the power of JWST/NIRCam to provide new\nconstraints on galaxy formation models.",

This\nlatter, when in a dilute plasma, can be dressed by an effective plasma mass. If\nthis is equal to the mass of the new degree of freedom, then a resonance takes\nplace and the probability of transition between states is enhanced. This\nphenomenon of resonance conversion is at the very basis of multiple probes of\ndark matter, and it is typically studied within the so-called Landau-Zener\napproximation for level crossings. This latter is known to break down in a\nvariety of scenarios, such as multiple level crossings or when the de Broglie\nwave length of the new boson is comparable to the scale over which the\nbackground plasma varies. We develop a flexible code adopting a 3+1 formalism\nin flat spacetime to perform non-linear simulations of systems with photons and\nnew ultralight bosons in the presence of plasma. Our code currently allows to\nevolve one-dimensional systems, which are the ones of interest for this first\nstudy, but can be easily extended to treat three-dimensional spaces, and can be\nadapted to describe a plethora of realistic astrophysical and cosmological\nsituations. Here we use it to study the breakdown of the Landau-Zener\napproximation in the case of multiple level crossings and when the\nslowly-varying plasma approximation ceases to be valid.

In this note, we repeat and\nextend these tests and also apply them to the priors used by D'Amico et al.\n(2019). We point out that in addition to the \"prior volume\" effect there is a\nmuch more dangerous effect that is largely overlooked: a systematic bias on\ncosmological parameters due to overoptimistic scale cuts. Unlike the \"prior\nvolume\" effect, this is a genuine systematic bias due to two-loop corrections\nthat does not vanish with better priors or with larger data volumes. Our study\nis based on the high fidelity BOSS-like PT Challenge simulation data which\noffer many advantages over analyses based on synthetic data generated with\nfitting pipelines.

This\nindicates that stellar feedback has little impact on CGM scales in those halos.\nFor $\\sim 10^{12}$ $\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ halos, the thermodynamic profiles are\nalso accurately reproduced in the outer CGM. For some of these lower-mass\nhalos, cooling flows significantly overpredict the hot gas density in the inner\nCGM. This could be due to multidimensional angular momentum effects not well\ncaptured by our 1D cooling flow models and/or to the larger cold gas fractions\nin these regions. Turbulence, which contributes $\\sim 10-40\\%$ of the total\npressure, must be included to accurately reproduce the temperature profiles.\nOverall, cooling flows predict entropy profiles in better agreement with the\nFIRE simulations than other idealized models in the literature.",

Half-mass (light)\nradii of metal-poor GCs exhibit, on average, $\\simeq 52 \\pm$5 ($60 \\pm$3) per\ncent more expansion than metal-rich ones. Furthermore, the lack of metal-poor\nGCs at low Galactocentric distances ($R_\\mathrm{G}$) follows a triangular\npattern in $R_\\mathrm{G}$-[Fe/H] space, indicating that GCs with lower\nmetallicities appear further away from the Galactic center.

We found that the retention of BHs\ninside the cluster is crucial to reproducing the observed dissimilarities. The\nheavier and less expanded BH sub-system (BHSub) in metal-poor clusters leads to\nmore intense few-body encounters, injecting more kinetic energy into the\nstellar population. Consequently, they experience larger expansion and higher\nevaporation rates rather than metal-rich clusters.

While the initial 3D Gaussians may suffer from misalignment between\ndifferent views, we address this via view-specific deformation networks that\nadjust the position of Gaussians to be well aligned.

    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful foundation\nmodel for object segmentation in both images and videos, paving the way for\nvarious downstream video applications. The crucial design of SAM 2 for video\nsegmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from\nprevious frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection\nmemory design suffers from the \"error accumulation\" problem, where an errored\nor missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent\nframes, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos.\nTo this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object\nsegmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each\nframe and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation\npathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed\nnumber of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple\nmasks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate\nbranches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher\ncumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the\nfinal frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the\nfinal segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design,\nSAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can\neffectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably,\nSAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24\nhead-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term\nvideo object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS.

However, generating high-quality novel views under\nchallenging settings, such as sparse input views, remains difficult due to\ninsufficient information in under-sampled areas, often resulting in noticeable\nartifacts. This paper presents 3DGS-Enhancer, a novel pipeline for enhancing\nthe representation quality of 3DGS representations. We leverage 2D video\ndiffusion priors to address the challenging 3D view consistency problem,\nreformulating it as achieving temporal consistency within a video generation\nprocess. 3DGS-Enhancer restores view-consistent latent features of rendered\nnovel views and integrates them with the input views through a spatial-temporal\ndecoder. The enhanced views are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model,\nsignificantly improving its rendering performance. Extensive experiments on\nlarge-scale datasets of unbounded scenes demonstrate that 3DGS-Enhancer yields\nsuperior reconstruction performance and high-fidelity rendering results\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Efficient and accurate evaluation is crucial for the continuous improvement\nof large language models (LLMs). Among various assessment methods, subjective\nevaluation has garnered significant attention due to its superior alignment\nwith real-world usage scenarios and human preferences. However, human-based\nevaluations are costly and lack reproducibility, making precise automated\nevaluators (judgers) vital in this process. In this report, we introduce\n\\textbf{CompassJudger-1}, the first open-source \\textbf{all-in-one} judge LLM.\nCompassJudger-1 is a general-purpose LLM that demonstrates remarkable\nversatility. It is capable of: 1. Performing unitary scoring and two-model\ncomparisons as a reward model; 2. Conducting evaluations according to specified\nformats; 3. Generating critiques; 4. Executing diverse tasks like a general\nLLM. To assess the evaluation capabilities of different judge models under a\nunified setting, we have also established \\textbf{JudgerBench}, a new benchmark\nthat encompasses various subjective evaluation tasks and covers a wide range of\ntopics. CompassJudger-1 offers a comprehensive solution for various evaluation\ntasks while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to diverse requirements. Both\nCompassJudger and JudgerBench are released and available to the research\ncommunity athttps://github.com/open-compass/CompassJudger. We believe that by\nopen-sourcing these tools, we can foster collaboration and accelerate progress\nin LLM evaluation methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Industrial anomaly detection is crucial for quality control and predictive\nmaintenance, but it presents challenges due to limited training data, diverse\nanomaly types, and external factors that alter object appearances. Existing\nmethods commonly detect structural anomalies, such as dents and scratches, by\nleveraging multi-scale features from image patches extracted through deep\npre-trained networks. However, significant memory and computational demands\noften limit their practical application. Additionally, detecting logical\nanomalies-such as images with missing or excess elements-requires an\nunderstanding of spatial relationships that traditional patch-based methods\nfail to capture. In this work, we address these limitations by focusing on Deep\nFeature Reconstruction (DFR), a memory- and compute-efficient approach for\ndetecting structural anomalies. We further enhance DFR into a unified\nframework, called ULSAD, which is capable of detecting both structural and\nlogical anomalies. Specifically, we refine the DFR training objective to\nimprove performance in structural anomaly detection, while introducing an\nattention-based loss mechanism using a global autoencoder-like network to\nhandle logical anomaly detection. Our empirical evaluation across five\nbenchmark datasets demonstrates the performance of ULSAD in detecting and\nlocalizing both structural and logical anomalies, outperforming eight\nstate-of-the-art methods. An extensive ablation study further highlights the\ncontribution of each component to the overall performance improvement.

An unexpected increase in decay rates for 10 satellites\nwas identified around 25 April 2024, while two lower-altitude satellites\nremained unaffected. Detailed analysis revealed that this enhanced decay rate\nprior to the storm was influenced by a spike in the O/N2 ratio and an increase\nin Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV) flux. Moreover, most of the satellites exhibited\nsharp decay during the early recovery phase of the geomagnetic storm. Based on\nthe positions and local times of changes in decay rates, it is likely that the\nsatellites were affected by various processes during elevated space weather\nactivity, such as enhanced EUV flux, Joule heating, particle precipitation, and\nthe equatorial neutral anomaly.

    "abstract": "Generative models at times produce \"invalid\" outputs, such as images with\ngeneration artifacts and unnatural sounds. Validity-constrained distribution\nlearning attempts to address this problem by requiring that the learned\ndistribution have a provably small fraction of its mass in invalid parts of\nspace -- something which standard loss minimization does not always ensure. To\nthis end, a learner in this model can guide the learning via \"validity\nqueries\", which allow it to ascertain the validity of individual examples.\nPrior work on this problem takes a worst-case stance, showing that proper\nlearning requires an exponential number of validity queries, and demonstrating\nan improper algorithm which -- while generating guarantees in a wide-range of\nsettings -- makes an atypical polynomial number of validity queries. In this\nwork, we take a first step towards characterizing regimes where guaranteeing\nvalidity is easier than in the worst-case. We show that when the data\ndistribution lies in the model class and the log-loss is minimized, the number\nof samples required to ensure validity has a weak dependence on the validity\nrequirement. Additionally, we show that when the validity region belongs to a\nVC-class, a limited number of validity queries are often sufficient.",

However, a common issue of\nexisting evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure\nthat LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions\nbefore editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by\ndifferent techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess\nthe effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting\nhallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently\nvalidated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs?

Its strength $\\alpha_R\n\\propto \\kappa$ (curvature) and shifting electronic levels $\\Delta \\propto\n\\kappa^2$. Despite the vanishing integral curvature of typical topographies,\nimplying a net-zero Rashba effect, our two-band analysis and electronic\nstructure calculation of a bent 2D MoTe$_2$ show that only an interplay of\n$\\alpha_R$ and $\\Delta$ modulations results in large unidirectional Rashba SOC\nwith well-isolated states. Their high spin-splitting $\\sim 0.16$ eV, and\nattractively small spin-precession length $\\sim 1$ nm, are among the best\nknown. Our work uncovers major physical effects of undulations on Rashba SOC in\n2D materials, opening new avenues for using their topographical deformation for\nspintronics and quantum computing.",

    "abstract": "Weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS) exhibit X-ray flares, likely resulting from\nmagnetic reconnection that heats the stellar plasma to very high temperatures.\nThese flares are difficult to identify through targeted observations. Here, we\nreport the serendipitous detection of the brightest X-ray flaring state of KM\nOri in the eROSITA DR1 survey. Observations from SRG/eROSITA, Chandra X-ray\nObservatory, and XMM-Newton are analysed to assess the X-ray properties of KM\nOri, thereby establishing its flaring state at the eROSITA epoch. The long-term\n(1999-2020) X-ray light curve generated for the Chandra observations confirmed\nthat eROSITA captured the source at its highest X-ray flaring state recorded to\ndate. Multi-instrument observations support the X-ray flaring state of the\nsource, with time-averaged X-ray luminosity ($L_{0.2-5keV}$) reaching $\\sim\n1.9\\times10^{32}{erg~s^{-1}}$ at the eROSITA epoch, marking it the brightest\nand possibly the longest flare observed to date. Such intense X-ray flares have\nbeen detected only in a few WTTS. The X-ray spectral analysis unveils the\npresence of multiple thermal plasma components at all epochs. The notably high\nluminosity ($L_{0.5-8~keV}\\sim10^{32}{erg~s}^{-1}$), energy\n($E_{0.5-8~keV}\\sim10^{37}$erg), and the elevated emission measures of the\nthermal components in the eROSITA epoch indicate a superflare/megaflare state\nof KM Ori. Additionally, the H$\\alpha$ line equivalent width of $\\sim$-5\\AA\nfrom our optical spectral analysis, combined with the lack of infrared excess\nin the spectral energy distribution, were used to re-confirm the WTTS (thin\ndisk/disk-less) classification of the source. The long-duration flare of KM Ori\nobserved by eROSITA indicates the possibility of a slow-rise top-flat flare.\nThe detection demonstrates the potential of eROSITA to uncover such rare,\ntransient events, thereby providing new insights into the X-ray activity of\nWTTS.",

The Byzantine Generals Problem (BGP) is a critical model for\nconstructing resilient multi-agent systems (MAS) under adversarial attacks. It\ndescribes a scenario where malicious agents with unknown identities exist in\nthe system-situations that, in our context, could result from LLM agents'\nhallucinations or external attacks. In BGP, the objective of the entire system\nis to reach a consensus on the action to be taken. Traditional BGP requires\nglobal consensus among all agents; however, in practical scenarios, global\nconsensus is not always necessary and can even be inefficient. Therefore, there\nis a pressing need to explore a refined version of BGP that aligns with the\nlocal coordination patterns observed in MAS. We refer to this refined version\nas Imperfect BGP (IBGP) in our research, aiming to address this discrepancy. To\ntackle this issue, we propose a framework that leverages consensus protocols\nwithin general MAS settings, providing provable resilience against\ncommunication attacks and adaptability to changing environments, as validated\nby empirical results.

Our experiments show that CONAN achieves\nconvincing performance on different code generation tasks and significantly\noutperforms previous retrieval augmented code generation models. Our further\nanalyses show that CONAN learns tailored representations for both code snippets\nand documentation by aligning code-documentation data pairs and capturing\nstructural semantics by masking and predicting entities in the code data.\nAdditionally, the retrieved code snippets and documentation provide necessary\ninformation from both program language and natural language to assist the code\ngeneration process. CONAN can also be used as an assistant for Large Language\nModels (LLMs), providing LLMs with external knowledge in shorter code document\nlengths to improve their effectiveness on various code tasks. It shows the\nability of CONAN to extract necessary information and help filter out the noise\nfrom retrieved code documents.",

By\nemploying the Yang-Feldman-type equation, we compute the two-point correlation\nfunction up to the $\\lambda^3$ order and the four-point correlation function up\nto the $\\lambda^2$ one. In contrast to the standard theory of a massive scalar\nfield based on the de Sitter-invariant vacuum, we develop the\nvacuum-independent reasoning that may not possess de Sitter invariance but\nresults in a smooth massless limit of the correlation function's infrared part.\nOur elaboration affords to calculate correlation functions of a free massive\nscalar field and to proceed with quantum corrections, relying only on the known\ntwo-point correlation function's infrared part of a free massless one.\nRemarkably, the two-point correlation function of a free massive scalar field\ncoincides with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process's one and has a clear\nphysical interpretation. We compared our results with those obtained with the\nSchwinger-Keldysh diagrammatic technique, Starobinsky's stochastic approach,\nand the Hartree-Fock approximation. At last, we have constructed a\nrenormalization group-inspired autonomous equation for the two-point\ncorrelation function.

We observed that the interplay between obstacle softness, entropic\nbarriers, and external bias leads to striking transport characteristics of the\nactive particles. For instance, with increasing $F$, the non-linear mobility\nexhibits non-monotonic behavior, and effective diffusion is greatly enhanced,\nshowing multiple peaks in the presence of soft obstacles. Further, as a\nfunction of $K$ and $F$, particles exhibit various diffusive behaviors, e.g.,\nnormal diffusion - where the role of obstacles is insignificant, subdiffusion\nor superdiffusion - where the particles are partially trapped by the obstacles,\nand particles are ultimately caged by the obstacles.

Being\ninherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis\nand comparison of jailbreak attacks.

US offers deep tissue penetration and can monitor pulsatile\narterial blood flow in large vessels and the surrounding tissue, potentially\nimproving robustness and accuracy compared to PPG.\n  We present an IoT wearable system prototype utilizing a commercial\nmicrocontroller MCU employing the onboard ADC to capture high frequency US\nsignals and an innovative low-power US pulser. An envelope filter lowers the\nbandwidth of the US signal by a factor of >5x, reducing the system's\nacquisition requirements without compromising accuracy (correlation coefficient\nbetween HR extracted from enveloped and raw signals, r(92)=0.99, p<0.001). The\nfull signal processing pipeline is ported to fixed point arithmetic for\nincreased energy efficiency and runs entirely onboard. The system has an\naverage power consumption of 5.8mW, competitive with PPG based systems, and the\nHR extraction algorithm requires only 68kB of RAM and 71ms of processing time\non an ARM Cortex-M4 MCU. The system is estimated to run continuously for more\nthan 7 days on a smartwatch battery.\n  To accurately evaluate the proposed circuit and algorithm and identify the\nanatomical location on the wrist with the highest accuracy for HR extraction,\nwe collected a dataset from 10 healthy adults at three different wrist\npositions. The dataset comprises roughly 5 hours of HR data with an average of\n80.6+-16.3 bpm. During recording, we synchronized the established ECG gold\nstandard with our US-based method.

    "abstract": "Inspired by the success of large language models (LLM) for DNA and proteins,\nseveral LLM for RNA have been developed recently. RNA-LLM uses large datasets\nof RNA sequences to learn, in a self-supervised way, how to represent each RNA\nbase with a semantically rich numerical vector. This is done under the\nhypothesis that obtaining high-quality RNA representations can enhance\ndata-costly downstream tasks. Among them, predicting the secondary structure is\na fundamental task for uncovering RNA functional mechanisms. In this work we\npresent a comprehensive experimental analysis of several pre-trained RNA-LLM,\ncomparing them for the RNA secondary structure prediction task in an unified\ndeep learning framework. The RNA-LLM were assessed with increasing\ngeneralization difficulty on benchmark datasets.

In\ncontrast, recent empirical studies find that modern ensembles of\n(overparameterized) neural networks may not provide any inherent generalization\nadvantage over single but larger neural networks. This paper clarifies how\nmodern overparameterized ensembles differ from their classic underparameterized\ncounterparts, using ensembles of random feature (RF) regressors as a basis for\ndeveloping theory. In contrast to the underparameterized regime, where\nensembling typically induces regularization and increases generalization, we\nprove with minimal assumptions that infinite ensembles of overparameterized RF\nregressors become pointwise equivalent to (single) infinite-width RF\nregressors, and finite width ensembles rapidly converge to single models with\nthe same parameter budget. These results, which are exact for ridgeless models\nand approximate for small ridge penalties, imply that overparameterized\nensembles and single large models exhibit nearly identical generalization. We\nfurther characterize the predictive variance amongst ensemble members,\ndemonstrating that it quantifies the expected effects of increasing capacity\nrather than capturing any conventional notion of uncertainty. Our results\nchallenge common assumptions about the advantages of ensembles in\noverparameterized settings, prompting a reconsideration of how well intuitions\nfrom underparameterized ensembles transfer to deep ensembles and the\noverparameterized regime.",

For an even number of electrons\nper unit cell, either band- or Mott-insulators can theoretically occur.\nHowever, unambiguously identifying an unconventional Mott-insulator with an\neven number of electrons experimentally has remained a longstanding challenge\ndue to the lack of a momentum-resolved fingerprint.

In this work, we present a unique momentum-resolved signature\nof a Mott-insulating phase in the spectral function of Nb$_3$Br$_8$: the top of\nthe highest occupied band along the out-of-plane dimerization direction $k_z$\nhas a momentum space separation of $\\Delta k_z=2\\pi/d$, whereas the valence\nband maximum of a band insulator would be separated by less than $\\Delta\nk_z=\\pi/d$, where $d$ is the average spacing between the layers. As the strong\nelectron correlations inherent in Mott insulators can lead to unconventional\nsuperconductivity, identifying Nb$_3$Br$_8$ as an unconventional Mott-insulator\nis crucial for understanding its apparent time-reversal symmetry breaking\nJosephson diode effect. Moreover, the momentum-resolved signature employed here\ncould be used to detect quantum phase transition between band- and\nMott-insulating phases in van der Waals heterostructures, where interlayer\ninteractions and correlations can be easily tuned to drive such transition.",

For object detection and pose estimation,\nperformance comparisons of YOLO11 (YOLO11n, YOLO11s, YOLO11m, YOLO11l and\nYOLO11x) and YOLOv8 (YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x) were made\nunder identical hyperparameter settings among the all configurations. It was\nobserved that YOLO11n surpassed all configurations of YOLO11 and YOLOv8 in\nterms of box precision and pose precision, achieving scores of 0.91 and 0.915,\nrespectively. Conversely, YOLOv8n exhibited the highest box and pose recall\nscores of 0.905 and 0.925, respectively. Regarding the mean average precision\nat 50\\% intersection over union (mAP@50), YOLO11s led all configurations with a\nbox mAP@50 score of 0.94, while YOLOv8n achieved the highest pose mAP@50 score\nof 0.96. In terms of image processing speed, YOLO11n outperformed all\nconfigurations with an impressive inference speed of 2.7 ms, significantly\nfaster than the quickest YOLOv8 configuration, YOLOv8n, which processed images\nin 7.8 ms. Subsequent integration of ViTs for the green fruit's pose depth\nestimation revealed that Depth Anything V2 outperformed Dense Prediction\nTransformer in 3D pose length validation, achieving the lowest Root Mean Square\nError (RMSE) of 1.52 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.28, demonstrating\nexceptional precision in estimating immature green fruit lengths.

However, the optimization\ntechniques employed in existing SVI methods struggle to address problems in\nwhich the target distribution is high-dimensional, poorly-conditioned, or\nnon-convex, which severely limits the range of their practical applicability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel trust-region optimization approach for SVI\nthat successfully addresses each of these challenges.

To this end, we use silicon-nitride slot waveguides\nand show that both the fundamental TE and TM modes can be used to drive the\ncavity, making our device polarization-independent. We demonstrate our concept\nby performing surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of BPT molecules on a chip\nfabricated by standard silicon fabrication tools mixed with the deterministic\npositioning of gold nanospheres on the gap of a plasmonic dipole antenna.",

    "abstract": "We systematically investigate whether classical hydrodynamic field theories\ncan predict the long-time dynamics of many-particle quantum systems. We study\nboth numerically and analytically the time evolution of a chain of spins (or\nqubits) subjected to stroboscopic dynamics. The time evolution is implemented\nby a sequence of local and nearest-neighbor gates that conserve the total\nmagnetization. The long-time dynamics of such a system is believed to be\ndescribable by a hydrodynamic field theory, which, importantly, includes the\neffect of noise. Based on a field theoretical analysis and symmetry arguments,\nwe map each operator in the spin model to the corresponding fields in\nhydrodynamics. This allows us to predict which expectation values decay\nexponentially and which decay with a hydrodynamic long-time tail. We illustrate\nthese findings by studying the time evolution of all 255 Hermitian operators\nthat can be defined on four neighboring sites. All operators not protected by\nhydrodynamics decay exponentially, while the others show a slow hydrodynamic\ndecay. While most hydrodynamic power laws seem to follow the analytical\npredictions, we also discuss cases where there is an apparent discrepancy\nbetween analytics and the finite-size numerical data.",

Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention\napproximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that\nattention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself\nsuffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention\nis not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values\nwith the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can\nprovide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based\napproximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous\nsystem based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly\nreduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy\nfor diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention\ncomputation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger\nbatch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding\nthroughput by up to $5\\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms\ndecoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a\ncontext of 96k tokens.

This framework facilitates the development of predictive\nmodels and provides openly available benchmarking datasets for healthcare\nresearch. We demonstrate our framework using optical coherence tomography (OCT)\nscans, though it is applicable across domains. Using 109,309 2D OCT scan\nslices, we trained an image generative model combining a variational\nautoencoder and a diffusion model. Longitudinal observations were simulated\nusing a nonlinear mixed effect (NLME) model from a low-dimensional space of\nrandom effects. We generated 1.1M OCT scan slices paired with five sets of\nlongitudinal observations at controlled association levels (100%, 50%, 10%,\n5.26%, and 2% of between-subject variability). To assess the framework, we\nmodeled synthetic longitudinal observations with another NLME model, computed\nempirical Bayes estimates of random effects, and trained a ResNet to predict\nthese estimates from synthetic OCT scans. We then incorporated ResNet\npredictions into the NLME model for patient-individualized predictions.\nPrediction accuracy on withheld data declined as intended with reduced\nassociation between images and longitudinal measurements. Notably, in all but\nthe 2% case, we achieved within 50% of the theoretical best possible prediction\non withheld data, demonstrating our ability to detect even weak signals.

Using five\nsimulations from the Auriga project, both with and without local stellar\nradiation, we find that local stellar radiation, as a pre-reionization source,\nis highly effective at photoionizing and heating the gas around the proto-MW\nanalogues. As a result, the formation of surrounding dwarf galaxies in dark\nmatter halos with masses below approximately $10^{9.5}\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ are\nsignificantly suppressed. After reionization, the intensity of local stellar\nradiation eventually becomes comparable to the ultraviolet background (UVB).\nConsequently, the impact of local stellar radiation on the surrounding dwarf\ngalaxy formation decreases with decreasing redshift and nearly vanishes after\nredshift $z=4$. At present day, the bright satellite population in the\nsimulations with and without local stellar radiation is nearly identical. While\nour simulations do not have sufficient resolution to resolve the faintest\nsatellite galaxies which are most prone to the local stellar radiation, we use\nthe accreted galaxy mass function to assess the impact and find that the\nreduction in the faintest satellite is around $13$ percent in the presence of\nlocal stellar radiation, but this difference is within $\\sim2\\sigma$ of the\nPoisson uncertainty and thus not statistically significant.",

To control swarms\nof low-cost robots, researchers may end up spending countless hours\nbrainstorming robot configurations and policies to ``organically\" create\nbehaviors which do not need expensive sensors and perception. Existing research\nexplores the possible emergent behaviors in swarms of robots with only a binary\nsensor and a simple but hand-picked controller structure.

In this paper, we focus on\nsimulating a specific milling behavior already known to be producible using\nvery simple binary sensing and acting agents. To do this, we use evolutionary\nalgorithms to evolve not only the parameters (the weights, biases, and delays)\nof a spiking neural network, but also its structure. To create a baseline, we\nalso show an evolutionary search strategy over the parameters for the incumbent\nhand-picked binary controller structure.

The TDCOSMO\ncollaboration used velocity dispersion measurements of lensed quasars and\nlensed galaxies to infer that mass sheets are present, which decrease the\ninferred $H_0$ by 8$\\%$. Here, we test the assumption that the density profiles\nof galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses are the same. We use a composite\nstar-plus-dark-matter mass profile for the parent deflector population and\nmodel the selection function for galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lenses. We\nfind that a power-law density profile with an MST is a good approximation to a\ntwo-component mass profile around the Einstein radius, but we find that\ngalaxy-galaxy lenses have systematically higher mass-sheet components than\ngalaxy-quasar lenses. For individual systems, $\\lambda_\\mathrm{int}$ correlates\nwith the ratio of the half-light radius and Einstein radius of the lens. By\npropagating these results through the TDCOSMO methodology, we find that $H_0$\nis lowered by a further $\\sim$3\\%. Using the velocity dispersions from\n\\citet{slacs9} and our fiducial model for selection biases, we infer $H_0 =\n66\\pm4 \\ \\mathrm{(stat)} \\pm 1 \\ \\mathrm{(model \\ sys)} \\pm 2 \\\n\\mathrm{(measurement \\ sys)} \\ \\mathrm{km} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\\n\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for the TDCOSMO plus SLACS dataset. The first residual\nsystematic error is due to plausible alternative choices in modeling the\nselection function, and the second is an estimate of the remaining systematic\nerror in the measurement of velocity dispersions for SLACS lenses. Accurate\ntime-delay cosmography requires precise velocity dispersion measurements and\naccurate calibration of selection biases.",

Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial\ncapabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite\nspatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial\nproblem-solving, with generalized improvements in real-world visual-spatial\ntasks. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle: a framework that\nuses synthetic data generation to provide targeted supervision for vision\nlanguage models (VLMs) in three basic spatial capabilities, creating an\ninstruction dataset for each capability.

    "abstract": "With the development of large language models, they are widely used as agents\nin various fields. A key component of agents is memory, which stores vital\ninformation but is susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing research mainly\nfocuses on single-agent attacks and shared memory attacks. However, real-world\nscenarios often involve independent memory. In this paper, we propose the\nTroublemaker Makes Chaos in Honest Town (TMCHT) task, a large-scale,\nmulti-agent, multi-topology text-based attack evaluation framework. TMCHT\ninvolves one attacker agent attempting to mislead an entire society of agents.\nWe identify two major challenges in multi-agent attacks: (1) Non-complete graph\nstructure, (2) Large-scale systems. We attribute these challenges to a\nphenomenon we term toxicity disappearing. To address these issues, we propose\nan Adversarial Replication Contagious Jailbreak (ARCJ) method, which optimizes\nthe retrieval suffix to make poisoned samples more easily retrieved and\noptimizes the replication suffix to make poisoned samples have contagious\nability. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach in TMCHT, with 23.51%,\n18.95%, and 52.93% improvements in line topology, star topology, and 100-agent\nsettings. Encourage community attention to the security of multi-agent systems.",

The\namount of structure in the data is controlled by adjusting the number of hidden\nunits of the teacher and the correlations in the rows of the weights, a.k.a.\npatterns. In the absence of correlations, we validate the conjecture that the\nperformance is independent of the number of teacher patters and hidden units of\nthe student RBMs, and we argue that the teacher-student setting can be used as\na toy model for studying the lottery ticket hypothesis. Beyond this regime, we\nfind that the critical amount of data required to learn the teacher patterns\ndecreases with both their number and correlations. In both regimes, we find\nthat, even with a relatively large dataset, it becomes impossible to learn the\nteacher patterns if the inference temperature used for regularization is kept\ntoo low.

A practical solution is to divide episodes into\nchapters--semantically coherent segments labeled with titles and timestamps.\nSince most episodes on our platform at Spotify currently lack creator-provided\nchapters, automating the creation of chapters is essential. Scaling the\nchapterization of podcast episodes presents unique challenges. First, episodes\ntend to be less structured than written texts, featuring spontaneous\ndiscussions with nuanced transitions. Second, the transcripts are usually\nlengthy, averaging about 16,000 tokens, which necessitates efficient processing\nthat can preserve context. To address these challenges, we introduce PODTILE, a\nfine-tuned encoder-decoder transformer to segment conversational data. The\nmodel simultaneously generates chapter transitions and titles for the input\ntranscript. To preserve context, each input text is augmented with global\ncontext, including the episode's title, description, and previous chapter\ntitles. In our intrinsic evaluation, PODTILE achieved an 11% improvement in\nROUGE score over the strongest baseline. Additionally, we provide insights into\nthe practical benefits of auto-generated chapters for listeners navigating\nepisode content.

    "abstract": "Domain generalization methods aim to learn transferable knowledge from source\ndomains that can generalize well to unseen target domains. Recent studies show\nthat neural networks frequently suffer from a simplicity-biased learning\nbehavior which leads to over-reliance on specific frequency sets, namely as\nfrequency shortcuts, instead of semantic information, resulting in poor\ngeneralization performance. Despite previous data augmentation techniques\nsuccessfully enhancing generalization performances, they intend to apply more\nfrequency shortcuts, thereby causing hallucinations of generalization\nimprovement. In this paper, we aim to prevent such learning behavior of\napplying frequency shortcuts from a data-driven perspective. Given the\ntheoretical justification of models' biased learning behavior on different\nspatial frequency components, which is based on the dataset frequency\nproperties, we argue that the learning behavior on various frequency components\ncould be manipulated by changing the dataset statistical structure in the\nFourier domain. Intuitively, as frequency shortcuts are hidden in the dominant\nand highly dependent frequencies of dataset structure, dynamically perturbating\nthe over-reliance frequency components could prevent the application of\nfrequency shortcuts. To this end, we propose two effective data augmentation\nmodules designed to collaboratively and adaptively adjust the frequency\ncharacteristic of the dataset, aiming to dynamically influence the learning\nbehavior of the model and ultimately serving as a strategy to mitigate shortcut\nlearning.

In practice, 2:4 sparsity often\npossesses low actual speedups ($\\leq 1.3$) and requires fixed sparse ratios,\nmeaning that other ratios, such as 4:8, 8:16, or those exceeding 50% sparsity,\ndo not incur any speedups on GPUs. Recent studies suggest that V:N:M sparsity\nis promising in addressing these limitations of 2:4 sparsity. However,\nregarding accuracy, the effects of V:N:M sparsity on broader Transformer\nmodels, such as vision Transformers and large language models (LLMs), are\nlargely unexamined. Moreover, Some specific issues related to V:N:M sparsity,\nsuch as how to select appropriate V and M values, remain unresolved. In this\nstudy, we thoroughly investigate the application of V:N:M sparsity in vision\nmodels and LLMs across multiple tasks, from pertaining to downstream tasks. We\npropose three key approaches to enhance the applicability and accuracy of\nV:N:M-sparse Transformers, including heuristic V and M selection,\nV:N:M-specific channel permutation, and three-staged LoRA training techniques.\nExperimental results show that, with our methods, the DeiT-small achieves\nlossless accuracy at 64:2:5 sparsity, while the DeiT-base maintains accuracy\neven at 64:2:8 sparsity. In addition, the fine-tuned LLama2-7B at 64:2:5\nsparsity performs comparably or better than training-free 2:4 sparse\nalternatives on downstream tasks. More importantly, V:N:M-sparse Transformers\noffer a wider range of speedup-accuracy trade-offs compared to 2:4 sparsity.\nOverall, our exploration largely facilitates the V:N:M sparsity to act as a\ntruly effective acceleration solution for Transformers in cost-sensitive\ninference scenarios.",

Additionally, we construct a physical model of navigation\npotential fields based on flow field theory to guide pedestrian movements,\nthereby reinforcing physical constraints during the simulation. In our\nframework, navigation potential fields are dynamically computed and updated\nbased on the movement trends predicted by the PI-STGCN, while the updated crowd\ndynamics, guided by these fields, subsequently feed back into the PI-STGCN.\nComparative experiments on two publicly available large-scale real-world\ndatasets across five scenes demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms\nexisting rule-based methods in accuracy and fidelity.

While the fluctuation-dissipation theorem offers a complete\nlinear response theory for systems in steady-state, it fails to apply to\ntransient first-passage processes. We address this challenge by focusing on\nrare - rather than weak - perturbations. Surprisingly, we discover that the\nlinear response of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) to such perturbations is\nuniversal. It depends solely on the first two moments of the unperturbed\nfirst-passage time and the mean completion time following perturbation\nactivation, without any assumptions about the underlying system's dynamics. To\ndemonstrate the utility of our findings, we analyze the MFPT response of\ndrift-diffusion processes in two scenarios: (i) stochastic resetting with\ninformation feedback, and (ii) an abrupt transition from a linear to a\nlogarithmic potential. In both cases, our approach bypasses the need for\nexplicit determination of the perturbed dynamics, unraveling a highly\nnon-trivial response landscape with minimal effort. Finally, we show how our\nframework enables a new type of experiment - inferring molecular-level\nfluctuations from bulk measurements, a feat previously believed to be\nimpossible. Overall, the newly discovered universality reported herein offers a\npowerful tool for predicting the impact of perturbations on kinetic processes -\nand, remarkably, for extracting hidden single-molecule fluctuations from\naccessible bulk measurements.",

This inefficiency raises the\nquestion: Can LMs learn to select the optimal strategy in the first attempt,\nwithout a need for refinement? To address this challenge, we introduce SMART\n(Self-learning Meta-strategy Agent for Reasoning Tasks), a novel framework that\nenables LMs to autonomously learn and select the most effective strategies for\nvarious reasoning tasks. We model the strategy selection process as a Markov\nDecision Process and leverage reinforcement learning-driven continuous\nself-improvement to allow the model to find the suitable strategy to solve a\ngiven task.

    "abstract": "Existing communication hardware is being exerted to its limits to accommodate\nfor the ever increasing internet usage globally. This leads to non-linear\ndistortion in the communication link that requires non-linear equalization\ntechniques to operate the link at a reasonable bit error rate. This paper\naddresses the challenge of blind non-linear equalization using a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) with a second-order Volterra channel model. The VAE\nframework's costfunction, the evidence lower bound (ELBO), is derived for\nreal-valued constellations and can be evaluated analytically without resorting\nto sampling techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nthrough simulations on a synthetic Wiener-Hammerstein channel and a simulated\nintensity modulated direct detection (IM/DD) optical link. The results show\nsignificant improvements in equalization performance, compared to a VAE with\nlinear channel assumptions, highlighting the importance of appropriate channel\nmodeling in unsupervised VAE equalizer frameworks.",

    "abstract": "We explore the potential of an array of O(100) small fixed telescopes,\naligned along a meridian and automated to measure millions of occultations of\nGaia stars by minor planets, to constrain gravitational signatures from a\n\"Planet X\" mass in the outer solar system. The accuracy of center-of-mass\ntracking for the occulters is limited by photon noise, uncertainties in\nasteroid shapes, and Gaia's astrometry of the occulted stars. Using both\nparametric calculations and survey simulations, we assess the total information\nobtainable from occultation measurements of main-belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian\nTrojans and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). We find that MBAs are the optimal\ntarget population due to their higher occultation rates and abundance of\nobjects above LSST detection thresholds. A 10-year survey of occultations by\nMBAs and Trojans using an array of 200 40 cm telescopes at 5 km separation\nwould achieve $5\\sigma$ sensitivity to the gravitational tidal field of a\n$5M_\\oplus$ Planet X at 800 AU for $>90\\%$ of potential sky locations. This\nconfiguration corresponds to an initial cost of $\\approx $15 million. While the\noccultation survey's sensitivity to tidal forces improves rapidly with\nincreasing number of telescopes, sensitivity to a Planet X becomes limited by\ndegeneracy with the uncertain masses of large moonless TNOs. The 200-telescope\nsurvey would additionally detect $\\approx $1800 TNO occultations, providing\ndetailed shape, size, and albedo information. The survey would also measure the\nYarkovski effect on many individual MBAs, measure the masses of many asteroids\ninvolved in mutual gravitational deflections, and enable better searches for\nprimordial black holes and departures from General Relativity.",

In this study, we explore how random fluctuations (or \"stochastic\ninputs\") affect these oscillations in brain states, which reflect the\ncollective activity of interconnected neurons. These random inputs are modeled\nin the context of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a brain region implicated in\nPD, and their interaction with synaptic dynamics and spike-timing-dependent\nplasticity (STDP) in both healthy and PD-affected neurons. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the effects of random synaptic inputs and their correlations on the\nmembrane potential of STN neurons. Our results show that these random inputs\nsignificantly influence the firing patterns of STN neurons, both in healthy\ncells and in those affected by PD under deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment.\nWe also find that STDP increases the regularity of the interspike intervals\n(ISI) in spike trains of output neurons. However, the introduction of random\nrefractory periods and fluctuating input currents can induce greater\nirregularity in the spike trains. Furthermore, when random inputs and STDP are\ncombined, the correlation between the activity of different neurons increases.\nThese findings suggest that the stochastic dynamics of STN neurons, in\nconjunction with STDP, could offer insights into the mechanisms underlying PD\nsymptoms and their potential management.",

While success\nwas demonstrated primarily on image data, these methods do not directly\ntransfer to other domains, such as spatiotemporal data. To understand privacy\nrisks in spatiotemporal federated learning, we first propose Spatiotemporal\nGradient Inversion Attack (ST-GIA), a gradient attack algorithm tailored to\nspatiotemporal data that successfully reconstructs the original location from\ngradients. Furthermore, the absence of priors in attacks on spatiotemporal data\nhas hindered the accurate reconstruction of real client data. To address this\nlimitation, we propose ST-GIA+, which utilizes an auxiliary language model to\nguide the search for potential locations, thereby successfully reconstructing\nthe original data from gradients. In addition, we design an adaptive defense\nstrategy to mitigate gradient inversion attacks in spatiotemporal federated\nlearning. By dynamically adjusting the perturbation levels, we can offer\ntailored protection for varying rounds of training data, thereby achieving a\nbetter trade-off between privacy and utility than current state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Results show that\nmodels trained with saliency incorporation display an increase in\ninterpretability of up to 30% over models trained without saliency information.\nThe collection of this saliency information, however, can be costly, laborious\nand in some cases infeasible. To address this limitation, we propose a\ncombination strategy of saliency incorporation and active learning to reduce\nthe human annotation data required by 80% while maintaining the\ninterpretability and performance increase from human saliency.

When estimating equations omit past outcomes,\ndynamic bias can lead to significantly inaccurate treatment effect estimates,\neven with randomly assigned treatments. This dynamic bias in simulations is\nlarger than Nickell bias. I show that dynamic bias stems from the estimation of\nfixed effects, as their estimation generates confounding in the data. To\nrecover consistent treatment effects, I develop a flexible estimator that\nprovides fixed-T bias correction. I apply this approach to study the impact of\ntemperature shocks on GDP, a canonical example where economic theory points to\nan important feedback from past to future outcomes.

To this end, hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithms are preferred for Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum\n(NISQ) architectures. The Projective Quantum Eigensolver (PQE) is one such\nalgorithms that optimizes the parameters of the chemistry-inspired unitary\ncoupled cluster (UCC) ansatz using a conventional coupled cluster-like residual\nminimization. Such a strategy involves the projection of the Schrodinger\nequation on to linearly independent basis towards the parameter optimization,\nrestricting the ansatz is solely defined in terms of the excitation operators.\nThis warrants the inclusion of high-rank operators for strongly correlated\nsystems, leading to increased utilization of quantum resources. In this\nmanuscript, we develop a methodology for determining the generalized operators\nin terms of a closed form residual equations in the PQE framework that can be\nefficiently implemented in a quantum computer with manageable quantum\nresources. Such a strategy requires the removal of the underlying redundancy in\nhigh-rank excited determinants, generated due to the presence of the\ngeneralized operators in the ansatz, by projecting them on to an internally\ncontracted lower dimensional manifold. With the application on several\nmolecular systems, we have demonstrated our ansatz achieves similar accuracy to\nthe (disentangled) UCC with singles, doubles and triples (SDT) ansatz, while\nutilizing an order of magnitude fewer quantum gates. Furthermore, when\nsimulated under stochastic Gaussian noise or depolarizing hardware noise, our\nmethod shows significantly improved noise resilience compared to the other\nmembers of PQE family and the state-of-the-art variational quantum eigensolver.",

Notice that a function having only low\nfrequency components may be well-represented by a shallow neural network (SNN),\na network having only a few layers. By observing that composition of low\nfrequency functions can effectively approximate a high-frequency function, we\npropose to learn a function containing high-frequency components by composing\nseveral SNNs, each of which learns certain low-frequency information from the\ngiven data. We implement the proposed idea by exploiting the multi-grade deep\nlearning (MGDL) model, a recently introduced model that trains a DNN\nincrementally, grade by grade, a current grade learning from the residue of the\nprevious grade only an SNN composed with the SNNs trained in the preceding\ngrades as features. We apply MGDL to synthetic, manifold, colored images, and\nMNIST datasets, all characterized by presence of high-frequency features.

The ideal solution to this\nproblem should not require the active participation of the users. Our solution\nto active MitM attacks builds directly on Signal. We automate the process of\nkey confirmation without relying on the intervention of users, and without\nusing an out-of-band communication channel, at the cost of slightly altered\ntrust assumptions on the server. We consider a powerful active MitM that not\nonly controls the communication channel, but also has (one time) access to all\nsecrets on one of the clients, i.e., can perform a key compromise attack. Our\nsolution utilises the server to keep track of the changes in the clients key\nfingerprint as ratcheting is performed. Given that the server can keep a\nmessage log already, we find that any impact on deniability is minimal in\npractice. We present our detailed modifications to Signal, and document the new\nsecurity guarantees while preserving the existing security guarantees of\nSignal. Our proof-of-concept implementation, which is based on the open-source\nSignal library used in real-world instant messaging applications, shows that\nour solution is practical and integrates well with the library.

    "abstract": "We calculate the holographic central charges for general higher curvature\ngravity theory dual to eight dimensional CFT. To do this, we first elaborate\nthe general form of Weyl anomaly in 8d CFT and find 11 non-trivial linearly\nindependent curvature combinations, one of which is Euler density and the rest\nare Weyl invariants, including 7 non-differentiated ones and 3 differentiated\nones. The Weyl invariants are constructed as invariant polynomials of curvature\ntensor and covariant derivatives. We denote $W_{(n)}$ as the Weyl invariant\nthat contains a polynormial term with a minimum of $n$ curvature tensors.\nInterestingly, since there are a total of 12 Weyl invariants in 8d, our finding\nmeans two of them are trivial and expressible as total derivatives. The\nresulting central charges are expressed in terms of 15 theory-dependent\nconstants. Remarkably, we find that the $W_{(2)}$ invariant corresponds to the\n$c$-charge that is proportional to $C_T$, while the two $W_{(3)}$'s are related\nto three-point function parameters of energy-momentum tensor. This suggests a\npossible connection between the $c$-charges of $W_{(n)}$'s and the $n$-point\nfunctions of energy-momentum tensor.",

    "abstract": "Individual mobility trajectories are difficult to measure and often incur\nlong periods of missingness. Aggregation of this mobility data without\naccounting for the missingness leads to erroneous results, underestimating\ntravel behavior. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping-Based Multiple\nImputation (DTWBMI) as a method of filling long gaps in human mobility\ntrajectories in order to use the available data to the fullest extent. This\nmethod reduces spatiotemporal trajectories to time series of particular travel\nbehavior, then selects candidates for multiple imputation on the basis of the\ndynamic time warping distance between the potential donor series and the series\npreceding and following the gap in the recipient series and finally imputes\nvalues multiple times. A simulation study designed to establish optimal\nparameters for DTWBMI provides two versions of the method. These two methods\nare applied to a real-world dataset of individual mobility trajectories with\nsimulated missingness and compared against other methods of handling\nmissingness. Linear interpolation outperforms DTWBMI and other methods when\ngaps are short and data are limited. DTWBMI outperforms other methods when gaps\nbecome longer and when more data are available.",

However, it is difficult to collect\nreal-world image pairs, which prevents developments of existing methods.\nAlthough several works partially alleviate this issue by using synthetic\ndatasets or small-scale real datasets. The haze intensity distribution bias and\nscene homogeneity in existing datasets limit the generalization ability of\nthese methods, particularly when encountering images with previously unseen\nhaze intensities. In this work, we present LMHaze, a large-scale, high-quality\nreal-world dataset. LMHaze comprises paired hazy and haze-free images captured\nin diverse indoor and outdoor environments, spanning multiple scenarios and\nhaze intensities. It contains over 5K high-resolution image pairs, surpassing\nthe size of the biggest existing real-world dehazing dataset by over 25 times.\nMeanwhile, to better handle images with different haze intensities, we propose\na mixture-of-experts model based on Mamba (MoE-Mamba) for dehazing, which\ndynamically adjusts the model parameters according to the haze intensity.\nMoreover, with our proposed dataset, we conduct a new large multimodal model\n(LMM)-based benchmark study to simulate human perception for evaluating dehazed\nimages.

The goal is to find an assignment\nof all clients to the servers, while minimizing the maximum load on each\nserver, where load of a server is the number of clients assigned to it. We\nstudy load-balancing in the one-way communication model: the edges of the input\ngraph are partitioned between Alice and Bob, and Alice needs to send a message\nto Bob for him to output the solution.\n  We show that settling the one-way communication complexity of load-balancing\nis equivalent to a natural sparsification problem for load-balancing. We then\nprove a dual interpretation of this sparsifier, showing that the minimum\ndensity of a sparsifier is effectively the same as the maximum density one can\nachieve for an extremal graph family that is new to this paper, called\nMatching-Contractors; these graphs are intimately connected to the well-known\nRuzsa-Szemeredi graphs and generalize them in certain aspects. Our chain of\nequivalences thus shows that the one-way communication complexity of\nload-balancing can be reduced to a purely graph theoretic question: what is the\nmaximum density of a Matching-Contractor on $n$ vertices?\n  Finally, we present a novel combinatorial construction of some-what dense\nMatching-Contractors, which implies a strong one-way communication lower bound\nfor load-balancing: any one-way protocol (even randomized) with $\\tilde{O}(n)$\ncommunication cannot achieve a better than $n^{\\frac14-o(1)}$-approximation.\nPreviously, no non-trivial lower bounds were known for protocols with even\n$O(n\\log{n})$ bits of communication.

In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can identify knowledge\nconflicts and whether it is possible to know which source of knowledge the\nmodel will rely on by analysing the residual stream of the LLM. Through probing\ntasks, we find that LLMs can internally register the signal of knowledge\nconflict in the residual stream, which can be accurately detected by probing\nthe intermediate model activations. This allows us to detect conflicts within\nthe residual stream before generating the answers without modifying the input\nor model parameters. Moreover, we find that the residual stream shows\nsignificantly different patterns when the model relies on contextual knowledge\nversus parametric knowledge to resolve conflicts. This pattern can be employed\nto estimate the behaviour of LLMs when conflict happens and prevent unexpected\nanswers before producing the answers.

A key challenge in RS is efficiently processing vast\nitem pools to deliver highly personalized recommendations under strict latency\nconstraints. Multi-stage cascade ranking addresses this by employing\ncomputationally efficient retrieval methods to cover diverse user interests,\nfollowed by more precise ranking models to refine the results. In the retrieval\nstage, multi-channel retrieval is often used to generate distinct item subsets\nfrom different candidate generators, leveraging the complementary strengths of\nthese methods to maximize coverage. However, forwarding all retrieved items\noverwhelms downstream rankers, necessitating truncation. Despite advancements\nin individual retrieval methods, multi-channel fusion, the process of\nefficiently merging multi-channel retrieval results, remains underexplored. We\nare the first to identify and systematically investigate multi-channel fusion\nin the retrieval stage. Current industry practices often rely on heuristic\napproaches and manual designs, which often lead to suboptimal performance.\nMoreover, traditional gradient-based methods like SGD are unsuitable for this\ntask due to the non-differentiable nature of the selection process.

We utilize black-box\noptimization techniques, including the Cross Entropy Method and Bayesian\nOptimization for global weight optimization, alongside policy gradient-based\napproaches for personalized merging.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models address that by\nallowing the model size to grow without substantially raising training or\ninference costs. Yet MoE models face challenges regarding knowledge sharing\namong experts, making their performance somehow sensitive to routing accuracy.\nTo tackle that, previous works introduced shared experts and combined their\noutputs with those of the top $K$ routed experts in an ``addition'' manner. In\nthis paper, inspired by collective matrix factorization to learn shared\nknowledge among data, we propose CartesianMoE, which implements more effective\nknowledge sharing among experts in more like a ``multiplication'' manner.\nExtensive experimental results indicate that CartesianMoE outperforms previous\nMoE models for building LLMs, in terms of both perplexity and downstream task\nperformance.

However, these thresholds are not\nclosed form and the test is often applied with approximate thresholds\n$(1-\\beta)/\\alpha$ and $\\beta/(1-\\alpha)$ (approximate SPRT). When $\\beta > 0$,\nthis neither guarantees error control at $\\alpha,\\beta$ nor optimality. When\n$\\beta=0$ (power-one SPRT), this method is conservative and not optimal. The\nlooseness in both cases is caused by \\emph{overshoot}: the test statistic\novershoots the thresholds at the stopping time.

    "abstract": "Quantum non-locality has become a popular term. Yet, its precise meaning, and\neven its mere existence, is the subject of controversies. The main cause of the\ncontroversies is the never ending discussion on the appropriate definitions of\nLocality and Realism in the derivation of Bell's inequalities. On the other\nhand, Louis Sica derived Bell's inequalities from the hypothesis that time\nseries of outcomes observed in one station do not change if the setting in the\nother (distant) station is changed. The derivation is based on arithmetical\nproperties of time series only; it does not involve the definitions of\nLocality, Realism and probabilities, and is valid for series of any length. An\nimportant consequence is that violation of Bell's inequalities implies the\nseries recorded (at the same time) in one station to be different if the\nsetting in the other station is changed. This result gives precise meaning to\nthe idea of quantum non-locality, and also makes evident why using it for\nfaster than light signaling is impossible (because the difference is between\nfactual and counter-factual series). Finally, it is demonstrated that series of\noutcomes, even if they violate Bell's inequalities, can be always embedded in a\nset of factual and counter-factual data that does hold to Bell's inequalities.\nLoosely speaking, the factual world may be quantum or not, but the union of\nfactual and counter-factual worlds is always classical.",

The\nPearson correlation of both descriptors with LTC are significantly higher in\nmagnitude compared with the traditional simple rule of average mass.

We select 367 (533) with low\n(high) normalized -ICOHP and ICOBI for first-principles validation.

This flexibility arises\nfrom complex hydrogen-bonding networks defined by canonical and non-canonical\nbase pairs that require protonation events to stabilize or perturb these\ninteractions. Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) methods provide a reliable\nframework to explore the conformational and protonation space of dynamic\nstructures and for robust calculations of pH-dependent properties, such as the\npK$_\\mathrm{a}$ of titrable sites. Despite growing biological evidence\nconcerning pH regulation of certain motifs and in biotechnological\napplications, pH-sensitive in silico methods have rarely been applied to\nnucleic acids. In this work, we extended the stochastic titration CpHMD method\nto include RNA parameters from the standard $\\chi$OL3 AMBER force field and\nhighlighted its capability to depict titration events of nucleotides in\nsingle-stranded RNAs. We validated the method using trimers and pentamers with\na single central titrable site while integrating a well-tempered metadynamics\napproach into the st-CpHMD methodology (CpH-MetaD) using PLUMED. This approach\nenhanced the convergence of the conformational landscape and enabled more\nefficient sampling of protonation-conformation coupling. Our pK$_\\mathrm{a}$\nestimates agree with experimental data, validating the method's ability to\nreproduce electrostatic changes around a titrable nucleobase in single-stranded\nRNA. These findings provided molecular insight into intramolecular phenomena,\nsuch as nucleobase stacking and phosphate interactions, that dictate the\nexperimentally observed pK$_\\mathrm{a}$ shifts between different strands.\nOverall, this work validates both the st-CpHMD and the metadynamics integration\nas reliable tools for studying biologically relevant RNA systems.",

The article proposes a novel small sample instance segmentation\nsolution from the perspective of maximizing the utilization of existing\ninformation without increasing annotation burden and training costs. The\nproposed method designs two modules to address the problems encountered in\nsmall sample instance segmentation.

Second, by integrating the features of text and image, more\naccurate classification results can be obtained. These two modules are suitable\nfor box-free and box-dependent frameworks. In the way, the proposed method not\nonly improves the performance of small sample instance segmentation, but also\ngreatly reduce reliance on pre-training. We have conducted experiments in three\ndatasets from different scenes: on land, underwater and under microscope. As\nevidenced by our experiments, integrated image-text corrects the confidence of\nclassification, and pseudo labels help the model obtain preciser masks.

More concretely,\nwe propose a qualified majority voting strategy, i.e., a threshold voting\nscheme is designed to model agreement among raters and the majority-voted\nlabels of the selected subset of pixels are regarded as supervision. To fill\nlabels of other pixels, two types of mixed auxiliary supervision are proposed:\na soft label learned from intrinsic structures of noisy annotations, and\nraters' characteristics labels which propagate individual rater's\ncharacteristics information. LF-Net has two main advantages. 1) Training with\ntrustworthy pixels incorporates training with confident supervision, guiding\nthe direction of groundtruth label learning. 2) Two types of mixed supervision\nprevent over-fitting issues when the network is supervised by a subset of\npixels, and guarantee high fidelity with the true label. Results on five\ndatasets of diverse imaging modalities show that our LF-Net boosts segmentation\naccuracy in all datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods, with even a 7%\nimprovement in DSC for MS lesion segmentation.",

We find NLRs extending 3-9 kpc, with four quasars showing roughly\nsymmetrical structures (b/a=1.2-1.5) and three displaying asymmetric NLRs\n(b/a=2.4-5.6). When included with type 1 and type 2 AGNs from previous studies,\nthe sizes of the extended [O III] regions scale with luminosity as $R[O III]\n\\sim L[O III]^{0.5}$, consistent with photoionisation.

We use photoionisation modeling to estimate\nthe maximum NLRs sizes, assuming a minimum ionisation parameter of $\\log(U) =\n-3$, an ionising luminosity based on the $L[O III]$-derived bolometric\nluminosity, and a minimum gas number density $n_H \\sim 100\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$,\nassuming that molecular clouds provide a reservoir for the ionised gas. The\nderived sizes agree well with direct measurements for a sample of type 2\nquasars, but are underestimated for the current sample of QSO1s. A better\nagreement is obtained for the QSO1s using bolometric luminosities derived from\nthe 5100A continuum luminosity. Radial mass profiles for the QSO1s show\nsignificant extended mass in all cases, but with less [O III]-emitting gas near\nthe central AGN compared to QSO2s.

    "abstract": "Turn-taking is a fundamental mechanism in human communication that ensures\nsmooth and coherent verbal interactions. Recent advances in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have motivated their use in improving the turn-taking\ncapabilities of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS), such as their ability to respond\nat appropriate times. However, existing models often struggle to predict\nopportunities for speaking -- called Transition Relevance Places (TRPs) -- in\nnatural, unscripted conversations, focusing only on turn-final TRPs and not\nwithin-turn TRPs. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dataset of\nparticipant-labeled within-turn TRPs and use it to evaluate the performance of\nstate-of-the-art LLMs in predicting opportunities for speaking. Our experiments\nreveal the current limitations of LLMs in modeling unscripted spoken\ninteractions, highlighting areas for improvement and paving the way for more\nnaturalistic dialogue systems.",

This study aims to systematically\nanalyze the set of possible critical exponents in weak noise statistical field\ntheories in 1+1 dimensions, focusing on cases with a single fluctuating field.\nTo achieve this, we develop and apply the Gaussian fluctuation method, avoiding\nreliance on constructing a Landau theory based on system symmetries. Our\nanalysis reveals that the critical exponents can be categorized into a limited\nset of distinct cases, suggesting a constrained universality in weak\nnoise-induced dynamical phase transitions.

    "abstract": "Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are used to observe very\nhigh-energy photons from the ground. Gamma rays are indirectly detected through\nthe Cherenkov light emitted by the air showers they induce. The new generation\nof experiments, in particular the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO),\nsets ambitious goals for discoveries of new gamma-ray sources and precise\nmeasurements of the already discovered ones. To achieve these goals, both\nhardware and data analysis must employ cutting-edge techniques. This also\napplies to the LST-1, the first IACT built for the CTAO, which is currently\ntaking data on the Canary island of La Palma. This paper introduces a new event\nreconstruction technique for IACT data, aiming to improve the image\nreconstruction quality and the discrimination between the signal and the\nbackground from misidentified hadrons and electrons. The technique models the\ndevelopment of the extensive air shower signal, recorded as a waveform per\npixel, seen by CTAO telescopes' cameras. Model parameters are subsequently\npassed to random forest regressors and classifiers to extract information on\nthe primary particle. The new reconstruction was applied to simulated data and\nto data from observations of the Crab Nebula performed by the LST-1. The event\nreconstruction method presented here shows promising performance improvements.\nThe angular and energy resolution, and the sensitivity, are improved by 10 to\n20% over most of the energy range. At low energy, improvements reach up to 22%,\n47%, and 50%, respectively. A future extension of the method to stereoscopic\nanalysis for telescope arrays will be the next important step.",

However, current quantum algorithms are\nconstrained by hardware limitations and the increased number of measurements\nrequired to achieve chemical accuracy. To address the measurement challenge,\ntechniques for grouping commuting and anti-commuting terms, driven by\nheuristics, have been developed to reduce the number of measurements needed in\nquantum algorithms on near-term quantum devices. In this work, we propose a\nprobabilistic framework using GFlowNets to group fully (FC) or qubit-wise\ncommuting (QWC) terms within a given Hamiltonian.

    "abstract": "Modeling strong gravitational lenses is prohibitively expensive for modern\nand next-generation cosmic survey data. Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a\nsimulation-based inference (SBI) approach, has been studied as an avenue for\nefficient analysis of strong lensing data. However, NPE has not been\ndemonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data -- e.g., when trained\non simulated data and then applied to real, observational data. In this work,\nwe perform the first study of the efficacy of NPE in combination with\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The source domain is noiseless, and the\ntarget domain has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that\ncombining UDA and NPE improves the accuracy of the inference by 1-2 orders of\nmagnitude and significantly improves the posterior coverage over an NPE model\nwithout UDA. We anticipate that this combination of approaches will help enable\nfuture applications of NPE models to real observational data.",

    "abstract": "For analytical description of the initial stage of jet generation in\nnonequilibrium inhomogeneous plasma in the magnetohydrodynamic approximation,\npossible generalizations of solutions of the nonlinear equation for the stream\nfunction are analyzed. The jet generation model is based on the mechanism of\nconvective instability and the frozen-in condition of magnetic field lines and\nis characterized by a number of free parameters. The equation for the radial\npart of the stream function is satisfied by first-order Bessel functions. To\nsatisfy all the conditions near the jet axis and on its periphery, the found\nsolutions are smoothly joined at the boundary. The final analytical solution\nfor the velocity field is applicable to arbitrary values of dimensionless\ncoordinates. The poloidal velocity increases approximately exponentially, and\nthe azimuthal velocity - according to a superexponential law. In this paper,\nthe velocity field of the jet, which consists of seven sections, is calculated.\nThe rotation of the jet turns out to be differential, and to obtain a solution\nin quadratures for the azimuthal velocity, one can use not only linear but also\npower dependences on the altitude. For the exponent n < 1, a noticeable\nincrease in the azimuthal velocity with radius is observed immediately from the\njet axis, and for n > 1, a region of relative calm is observed near the axis.\nThe jet model is generalized to the case of an arbitrary dependence of the\nBrunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency on the altitude. The corresponding solutions are\nfound for the radial and vertical velocity components. For the initial stage of\ndevelopment, the vertical and azimuthal components of the generated magnetic\nfield of the jet were also found in the work.",

In this work, we present the time series pattern machine (TSPM), a\nmodel designed to excel in a broad range of time series tasks through powerful\nrepresentation and pattern extraction capabilities. Traditional time series\nmodels often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their\neffectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales\nin the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing\nvarious mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series\npatterns. Specifically, we introduce a general-purpose TSPM that processes\nmulti-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2)\ntime image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4)\nmulti-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI\ntransforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing\npatterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis\nattention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically\naggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all\nrepresentations across resolutions. This method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across 8 time series analytical tasks, consistently surpassing both\ngeneral-purpose and task-specific models.

    "abstract": "Training LLMs presents significant memory challenges due to growing size of\ndata, weights, and optimizer states. Techniques such as data and model\nparallelism, gradient checkpointing, and offloading strategies address this\nissue but are often infeasible due to hardware constraints. To mitigate memory\nusage, alternative methods like Parameter-Efficient-Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and\nGaLore approximate weights or optimizer states. PEFT methods, such as LoRA,\nhave gained popularity for fine-tuning LLMs, though they require a full-rank\nwarm start. In contrast, GaLore allows full-parameter learning while being more\nmemory-efficient. This work introduces Natural GaLore, a simple drop in\nreplacement for AdamW, which efficiently applies the inverse Empirical Fisher\nInformation Matrix to low-rank gradients using Woodbury's Identity. We\ndemonstrate that incorporating second-order information speeds up optimization\nsignificantly, especially when the iteration budget is limited. Empirical\npretraining on 60M, 130M, 350M, and 1.1B parameter Llama models on C4 data\ndemonstrate significantly lower perplexity over GaLore without additional\nmemory overhead. By fine-tuning RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark using Natural\nGaLore, we demonstrate significant reduction in gap 86.05% vs 86.28% for\nfull-finetuning. Furthermore, fine-tuning the TinyLlama 1.1B model for function\ncalling using the TinyAgent framework shows that Natural GaLore achieving\n83.09% accuracy on the TinyAgent dataset, significantly outperforms 16-bit LoRA\nat 80.06% and even surpasses GPT4-Turbo by 4%, all while using 30% less memory.\n  All code to reproduce the results are available at:\nhttps://github.com/selfsupervised-ai/Natural-GaLore.git",

To\naddress this issue, we draw inspiration from recommendation systems and propose\nComPO, a method to personalize preference optimization in LMs by\ncontextualizing the probability distribution of model outputs with the\npreference provider. Focusing on group-level preferences rather than\nindividuals, we collect and release ComPRed, a question answering dataset with\ncommunity-level preferences from Reddit. This dataset facilitates studying\ndiversity in preferences without incurring privacy concerns associated with\nindividual feedback. Our experiments reveal that conditioning language models\non a community identifier (i.e., subreddit name) during preference tuning\nsubstantially enhances model performance. Conversely, replacing this context\nwith random subreddit identifiers significantly diminishes performance,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of our approach in tailoring responses to\ncommunities' preferences.",

    "abstract": "Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen\ntarget domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods\nprimarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn\ntexture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to\noverfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based\nmethods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods\nincur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of\nself-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by\nMamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving\nlinear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like\ncomputation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the\ngeneralization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that\ninput-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify\ndomain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based\ntoken-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our\nSTART can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient\ntokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing\nthe discrepancy between different domains. Extensive experiments on five\nbenchmarks demonstrate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with\nefficient linear complexity.

The simulations are\nbased on three BLR models, a Keplerian disk (KD), an equatorial wind (EW), and\na polar wind (PW). We find that the wide variety of observed line profile\ndistortions can be reproduced with microlensing-induced distortions of line\nprofiles generated by our BLR models. For three quasars, the most likely model\nis either KD or EW, depending on the orientation of the magnification map with\nrespect to the BLR axis. This shows that the line profile distortions depend on\nthe position and orientation of the BLR with respect to the caustic network,\nand not only on their different effective sizes. In the other quasars, the EW\nmodel is preferred. For all objects, the PW model has a lower probability. We\nconclude that disk geometries with kinematics dominated by either Keplerian\nrotation or equatorial outflow best reproduce the microlensing effects on the\nMgII and H$\\alpha$ emission lines. The half-light radii of the MgII and\nH$\\alpha$ BLRs are measured in the range of 3 to 25 light-days. The size of the\nregion emitting the low-ionization lines is larger than the region emitting the\nhigh-ionization lines, with a factor of four measured between the sizes of the\nMgII and CIV emitting regions. The microlensing radii of the BLRs are found to\nbe systematically below the radius-luminosity ($R -L$) relations derived from\nreverberation mapping, confirming that the intrinsic dispersion of the BLR\nradii with respect to the $R-L$ relations is large, but also revealing a\nselection bias that affects microlensing-based BLR size measurements.",

Using this observation, I introduce a Bayesian\ninference framework in which an unknown conditional distribution is replaced\nwith a nonparametric posterior, and structural parameter inference is then\nperformed using an implied posterior. The method has the same flexibility as\nfrequentist semiparametric estimators and does not require converting\nconditional moments to unconditional moments. Importantly, I prove a\nsemiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem, providing conditions under which,\nin large samples, the posterior for the structural parameter is approximately\nnormal, centered at an efficient estimator, and has variance equal to the\nChamberlain (1987) semiparametric efficiency bound. As byproducts, I show that\nBayesian uncertainty quantification methods are asymptotically optimal\nfrequentist confidence sets and derive low-level sufficient conditions for\nGaussian process priors.

The optimization process involves two main objectives: maximizing the\nend-fire gain and minimizing the reflection coefficient to ensure high realized\ngain. In the first step, the current excitation vector of the fully driven\narray is selected to maximize the end-fire gain. Then, all but one of the\ndipoles are reactively loaded according to their input impedance. Following\nthat, the optimization focuses on the inter-element distance, computing the one\nthat offers a favorable balance between the gain and the total efficiency. This\nmulti-objective optimization leverages the differential evolution (DE)\nalgorithm and utilizes a simple wire dipole as the unit element. Full-wave\nsimulations further confirm the accuracy of our theoretical results. Our two-\nand three-element parasitic arrays achieve realized gain comparable to\nstate-of-the-art designs, without relying on intricate unit elements or\nresource-intensive simulations. Moreover, our four- and five-element parasitic\narrays deliver the highest realized gain values reported in the literature. The\nsimplicity of our approach is validated by significant time savings, with\ntheoretical models completing optimizations much faster than full-wave\nsimulations. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of\nthe proposed optimization algorithm, demonstrating that the optimized design\nparameters remain effective even under small deviations in loads and element\npositions. Finally, the proposed parasitic arrays are well-suited for base\nstation antennas due to their compact design, reduced power consumption, and\nsimplified hardware requirements, making them ideal for modern communication\nsystems.",

For example, gpt-4o-mini often picks the first of two options\npresented in the prompt regardless of the options' implied likelihoods, whereas\nLlama-3.1-8B picks the second. Models do not allocate probability mass among\nvalid options in a calibrated manner.",

    "abstract": "A common challenge towards the adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nis their ability to learn new languages over time without hampering the model's\nperformance on languages in which the model is already proficient (usually\nEnglish). Continual fine-tuning (CFT) is the process of sequentially\nfine-tuning an LLM to enable the model to adapt to downstream tasks with\nvarying data distributions and time shifts. This paper focuses on the language\nadaptability of LLMs through CFT. We study a two-phase CFT process in which an\nEnglish-only end-to-end fine-tuned LLM from Phase 1 (predominantly Task\nAbility) is sequentially fine-tuned on a multilingual dataset -- comprising\ntask data in new languages -- in Phase 2 (predominantly Language Ability). We\nobserve that the ``similarity'' of Phase 2 tasks with Phase 1 determines the\nLLM's adaptability. For similar phase-wise datasets, the LLM after Phase 2 does\nnot show deterioration in task ability. In contrast, when the phase-wise\ndatasets are not similar, the LLM's task ability deteriorates. We test our\nhypothesis on the open-source \\mis\\ and \\llm\\ models with multiple phase-wise\ndataset pairs. To address the deterioration, we analyze tailored variants of\ntwo CFT methods: layer freezing and generative replay. Our findings demonstrate\ntheir effectiveness in enhancing the language ability of LLMs while preserving\ntask performance, in comparison to relevant baselines.",

Here, we use both linear\nresponse theory and adiabatic response theory to derive the spin friction\nmicroscopically for a generic single-band tight-binding model of the electronic\nstructure. The resulting Gilbert damping is time-dependent and nonlocal. For a\none-dimensional model, we compare the emergent relaxation dynamics as obtained\nfrom LRT and ART against each other and against the full solution of the\nmicroscopic equations of motion and demonstrate the importance of nonlocality,\nwhile the time dependence turns out to be irrelevant. In two dimensions and for\na few magnetic moments in different geometries, it is found that the inclusion\nof nonlocal Gilbert damping can counterintuitively lead to longer relaxation\ntimes. Besides the distance dependence, the directional dependence of the\nnonlocal Gilbert damping turns out as very important. Our results are based on\nan expression relating the nonlocal Gilbert damping to the nonlocal\ntight-binding density of states close to the Fermi energy. This is exact in\ncase of noninteracting electrons. Effects due to electronic correlations are\nstudied within the random-phase approximation.

Recent interest on the phonon\nbehavior in chiral materials is growing due to their unique characteristics,\nincluding topological phonons, protected surface states and the chiral phonons\nwith non-zero angular momentums. In this study, we explore the topological and\nchiral phonon behavior in RhGe, using first-principles density functional\ntheory calculations as well as the symmetry and topological analysis. In\nparticular, we uncover six spin-1 triply degenerate nodal points at the\n$\\Gamma$ point and six charge-2 double Weyl points at the R point in the\nBrillouin zone (BZ). Interestingly, these topological features are identical to\nthat in the electronic band structure without the electron spin-orbit coupling,\nof the same material. We expect that this finding not only applies to the CoSi\nfamily but also is universal. Secondly, we find that chiral crystal RhGe hosts\nchiral phonon modes with a phonon angular momentum (PAM) and an associated\nphonon magnetic moment (PMM), everywhere in the BZ except at high symmetry\npoints such as $\\Gamma$, R, X and M. The PAM and PMM are large along the chiral\nrotation axis and also in the vicinity of the topological nodes. Our study also\nreveals that all the topological phonon modes are chiral. However, the reverse\nis not always true. Among other things, our finding of the coexistence of\ntopological and chiral phonon modes in chiral RhGe not only deepens our\nunderstanding of the phonon behavior in the CoSi-family but also opens new\npathways for developing advanced materials and devices.",

Since the\nextracted response functions cover a large kinematic range they can be readily\nused for comparison to theoretical predictions as well as validation and tuning\nMonte Carlo (MC) generators for electron and neutrino scattering experiments.\nComparisons to several theoretical approaches and MC generators are given in\narXiv:2409.10637v1 [hep-ex]. We find that among all the theoretical models that\nwere investigated, the ``Energy Dependent-Relativistic Mean Field'' (ED-RMF)\napproach provides the best description of both the Quasielastic (QE) and {\\it\nnuclear excitation} response functions (leading to single nucleon final states)\nover all values of four-momentum transfer. he QE data are also well described\nby the \"Short Time Approximation Quantum Monte Carlo\" (STA-QMC) calculation\nwhich includes both single and two nucleon final states which presently is only\nvalid for momentum transfer $0.3<{\\bf q} < 0.65$ GeV and does not include\nnuclear excitations. An analytic extrapolation of STA-QMC to lower $\\bf q$ has\nbeen implemented in the GENIE MC generator for $\\rm^{4}He$ and a similar\nextrapolation for ${\\rm ^{12}C}$ is under development.

Three cases of intermittent BLF,\ncharacterized by periodic flame entry and exit of the mixing tube, are\npresented. The intermittent BLF characteristics varied with the hydrogen volume\nfraction. Small flame bulges entered and exited the mixing tube in low\nhydrogen-enrichment cases. The duration of intermittent BLF events and BLF\ndepth increased as the hydrogen content increased. Meanwhile, a large flame\ntongue penetrating deeply upstream characterised the highest\nhydrogen-enrichment case.The mean BLF peak depths and standard deviations\nobtained through simulations aligned well with experimental data for low and\nmoderate hydrogen-enrichment cases. However, LES-FSD underestimated the average\nBLF peak depth for the highest hydrogen-enrichment case.Analysis of the\nflow-flame interaction revealed two mechanisms underlying the intermittent BLF\nphenomena. The flame bulges' oscillation near the outlet is caused by the\nreverse flow induced by the recirculation zone.

While methods such as re-weighting and re-sampling\nhelp alleviate the imbalance issue, limited sample diversity continues to\nhinder models from learning robust and generalizable feature representations,\nparticularly for tail classes. In contrast to existing methods, we offer a\nnovel perspective on long-tail learning, inspired by an observation: datasets\nwith finer granularity tend to be less affected by data imbalance. In this\npaper, we investigate this phenomenon through both quantitative and qualitative\nstudies, showing that increased granularity enhances the generalization of\nlearned features in tail categories.

This forms the core contribution and insight of our approach. To\nautomate the curation of auxiliary data, we leverage large language models\n(LLMs) as knowledge bases to search for auxiliary categories and retrieve\nrelevant images through web crawling. To prevent the overwhelming presence of\nauxiliary classes from disrupting training, we introduce a neighbor-silencing\nloss that encourages the model to focus on class discrimination within the\ntarget dataset. During inference, the classifier weights for auxiliary\ncategories are masked out, leaving only the target class weights for use.\nExtensive experiments and ablation studies on three standard long-tail\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, notably outperforming\nstrong baseline methods that use the same amount of data. The code will be made\npublicly available.",

    "abstract": "The sample inefficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) remains a significant\nchallenge in robotics. RL requires large-scale simulation and can still cause\nlong training times, slowing research and innovation. This issue is\nparticularly pronounced in vision-based control tasks where reliable state\nestimates are not accessible. Differentiable simulation offers an alternative\nby enabling gradient back-propagation through the dynamics model, providing\nlow-variance analytical policy gradients and, hence, higher sample efficiency.\nHowever, its usage for real-world robotic tasks has yet been limited. This work\ndemonstrates the great potential of differentiable simulation for learning\nquadrotor control. We show that training in differentiable simulation\nsignificantly outperforms model-free RL in terms of both sample efficiency and\ntraining time, allowing a policy to learn to recover a quadrotor in seconds\nwhen providing vehicle states and in minutes when relying solely on visual\nfeatures. The key to our success is two-fold. First, the use of a simple\nsurrogate model for gradient computation greatly accelerates training without\nsacrificing control performance. Second, combining state representation\nlearning with policy learning enhances convergence speed in tasks where only\nvisual features are observable. These findings highlight the potential of\ndifferentiable simulation for real-world robotics and offer a compelling\nalternative to conventional RL approaches.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have garnered substantial attention due to their\npromising applications in diverse domains. Nevertheless, the increasing size of\nLLMs comes with a significant surge in the computational requirements for\ntraining and deployment. Memristor crossbars have emerged as a promising\nsolution, which demonstrated a small footprint and remarkably high energy\nefficiency in computer vision (CV) models. Memristors possess higher density\ncompared to conventional memory technologies, making them highly suitable for\neffectively managing the extreme model size associated with LLMs. However,\ndeploying LLMs on memristor crossbars faces three major challenges. Firstly,\nthe size of LLMs increases rapidly, already surpassing the capabilities of\nstate-of-the-art memristor chips. Secondly, LLMs often incorporate multi-head\nattention blocks, which involve non-weight stationary multiplications that\ntraditional memristor crossbars cannot support. Third, while memristor\ncrossbars excel at performing linear operations, they are not capable of\nexecuting complex nonlinear operations in LLM such as softmax and layer\nnormalization. To address these challenges, we present a novel architecture for\nthe memristor crossbar that enables the deployment of state-of-the-art LLM on a\nsingle chip or package, eliminating the energy and time inefficiencies\nassociated with off-chip communication. Our testing on BERT_Large showed\nnegligible accuracy loss. Compared to traditional memristor crossbars, our\narchitecture achieves enhancements of up to 39X in area overhead and 18X in\nenergy consumption. Compared to modern TPU/GPU systems, our architecture\ndemonstrates at least a 68X reduction in the area-delay product and a\nsignificant 69% energy consumption reduction.",

The obvious signed\nShannon candidate is ruled out because it violates extensivity. We prove four\nresults that bolster the usefulness of the new measure. (i) It serves as a\nwitness of negative probability. (ii) For $\\alpha > 1$, it is Schur-concave,\ndelivering the intuitive property that mixing increases entropy. (iii) The same\nparametric family obeys a quantum H-theorem, namely, that under de-phasing\ndynamics entropy cannot decrease. (iv) The $2$-entropy is conserved under\ndiscrete Moyal-bracket dynamics, mirroring conservation of von Neumann entropy\nunder unitary evolution on Hilbert space. We also comment on interpreting the\nR\\'enyi order parameter as an inverse temperature.

For this problem, we observe that minimizing the\nKKT Loss alone outperforms training the network with a weighted sum of the KKT\nLoss and a Data Loss (the mean-squared error between the ground truth optimal\nsolutions and the network's output). Moreover, minimizing only the Data Loss\nyields inferior results compared to those obtained by minimizing the KKT Loss.\nWhile the approach is promising, the obtained primal and dual solutions are not\nsufficiently close to the ground truth optimal solutions.

Our goal is\nto exploit information from the explosion to infer orientations of proteins at\nthe time of X-ray exposure. Our results demonstrate that partial orientation\ninformation can be extracted, particularly for larger proteins. Our findings\ncan be integrated into existing reconstruction algorithms such as\nExpand-Maximize-Compress, to improve their efficiency and reduce the need for\nhigh-quality diffraction patterns. This method offers a promising avenue for\nenhancing Single Particle Imaging by leveraging measurable data from the\nCoulomb explosion to provide valuable insights about orientation.",

    "abstract": "In the first half of May 2024, the solar active region (AR)13664 was\nresponsible for generating the strongest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years,\nthrough an enhanced production of X-class flares and coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs). A key factor in this production was the complex magnetic topology of\nAR13664. In this work, we investigate the region's magnetic topology related to\nthe production of its first halo CME on May 8th. This is achieved by combining\ndifferent observations of magnetic topology based on photospheric magnetic\nwinding signatures and nonlinear force-free extrapolations, together with\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations at different wavelengths. We\npresent evidence that the first halo CME, and its associated X1 flare, was\ncreated by an emerging bipole of twisted magnetic field, following the general\npicture of the standard flare model. The coincidence of the first large\nmagnetic winding signature with the start time of the X1 flare, provides the\nonset time for the CME as well as the period of enhanced eruptive activity of\nthe region - 04:36UT on May 8th. Finally, our topological analysis identifies\nthe key topological sub-regions of AR13664 that can lead to subsequent\neruptions, which will be useful for further studies of this region.",

Solvers of this type separate the\noptimization problem from the differential equation and solve each\nindividually. The new solver relies on the reduction of a DAEO to a sequence of\ndifferential inclusions separated by jump events. These jump events occur when\nthe global solution to the optimization problem jumps to a new value. Without\nexplicit treatment, these events will reduce the order of convergence of the\nintegration step to one. The solver implements a \"local optimizer tracking\"\nprocedure to detect and correct these jump events. Local optimizer tracking is\nmuch less expensive than running a deterministic global optimizer at every time\nstep. This preserves the order of convergence of the integrator component\nwithout sacrificing performance to perform deterministic global optimization at\nevery time step. The newly developed solver produces correct solutions to DAEOs\nand runs much faster than sequential DAEO solvers that rely only on global\noptimization.",

The common\napproach to solve an SOS problem is by relaxation to a Semidefinite Program\n(SDP). The main advantage of this transormation is that SDP is a convex problem\nfor which efficient solvers are readily available. However, while considerable\nprogress has been made in recent years, the standard approaches for solving\nSDPs are still known to scale poorly. Our goal is to devise an approach that\ncan handle larger, more complex problems than is currently possible. The\nchallenge indeed lies in how SDPs are commonly solved. State-Of-The-Art\napproaches rely on the interior point method, which requires the factorization\nof large matrices. We instead propose an approach inspired by polynomial neural\nnetworks, which exhibit excellent performance when optimized using techniques\nfrom the deep learning toolbox. In a somewhat counter-intuitive manner, we\nreplace the convex SDP formulation with a non-convex, unconstrained, and\n\\emph{over parameterized} formulation, and solve it using a first order\noptimization method. It turns out that this approach can handle very large\nproblems, with polynomials having over four million coefficients, well beyond\nthe range of current SDP-based approaches. Furthermore, we highlight\ntheoretical and practical results supporting the experimental success of our\napproach in avoiding spurious local minima, which makes it amenable to simple\nand fast solutions based on gradient descent. In all the experiments, our\napproach had always converged to a correct global minimum, on general\n(non-sparse) polynomials, with running time only slightly higher than linear in\nthe number of polynomial coefficients, compared to higher than quadratic in the\nnumber of coefficients for SDP-based methods.",

We innovatively associate the quality of a condition\nwith its ability to reduce uncertainty and interpret noisy cross-frame features\nas a form of noisy condition.

MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical\napplications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and\nholistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these\napplications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here\nreferred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly\nbranched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology\nof such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at\na target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical\nend-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in\nlinear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to\nany MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as\nsignaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering\ncomponents that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively\nisolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model\nwith testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule\ndelay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule\ndispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the\ncharacterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the\nnetwork topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for\noptimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed\ntopologies for given SNR requirements.",

Existing deep\nlearning-based methods have shown significant achievements in this field.\nHowever, they still face limitations in effectively handling long sequences and\naddressing the issue of shrinkage artifacts around the surface of the point\ncloud. Inspired by the newly proposed Mamba, in this paper, we introduce a\nnetwork named MBPU built on top of the Mamba architecture, which performs well\nin long sequence modeling, especially for large-scale point cloud upsampling,\nand achieves fast convergence speed. Moreover, MBPU is an arbitrary-scale\nupsampling framework as the predictor of point distance in the point refinement\nphase. At the same time, we simultaneously predict the 3D position shift and 1D\npoint-to-point distance as regression quantities to constrain the global\nfeatures while ensuring the accuracy of local details. We also introduce a fast\ndifferentiable renderer to further enhance the fidelity of the upsampled point\ncloud and reduce artifacts. It is noted that, by the merits of our fast point\nrendering, MBPU yields high-quality upsampled point clouds by effectively\neliminating surface noise.

This allows to systematically\nidentify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by\nSoviet propaganda and quantify their importance.",

At this high\ntemporal resolution, two variables, precipitation and radiation, exhibit a high\nshare of zero inflation. We propose a novel bias-correction method, VBC (Vine\ncopula bias correction), that models and transfers multivariate dependence\nstructures for zero-inflated margins in the data from its error-prone model\ndomain to a reference domain. VBC estimates the model and reference\ndistribution using vine copulas and corrects the model distribution via\n(inverse) Rosenblatt transformation.

This novel approach allows for more accurate modelling of\nmultivariate zero-inflated climate data.

    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the exploration of rectangular finite elements'\nability to model the stress-strain state of isotropic and orthotropic materials\nwith a negative Poisson's ratio, known as auxetic materials. By employing\nlinear elasticity in the plane stress formulation, the research evaluates the\nlinear compatible and the quadratic incompatible shape functions in describing\nthe mechanical behavior of auxetic materials within a displacement-based finite\nelement method under static shear and indentation. Additionally, the analytical\nexpression of an incompatible rectangular finite element is adapted to\naccommodate an orthotropic case. Hexachiral and re-entrant honeycomb\nstructures, characterized by auxetic behavior, are modeled as continuous media\nwith homogenized properties using analytical expressions for their effective\nmaterial constants. The findings reveal that while the classical shape\nfunctions may be sufficient for displacement modeling, they are ineffective in\naccurately predicting the characteristic auxetic behavior and stress\ndistributions in auxetic materials. In contrast, the incompatible shape\nfunctions prove to be effective in providing appropriate stress modeling in\nboth cases. This work underscores the relevance of the incompatible rectangular\nfinite elements in the analysis of advanced materials with a negative Poisson's\nratio. It provides computationally efficient approaches for the calculation of\nauxetic honeycomb structures and multilayer composites based on them.",

Unlike conventional reactive methods relying on\ngradient information, our methodology enables the swarm to determine an\nascending direction so that it approaches the source with an arbitrary\nprecision. Our source-seeking solution consists of three distributed algorithms\nrunning simultaneously in a slow-fast closed-loop system. The fastest algorithm\nprovides the centroid-relative coordinates of the robots and the next slower\none provides the ascending direction to be tracked. The tracking of the\nascending direction by single integrators is instantaneous; howeverin this\npaper we will also focus on 2D unicycle-like robots with a constant speed. The\nthird algorithm, the slowest one since the speed of the robots can be chosen\narbitrarily slow, is the individual control law for the unicycle to track the\nestimated ascending direction.We will show that the three distributed\nalgorithms converge exponentially fast to their objectives, allowing for a\nfeasible slow-fast closed-loop system. The robots are not constrained to any\nparticular geometric formation, and we study both discrete and continuous\ndistributions of robots.The swarm shape analysis reveals the resiliency of our\napproach as expected in robot swarms, i.e., by amassing robots we ensure the\nsource-seeking functionality in the event of missing or misplaced individuals\nor even if the robot network splits in two or more disconnected subnetworks.We\nexploit such an analysis so that the swarm can adapt to unknown environments by\nmorphing its shape and maneuvering while still following an ascending\ndirection. We analyze our solution with robots as kinematic points in\nn-dimensional Euclidean spaces and extend the analysis to 2D unicycle-like\nrobots with constant speeds.",

The objective is to find the set of\nbreakpoints, i.e., the points at which the minimum cut changes. It is well\nknown that this problem can be solved in the same asymptotic runtime as the\nstatic minimum cut problem. However, existing algorithms that achieve this\nruntime bound involve fairly complicated steps that are inefficient in\npractice. PBFS uses a simpler approach that discovers the breakpoints in\nascending order, which allows it to achieve the desired runtime bound while\nstill performing well in practice. We evaluate our algorithm on benchmark\ninstances from polygon aggregation and computer vision. Polygon aggregation was\nrecently proposed as an application for parametric minimum cut, but the\nmonotonicity property has not been exploited fully. PBFS outperforms the state\nof the art on most benchmark instances, usually by a factor of 2-3. It is\nparticularly strong on instances with many breakpoints, which is the case for\npolygon aggregation. Compared to the existing min-cut-based approach for\npolygon aggregation, PBFS scales much better with the instance size. On large\ninstances with millions of vertices, it is able to compute all breakpoints in a\nmatter of seconds.",

    "abstract": "In ImageNet-condensation, the storage for auxiliary soft labels exceeds that\nof the condensed dataset by over 30 times. However, are large-scale soft labels\nnecessary for large-scale dataset distillation? In this paper, we first\ndiscover that the high within-class similarity in condensed datasets\nnecessitates the use of large-scale soft labels. This high within-class\nsimilarity can be attributed to the fact that previous methods use samples from\ndifferent classes to construct a single batch for batch normalization (BN)\nmatching. To reduce the within-class similarity, we introduce class-wise\nsupervision during the image synthesizing process by batching the samples\nwithin classes, instead of across classes. As a result, we can increase\nwithin-class diversity and reduce the size of required soft labels. A key\nbenefit of improved image diversity is that soft label compression can be\nachieved through simple random pruning, eliminating the need for complex\nrule-based strategies. Experiments validate our discoveries. For example, when\ncondensing ImageNet-1K to 200 images per class, our approach compresses the\nrequired soft labels from 113 GB to 2.8 GB (40x compression) with a 2.6%\nperformance gain.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been widely used to learn from both a few\nlabeled images and many unlabeled images to overcome the scarcity of labeled\nsamples in medical image segmentation. Most current SSL-based segmentation\nmethods use pixel values directly to identify similar features in labeled and\nunlabeled data. They usually fail to accurately capture the intricate\nattachment structures in the left atrium, such as the areas of inconsistent\ndensity or exhibit outward curvatures, adding to the complexity of the task. In\nthis paper, we delve into this issue and introduce an effective solution,\nCORAL(Correlation-Aligned)-Correlation Consistency Network (CORN), to capture\nthe global structure shape and local details of Left Atrium. Diverging from\nprevious methods focused on each local pixel value, the CORAL-Correlation\nConsistency Module (CCM) in the CORN leverages second-order statistical\ninformation to capture global structural features by minimizing the\ndistribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled samples in feature\nspace. Yet, direct construction of features from unlabeled data frequently\nresults in ``Sample Selection Bias'', leading to flawed supervision. We thus\nfurther propose the Dynamic Feature Pool (DFP) for the CCM, which utilizes a\nconfidence-based filtering strategy to remove incorrectly selected features and\nregularize both teacher and student models by constraining the similarity\nmatrix to be consistent. Extensive experiments on the Left Atrium dataset have\nshown that the proposed CORN outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nsemi-supervised learning methods.",

    "abstract": "When building a predictive model, it is often difficult to ensure that\napplication-specific requirements are encoded by the model that will eventually\nbe deployed. Consider researchers working on hate speech detection. They will\nhave an idea of what is considered hate speech, but building a model that\nreflects their view accurately requires preserving those ideals throughout the\nworkflow of data set construction and model training. Complications such as\nsampling bias, annotation bias, and model misspecification almost always arise,\npossibly resulting in a gap between the application specification and the\nmodel's actual behavior upon deployment. To address this issue for hate speech\ndetection, we propose DefVerify: a 3-step procedure that (i) encodes a\nuser-specified definition of hate speech, (ii) quantifies to what extent the\nmodel reflects the intended definition, and (iii) tries to identify the point\nof failure in the workflow. We use DefVerify to find gaps between definition\nand model behavior when applied to six popular hate speech benchmark datasets.",

After determining a\nlatent style for a trajectory, previous diverse policies recovering methods\nusually employ a vanilla behavioral cloning learning objective conditioned on\nthe latent style, treating each state-action pair in the trajectory with equal\nimportance. Based on an observation that in many scenarios, behavioral styles\nare often highly relevant with only a subset of state-action pairs, this paper\npresents a new principled method in diverse polices recovery. In particular,\nafter inferring or assigning a latent style for a trajectory, we enhance the\nvanilla behavioral cloning by incorporating a weighting mechanism based on\npointwise mutual information. This additional weighting reflects the\nsignificance of each state-action pair's contribution to learning the style,\nthus allowing our method to focus on state-action pairs most representative of\nthat style. We provide theoretical justifications for our new objective, and\nextensive empirical evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our method in\nrecovering diverse policies from expert data.",

These models offer greater\naccuracy than models trained on each catchment independently if using the same\ndata. However, the same data is rarely available for all catchments. This\nprevents the use of variables available only in some catchments, such as\nhistoric river discharge or upstream discharge. The only existing method that\nallows for optional variables requires all variables to be considered in the\ninitial training of the model, limiting its transferability to new catchments.\nTo address this limitation, we develop the Hydra-LSTM. The Hydra-LSTM processes\nvariables used across all catchments and variables used in only some catchments\nseparately to allow general training and use of catchment-specific data in\nindividual catchments. The bulk of the model can be shared across catchments,\nmaintaining the benefits of multi-catchment models to generalise, while also\nbenefitting from the advantages of using bespoke data. We apply this\nmethodology to 1 day-ahead river discharge prediction in the Western US, as\nnext-day river discharge prediction is the first step towards prediction across\nlonger time scales. We obtain state-of-the-art performance, generating more\naccurate median and quantile predictions than Multi-Catchment and\nSingle-Catchment LSTMs while allowing local forecasters to easily introduce and\nremove variables from their prediction set. We test the ability of the\nHydra-LSTM to incorporate catchment-specific data by introducing historical\nriver discharge as a catchment-specific input, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmodels without needing to train an entirely new model.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a novel, MaxSAT-based method for error correction in quantum\ncomputing has been proposed that requires both incremental MaxSAT solving\ncapabilities and support for XOR constraints, but no dedicated MaxSAT solver\nfulfilling these criteria existed yet. We alleviate that and introduce IGMaxHS,\nwhich is based on the existing solvers iMaxHS and GaussMaxHS, but poses fewer\nrestrictions on the XOR constraints than GaussMaxHS. IGMaxHS is fuzz tested\nwith xwcnfuzz, an extension of wcnfuzz that can directly output XOR\nconstraints. As a result, IGMaxHS is the only solver that reported neither\nincorrect unsatisfiability verdicts nor invalid models nor incoherent cost\nmodel combinations in a final fuzz testing comparison of all three solvers with\n10000 instances. We detail the steps required for implementing Gaussian\nelimination on XOR constraints in CDCL SAT solvers, and extend the recently\nproposed re-entrant incremental MaxSAT solver application program interface to\nallow for incremental addition of XOR constraints. Finally, we show that\nIGMaxHS is capable of decoding quantum color codes through simulation with the\nMunich Quantum Toolkit.",

    "abstract": "In the pursuit of quantum computing, solid-state quantum systems,\nparticularly superconducting ones, have made remarkable advancements over the\npast two decades. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing for\nnext-generation applications necessitates the integration of several million\nqubits, which presents significant challenges in terms of interconnection\ncomplexity and latency that are currently unsolvable with state-of-the-art\nroom-temperature control and readout electronics. Recently, cryogenic\nintegrated circuits (ICs), including CMOS radio-frequency ICs and\nrapid-single-flux-quantum-logic ICs, have emerged as potential alternatives to\nroom-temperature electronics. Unlike their room-temperature counterparts, these\nICs are deployed within cryostats to enhance scalability by reducing the number\nand length of transmission lines. Additionally, operating at cryogenic\ntemperatures can suppress electronic noise and improve qubit control fidelity.\nHowever, for CMOS ICs specifically, circuit design uncertainties arise due to a\nlack of reliable models for cryogenic field effect transistors as well as\nissues related to severe fickle noises and power dissipation at cryogenic\ntemperatures. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on\nboth types of cryogenic control and readout ICs but primarily focuses on the\nmore mature CMOS technology. The discussion encompasses principles underlying\ncontrol and readout techniques employed in cryogenic CMOS ICs along with their\narchitectural designs; characterization and modeling approaches for field\neffect transistors under cryogenic conditions; as well as fundamental concepts\npertaining to rapid single flux quantum circuits.",

The technique has\nproven useful for diverse tasks including load balancing, managing system\nupdates, improving data locality, and improving system resilience.\nUnfortunately, current live migration solutions fail to meet today's computing\nneeds. First, most techniques do not support heterogeneous source and\ndestination hosts, as they require the two machines to have the same\ninstruction set architecture (ISA) or use the same operating system (OS), which\nhampers numerous live migration usecases. Second, many techniques are not\ntransparent, as they require that applications be written in a specific\nhigh-level language or call specific library functions, which imposes barriers\nto entry for many users. We present a new lightweight abstraction, called a\nvessel, that supports transparent heterogeneous live migration. A vessel\nmaintains a machine-independent encoding of a process's state, using\nWebAssembly abstractions, allowing it to be executed on nearly-arbitrary ISAs.\nA vessel virtualizes all of its OS state, using the WebAssembly System\nInterface (WASI), allowing it to execute on nearly arbitrary OS. We introduce\ndocks and software systems that execute and migrate vessels. Docks face two key\nchallenges: First, maintaining a machine-independent encoding at all points in\na process is extremely expensive. So, docks instead ensure that a vessel is\nguaranteed to eventually reach a machine-independent point and delay the\ninitiation of vessel migration until the vessel reaches such a point. Second, a\ndock may receive a vessel migration that originates from a dock executing on a\ndifferent OS.",

However, in some situations perfectly\nindistinguishable bosons may counter-intuitively bunch less than classical,\ndistinguishable particles. Here we report two such counter-intuitive\nmultiphoton bunching effects observed with three photons in a three-mode\nbalanced photonic Fourier interferometer. In this setting, we show\nindistinguishable photons actually minimize the probability of bunching. We\nalso show that any non-trivial value of the three-photon collective photonic\nphase leads to a decreased probability of all photons ending up in the same\nmode, even as we increase pairwise indistinguishability.

    "abstract": "Polynomial factorization over $ZZ$ is of great historical and practical\nimportance. Currently, the standard technique is to factor the polynomial over\nfinite fields first and then to lift to integers. Factorization over finite\nfields can be done in polynomial time using Berlekamp or Cantor-Zassenhaus\nalgorithms. Lifting from the finite field to $ZZ$ requires a combinatorial\nalgorithm. The van Hoeij algorithm casts the combinatorial problem as a\nknapsack-equivalent problem, which is then solved using lattice-reduction (the\nLLL algorithm) in polynomial time, which is implemented in many computer\nalgebra systems (CAS).\n  In this paper, we revisit the old idea of starting with factorization over\n$RR$ instead of a finite field, followed by recombination of the resulting\nlinear and quadratic factors. We transform the problem into an integer subset\nsum problem, which is then solved using the Horowizt-Sinha algorithm. This\nalgorithm can factor a random integer polynomial of degree $d$ in a time\ncomplexity of $O(2^(d slash 4))$.\n  While the resulting algorithm is exponential, consistent with the integer\nsubset sum problem being in NP, it has a few advantages. First, it is simple\nand easy to implement. Second, it is almost embarrassingly parallelizable. We\ndemonstrate this by implementing the algorithm in a Graphic Processing Unit\n(GPU). The resulting code can factor a degree 100 polynomial is a few tenths of\na second, comparable to some standard CAS. This shows that it is possible to\nuse current hardware, especially massively parallel systems like GPU, to the\nbenefit of symbolic algebra.",

Grammars exhibit consistent\norganizational patterns across diverse languages, invariably rooted in a\nsemantic foundation-a widely confirmed but still theoretically unexplained\nphenomenon. To explain the basis of universal grammatical patterns, we unify\ntwo fundamental properties of grammar, semantic encoding and agreement-based\npredictability, into a single information-theoretic objective under cognitive\nconstraints, accounting for variable communicative need.

The complexity of price formation in the power system arises from\nits diverse attributes, such as various generator types, each characterized by\nits specific fixed and variable costs as well as different lifetimes. In this\npaper, we adopt an approach that investigates both long-run marginal cost\n(LRMC) and short-run marginal cost (SRMC) in a perfect competition market.\nAccording to economic theory, marginal pricing serves as an effective method\nfor determining the generation cost of electricity. This paper presents a\ncapacity expansion model designed to evaluate the marginal cost of electricity\ngeneration, encompassing both long-term and short-term perspectives. Following\na parametric analysis and the calculation of LRMCs, this study investigates the\nallocation of investment costs across various time periods and how these costs\nfactor into the LRMC to ensure cost recovery. Additionally, an exploration of\nSRMCs reveals the conditions under which LRMCs and SRMCs converge or diverge.\nWe observe that when there is a disparity between LRMC and SRMC, setting\nelectricity generation prices equal to SRMCs does not ensure the complete\nrecovery of investment and operational costs. This phenomenon holds\nimplications for market reliability and challenges the pricing strategies that\nrely solely on SRMCs. Furthermore, our investigation highlighted the\nsignificance of addressing degeneracy in the power market modeling. Primal\ndegeneracy in the SRMC model can result in multiple values for the dual\nvariable representing SRMC. This multiplicity of values creates ambiguity\nregarding the precise SRMC value, making it challenging to ascertain the\ncorrect estimation. As a result, resolving degeneracy will ensure the\nreliability of the SRMC value, consequently enhancing the robustness and\ncredibility of our analysis.",

    "abstract": "An accurate approximation of solutions to elliptic problems in infinite\ndomains is challenging from a computational point of view. This is due to the\nneed to replace the infinite domain with a sufficiently large and bounded\ncomputational domain, and posing artificial boundary conditions on the boundary\nof the truncated computational geometry, which will then pollute the solution\nin an interior region of interest. For elliptic problems with periodically\nvarying coefficients (with a possibly unknown period), a modelling strategy\nbased on exponentially regularized elliptic problem was previously developed\nand analysed. The main idea was to replace the infinite domain periodic problem\nwith a regularized elliptic problem posed over a finite domain, while retaining\nan accuracy decaying exponentially with respect to the size of the truncated\ndomain. In this article, we extend the analysis to problems, where no\nstructural assumptions on the coefficient are assumed. Moreover, the analysis\nhere uncovers an interesting property of the right hand side in the Fourier\ndomain for the method to converge fast for problems beyond periodicity.",

    "abstract": "Traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) lack scalability and lose individual\nnode characteristics due to over-smoothing, especially in the case of deeper\nnetworks. This results in sub-optimal feature representation, affecting the\nmodel's performance on tasks involving dynamically changing graphs. To address\nthis issue, we present Graph Selective States Focused Attention Networks\n(GSANs) based neural network architecture for graph-structured data. The GSAN\nis enabled by multi-head masked self-attention (MHMSA) and selective state\nspace modeling (S3M) layers to overcome the limitations of GNNs. In GSAN, the\nMHMSA allows GSAN to dynamically emphasize crucial node connections,\nparticularly in evolving graph environments. The S3M layer enables the network\nto adjust dynamically in changing node states and improving predictions of node\nbehavior in varying contexts without needing primary knowledge of the graph\nstructure. Furthermore, the S3M layer enhances the generalization of unseen\nstructures and interprets how node states influence link importance. With this,\nGSAN effectively outperforms inductive and transductive tasks and overcomes the\nissues that traditional GNNs experience. To analyze the performance behavior of\nGSAN, a set of state-of-the-art comparative experiments are conducted on graphs\nbenchmark datasets, including $Cora$, $Citeseer$, $Pubmed$ network citation,\nand $protein-protein-interaction$ datasets, as an outcome, GSAN improved the\nclassification accuracy by $1.56\\%$, $8.94\\%$, $0.37\\%$, and $1.54\\%$ on\n$F1-score$ respectively.",

The new method outlined\nin this paper uses a small-diameter, high-pressure supply line and a subsea\ndeployed tool containing a pump which recirculates the cleaning fluid through\nthe component or system to be retrieved. The main benefit of this method when\ncompared against conventional practices is that it allows achieving higher\nfluid speeds inside the subsea equipment being flushed, while injecting smaller\nflow rates from the surface vessel. The high fluid speeds are achieved with the\nrecirculation pump. The higher fluid speeds ensure efficient sweeping of\nhydrocarbons from complex paths. A reduced flow rate from the surface vessel\nalso allows a small diameter high pressure supply line to be used, which allows\nfor reduced weight and storage. The study is a numerical simulation of the\nmethod applied to a subsea jumper geometry. The injection flow rates required\nto achieve an efficient flushing were determined from previous experimental\nwork. Calculations were made to estimate the pressure and power requirements\nfor performing the flushing operation as well as the design requirements for\nthe supply line concerning dimensions, material properties and the storage\nspace needed on the support vessel. The performance of the proposed novel\nsystem was compared to that of conventional flushing systems. As environmental\nconcerns increase, the presented method has the potential to make the flushing\nprocess more efficient while reducing costs associated with support vessels and\nthe materials needed. The novel system may also be deployed using a low-cost\nInspection Maintenance and Repair (IMR) vessel.

    "abstract": "A fully implicit scheme is proposed for solving the heat equation in 1D\nheterogeneous media, available as a computationally efficient open-source\nPython code. The algorithm uses finite differences on an irregular grid and is\nunconditionally stable due to the implicit formulation. The thermal solver is\nvalidated against a stiff analytical solution, demonstrating its robustness in\nhandling stiff initial conditions. Its general applicability for heterogeneous\ncases is demonstrated through its use in a planetary surface scenario with\nnonlinear boundary conditions induced by blackbody thermal emission.\nMultIHeaTS's advantageous stability allows for computation times up to 100\ntimes faster than Spencer's explicit solver, making it ideal for simulating\nprocesses on large timescales. This solver is used to compare the thermal\nsignatures of homogeneous and bilayer profiles on Europa. Results show that\nhomogeneous materials cannot reproduce the thermal signature observed in\nbilayer profiles, emphasizing the need for multilayer solvers. In order to\noptimize the scientific return of a space mission, we propose a strategy made\nof three local time observations that is enough to identify bilayer media, for\ninstance, for the next missions to the Jovian system. A second application of\nthe solver is the estimation of the temperature profile of Europa's near\nsurface (first 10s m) throughout a 1 million yr simulation with varying orbital\nparameters. The probability distribution of temperature through depth is\nobtained.

    "abstract": "Practical Bayes filters often assume the state distribution of each time step\nto be Gaussian for computational tractability, resulting in the so-called\nGaussian filters. When facing nonlinear systems, Gaussian filters such as\nextended Kalman filter (EKF) or unscented Kalman filter (UKF) typically rely on\ncertain linearization techniques, which can introduce large estimation errors.\nTo address this issue, this paper reconstructs the prediction and update steps\nof Gaussian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization problems, whose\noptimal conditions are found to have analytical forms from Stein's lemma. It is\nobserved that the stationary point for the prediction step requires calculating\nthe first two moments of the prior distribution, which is equivalent to that\nstep in existing moment-matching filters. In the update step, instead of\nlinearizing the model to approximate the stationary points, we propose an\niterative approach to directly minimize the update step's objective to avoid\nlinearization errors. For the purpose of performing the steepest descent on the\nGaussian manifold, we derive its natural gradient that leverages Fisher\ninformation matrix to adjust the gradient direction, accounting for the\ncurvature of the parameter space. Combining this update step with moment\nmatching in the prediction step, we introduce a new iterative filter for\nnonlinear systems called \\textit{N}atural Gr\\textit{a}dient Gaussia\\textit{n}\nAppr\\textit{o}ximation filter, or NANO filter for short. We prove that NANO\nfilter locally converges to the optimal Gaussian approximation at each time\nstep. Furthermore, the estimation error is proven exponentially bounded for\nnearly linear measurement equation and low noise levels through constructing a\nsupermartingale-like property across consecutive time steps.",

We find it difficult for developers to express complex data\nrelationships across actors and reason about the impact of state updates on\nperformance due to opaque state management abstractions.\n  To solve this conundrum, we develop SmSa, a novel data management layer for\nactor systems, allowing developers to declare data dependencies that cut across\nactors, including foreign keys, data replications, and other dependencies. SmSa\ncan transparently enforce the declared dependencies, reducing the burden on\ndevelopers. Furthermore, SmSa employs novel logging and concurrency control\nalgorithms to support transactional maintenance of data dependencies.\n  We demonstrate SmSa can support core data management tasks where dependencies\nacross components appear frequently without jeopardizing application logic\nexpressiveness and performance. Our experiments show SmSa significantly reduces\nthe logging overhead and leads to increased concurrency level, improving by up\nto 2X the performance of state-of-the-art deterministic scheduling approaches.\nAs a result, SmSa will make it easier to design and implement highly\npartitioned and distributed applications.",

While the algorithm has been well-studied\nwhen stochastic gradients are assumed to have a finite variance, there is\nsignificantly less research addressing its theoretical properties in the case\nof infinite variance gradients. In this paper, we establish the asymptotic\nbehavior of stochastic gradient descent in the context of infinite variance\nstochastic gradients, assuming that the stochastic gradient is regular varying\nwith index $\\alpha\\in(1,2)$. The closest result in this context was established\nin 1969 , in the one-dimensional case and assuming that stochastic gradients\nbelong to a more restrictive class of distributions. We extend it to the\nmultidimensional case, covering a broader class of infinite variance\ndistributions. As we show, the asymptotic distribution of the stochastic\ngradient descent algorithm can be characterized as the stationary distribution\nof a suitably defined Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by an appropriate\nstable L\\'evy process.

We start by studying the problem of\nPrincipal with multiple Agents in cooperation. The term cooperation is\nmanifested here by the fact that the agents optimize their criteria through\nPareto equilibria. We show that as the number of agents tends to infinity, the\nprincipal's value function converges to the value function of a McKean--Vlasov\ncontrol problem. Using the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem, we\nderive a constructive method for obtaining approximately optimal contracts for\nthe principal's problem with multiple agents in cooperation. In a second step,\nwe show that the problem of Principal with multiple Agents turns out to also\nconverge, when the number of agents goes to infinity, towards a new\nPrincipal--Agent problem which is the Principal--Agent problem with\nMckean--Vlasov dynamics. This is a Principal--Agent problem where the\nagent--controlled production follows a Mckean-Vlasov dynamics and the contract\ncan depend of the distribution of the production. The value function of the\nprincipal in this setting is equivalent to that of the same McKean--Vlasov\ncontrol problem from the multi--agent scenario. Furthermore, we show that an\noptimal contract can be constructed from the solution to this McKean--Vlasov\ncontrol problem.

Additionally, we have developed a semantic-enhanced dataset comprising\nover 23,000 samples and introduced new personalized evaluation metrics that\nreflect both bidder preferences and profit.

CI pipelines typically\nrun in data centers which contribute significantly to the environmental\nfootprint of ICT, yet there is little information available regarding their\nenvironmental impact. This article aims to bridge this gap by conducting the\nfirst large-scale analysis of the energy footprint of CI pipelines implemented\nwith GitHub Actions and to provide a first overview of the energy impact of CI.\nWe collect, instrument, and reproduce 838 workflows from 396 Java repositories\nhosted on GitHub to measure their energy consumption.

When evaluating\nCO2 emissions based on regional Wh-to-CO2 estimates, we observe that the\naverage aggregated CO2 emissions are significant, averaging 10.5 kg. To put\nthis into perspective, this is akin to the emissions produced by driving\napproximately 100 kilometers in a typical European car (110 gCO2/km).

LiDAR provides\nprecise three-dimensional spatial information, while cameras offer semantic\ninformation. These two modalities are complementary in 3D detection.

Automatic lung image segmentation assists doctors in\nidentifying diseases such as lung cancer, COVID-19, and respiratory disorders.\nHowever, lung segmentation is challenging due to overlapping features like\nvascular and bronchial structures, along with pixel-level fusion of brightness,\ncolor, and texture. New lung segmentation methods face difficulties in\nidentifying long-range relationships between image components, reliance on\nconvolution operations that may not capture all critical features, and the\ncomplex structures of the lungs. Furthermore, semantic gaps between feature\nmaps can hinder the integration of relevant information, reducing model\naccuracy.

We used ESPRESSO archival\nobservations. Our work confirms the Na detections in three systems, namely\nWASP-52b, WASP-76b, and WASP-127b, improving the accuracy of the measured\nabsorption depth. Furthermore, we find that 3D NLTE stellar models can explain\nthe spectral features in HD 209458b without the need for any planetary\nabsorption. In the grid of synthetic spectra, we observe that the CLV effect is\nstronger for stars with low Teff and high log g. However, the combined effect\nof CLV and RM is highly dependent on the orbital geometry of the planet-star\nsystem. With the continuous improvement of instrumentation, it is crucial to\nuse the most accurate stellar models to correct for the CLV+RM effect in\nhigh-resolution transmission spectra, to achieve the best possible\ncharacterization of exoplanet atmospheres. We make our grid of 3D NLTE spectra\nfor Na publicly available.",

Support-guessing involves randomly selecting candidate\nsupports and attempting to decode the error under the assumption that it is\nconfined to these supports. While previous works have focused on worst-case\nscenarios, we analyze the average case and derive an optimal support-guessing\ndistribution in the asymptotic regime.

Our analysis provides exact complexity\nestimates for unique decoding scenarios and establishes tighter bounds beyond\nthe unique decoding radius.\n  Additionally, we introduce a randomized decoding algorithm for Linearized\nReed--Solomon (LRS) codes. This algorithm extends decoding capabilities beyond\nthe unique decoding radius by leveraging an efficient error-and-erasure\ndecoder. Instead of requiring the entire error support to be confined to the\nguessed support, the algorithm succeeds as long as there is sufficient overlap\nbetween the guessed support and the actual error support. As a result, the\nproposed method improves the success probability and reduces computational\ncomplexity compared to generic decoding algorithms.\n  Our contributions offer more accurate complexity estimates than previous\nworks, which are essential for understanding the computational challenges\ninvolved in decoding sum-rank-metric codes.

While recent SOTA HAR research has\ndemonstrated impressive performance, some key aspects remain under-explored.\nFirstly, HAR can be both highly contextualized and personalized. However, prior\nwork has predominantly focused on being Context-Aware (CA) while largely\nignoring the necessity of being User-Aware (UA). We argue that addressing the\nimpact of innate user action-performing differences is equally crucial as\nconsidering external contextual environment settings in HAR tasks. Secondly,\nbeing user-aware makes the model acknowledge user discrepancies but does not\nnecessarily guarantee mitigation of these discrepancies, i.e., unified\npredictions under the same activities. There is a need for a methodology that\nexplicitly enforces closer (different user, same activity) representations. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce CLAUDIA, a novel framework designed to address\nthese issues. Specifically, we expand the contextual scope of the CA-HAR task\nby integrating User Identification (UI) within the CA-HAR framework, jointly\npredicting both CA-HAR and UI in a new task called User and Context-Aware HAR\n(UCA-HAR). This approach enriches personalized and contextual understanding by\njointly learning user-invariant and user-specific patterns. Inspired by SOTA\ndesigns in the visual domain, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss\nobjective on instance-instance pairs to enhance model efficacy and improve\nlearned feature quality.

Utilizing these\nprocesses as generators of partial information, a class of continuous-time\nmartingale -- the filtered arcade martingales (FAMs) -- is constructed. FAMs\ninterpolate through a sequence of target random variables, which form a\ndiscrete-time martingale. The research presented in this paper treats the\nproblem of selecting the worst martingale coupling for given, convexly ordered,\nprobability measures contingent on the paths of FAMs that are constructed using\nthe martingale coupling. This optimization problem, that we term the\ninformation-based martingale optimal transport problem (IB-MOT), can be viewed\nfrom different perspectives. It can be understood as a model-free construction\nof FAMs, in the case where the coupling is not determined, a priori. It can\nalso be considered from the vantage point of optimal transport (OT), where the\nproblem is concerned with introducing a noise factor in martingale optimal\ntransport, similarly to how the entropic regularization of optimal transport\nintroduces noise in OT. The IB-MOT problem is static in its nature, since it is\nconcerned with finding a coupling, but a corresponding dynamical solution can\nbe found by considering the FAM constructed with the identified optimal\ncoupling.

IO effectively combines the generalization capabilities\nof deep learning with the fine-tuning advantages of instance-specific\noptimization. Within this framework, we emphasize the use of gradient\nprojection to mitigate conflicting updates in MOO. This technique projects\nconflicting gradients into a common space, better aligning the dual objectives\nand enhancing optimization stability. We validate our method using a\nstate-of-the-art foundation model on the 3D Brain inter-subject registration\ntask (LUMIR) from the Learn2Reg 2024 Challenge. Our results show significant\nimprovements over standard gradient descent, leading to more accurate and\nreliable registration results.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the efficacy of data augmentations to close the domain gap in\nspaceborne computer vision, crucial for autonomous operations like on-orbit\nservicing. As the use of computer vision in space increases, challenges such as\nhostile illumination and low signal-to-noise ratios significantly hinder\nperformance. While learning-based algorithms show promising results, their\nadoption is limited by the need for extensive annotated training data and the\ndomain gap that arises from differences between synthesized and real-world\nimagery. This study explores domain generalization in terms of data\naugmentations -- classical color and geometric transformations, corruptions,\nand noise -- to enhance model performance across the domain gap. To this end,\nwe conduct an large scale experiment using a hyperparameter optimization\npipeline that samples hundreds of different configurations and searches for the\nbest set to bridge the domain gap. As a reference task, we use 2D object\ndetection and evaluate on the SPEED+ dataset that contains real\nhardware-in-the-loop satellite images in its test set. Moreover, we evaluate\nfour popular object detectors, including Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO-v7, and\nthe open set detector GroundingDINO, and highlight their trade-offs between\nperformance, inference speed, and training time. Our results underscore the\nvital role of data augmentations in bridging the domain gap, improving model\nperformance, robustness, and reliability for critical space applications. As a\nresult, we propose two novel data augmentations specifically developed to\nemulate the visual effects observed in orbital imagery. We conclude by\nrecommending the most effective augmentations for advancing computer vision in\nchallenging orbital environments. Code for training detectors and\nhyperparameter search will be made publicly available.",

Most\nexisting methods utilize Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to encode speech\ninto multiple layers of discrete codes with uniform time scales.

This paper proposes MsCodec, a\nnovel multi-scale neural speech codec that encodes speech into multiple layers\nof discrete codes, each corresponding to a different time scale.

Hardware reliability assessment is a\nmajor concern with respect to measuring the level of safety. Quantifying the\nreliability of emerging ML models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), is\nhighly complex due to their enormous size in terms of the number of parameters\nand computations. Conventionally, Fault Injection (FI) is applied to perform a\nreliability measurement. However, performing FI on modern-day DNNs is\nprohibitively time-consuming if an acceptable confidence level is to be\nachieved. In order to speed up FI for large DNNs, statistical FI has been\nproposed.

Our\nresults are twofold, with (1) bounding how the optimal social cost escalates\nresulting from fairness requirements and (2) presenting the hardness of\napproximation for the problems of finding fair allocations with the minimum\nsocial cost. To quantify the escalation, we introduce cost of fairness (CoF)\n$\\unicode{x2014}$ an alternative to the price of fairness (PoF)\n$\\unicode{x2014}$ to bound the difference (v.s. ratio for PoF) between the\noptimal social cost with and without fairness constraints in the worst-case\ninstance.

    "abstract": "We propose a new estimator for nonparametric binary choice models that does\nnot impose a parametric structure on either the systematic function of\ncovariates or the distribution of the error term. A key advantage of our\napproach is its computational efficiency. For instance, even when assuming a\nnormal error distribution as in probit models, commonly used sieves for\napproximating an unknown function of covariates can lead to a large-dimensional\noptimization problem when the number of covariates is moderate. Our approach,\nmotivated by kernel methods in machine learning, views certain reproducing\nkernel Hilbert spaces as special sieve spaces, coupled with spectral cut-off\nregularization for dimension reduction. We establish the consistency of the\nproposed estimator for both the systematic function of covariates and the\ndistribution function of the error term, and asymptotic normality of the\nplug-in estimator for weighted average partial derivatives. Simulation studies\nshow that, compared to parametric estimation methods, the proposed method\neffectively improves finite sample performance in cases of misspecification,\nand has a rather mild efficiency loss if the model is correctly specified.\nUsing administrative data on the grant decisions of US asylum applications to\nimmigration courts, along with nine case-day variables on weather and\npollution, we re-examine the effect of outdoor temperature on court judges'\n\"mood\", and thus, their grant decisions.",

It is broadly recognised that annotations of\ntext data can contain annotator bias, where systematic disagreement in\nannotations can be traced back to differences in the annotators' backgrounds.\nBeing unaware of such annotator bias can lead to representational bias against\nminority group perspectives and therefore several methods have been proposed\nfor recognising bias or preserving perspectives. These methods typically\nrequire either a substantial number of annotators or annotations per data\ninstance. In this study, we propose a simple method for handling bias in\nannotations without requirements on the number of annotators or instances.\nInstead, we ask annotators about their beliefs of other annotators' judgements\nof an instance, under the hypothesis that these beliefs may provide more\nrepresentative and less biased labels than judgements. The method was examined\nin two controlled, survey-based experiments involving Democrats and Republicans\n(n=1,590) asked to judge statements as arguments and then report beliefs about\nothers' judgements. The results indicate that bias, defined as systematic\ndifferences between the two groups of annotators, is consistently reduced when\nasking for beliefs instead of judgements. Our proposed method therefore has the\npotential to reduce the risk of annotator bias, thereby improving the\ngeneralisability of AI systems and preventing harm to unrepresented\nsocio-demographic groups, and we highlight the need for further studies of this\npotential in other tasks and downstream applications.",

There are two main types of\ntransport networks: road networks for car driving and public transport route\nnetwork. The solutions that work well in road networks, such as Time-dependent\nContraction Hierarchies and other graph-based approaches, do not usually apply\nin transport networks. In transport networks, non-graph solutions such as CSA\nand RAPTOR show the best results compared to graph-based techniques. In our\nwork, we propose a method that advances graph-based approaches by using\ndifferent optimization techniques from computational geometry to speed up the\nsearch process in transport networks. We apply a new pre-computation step,\nwhich we call timetable nodes (TTN). Our inspiration comes from an iterative\nsearch problem in computational geometry. We implement two versions of the TTN:\none uses a Combined Search Tree (TTN-CST), and the second uses Fractional\nCascading (TTN-FC). Both of these approaches decrease the asymptotic complexity\nof reaching new nodes from $O(k\\times \\log|C|)$ to $O(k + \\log(k) +\n\\log(|C|))$, where $k$ is the number of outgoing edges from a node and $|C|$ is\nthe size of the timetable information (total outgoing edges). Our solution\nsuits any other time-dependent networks and can be integrated into other\npathfinding algorithms.

We learn the codebook using\nexponential moving average and there are no other learnable parameters\nincluding the input and output projections normally used in a vector\nquantization set up.

Further\ninformation can be obtained using the hybrid character of the Observatory,\nwhich allows the simultaneous observation of the longitudinal development of\nthe shower with the fluorescence (and lately also radio) detector and the\nground signal with the surface detector. Several different analyses using\nhybrid data show a discrepancy between the predictions of simulations based on\nthe latest hadronic interaction models and data.

In this paper, we address these\nhallucination issues in the context of Medical Information Extraction (MIE)\ntasks by introducing ALternate Contrastive Decoding (ALCD). We begin by\nredefining MIE tasks as an identify-and-classify process. We then separate the\nidentification and classification functions of LLMs by selectively masking the\noptimization of tokens during fine-tuning. During the inference stage, we\nalternately contrast output distributions derived from sub-task models. This\napproach aims to selectively enhance the identification and classification\ncapabilities while minimizing the influence of other inherent abilities in\nLLMs. Additionally, we propose an alternate adaptive constraint strategy to\nmore effectively adjust the scale and scope of contrastive tokens.

However, current methods lack\nprincipled personality modeling, scalable evaluation of behavioral consistency,\nand empirical validation in interactive teaching settings. We propose the SOEI\nframework, a structured pipeline comprising Scene, Object, Evaluation, and\nInteraction, for constructing and evaluating personality-aligned LVSAs in\nclassroom scenarios. Leveraging Chinese language instruction as a cognitively\nand emotionally rich testbed, we generate five LVSAs based on Big Five traits\nthrough LoRA fine-tuning and expert-informed prompt design. Their behavioral\nrealism and personality coherence are assessed using a hybrid human & GPT-4\nevaluation and a multi-dimensional annotation protocol. Through controlled\nexperiments with real pre-service teachers, we demonstrate that LVSAs can\nelicit adaptive teaching strategies and maintain trait-consistent behavior\nacross multi-turn dialogues. Our results provide: (1) an educationally and\npsychologically grounded generation pipeline for LLM-based student agents; (2)\na hybrid, scalable evaluation framework for behavioral realism; and (3)\nempirical insights into the pedagogical utility of LVSAs in shaping\ninstructional adaptation.

For BPE, this is\nparticularly surprising given its resemblance to context-free grammar and the\nfact that it does not tokenize strings from left to right.\n  An application of this is to guided generation, where the outputs of a\nlanguage model are constrained to match some pattern. Here, patterns are\nencoded at the character level, which creates a mismatch between the\nconstraints and the model's subword vocabulary.

However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent\nneuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from\nfully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities.

Before attempting such a task, it would be useful to gain insight\ninto whether or not agents are in fact acting strategically at all, from a\ngame-theoretic perspective. In this paper, we present an initial step toward\naddressing this problem by proposing a general approach based on machine\nlearning fundamentals for detecting potentially strategic behavior. We\ninstantiate the approach by applying state-of-the-art machine learning tools\nfor model selection and performance evaluation of prediction models in the\ncontext of detecting the strategic behavior of players for game mode selection\nin the multiplayer online video game Heroes of the Storm. Specifically, as a\nbaseline, we first train neural networks to predict players' game mode\nselections using only information about the state of the player themselves.\nThen, we train a new set of neural networks using the same architectures, this\ntime incorporating \"historical co-play\" features that encode players' past\ninteractions with other players. We find that including these new features led\nto statistically significant improvements in game mode prediction accuracy,\nproviding a sufficiently strong signal that players indeed make decisions\nstrategically, which justifies the development of more complex computational\ngame-theoretic tools in the hope of improving modeling and predictive power. We\ndiscuss remaining research work about potential approaches to validate the\neffectiveness of this initial step to detect strategic behavior.",

An\nexample of this is the data deluge expected from the SKA Telescopes of more\nthan 60PB per day, all to be stored on the buffer filesystem. Compressing the\ndata is an obvious solution. We used MGARD, an error-controlled compressor, and\napplied it to simulated and real visibility data, in noise-free and\nnoise-dominated regimes. As the data has an implicit error level in the system\ntemperature, using an error bound in compression provides a natural metric for\ncompression. Measuring the degradation of images reconstructed using the lossy\ncompressed data, we explore the trade-off between these error bounds and the\ncorresponding compression ratios, as well as the impact on science quality\nderived from the lossy compressed data products through a series of\nexperiments.\n  We studied the global and local impacts on the output images. We found\nrelative error bounds of as much as $10\\%$, which provide compression ratios of\nabout 20, have a limited impact on the continuum imaging as the increased noise\nis less than the image RMS. For extremely sensitive observations and for very\nprecious data, we would recommend a $0.1\\%$ error bound with compression ratios\nof about 4. These have noise impacts two orders of magnitude less than the\nimage RMS levels. At these levels, the limits are due to instabilities in the\ndeconvolution methods.

Given the characteristics of the LiDAR sensor, an\nobservation of an object at a certain location confirms both 1) the occupation\nof that location and 2) the absence of obstacles along the line of sight from\nthe LiDAR to that point. TALoS utilizes these observations to obtain\nself-supervision about occupancy and emptiness, guiding the model to adapt to\nthe scene in test time. In a similar manner, we aggregate reliable SSC\npredictions among multiple moments and leverage them as semantic pseudo-GT for\nadaptation. Further, to leverage future observations that are not accessible at\nthe current time, we present a dual optimization scheme using the model in\nwhich the update is delayed until the future observation is available.\nEvaluations on the SemanticKITTI validation and test sets demonstrate that\nTALoS significantly improves the performance of the pre-trained SSC model.

This approach allows for substantial improvements\nin amortized training efficiency -- scaling only linearly with respect to new\ndata -- by enabling reuse of previous training computation, opening new avenues\nfor improving model performance through rigorous, incremental data assessment\nand mixing.",

However, in Massive Multi User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output\n(Massive MU MIMO-ISAC) systems, the dense user access creates a serious\nmulti-user interference (MUI) problem, leading to degradation of communication\nperformance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a decentralized baseband\nprocessing (DBP) precoding method. We first model the MUI of dense user\nscenarios with minimizing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as an objective\nfunction.Hybrid precoding is an attractive ISAC technique, and hybrid precoding\nusing Partially Connected Structures (PCS) can effectively reduce hardware cost\nand power consumption. We mitigate the MUI between dense users based on\nThomlinsonHarashima Precoding (THP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method through simulation experiments. Compared with the existing\nmethods, it can effectively improve the communication data rates and energy\nefficiency in dense user access scenario, and reduce the hardware complexity of\nMassive MU MIMO-ISAC systems.

In ordinal\nregression tasks, this problem is compounded by an additional challenge: the\nexpectation that softmax probabilities should exhibit unimodal distribution is\nnot met with cross-entropy. The ordinal regression literature has focused on\nlearning orders and overlooked calibration. To address both issues, we propose\na novel loss function that introduces ordinal-aware calibration, ensuring that\nprediction confidence adheres to ordinal relationships between classes.

Our approach involves two stages: context distillation,\nwhere a Visual Linguistic Translator (VLT) converts visual information into\nlinguistic form, and interaction distillation, where an Interaction Cognition\nNetwork (ICN) reasons about spatial, visual, and context relations.

This\nconfiguration is optimized to harness and enhance absorption capabilities\neffectively across a broadband terahertz (THz) spectrum. The absorber\ndemonstrates an extensive absorption bandwidth of 3.00 THz, spanning\nfrequencies from 2.414 THz to 5.417 THz. Remarkably, throughout this range, the\ndevice maintains a consistently high absorption efficiency, exceeding 90%. This\nefficiency is characterized by two sharp absorption peaks located at 2.638 THz\nand 5.158 THz, which signify the precise tuning of the metamaterial structure\nto interact optimally with specific THz frequencies. The absorbance of the\nproposed model is almost equal to 99%. This absorber is polarization\ninsensitive. The development of this absorber involved a series of theoretical\nsimulations backed by experimental validations, which helped refine the\nmetamaterial's geometry and material composition.

In this paper, we develop a minimum bit error\nrate (BER) precoder design for an OTFS-based ISAC system. In particular, the\nBER minimization problem takes into account the maximum available transmission\npower budget and the required sensing performance. Different from prior studies\nthat considered ISAC in the time-frequency (TF) domain, we devise the precoder\nfrom the perspective of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain by exploiting the\nequivalent DD domain channel due to the fact that the DD domain channel\ngenerally tends to be sparse and quasi-static, which can facilitate a\nlow-overhead ISAC system design. To address the non-convex optimization design\nproblem, we resort to optimizing the lower bound of the derived average BER by\nadopting Jensen's inequality. Subsequently, the formulated problem is decoupled\ninto two independent sub-problems via singular value decomposition (SVD)\nmethodology. We then theoretically analyze the feasibility conditions of the\nproposed problem and present a low-complexity iterative solution via leveraging\nthe Lagrangian duality approach. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of\nour proposed precoder compared to the benchmark schemes and reveal the\ninterplay between sensing and communication for dual-functional precoder\ndesign, indicating a trade-off where transmission efficiency is sacrificed for\nincreasing transmission reliability and sensing accuracy.",

Our\napproach addresses the limitations of MEF-based tone mapping with existing\nsegmentation-based exposure compensation, which often result in visually\nunappealing outcomes due to inappropriate exposure value selection. The\nproposed exposure compensation method first segments the input HDR image into\nsubregions based on luminance values of pixels.

This approach contrasts with\nconventional methods that may invert luminance relationships or compromise\ncontrast between regions.

However, increasing the mass of the spectator quark\nflavour indirectly acts to increase the magnetic polarisability. To gain a\ndeeper understanding of these effects, we evaluate the predictions of the\nconstituent quark model in this context. While the model provides a compelling\nexplanation for the environmental effect of varying the spectator quark mass,\nan explanation of the direct mass dependence is more complicated as competing\nfactors combine in the final result. The lattice results indicate the key\nfactor is a reduction in the constituent quark magnetic moment with increasing\nquark mass, as it governs the strength of the magnetic transition to the nearby\ndecuplet baryon.",

Ironically, this is because the main\nbarrier is the reliance on them, which requires increasing training and\nrendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design a\nExplicit 4D Gaussian Splatting(Ex4DGS). Our key idea is to firstly separate\nstatic and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample\npositions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The\nsampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both\nspatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as\nwell as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive\ntraining scheme and a point-backtracking technique that improves Ex4DGS's\nconvergence. We initially train Ex4DGS using short timestamps and progressively\nextend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The\npoint-backtracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian\nover time, enabling the detection and removal of erroneous Gaussians in dynamic\nscenes. Comprehensive experiments on various scenes demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art rendering quality from our method, achieving fast rendering of\n62 fps on a single 2080Ti GPU.",

However, such an assumption is easily violated in real-world\nscenarios due to the complexity and diversity of queries, thus leading to the\nquery shift problem. Specifically, query shift refers to the online query\nstream originating from the domain that follows a different distribution with\nthe source one. In this paper, we observe that query shift would not only\ndiminish the uniformity (namely, within-modality scatter) of the query modality\nbut also amplify the gap between query and gallery modalities. Based on the\nobservations, we propose a novel method dubbed Test-time adaptation for\nCross-modal Retrieval (TCR). In brief, TCR employs a novel module to refine the\nquery predictions (namely, retrieval results of the query) and a joint\nobjective to prevent query shift from disturbing the common space, thus\nachieving online adaptation for the cross-modal retrieval models with query\nshift. Expensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TCR\nagainst query shift. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the challenging task of 3D visual grounding-locating a\nspecific object in a 3D point cloud scene based on text descriptions. Existing\nmethods fall into two categories: top-down and bottom-up methods. Top-down\nmethods rely on a pre-trained 3D detector to generate and select the best\nbounding box, resulting in time-consuming processes. Bottom-up methods directly\nregress object bounding boxes with coarse-grained features, producing worse\nresults. To combine their strengths while addressing their limitations, we\npropose a joint top-down and bottom-up framework, aiming to enhance the\nperformance while improving the efficiency. Specifically, in the first stage,\nwe propose a bottom-up based proposal generation module, which utilizes\nlightweight neural layers to efficiently regress and cluster several coarse\nobject proposals instead of using a complex 3D detector. Then, in the second\nstage, we introduce a top-down based proposal consolidation module, which\nutilizes graph design to effectively aggregate and propagate the query-related\nobject contexts among the generated proposals for further refinement. By\njointly training these two modules, we can avoid the inherent drawbacks of the\ncomplex proposals in the top-down framework and the coarse proposals in the\nbottom-up framework.

Although there are several offline and\nonline approaches to aligning LLMs, they often suffer from distribution shift\nissues. These issues arise from the inability to accurately capture the\ndistributional interdependence between the reward learning and policy learning\nstages. Consequently, this has led to various approximated approaches, but the\ntheoretical insights and motivations remain largely limited to tabular\nsettings, which do not hold in practice. This gap between theoretical insights\nand practical implementations is critical. It is challenging to address this\ngap as it requires analyzing the performance of AI alignment algorithms in\nneural network-parameterized settings. Although bi-level formulations have\nshown promise in addressing distribution shift issues, they suffer from the\nhyper-gradient problem, and current approaches lack efficient algorithms to\nsolve this. In this work, we tackle these challenges employing the bi-level\nformulation laid out in Kwon et al.

Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning\nmethods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based\nmethods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised\nlearning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack\nthe capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse\nreinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design\nissue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure\nassumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban\nautomated driving.

Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward\nfunction is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban\nscenarios.

Our research explores the\napplication of P-YOLOv8 for image classification, evaluating its performance\ncompared to deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet. Some\ntraditional models often struggle with low accuracy, while others achieve high\naccuracy but come with high computational costs and slow detection speeds,\nmaking them unsuitable for real-time applications. P-YOLOv8 addresses these\nissues by achieving competitive accuracy with significant computational cost\nand efficiency advantages. In particular, P-YOLOv8 generates a lightweight\nmodel with a size of only 2.84 MB and a lower number of parameters, totaling\n1,451,098, due to its innovative architecture. It achieves a high accuracy of\n99.46 percent with this small model size, opening new directions for deployment\non inexpensive and small embedded devices using Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML).\nThe experimental results show robust performance, making P-YOLOv8 a\ncost-effective solution for real-time deployment. This study provides a\ndetailed analysis of P-YOLOv8's architecture, training, and performance\nbenchmarks, highlighting its potential for real-time use in detecting\ndistracted driving.",

The proposed approach utilizes an\nencoder-decoder attention model, namely the transformer and pointer\narchitectures, to develop job sequences with negative reduced cost and thus\ngenerate columns to add to the master problem. By training the neural network\noffline and using it in inference mode to predict negative reduced costs\ncolumns, we achieve significant computational time savings compared to dynamic\nprogramming (DP). Since the exact DP procedure is used to verify that no\nfurther columns with negative reduced cost can be identified at termination,\nthe optimality guarantee of the original CG procedure is preserved. For small\nto medium-sized instances, our approach achieves an average 45% reduction in\ncomputation time compared to solving the subproblems with DP. Furthermore, the\nmodel generalizes not only to unseen, larger problem instances from the same\nprobability distribution but also to instances from different probability\ndistributions than those presented at training time.

Our objective is to devise\na patrolling schedule with an infinite time horizon that minimizes the\nattacker's payoff. We demonstrated that PSG can be transformed into a\ncombinatorial minimax problem with a closed-form objective function. By\nconstraining the defender's strategy to a time-homogeneous first-order Markov\nchain (i.e., the patroller's next move depends solely on their current\nlocation), we proved that the optimal solution in cases of zero penalty\ninvolves either minimizing the expected hitting time or return time, depending\non the attacker model, and that these solutions can be computed efficiently.\nAdditionally, we observed that increasing the randomness in the patrol schedule\nreduces the attacker's expected payoff in high-penalty cases. However, the\nminimax problem becomes non-convex in other scenarios. To address this, we\nformulated a bi-criteria optimization problem incorporating two objectives:\nexpected maximum reward and entropy. We proposed three graph-based algorithms\nand one deep reinforcement learning model, designed to efficiently balance the\ntrade-off between these two objectives. Notably, the third algorithm can\nidentify the optimal deterministic patrol schedule, though its runtime grows\nexponentially with the number of patrol spots.

Selecting the optimal model for a\ngiven dataset can pose a challenge, necessitating the exploration of ensemble\nmethods to enhance generalization and applicability in network intrusion\ndetection.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from monocular camera data is highly\nchallenging due to viewpoint limitations and image ambiguity. While implicit\nfunction-based approaches, combined with prior knowledge from parametric\nmodels, have made significant progress, there are still two notable problems.\nFirstly, the back details of human models are ambiguous due to viewpoint\ninvisibility. The quality of the back details depends on the back normal map\npredicted by a convolutional neural network (CNN). However, the CNN lacks\nglobal information awareness for comprehending the back texture, resulting in\nexcessively smooth back details. Secondly, a single image suffers from local\nambiguity due to lighting conditions and body movement. However, implicit\nfunctions are highly sensitive to pixel variations in ambiguous regions. To\naddress these ambiguities, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Transformer (STT)\nnetwork for 3D clothed human reconstruction. A spatial transformer is employed\nto extract global information for normal map prediction. The establishment of\nglobal correlations facilitates the network in comprehending the holistic\ntexture and shape of the human body. Simultaneously, to compensate for local\nambiguity in images, a temporal transformer is utilized to extract temporal\nfeatures from adjacent frames. The incorporation of temporal features can\nenhance the accuracy of input features in implicit networks. Furthermore, to\nobtain more accurate temporal features, joint tokens are employed to establish\nlocal correspondences between frames. Experimental results on the Adobe and\nMonoPerfCap datasets have shown that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods and maintains robust generalization even under low-light outdoor\nconditions.",

We prove that the pure\nknotoids in the knotoid spectra of a knot, which are individually agnostic of\nthe knot type, can distinguish knots of Gordian distance greater than one. We\nalso prove that the neighborhood of some embeddings of the unknot can be\ndistinguished from any embedding of any non-trivial knot that satisfies the\ncosmetic crossing conjecture. Topological invariants of knots can be extended\nto their open curve neighborhood to define continuous functions in the\nneighborhood of knots. We discuss their properties and prove that invariants in\nthe neighborhood of knots may be able to distinguish more knots than their\napplication to the knots themselves. For example, we prove that an invariant of\nknots that fails to distinguish mutant knots (and mutant knotoids), can\ndistinguish them by their neighborhoods, unless it also fails to distinguish\nnon-mutant pure knotoids in their spectra. Studying the neighborhood of knots\nopens the possibility of answering questions, such as if an invariant can\ndetect the unknot, via examining possibly easier questions, such as whether it\ncan distinguish height one knotoids from the trivial knotoid.",

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is vital for\nintelligent traffic prediction. Yet, ITS often relies on data from traffic\nsensors or vehicle devices, where certain cities might not have all those smart\ndevices or enabling infrastructures. Also, recent studies have employed\nmeta-learning to generalize spatial-temporal traffic networks, utilizing data\nfrom multiple cities for effective traffic forecasting for data-scarce target\ncities. However, collecting data from multiple cities can be costly and\ntime-consuming. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Single Source\nMeta-Transfer Learning (SSMT) which relies only on a single source city for\ntraffic prediction. Our method harnesses this transferred knowledge to enable\nfew-shot traffic forecasting, particularly when the target city possesses\nlimited data. Specifically, we use memory-augmented attention to store the\nheterogeneous spatial knowledge from the source city and selectively recall\nthem for the data-scarce target city. We extend the idea of sinusoidal\npositional encoding to establish meta-learning tasks by leveraging diverse\ntemporal traffic patterns from the source city. Moreover, to capture a more\ngeneralized representation of the positions we introduced a meta-positional\nencoding that learns the most optimal representation of the temporal pattern\nacross all the tasks. We experiment on five real-world benchmark datasets to\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms several existing methods in time series\ntraffic prediction.",

Long-term optical light curve analysis reveals that many\nobjects in our sample exhibit a prolonged plateau during the dim states lasting\n4 to 7 years, with gradual turn-on/off process. We observe no significant\ndifference between the turn-on and turn-off timescales, and this timescale is\nbroadly consistent with the heating/cooling front propagation timescale. The\ncomparison between optical and infrared variations supports that these\ntransitions are driven by changes in accretion disk emission rather than dust\nobscuration.

This paper proposes an\nefficient query method for searching a given multiword place name on historical\nmaps. Using existing methods to recognize words on historical maps, we link\nsingle-word text labels into potential multiword phrases by constructing\nminimum spanning trees. These trees aim to link pairs of text labels that are\nspatially close and have similar height, angle, and capitalization. We then\nquery these trees for the given multiword place name. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod in two experiments: 1) to evaluate the accuracy of the minimum spanning\ntree approach at linking multiword place names and 2) to evaluate the number\nand time range of maps retrieved by the query approach.

    "abstract": "Although existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods have made\nsignificant progress, simultaneously estimating human pose and shape from\nlow-resolution image features limits their performance. These image features\nlack sufficient spatial information about the human body and contain various\nnoises (e.g., background, lighting, and clothing), which often results in\ninaccurate pose and inconsistent motion. Inspired by the rapid advance in human\npose estimation, we discover that compared to image features, skeletons\ninherently contain accurate human pose and motion. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel semiAnalytical Regressor using disenTangled Skeletal representations for\nhuman mesh recovery from videos, called ARTS. Specifically, a skeleton\nestimation and disentanglement module is proposed to estimate the 3D skeletons\nfrom a video and decouple them into disentangled skeletal representations\n(i.e., joint position, bone length, and human motion). Then, to fully utilize\nthese representations, we introduce a semi-analytical regressor to estimate the\nparameters of the human mesh model. The regressor consists of three modules:\nTemporal Inverse Kinematics (TIK), Bone-guided Shape Fitting (BSF), and\nMotion-Centric Refinement (MCR). TIK utilizes joint position to estimate\ninitial pose parameters and BSF leverages bone length to regress bone-aligned\nshape parameters. Finally, MCR combines human motion representation with image\nfeatures to refine the initial human model parameters. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our ARTS surpasses existing state-of-the-art video-based\nmethods in both per-frame accuracy and temporal consistency on popular\nbenchmarks: 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M.

By integrating external databases with generative AI models,\nRAG technology bridges this gap, empowering chatbots to not only provide\nprecise answers but also resonate deeply with the cultural nuances that are\ncrucial for authentic interactions. This study delves into the intricate\nprocess of augmenting the chatbot's knowledge base with targeted cultural data,\nspecifically curated to reflect the unique aspects of Hakka traditions,\nlanguage, and practices. Through dynamic information retrieval, the\nRAG-enhanced chatbot becomes a versatile tool capable of handling complex\ninquiries that demand an in-depth understanding of Hakka cultural context. This\nis particularly significant in an age where digital platforms often dilute\ncultural identities, making the role of culturally aware AI systems more\ncritical than ever. System usability studies conducted as part of our research\nreveal a marked improvement in both user satisfaction and engagement,\nhighlighting the chatbot's effectiveness in fostering a deeper connection with\nHakka culture.

This paper introduces a new approach called\nfine-tuning stacks of language models (FSLM), which involves stacking small\nlanguage models (SLM) as an alternative to LLMs. By fine-tuning each SLM to\nperform a specific task, this approach breaks down high level reasoning into\nmultiple lower-level steps that specific SLMs are responsible for. As a result,\nFSLM allows for lower training and inference costs, and also improves model\ninterpretability as each SLM communicates with the subsequent one through\nnatural language.

While pruning is a promising technique to reduce model size and\naccelerate the inference, the traditional pruning techniques can hardly be\napplied for LLMs as they need to finetune the model on the full dataset with\nmultiple epochs consuming massive data and hardware resources.

We do so in a new query model encompassing a wide range of\nlattice sieving algorithms similar to those in the classical sieving lower\nbound by Kirshanova and Laarhoven [CRYPTO 21]. This implies that, under\nreasonable assumptions, quantum speedups in lattice sieving require the use of\nQRAM. In particular, no quantum speedup is possible without QRAM.\n  Second, we investigate the trade-off between the size of QRAM and the quantum\nspeedup. We obtain a new interpolation between classical and quantum lattice\nsieving. Moreover, we show that further improvements require a novel way to use\nthe QRAM by proving the optimality of some subroutines. An important caveat is\nthat this trade-off requires a strong assumption on the efficient replacement\nof QRAM data, indicating that even speedups with a small QRAM are already\nchallenging.\n  Finally, we provide a circuit for quantum lattice sieving without using QRAM.\nOur circuit has a better depth complexity than the best classical algorithms\nbut requires an exponential amount of qubits. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first quantum speedup for lattice sieving without QRAM in the\nstandard quantum circuit model.

    "abstract": "Multi-Objective Markov Decision Processes (MO-MDPs) are receiving increasing\nattention, as real-world decision-making problems often involve conflicting\nobjectives that cannot be addressed by a single-objective MDP. The Pareto front\nidentifies the set of policies that cannot be dominated, providing a foundation\nfor finding Pareto optimal solutions that can efficiently adapt to various\npreferences. However, finding the Pareto front is a highly challenging problem.\nMost existing methods either (i) rely on traversing the continuous preference\nspace, which is impractical and results in approximations that are difficult to\nevaluate against the true Pareto front, or (ii) focus solely on deterministic\nPareto optimal policies, from which there are no known techniques to\ncharacterize the full Pareto front. Moreover, finding the structure of the\nPareto front itself remains unclear even in the context of dynamic programming,\nwhere the MDP is fully known in advance. In this work, we address the challenge\nof efficiently discovering the Pareto front. By investigating the geometric\nstructure of the Pareto front in MO-MDPs, we uncover a key property: the Pareto\nfront is on the boundary of a convex polytope whose vertices all correspond to\ndeterministic policies, and neighboring vertices of the Pareto front differ by\nonly one state-action pair of the deterministic policy, almost surely. This\ninsight transforms the global comparison across all policies into a localized\nsearch among deterministic policies that differ by only one state-action pair,\ndrastically reducing the complexity of searching for the exact Pareto front. We\ndevelop an efficient algorithm that identifies the vertices of the Pareto front\nby solving a single-objective MDP only once and then traversing the edges of\nthe Pareto front, making it more efficient than existing methods.",

However,\nwell-trained neural networks can make prediction errors after deployment as the\nworld changes. \\textit{Model editing} involves updating the base model to\ncorrect prediction errors with less accessible training data and computational\nresources. Despite recent advances in model editors in computer vision and\nnatural language processing, editable training in graph neural networks (GNNs)\nis rarely explored. The challenge with editable GNN training lies in the\ninherent information aggregation across neighbors, which can lead model editors\nto affect the predictions of other nodes unintentionally. In this paper, we\nfirst observe the gradient of cross-entropy loss for the target node and\ntraining nodes with significant inconsistency, which indicates that directly\nfine-tuning the base model using the loss on the target node deteriorates the\nperformance on training nodes.

The standard training procedure for CBMs is to predefine\na candidate set of human-interpretable concepts, extract their values from the\ntraining data, and identify a sparse subset as inputs to a transparent\nprediction model. However, such approaches are often hampered by the tradeoff\nbetween enumerating a sufficiently large set of concepts to include those that\nare truly relevant versus controlling the cost of obtaining concept\nextractions.

Current benchmarks primarily focus on single-turn,\nmonolingual instructions, which do not adequately reflect the complexities of\nreal-world applications that require handling multi-turn and multilingual\ninteractions. To address this gap, we introduce Multi-IF, a new benchmark\ndesigned to assess LLMs' proficiency in following multi-turn and multilingual\ninstructions. Multi-IF, which utilizes a hybrid framework combining LLM and\nhuman annotators, expands upon the IFEval by incorporating multi-turn sequences\nand translating the English prompts into another 7 languages, resulting in a\ndataset of 4,501 multilingual conversations, where each has three turns. Our\nevaluation of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IF reveals that it presents a\nsignificantly more challenging task than existing benchmarks. All the models\ntested showed a higher rate of failure in executing instructions correctly with\neach additional turn. For example, o1-preview drops from 0.877 at the first\nturn to 0.707 at the third turn in terms of average accuracy over all\nlanguages. Moreover, languages with non-Latin scripts (Hindi, Russian, and\nChinese) generally exhibit higher error rates, suggesting potential limitations\nin the models' multilingual capabilities.

Moreover, resources such as link capacity and buffer memory may be\nlimited. Routing in satellite networks is therefore both complex and crucial to\navoid packet losses and long delays. The Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) paradigm\nhas emerged as an efficient solution for managing these challenging networks.\nContact Graph Routing (CGR), a deterministic routing algorithm, is one of the\nmost popular DTN algorithms. CGR is compatible with the ``store, carry, and\nforward\" principle, whereby a node receives a message and stores it in its\nbuffer until a transmission opportunity becomes available. However, CGR relies\non simplified models to incorporate potential constraints in the route search.\nFor instance, the linear volume assumption is often used to consider capacity\nconstraints. Moreover, capacity management and buffer management are mostly\nperformed during the forwarding phase, once an issue has occurred. In this\npaper, we propose taking measures before or during the route search in order to\nfind routes that respect both contact-capacity and node-buffer limits. We\nintroduce the contact splitting and edge pruning operations to effectively\naccount for the routing constraints. This ensures that CGR outputs the optimal\nsolution among the subset of valid solutions.

    "abstract": "We prove new monogamy of entanglement bounds for two-local qudit Hamiltonians\nof rank-one projectors without one-local terms. In particular, we certify the\nground state energy in terms of the maximum matching of the underlying\ninteraction graph via low-degree sum-of-squares proofs. Algorithmically, we\nshow that a simple matching-based algorithm approximates the ground state\nenergy to at least $1/d$ for general graphs and to at least $1/d + \\Theta(1/D)$\nfor graphs with bounded degree, $D$. This outperforms random assignment, which,\nin expectation, achieves energy of only $1/d^2$ of the ground state energy for\ngeneral graphs. Notably, on $D$-regular graphs with degree, $D \\leq 5$, and for\nany local dimension, $d$, we show that this simple matching-based algorithm has\nan approximation guarantee of $1/2$. Lastly, when $d=2$, we present an\nalgorithm achieving an approximation guarantee of $0.595$, beating that of\n[PT22, arXiv:2206.08342] (which gave a tight approximation guarantee of $1/2$).",

    "abstract": "In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a\nsurrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian\nprocess as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization\nproblem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent\nreceives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is\nencoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the\nobjective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian average\nregret and Bayesian simple regret, where the bound depends on the structure of\nthe communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is\napplicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is\nconstrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our\nbound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the\ncommunication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with\nnumerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, demonstrating\nthe significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.",

    "abstract": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is designed to detect a variety\nof gravitational-wave events, including mergers of massive black hole binaries,\nstellar-mass black hole inspirals, and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. LISA's\ncapability to observe signals with high signal-to-noise ratios raises concerns\nabout waveform accuracy. Additionally, its ability to observe long-duration\nsignals will raise the computational cost of Bayesian inference, making it\nchallenging to use costly and novel models with standard stochastic sampling\nmethods without incorporating likelihood and waveform acceleration techniques.\nIn this work, we present our attempt to tackle these issues. We adapt ${\\tt\nRIFT}$ for LISA to take advantage of its embarrassingly parallel architecture,\nenabling efficient analysis of large datasets with costly gravitational wave\nmodels without relying on likelihood or waveform acceleration. We demonstrate\nthat our open-source code can accurately infer parameters of massive black hole\nbinary signals by carrying out a zero-noise injection recovery using the\nnumerical relativity surrogate model ${\\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$. By utilizing all\navailable $m\\neq0$ modes in the inference, we study the impact of higher modes\non LISA data analysis. We study the impact of multiple massive black hole\nbinary signals in a dataset on the inference of a single signal, showing that\nthe selected source's inference remains largely unaffected. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the LDC-1A and blind LDC-2A datasets from the Radler and Sangria\nchallenge of the LISA data challenges. When eschewing specialized hardware, we\nfind ${\\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$ injection-recovery takes approximately $20$ hours to\ncomplete, while the analysis of Sangria and Radler datasets takes about $10$\nhours to complete.",
