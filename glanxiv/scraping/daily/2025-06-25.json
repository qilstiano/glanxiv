Unlike traditional schemes that\nrely on optical cavities or atomic references, we stabilize the laser frequency\nvia a closed-loop feedback system referenced to a wavelength meter. This\nconfiguration effectively suppresses long-term frequency drifts, achieving\nfrequency stability to the wavelength meter's shot-noise-limited resolution.\nThe system enables sub-hundred-kilohertz stability without complex optical\ncomponents, making it suitable for compact or field-deployable applications.\nOur results demonstrate that, with proper feedback design, wavelength\nmeter-based locking can offer a practical and scalable solution for precision\noptical experiments requiring long-term frequency stability.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a\nlightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier\nwithout full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is\nessential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased\npredictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail\nto replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from\nthe unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership\ninference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any\nof these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass\nfor the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to\nMIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)\ndistance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to\nprevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive\nexperiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that\nour approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for\nevaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to\nstate-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%\nin our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.",

Poroelasticity models are widely used in\nmany areas of science and engineering to describe coupled flow and mechanics\nprocesses in porous media. However, in many applications, the properties of\nporoelastic media possess high contrast, presenting serious computational\nchallenges. It is well known that standard homogenization approaches often fail\nto give an accurate solution due to the lack of macroscopic parameters.\nMulticontinuum approaches allow us to consider such cases by defining several\naverage states known as continua. In the field of poroelasticity,\nmultiple-network models arising from the multiple porous media theory are\nrepresentatives of these approaches. In this work, we extend previous findings\nby deriving the generalized multicontinuum poroelasticity model. We apply the\nrecently developed multicontinuum homogenization method and provide a rigorous\nderivation of multicontinuum equations. For this purpose, we formulate coupled\nconstraint cell problems in oversampled regions to consider different\nhomogenized effects. Then, we obtain a multicontinuum expansion of the\nfine-scale fields and derive the multicontinuum model supposing the smoothness\nof macroscopic variables. We present the most general version of equations and\nthe simplified ones based on our numerical experiments.

    "abstract": "Using the Bayesian Analysis of Stellar Evolution-9 (BASE-9) code and Gaia\nDR3, Pan-STARRS, and 2MASS data, we identify photometric binaries in 35 open\nclusters (OCs) and constrain their masses. We find a strong correlation between\nthe binary fraction and cluster dynamical age and an even stronger correlation\nbetween core binary fraction and cluster dynamical age. We find the binary\nmass-ratio (q) distribution of dynamically young OCs is statistically distinct\nfrom that of the old OCs. On average, dynamically young OCs display multi-modal\nq distributions rising toward unity and toward our detection limit of q=0.5\nwhile more dynamically evolved clusters display more uniform q distributions\noften with a peak near q=1. Interestingly, the uniform q distribution with a\npeak near q=1 is consistent with binaries in the field. We also observe a\nsimilar transition from multi-modal to unimodal q distributions when comparing\nlow mass to high mass OCs in our sample. Lastly, we find a correlation between\nthe median q of the binary population in a cluster and the cluster dynamical\nage. We interpret these results as an indication that dynamical encounters tend\nto increase the fraction of high-mass-ratio binaries within a given cluster --\nparticularly within the cluster's core where stellar dynamics are likely more\nimportant. This may be the result of stellar exchanges that tend to produce\nbinaries with larger q and/or the preferential disruption or evaporation of\nlower q binaries.",

The Gause-Witt mathematical\nsystem of coupled nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations\nemployed to model population of species sharing the same ecological niche and\ncompeting for the same resources was applied to the income data of Brazil.\nPrevious studies using Brazilian income data from 1981 to 2009 showed that the\ncomplementary cumulative distribution functions built from yearly datasets have\ntwo distinct segments: the lower income region comprising of about 99% of the\npopulation can be represented by the Gompertz curve, whereas the richest 1% is\ndescribed by the Pareto power-law. The results of applying the Gause-Witt\nsystem to Brazilian income data in order to describe the distributive\ncompetition dynamics of these two population shares indicate that the 99% and\n1% income classes are mostly in the dynamic state of stable coexistence.",

A major\nfactor contributing to this is the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address\nthis, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously\nevaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark\ncomprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a\nrange of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a\ntotal of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity\nacross age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide\nhuman-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We\npropose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify\nface count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a\nthorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches\nand training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose\nnovel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human\nsegmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our\nproposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a\nstandardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation.

Until now, the\nmetasurface-enhanced HHG was believed to follow the conventional integer-power\nscaling laws that hold for non-resonant bulk HHG. Here, we discover that highly\nresonant metasurfaces driven by quasi-bound states in the continuum break this\nprinciple, manifesting non-integer intensity dependencies of the generated\nharmonic powers. We show experimentally and theoretically that these\nunconventional nonlinearities arise from the high-Q resonances that generate\nlocal fields strong enough to substantially alter the contribution of higher\norder susceptibility tensors to the effective nonlinearities of the system. Our\nfindings reveal how harmonic generation rooted in resonant field-driven\nmodification of effective nonlinear susceptibilities can reshape our\nunderstanding of light-matter interaction at the nanoscale.",

To address this barrier, we\npropose a privacy-preserving framework that enables secure data sharing and\ncollaboration for research and development while mitigating privacy risks. The\nframework combines dimensionality reduction techniques (like Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA)) and differential privacy by introducing Laplacian\nnoise to protect sensitive information.

It also allows farmers to identify potential\ncollaborators based on similarities. We have validated this on real-life\ndatasets, demonstrating robust privacy protection against adversarial attacks\nand utility performance comparable to a centralized system. We demonstrate how\nthis framework can facilitate collaboration among farmers and help researchers\npursue broader research objectives.

To evaluate MIDAS, we\nconducted experiments on both the DFEW dataset and FERV39k-Plus, a newly\nconstructed dataset that assigns soft labels to an existing DFER dataset.

    "abstract": "The simulation of non-Abelian anyon braiding is a critical step towards\nfault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce a framework for this task\nbased on a one-dimensional Quasicrystal Inflation Code (QIC). The code is\ndefined by a local Hamiltonian whose ground state manifold enforces Fibonacci\ntiling constraints and possesses the correct Fibonacci degeneracy. We derive\nthe corresponding braid operators and demonstrate that, while they are formally\nnon-local, they possess an exact, local 3-qubit structure. This allows us to\ndistill their action into a single, physically realizable $8 \\times 8$ gate,\nwhich we term the $B_{gate}$. We prove through comparative compilation for\nsystems with different numbers of qubits that constructing circuits by\ncomposing these local gates is dramatically more scalable than compiling the\nequivalent global unitary, showing a greater than tenfold reduction in circuit\ndepth. To validate the framework, we successfully executed a braiding algorithm\nfor the Jones polynomial, a topological invariant of knots, on an IBM Quantum\nprocessor, quantifying the signal degradation due to hardware noise. Finally,\nwe numerically confirm for systems up to 17 qubits that our construction\nrigorously satisfies the required Temperley-Lieb and braid group relations\nwhile preserving the code subspace. This work establishes a validated and\nphysically grounded pathway for the scalable simulation of anyonic braiding on\nprogrammable quantum systems.",

Failing to consider the Rayleigh criterion may result in incorrect\ninterpretations of long-period signals or spurious claims that two closely\nspaced periodogram peaks represent two distinct physical processes. We\ndemonstrate how applying the Rayleigh criterion can help observers avoid false\npositive detections caused by uneven observing cadence or insufficient\nobserving time baseline. We present three synthetic datasets that illustrate\n(1) a single oscillation with a split Lomb-Scargle periodogram peak resulting\nfrom uneven observing cadence can be mistaken for two oscillations if the\nRayleigh criterion is neglected, (2) oversampling a periodogram's frequency\ngrid does not improve resolution, and (3) observing time baseline requirements\nfor resolving two closely spaced oscillations. We use the Rayleigh criterion to\nrevisit detections of planets, stellar activity, and differential rotation from\nfour published datasets. We show that the frequency separation between planet\n55~Cnc~d and the activity cycle is too small to distinguish the two phenomena\nbased on published radial velocities (RVs) alone. Likewise, the contested\n4970-day planet orbiting HD~99492 cannot be statistically separated from zero\nfrequency. We determine that a cubic polynomial better explains the long-term\nRV variability of Barnard's star than a sinusoid model. Finally, our\nre-analysis of {\\it Kepler} observations of two active stars shows that the\nsignals previously attributed to differential rotation can be modeled by a\nGaussian process with a single quasiperiodicity.

    "abstract": "We study a gas of $N$ Brownian particles in the presence of a common\nstochastic diffusivity $D(t)=B^2(t)$, where $B(t)$ represents a one-dimensional\nBrownian motion at time $t$. Starting with all the particles from the origin,\nthe gas expands ballistically. We show that because of the common stochastic\ndiffusivity, the expanding gas gets dynamically correlated, and the joint\nprobability density function of the position of the particles has a\nconditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure that was\nrecently found in several other systems. The special CIID structure allows us\nto compute the average density profile of the gas, extreme and order\nstatistics, gap distribution between successive particles, and the full\ncounting statistics (FCS) that describes the probability density function (PDF)\n$H(\\kappa, t)$ of the fraction of particles $\\kappa$ in a given region\n$[-L,L]$. Interestingly, the position fluctuation of the central particles and\nthe average density profiles are described by the same scaling function. The\nPDF describing the FCS has an essential singularity near $\\kappa=0$, indicating\nthe presence of particles inside the box $[-L,L]$ at all times. Near the upper\nlimit $\\kappa =1$, the scaling function $H(\\kappa,t)$ has a rather unusual\nbehavior: $H(\\kappa,t)\\sim (1-\\kappa)^{\\beta(t)}$ where the exponent $\\beta(t)$\nchanges continuously with time. While at early times $\\beta(t)<0$ indicating a\ndivergence of $H(\\kappa,t)$ as $\\kappa\\to 1$, $\\beta(t)$ becomes positive for\n$t>t_c$ where $t_c$ is computed exactly. For $t>t_c$, the scaling function\n$H(\\kappa,t)$ vanishes as $\\kappa\\to 1$, indicating that it is highly unlikely\nto have all the particles in the interval $[-L,L]$.

    "abstract": "The worldline of a free electron is revealed by applying Dirac's velocity\noperator to its Dirac wave function whose space-time arguments are expressed in\na proper time by a Lorentz transformation. This motion can be decomposed into\ntwo parts: the electron's global motion of its inertia (or spin) center and an\ninherent local periodic motion about this point that produces the electron's\nspin and has the zitterbewegung frequency found by Schr\\\"{o}dinger in his\noperator analysis of Dirac's wave equation. This zitter motion corresponds to\nthe so-called polarization and magnetization currents in Gordon's decomposition\nof Dirac's current. In an inertial \"rest\"-frame fixed at the inertia center,\nDirac's wave function for a free electron with its spin in a specified\ndirection implies that the zitter motion is a perpetual circular motion about\nthe inertia center in a plane orthogonal to this spin direction with a radius\none half of the Compton radius and moving at the speed of light. The electron\ncontinuously accelerates about the spin center without any external force\nbecause the inertia is effective at the spin center, rather than at its charge\ncenter where the electron interacts with the electro-magnetic field. This\nanalysis confirms the nature of zitterbewegung directly from Dirac's wave\nequation, agreeing with the conclusions of Barut and Zanghi, Beck, Hestenes,\nRivas and Salesi from their classical Dirac particle models of the electron.\nFurthermore, these five classical models are equivalent and express the same\nfree electron dynamics as Dirac's equation.",

Existing CLTR methods assume a single ranking policy\nthat selects top-K ranking from the entire document candidate set. In\nreal-world applications, the candidate document set is on the order of\nmillions, making a single-stage ranking policy impractical. In order to scale\nto millions of documents, real-world ranking systems are designed in a\ntwo-stage fashion, with a candidate generator followed by a ranker.

A CLTR method for training both the ranker and candidate\ngenerator jointly is missing from the existing literature. In this paper, we\npropose a two-stage CLTR estimator that considers the interaction between the\ntwo stages and estimates the joint value of the two policies offline.

    "abstract": "Semiclassical instanton theory captures nuclear quantum effects such as\ntunnelling in chemical reactions. It was originally derived from two different\nstarting points, the flux correlation function and the ImF premise. In pursuit\nof a nonadiabatic rate theory, a number of methods have been proposed; almost\nall based on the less rigorous ImF premise. Only recently, we introduced a\nrigorous nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory in the\nflux-correlation function framework which successfully bridges from the\nBorn-Oppenheimer to the golden-rule limit. Here, we examine the previous\nImF-based attempts and conclude that they do not capture the two limits\ncorrectly. In particular, we will highlight how the last in a series of\ndevelopments, called mean-field ring-polymer instanton theory, breaks down in\nthe golden-rule limit. We develop a new nonadiabatic ImF rate theory to remedy\nthe failings of previous attempts while taking inspiration from them. We also\nconsider the crossover from deep tunnelling to a high-temperature rate theory.\nWe test our new nonadiabatic ImF theory on a range of models including\nasymmetric and multidimensional systems and we show reliable results for the\ndeep-tunnelling regime but limitations for the related high-temperature rate\ntheory.",

    "abstract": "As data and knowledge expand rapidly, adopting systematic methodologies for\nontology generation has become crucial. With the daily increases in data\nvolumes and frequent content changes, the demand for databases to store and\nretrieve information for the creation of knowledge graphs has become\nincreasingly urgent. The previously established Knowledge Acquisition and\nRepresentation Methodology (KNARM) outlines a systematic approach to address\nthese challenges and create knowledge graphs. However, following this\nmethodology highlights the existing challenge of seamlessly integrating Neo4j\ndatabases with the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Previous attempts to integrate\ndata from Neo4j into an ontology have been discussed, but these approaches\noften require an understanding of description logics (DL) syntax, which may not\nbe familiar to many users. Thus, a more accessible method is necessary to\nbridge this gap. This paper presents a user-friendly approach that utilizes\nPython and its rdflib library to support ontology development. We showcase our\nnovel approach through a Neo4j database we created by integrating data from the\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)\ndatabase. Using this dataset, we developed a Python script that automatically\ngenerates the required classes and their axioms, facilitating a smoother\nintegration process. This approach offers a practical solution to the\nchallenges of ontology generation in the context of rapidly growing adverse\ndrug event datasets, supporting improved drug safety monitoring and public\nhealth decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) has become a cornerstone of self-supervised\npretraining (SSP) in foundation models, however, extending CL to pixel-wise\nrepresentation, crucial for medical vision, remains an open problem. Standard\nCL formulates SSP as a binary optimization problem (binary CL) where the\nexcessive pursuit of feature dispersion leads to an over-dispersion problem,\nbreaking pixel-wise feature correlation thus disrupting the intra-class\ndistribution. Our vector CL reformulates CL as a vector regression problem,\nenabling dispersion quantification in pixel-wise pretraining via modeling\nfeature distances in regressing displacement vectors. To implement this novel\nparadigm, we propose the COntrast in VEctor Regression (COVER) framework. COVER\nestablishes an extendable vector-based self-learning, enforces a consistent\noptimization flow from vector regression to distance modeling, and leverages a\nvector pyramid architecture for granularity adaptation, thus preserving\npixel-wise feature correlations in SSP.

The BBH is often neglected, not because this is\ngenerally justified, but because its inclusion in calculations is usually\ndifficult. To assess the significance of BBH for particle dynamics, we revisit\nunsteady Stokes flows around spherical particles or droplets and derive from\nfirst-principles the analytical expressions for the velocity around the\nparticles and the forces acting on them. This includes the case of time-varying\nradii for gas bubbles and also graphical representations of how the BBH force\narises from transient, diffusion-driven vortex structures around particles.\nApplying these results to sedimentation of heavy or rising light particles or\ndroplets in horizontally shaken fluids (i.e., periodically accelerated), we\nfind that within certain parameter ranges, BBH can reduce the particle\ndeflection amplitude by more than 60\\% relative to the fluid motion. Our\n(analytical) results show that the BBH effects become large in the transition\nregion between the low-frequency viscous Stokes regime and the regime dominated\nby high-frequency inertia. On this basis, we also derive a power law for the\namplitude of the periodic particle displacement, which can be unambiguously\nattributed to the BBH and directly identified in experiments. For light\nparticles such as gas bubbles, the dominant contribution to inertial forces\ncomes from the added mass, and the BBH acting on gas bubbles is more important\nfor their dynamics than in the case of heavy particles such as droplets in air\nor metal beads in water.",

    "abstract": "We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the\ncollapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the\nbirth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties\n(including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the\nera of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained\nelusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the\nGPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse,\ncore-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar\nprogenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a\none-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45\nM_\\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from\nstellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The\ncollapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km\nbefore stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron\nstar accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \\approx 325$ ms\nafter core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably\nsimilar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic\nneutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the\nhorizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity\nof $v_{kick} \\approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \\approx 2.62 M_\\odot$,\nwhich is still rising at the end of the simulation.",

Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates\nlow-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding.\nImportantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer\ndata points and less computational power than artificial models require. We\nintroduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural\nactivity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model\nfor training artificial neural networks.

We validate B2M in\nmemory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene\nreconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The\nresults show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer\nconverge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in\nisolation.

    "abstract": "Diffractive optical information processors have demonstrated significant\npromise in delivering high-speed, parallel, and energy efficient inference for\nscaling machine learning tasks. Training, however, remains a major\ncomputational bottleneck, compounded by large datasets and many simulations\nrequired for state-of-the-art classification models. The underlying linear\ntransformations in such systems are inherently constrained to compositions of\ncirculant and diagonal matrix factors, representing free-space propagation and\nphase and/or amplitude modulation of light, respectively. While theoretically\nestablished that an arbitrary linear transformation can be generated by such\nfactors, only upper bounds on the number of factors exist, which are\nexperimentally unfeasible. Additionally, physical parameters such as\ninter-layer distance, number of layers, and phase-only modulation further\nrestrict the solution space. Without tractable analytical decompositions, prior\nworks have implemented various constrained minimization techniques. As\ntrainable elements occupy a small subset of the overall transformation,\nexisting techniques incur unnecessary computational overhead, limiting\nscalability. In this work, we demonstrate significant reduction in training\ntime by exploiting the structured and sparse nature of diffractive systems in\ntraining and inference. We introduce a novel backpropagation algorithm that\nincorporates plane wave decomposition via the Fourier transform, computing\ngradients across all trainable elements in a given layer simultaneously, using\nonly change-of-basis and element wise multiplication. Given the lack of a\nclosed-form mathematical decomposition for realizable optical architectures,\nthis approach is not only valuable for machine learning tasks but broadly\napplicable for the generation of arbitrary linear transformations, wavefront\nshaping, and other signal processing tasks.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed inverse problem with many feasible\nsolutions consistent with a given low-resolution image. On one hand, regressive\nSR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single\nsolution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity\nin information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail\nto reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,\nand generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR\nspace. By aligning outputs with human expectations and semantic correctness,\nthis work sets a new benchmark for trustworthiness in generative SR.",

    "abstract": "In the present work, we present a hybrid quantum-classical workflow aimed at\nimproving the accuracy of alchemical free energy (AFE) predictions by\nincorporating configuration interaction (CI) simulations using the book-ending\ncorrection method. This approach applies the Multistate Bennett Acceptance\nRatio (MBAR) over a coupling parameter {\\lambda} to smoothly transition the\nsystem from molecular mechanics (MM) ({\\lambda} = 0) to a quantum mechanics\n(QM) ({\\lambda} = 1) description. The resulting correction is then applied to\nthe classically (MM) computed AFE to account for the more accurate QM\ntreatment. The standard book-ending procedure uses AMBER to simulate the MM\nregion, and QUICK, AMBER's default QM engine, to handle the QM region with\neither the Hartree-Fock (HF) method or density functional theory (DFT). In this\nwork, we introduce a novel interface to QUICK, via sander, that enables CI\nsimulations, and can operate in two ways: A) via PySCF backend to perform full\nconfiguration interaction (FCI) using conventional computing resources, B)\nquantum-centric sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) workflow via Qiskit\nwhich leverages both quantum hardware and post-processing on conventional\ncomputing resources for CI simulations. In this workflow QUICK performs most\nsteps of the calculations, but at user-defined intervals, it redirects the\ncomputation to either FCI or SQD backend to get the CI result. We computed the\nbook-end corrections for the hydration free energy (HFE) of three small organic\nmolecules (ammonia, methane, and water) to benchmark the proposed approach and\ndemonstrate how quantum-computers can be used in AFE calculations. We believe\nthat this approach can be scaled to more complex systems like drug-receptor\ninteractions in future studies.",

An accurate analytical model is\nfirst developed to characterize intermodal crosstalk caused by beam\nmisalignment in OAM-based inter-satellite links. Building upon this model, we\nderive efficient expressions to analyze and optimize system performance in\nterms of bit error rate (BER). Unlike traditional Monte Carlo-based methods\nthat are computationally intensive, the proposed approach offers accurate\nperformance predictions. This enables a substantial decrease in computation\ntime while maintaining high accuracy, thanks to the use of analytical\nexpressions for both crosstalk and BER. This fast and accurate evaluation\ncapability is particularly critical for dynamic low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite\nconstellations, where network topology and channel conditions change rapidly,\nrequiring real-time link adaptation. Furthermore, we systematically design and\nevaluate asymmetric OAM mode sets, which significantly outperform symmetric\nconfigurations in the presence of pointing errors. Our results also reveal key\ninsights into the interaction between beam divergence, tracking accuracy, and\nlink distance, demonstrating that the proposed framework enables real-time\noptimization of system parameters with high fidelity.

We discover that the main sources of the issue come from not only the\ninformation loss caused by graph partitioning but also the ways of drawing\nnegative samples during model training. While sharing the complete graph\ninformation with each worker resolves the issue and preserves link prediction\naccuracy, it incurs a high communication cost.

    "abstract": "As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, the demand for sustainable\nindoor power sources is increasing. Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs), which are\ncurrently in development, present a renewable solution but need to be designed\nto match specific light sources. While previous studies have emphasized the\nrole of white-light LED color temperature (CT) in determining IPV efficiency\nand optimum bandgap energy, the role of color rendering index (CRI) remains\nless understood. In this study, we employ detailed-balance calculations to\nassess the theoretical maximum efficiency and optimal bandgap energies of IPVs\nunder commercial white-light LED irradiance varying in both CT (2200 K to 6500\nK) and CRI (70, 80, and 90). Our results confirm that lower CTs indeed yield\nhigher efficiencies and lower optimal bandgaps. However, contrary to prior\nassumptions that CRI has negligible impact on IPV material choice and\nperformance, we demonstrate that high-CRI LEDs necessitate the use of materials\nwith significantly lower bandgap energies for optimum efficiency. We also\nevaluate the performance of various IPVs at fixed bandgaps, revealing that\nwhile optimal IPV performance is achieved with wide-bandgap materials under\nlower CRI lighting, mature technologies like silicon and CdTe benefit from\nhigh-CRI illumination. These findings underscore the need to consider both CT\nand CRI in the design and evaluation of IPVs for indoor IoT applications.",

    "abstract": "The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has\nbenefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These\ntechniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and\nlarger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around\nthe student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses,\nlimiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks\nand can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a\nreward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations\n(responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on\nrule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as\nweights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent\nbehavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model\nperformance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the\nefficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset\ndistillation processes.",

This is\naccentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the\nstrong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address\nthis problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that\naccomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the\nfirst phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize\ncatching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated\nsmoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a\nreal-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the\nend-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the\nobject to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the\nrobot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on\nhuman demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with\nunknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used\nto enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a\nstack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a\nsecondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one\ndimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics\nproposed. We show how the same task, without velocity matching, would be\ninfeasible due to excessive joint torques resulting from the impact. The\naddition of reflected mass minimization is then investigated, and the catching\nheight is increased to evaluate the method's robustness.

However, implementing these\nprotocols over long-distance inter-satellite free-space optical (FSO) channels\nposes critical physical-layer challenges that are not addressed in the existing\nliterature. In particular, photon losses due to beam divergence, pointing\nerrors, and background noise can severely degrade the key generation rate and\nquantum bit error rate (QBER), especially under narrow receiver field-of-view\n(FoV) constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of\nentanglement-based inter-satellite QKD, focusing on photon-level modeling and\nthe impact of practical impairments. We develop analytical expressions for\nsignal detection probabilities, background photon influence, multi-pair\nemissions, and QBER, incorporating key parameters such as link distance,\ntransmitter tracking jitter, receiver misalignment, and photon pair generation\nrate. Simulation results reveal the nonlinear sensitivity of system performance\nto tracking error and FoV limitations, and highlight optimal parameter regimes\nthat jointly maximize secret key rate while maintaining QBER below acceptable\nthresholds. The proposed model provides actionable design insights for reliable\nand efficient deployment of entanglement-based SatQKD systems.",

A characterisation,\nin terms of the so-called trinary spectrum of a measure, of ultrahomogeneous\nmeasures such that the action of their automorphism groups is (topologically)\ntransitive or minimal is given.

In high-dimensional systems, Bell\ninequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome\nmeasurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections\nopens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit.\nHere we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state\ncontains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this\nobstacle and certify and violate a Bell inequality for high-dimensional states.\nThis result is contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a\nphase-insensitive quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify\nentanglement or Bell-nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP\nBell inequality up to dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for\nthe first time close the binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell\nexperiments.

This is fundamental for many astrophysical\nissues on all scales, ranging from stellar evolution to the chemical\ncomposition, formation and evolution of stellar clusters and galaxies. Among\nthese processes, convective-envelope overshooting is in dire need of a\nsystematic calibration and comparison with predictions from multi-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations. The Red Giant Branch bump (RGBb) is an ideal\ncalibrator of overshooting processes, since its luminosity depends on the\nmaximum depth reached by the convective envelope after the first dredge-up.\nIndeed, a more efficient overshooting produces a discontinuity in the Hydrogen\nmass fraction profile deeper in the stellar interior and consequently a less\nluminous RGBb. In this work, we calibrated the overshooting efficiency by\ncomparing the RGBb location predicted by stellar models with observations of\nstellar clusters with HST and Gaia photometry, as well as solar-like\noscillating giants in the Kepler field. We explored the metallicity range\nbetween -2.02 dex and +0.35 dex and found overshooting efficiencies ranging\nfrom $0.009^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$ to $0.062^{+0.017}_{-0.015}$. In particular, we\nfound that the overshooting efficiency decreases linearly with [M/H], with a\nslope of $(-0.010\\pm0.006)$ dex$^{-1}$. We suggest a possible explanation for\nthis trend, linking it to the efficiency of turbulent entrainment at different\nmetallicities.",

In practice, it faces unanticipated but spatially aligned\nrequests, passengers seeking to join ongoing schedules, leading to\nunderutilized capacity and degraded service if not properly managed. At the\nsame time, it must accommodate diverse passenger needs, from routine errands to\ntime-sensitive trips such as medical appointments. To meet these expectations,\nincorporating time flexibility is essential. However, existing models seldom\nconsider both spontaneous and heterogeneous demand, limiting their real-world\napplicability. We propose a robust and flexible microtransit framework that\nintegrates time flexibility and demand uncertainty via a Chance-Constrained\nDial-A-Ride Problem with Soft Time Windows (CCDARP-STW). Demand uncertainty is\ncaptured through nonlinear chance constraints with controllable violation\nprobabilities, while time flexibility is modeled with soft time windows and\npenalized cost. We develop a bounded-support relaxation using limited\nstatistical information to linearize the chance constraints and solve the model\nusing a tailored Branch-and-Cut-and-Price (BCP) algorithm with a probabilistic\ndominance rule. This rule improves computational efficiency, reducing explored\nlabels by 17.40% and CPU time by 22.27% in robust cases.

In this work, we present a\nlow-complexity near-field beam training scheme that fully utilizes the\nconventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook designed for far-field\nusers. We begin by analyzing the received beam pattern in the near field and\nderive closed-form expressions for the beam width and central gain. These\nanalytical results enable the definition of an angle-dependent, modified\nRayleigh distance, which effectively distinguishes near-field and far-field\nuser regimes. Building on the analysis, we develop a direct and computationally\nefficient method to estimate user distance, with a complexity of O(1), and\nfurther improve its accuracy through a simple refinement. Simulation results\ndemonstrate significant gains in both single- and multi-user settings, with up\nto 2.38 dB SNR improvement over exhaustive search. To further enhance\nestimation accuracy, we additionally propose a maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE) based refinement method, leveraging the Rician distribution of signal\namplitudes and achieving accuracy close to the Cramer--Rao bound (CRB).\nSimulation shows the single-user and multi-user achievable rates can both\napproach those obtained with ideal channel state information.",

    "abstract": "We present the first theoretical framework for applying spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs) to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric phase\nunwrapping. Despite extensive research in both domains, our comprehensive\nliterature review confirms that SNNs have never been applied to phase\nunwrapping, representing a significant gap in current methodologies. As Earth\nobservation data volumes continue to grow exponentially (with missions like\nNISAR expected to generate 100PB in two years) energy-efficient processing\nbecomes critical for sustainable data center operations. SNNs, with their\nevent-driven computation model, offer potential energy savings of 30-100x\ncompared to conventional approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy. We\ndevelop spike encoding schemes specifically designed for wrapped phase data,\npropose SNN architectures that leverage the spatial propagation nature of phase\nunwrapping, and provide theoretical analysis of computational complexity and\nconvergence properties. Our framework demonstrates how the temporal dynamics\ninherent in SNNs can naturally model the spatial continuity constraints\nfundamental to phase unwrapping.

Reliable\nquantification from DaT-SPECT images requires performing attenuation\ncompensation (AC), typically with a separate X-ray CT scan. Such CT-based AC\n(CTAC) has multiple challenges, a key one being the non-availability of X-ray\nCT component on many clinical SPECT systems. Even when a CT is available, the\nadditional CT scan leads to increased radiation dose, costs, and complexity,\npotential quantification errors due to SPECT-CT misalignment, and higher\ntraining and regulatory requirements. To overcome the challenges with the\nrequirement of a CT scan for AC in DaT SPECT, we propose a deep learning\n(DL)-based transmission-less AC method for DaT-SPECT (DaT-CTLESS). An in silico\nimaging trial, titled ISIT-DaT, was designed to evaluate the performance of\nDaT-CTLESS on the regional uptake quantification task. We observed that\nDaT-CTLESS yielded a significantly higher correlation with CTAC than that\nbetween UAC and CTAC on the regional DaT uptake quantification task. Further,\nDaT-CLTESS had an excellent agreement with CTAC on this task, significantly\noutperformed UAC in distinguishing patients with normal versus reduced putamen\nSBR, yielded good generalizability across two scanners, was generally\ninsensitive to intra-regional uptake heterogeneity, demonstrated good\nrepeatability, exhibited robust performance even as the size of the training\ndata was reduced, and generally outperformed the other considered DL methods on\nthe task of quantifying regional uptake across different training dataset\nsizes. These results provide a strong motivation for further clinical\nevaluation of DaT-CTLESS.",

Existing work either\nrequires interpolation or focuses only on univariate inputs. This paper\npresents new and somewhat surprising theoretical results for multivariate\ninputs. On two natural settings (1) generalization gap for flat solutions, and\n(2) mean-squared error (MSE) in nonparametric function estimation by stable\nminima, we prove upper and lower bounds, which establish that while flatness\ndoes imply generalization, the resulting rates of convergence necessarily\ndeteriorate exponentially as the input dimension grows. This gives an\nexponential separation between the flat solutions vis-\\`a-vis low-norm\nsolutions (i.e., weight decay), which knowingly do not suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality. In particular, our minimax lower bound construction, based on a\nnovel packing argument with boundary-localized ReLU neurons, reveals how flat\nsolutions can exploit a kind of ''neural shattering'' where neurons rarely\nactivate, but with high weight magnitudes. This leads to poor performance in\nhigh dimensions. We corroborate these theoretical findings with extensive\nnumerical simulations.

Informed by practical constraints, we\nadopt an under-determined formulation of Maxwell's equations that avoids the\nneed for initial magnetic field data and charge density information. To address\nthis inverse problem, we develop a time-dimension reduction approach by\nprojecting the electric field onto a finite-dimensional Legendre\npolynomial-exponential basis in time.

In this review, we draw on what is\nknown about similar metabolic shifts both in normal mammalian physiology and\noverflow metabolism in microbes to shed new light on whether aerobic glycolysis\nin cancer represents some form of optimisation of cellular metabolism. From\nmicrobes to cancer, we find that metabolic shifts favouring glycolysis are\nsometimes driven by the need for faster growth, but the growth rate is by no\nmeans a universal goal of optimal metabolism. Instead, optimisation goals at\nthe cellular level are often multi-faceted and any given metabolic state must\nbe considered in the context of both its energetic costs and benefits over a\nrange of environmental contexts. For this purpose, we identify the conceptual\nframework of resource allocation as a potential testbed for the investigation\nof the cost-benefit balance of cellular metabolic strategies.

Traditional mean-field VI methods fail to\ncapture the complex dependencies and can be inconsistent in high-dimensional\nsettings. In contrast, it has been conjectured, based on statistical physics\nheuristics and conditions for the stationary points, that the more refined\nThouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) approximation is consistent in the\nhigh-dimensional regimes. Existing results, however, have only proved such TAP\nrepresentations in high-temperature regimes, even in the basic setting of\nspherical priors (Qiu and Sen, Ann. Appl. Probab. 2023). In this work, we prove\nthe asymptotic correctness of TAP free energy approximation for Bayesian linear\nregression under uniform spherical priors at any temperature ($\\Delta>0$).

Both simulations include a subgrid model of turbulent mixing,\nwhich is essential in tracking the formation of Pop III stars. We find that RT\nhas a minor impact on our results and that the overall star formation rate\ndensities for both simulations are in fair agreement with observations and\nother simulations.

This is because a top-heavy Pop III IMF results\nin 99 percent of Pop III stellar mass being recycled within 10 Myr, well before\nthe approx. 30 Myr timescale on which galaxies recover from supernova feedback\nand heating.

Outer\nregions of the LMC have large advantages compared to the previous attempts of\nthe TRGB calibrations using the red giants from the central parts of this\ngalaxy.

The number of red giants in the upper part of the red giant branch in\nour LMC region is large, ~140 000, making it possible to determine of the tip\nmagnitude with high accuracy.\n  Our ultimate I-band calibration of the TRGB is: M_{I,TRGB}=-4.022 +- 0.006\n(stat.) +- 0.033 (syst.) mag.

Specifically, we reduce the data\nstructure problem to the Unambiguous Arthur-Merlin (UAM) communication\ncomplexity of $f(x,y)$ under product distributions.\n  We apply our framework to the Partial Match problem (a.k.a, matching with\nwildcards), whose underlying communication problem is sparse set-disjointness.\nWhen the database consists of $n$ points in dimension $d$, and the number of\n$\\star$'s in the query is at most $w = c\\log n \\;(\\ll d)$, the fastest known\nlinear-space data structure (Cole, Gottlieb and Lewenstein, STOC'04) had query\ntime $t \\approx 2^w = n^c$, which is nontrivial only when $c<1$. By contrast,\nour framework produces a data structure with query time $n^{1-1/(c \\log^2 c)}$\nand space close to linear.\n  To achieve this, we develop a one-sided $\\epsilon$-error communication\nprotocol for Set-Disjointness under product distributions with\n$\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{d\\log(1/\\epsilon)})$ complexity, improving on the\nclassical result of Babai, Frankl and Simon (FOCS'86).

However, despite the improvements to\nexisting quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known\nabout \\textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it\nchallenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In\nthis work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum\ndifferential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation\n(LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a\nunitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make\nseveral algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization\nbounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme\nfor the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for\noblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the\nbest of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art\nby at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if\nstate preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous\nresource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the\nmost general case whereby the dynamics are not \\textit{fast-forwardable}, these\nfindings provide a 110x reduction in runtime costs.

The temporal\nconsistency requirements for dynamic and static regions in videos are\nfundamentally different. Consistent video depth in static regions, typically\nbackgrounds, can be more effectively achieved via stereo matching across all\nframes, which provides much stronger global 3D cues.

This unified\nframework allows for the description of a wide variety of analogue spacetimes,\nincluding new analogue geometries that have not been previously explored in the\nliterature. Then, we examine the behavior of scalar field perturbations in this\nbackground by solving the massless Klein--Gordon equation. Depending on the\nboundary conditions between the acoustic event horizon and infinity, we obtain\nthe quasinormal and quasibound spectra. This study opens up avenues for\nexperimental investigation within the context of analog gravity models, by\noffering new possibilities to simulate and study black hole phenomena in\nlaboratory settings.",

The analysis highlights the main types of\nrequirements addressed, the most frequently considered quality attributes, and\nrecurring challenges in the formalization, acquisition, and long-term\nmaintenance of domain knowledge. The results provide support for researchers\nand practitioners in identifying established approaches and unresolved issues.\nThe study also outlines promising directions for future research, emphasizing\nthe development of scalable, automated, and sustainable solutions to integrate\ndomain knowledge into RE processes.

To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly\nsupport lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)\nformats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a\nshared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and\nperform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency\ngains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of\nblock-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one\nthousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from\n$2 \\times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \\times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad\nrange of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe\nthat training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the\nloss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we\nconduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that\nexhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural\nsettings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a\nsimple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the\nquantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of\nactivations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \\emph{in situ} intervention\nexperiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be\naverted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these\nfindings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that\ncertain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with\nfull-precision training.

Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse\ndirection-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better\nchatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,\nlittle research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.\nTo address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)\nframework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like\nidentity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human\nempathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and\nintentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial\nbehaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which\nchatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the\nreasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and\nintentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and\nemotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and\nintention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects. Qualitative\nanalysis further identified two motivations for participants' prosocial\nbehaviors: empathy for the chatbot and perceiving the chatbot as human-like.

Existing localization approaches (e.g.\nactivation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to\nreplace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information. To fill\nthis gap, we propose dynamic weight-grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained\nlanguage models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) extract\nrelation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and\n(2) ``recall\" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In\nsome cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned\ninformation while, in other cases, a single ``enrichment\" or ``recall\" pathway\nalone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these\ninformation pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy\nthey exhibit, and which model components are involved -- finding that the\n``recall\" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and a\nrelation extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward\nnetworks at the final layers before next token prediction.",

Specifically, OTSurv\nformulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two\nconstraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological\ndistributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by\nregulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware\nconstraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by\nprogressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT\nproblem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that\ncan be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm.\nEmpirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular\nbenchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In\naddition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers\nhigh interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in\ndigital pathology.

We develop a Python-based library to\nsolve the equations of motion of the BH and provide an analytical framework for\nthe numerical results. Then, we carry out simulations at different resolutions\nand for different softening choices using the Tree-PM code OpenGADGET3, where\nwe implement an improved DF correction based on a kernel-weighted local density\nestimation. Our results demonstrate that the DF correction significantly\naccelerates BH sinking and ensures convergence with increasing resolution,\nclosely matching analytical predictions. We find that in low-resolution regimes\n- particularly when the BH mass is smaller than that of the background\nparticles - our DF model still effectively controls BH dynamics. Contrary to\nexpectations, the inclusion of a stellar bulge can delay sinking due to\nnumerical heating, an effect partially mitigated by the DF correction. We\nconclude that our refined DF implementation provides a robust framework for\nmodeling BH dynamics both in controlled simulation setups of galaxies and in\nlarge-scale cosmological simulations. This will be crucial for future\nsimulation campaigns, to enable more accurate predictions of AGN accretion and\nfeedback, and to estimate gravitational-wave event rates.",

Meanwhile, the classification of magnetic\norders, even for the most fundamental concepts like ferromagnetism (FM) and\nantiferromagnetism (AFM), has encountered unprecedented challenges since the\ndiscovery of unconventional magnets and advancements in antiferromagnetic\nspintronics. Here, we present a rigorous classification of magnetic order using\nstate-of-the-art spin space group (SSG) theory. Based on whether the net\nmagnetic moment is constrained to zero by SSG, magnetic order is unambiguously\ndichotomized into FM (including ferrimagnetism) and AFM. Additionally, we\nclassify AFM geometries into four categories -- primary, bi-color, spiral, and\nmulti-axial -- based on periodic spin propagation beyond the symmetry\noperations of magnetic space groups. We then introduce a distinct magnetic\nphase, dubbed spin-orbit magnetism, characterized by its unique behavior\ninvolving the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) order parameter and SOC-driven phase\ntransition. We further create an oriented SSG description, i.e., SSG with a\nfixed magnetic configuration, apply the framework to 2,065 experimentally\nvalidated magnetic materials in MAGNDATA database, and identify over 220\nspin-orbit magnets with distinct spin and orbital magnetization mechanisms.\nImplemented by the online program FINDSPINGROUP, our work establishes a\nuniversal symmetry standard for magnetic order classification, offering new\nunderstandings of unconventional magnets and broad applicability in spintronics\nand quantum material design.",

Magic\nangle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has emerged as a model system, where\nflat bands give rise to a variety of such phases, yet the precise nature of\nthese bands has remained elusive due to the lack of high-resolution momentum\nspace probes. Here, we use the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) to directly\nimage the interacting energy bands of MATBG with unprecedented momentum and\nenergy resolution. Away from the magic angle, the observed bands closely follow\nthe single-particle theory. At the magic angle, however, we observe bands that\nare completely transformed by interactions, exhibiting light and heavy\nelectronic character at different parts of momentum space. Upon doping, the\ninterplay between these light and heavy components gives rise to a variety of\nstriking phenomena, including interaction-induced bandwidth renormalization,\nMott-like cascades of the heavy particles, and Dirac revivals of the light\nparticles. We also uncover a persistent low-energy excitation tied to the heavy\nsector, suggesting a new unaccounted degree of freedom. These results resolve\nthe long-standing puzzle in MATBG - the dual nature of its electrons - by\nshowing that it originates from electrons at different momenta within the same\ntopological heavy fermion-like flat bands.

Using relativistic mean-field equations of state (EoSs)\nfor both components, we solved the two-fluid Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV)\nequations to determine neutron star (NS) properties assuming that DM is\nconfined within the stellar core. For hadronic matter, we employed realistic\nEoSs derived from low energy nuclear physics experiments, heavy-ion collision\ndata, and NS observations. To constrain key dark matter parameters such as\nparticle mass, mass fraction, and the coupling to mass ratio, we applied\nBayesian inference, incorporating various astrophysical data including mass,\nradii, and NICER mass-radius distributions for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR\nJ0030+0451. Additionally, we explored the influence of high-density HM EoSs and\nexamined the impact of stiffer hadronic EoSs, excluding the vector meson\nself-interaction term. Our findings indicate that current astrophysical\nobservations primarily constrain the dark matter fraction, while providing\nlimited constraints on the particle mass or coupling. However, the dark matter\nfraction is largely insensitive to how astrophysical observations or\nuncertainties in the high-density EoS are incorporated. Instead, it is\npredominantly determined by the stiffness of the hadronic EoS at high\ndensities, with stiffer hadronic EoSs yielding a higher dark matter mass\nfraction. Therefore, we conclude that the dark matter fraction plays a crucial\nrole in shaping the properties of DMANS. Future investigations incorporating\nmore realistic EoSs and astrophysical observations of other compact objects may\nprovide deeper insights into dark matter.",

In this work, we solve this problem via\ncoadjoint-orbit bosonization of the Fermi surface. Compared with the fermionic\nformalism, the issue of the oscillatory self energy is circumvented. As an\neffective field theory, Landau parameters $F_{n}$ directly enter the theory.

Via a mode\nexpansion, we show that the problem of dHvA is reduced to 0+1D quantum\nmechanics. We obtain analytic expressions for the behavior of dHvA at low and\nhigh temperatures, which deviate from the well-known Lifshitz-Kosevich formula.\nWe contrast this behavior with that of 3d Fermi liquids, for which we show such\ndeviations are parametrically small.

    "abstract": "Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a stellar-mass compact\nobject spiraling into a massive black hole, are key sources for future\nspace-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Accurate modeling of\nthese systems requires incorporating the spin effects of both the primary and\nsecondary bodies, particularly for waveforms at the precision required for LISA\ndetection and astrophysical parameter extraction. In this work, we develop a\nframework for modeling flux-driven spherical inspirals (orbits of approximately\nconstant Boyer-Lindquist radius) of a spinning secondary into a Kerr black\nhole. We leverage recently found solutions for the motion of spinning test\nparticles and compute the associated gravitational wave fluxes to linear order\nin the secondary spin. Next, we show that spherical orbits remain spherical\nunder radiation reaction at linear order in spin, and derive the evolution of\nthe orbital parameters throughout the inspiral. We implement a numerical scheme\nfor waveform generation in the frequency domain and assess the impact of the\nsecondary spin on the gravitational wave signal. In contrast to quasi-circular\ninspirals, we find that neglecting the secondary spin in spherical inspirals\ninduces large mismatches in the waveforms that will plausibly be detectable by\nLISA.",

Here, the entangling gate, characterizing the resource state, is\na diagonal or block-diagonal Clifford operation instead of the usual\ncontrolled-phase gate for cluster states. This simple change has remarkable\nconsequences: the applied entangling operation determines an intrinsic\nsingle-qudit gate associated with the resource that drives the quantum\ncomputation when performing single-qudit measurements on the resource state. We\nprove a condition for the intrinsic gate allowing for the measurement-based\nimplementation of arbitrary single-qudit unitaries. Furthermore, for\nprime-power-dimensional qudits, we demonstrate that the complexity of the\nrealization depends linearly on the dimension and the Pauli order of the\nintrinsic gate so that different entangling gates are associated with different\ncomputational overheads. In particular, we provide two examples of qutrit\nresource states, which allow more efficient quantum information transport and\nprocessing than the qutrit cluster state. Finally, we discuss the required\ntwo-dimensional geometry of the resource state for universal measurement-based\nquantum computing.",

A necessary condition for fast\nflavor conversion is the presence of crossings in the angular distribution of\nthe electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN) crossing. Because of the\ncomputational costs, flavor-dependent angular distributions are not computed by\nthe vast majority of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations; instead,\nangular distributions are reconstructed employing approximate methods in\npost-processing. In this work, we evaluate the performance of four methods\nadopted to diagnose the existence of ELN crossings. For selected post-bounce\ntimes, we extract the fluid and thermodynamic properties from spherically\nsymmetric supernova simulations for an $18.6 M_\\odot$ progenitor, testing cases\nwith and without muons as well as with and without mixing-length treatment of\nproto-neutron star convection. We compare the occurrence of crossings in the\nangular distributions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations with those in\ndistributions reconstructed from angular moments of our Boltzmann solutions by\nusing the maximum entropy and Minerbo schemes, and also with crossings\nidentified via a polynomial weighting function applied to the angular moments.\nOur results show that the polynomial method and the Minerbo closure scheme have\nsevere limitations. The maximum entropy approach captures most of the forward\ncrossings, although it fails to reproduce or misidentifies crossings in a\nsubset of our models.

    "abstract": "The manifold hypothesis asserts that data of interest in high-dimensional\nambient spaces, such as image data, lies on unknown low-dimensional\nsubmanifolds. Diffusion models (DMs) -- which operate by convolving data with\nprogressively larger amounts of Gaussian noise and then learning to revert this\nprocess -- have risen to prominence as the most performant generative models,\nand are known to be able to learn distributions with low-dimensional support.\nFor a given datum in one of these submanifolds, we should thus intuitively\nexpect DMs to have implicitly learned its corresponding local intrinsic\ndimension (LID), i.e. the dimension of the submanifold it belongs to. Kamkari\net al. (2024b) recently showed that this is indeed the case by linking this LID\nto the rate of change of the log marginal densities of the DM with respect to\nthe amount of added noise, resulting in an LID estimator known as FLIPD. LID\nestimators such as FLIPD have a plethora of uses, among others they quantify\nthe complexity of a given datum, and can be used to detect outliers,\nadversarial examples and AI-generated text. FLIPD achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance at LID estimation, yet its theoretical underpinnings are incomplete\nsince Kamkari et al. (2024b) only proved its correctness under the highly\nunrealistic assumption of affine submanifolds. In this work we bridge this gap\nby formally proving the correctness of FLIPD under realistic assumptions.\nAdditionally, we show that an analogous result holds when Gaussian convolutions\nare replaced with uniform ones, and discuss the relevance of this result.",

    "abstract": "We present measurements of the temperature and E-mode polarization angular\npower spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from observations of 4%\nof the sky with SPT-3G, the current camera on the South Pole Telescope (SPT).\nThe maps used in this analysis are the deepest used in a CMB TT/TE/EE analysis\nto date. The maps and resulting power spectra have been validated through blind\nand unblind tests. The measurements of the lensed EE and TE spectra are the\nmost precise to date at l=1800-4000 and l=2200-4000, respectively. Combining\nour TT/TE/EE spectra with previously published SPT-3G CMB lensing results, we\nfind parameters for the standard LCDM model consistent with Planck and ACT-DR6\nwith comparable constraining power. We report a Hubble constant of\n$H_0=66.66\\pm0.60$ km/s/Mpc from SPT-3G alone, 6.2 sigma away from local\nmeasurements from SH0ES. For the first time, combined ground-based (SPT+ACT)\nCMB primary and lensing data have reached Planck's constraining power on some\nparameters, a milestone for CMB cosmology. The combination of these three CMB\nexperiments yields the tightest CMB constraints to date, with\n$H_0=67.24\\pm0.35$ km/s/Mpc, and the amplitude of clustering\n$\\sigma_8=0.8137\\pm0.0038$. CMB data alone show no evidence for physics beyond\nLCDM; however, we observe a 2.8 sigma difference in LCDM between CMB and baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) results from DESI-DR2, which is relaxed in extended\nmodels. The combination of CMB and BAO yields 2-3 sigma shifts from LCDM in the\ncurvature of the universe, the amplitude of CMB lensing, or the dark energy\nequation of state. It also drives mild preferences for models that address the\nHubble tension through modified recombination or variations in the electron\nmass in a non-flat universe. This work highlights the growing power of\nground-based CMB experiments and lays a foundation for further cosmological\nanalyses with SPT-3G.",

Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory\ndoes not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \\geq 4$, but that nevertheless\nthe stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors\n$N_f$. For $N_f < N_{f,c1} \\approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for\n$N_{f,c1} < N_f < N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the\ncomplex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions\nnecessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f >\nN_{f,c2} \\approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as\nwell. In the present work we compute the $O(\\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections\nto the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly,\nwe observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings\nit closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model.\nSome three-loop results are also presented and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a pivotal approach for jointly\nlearning scene geometry and semantics, enabling downstream applications such as\nnavigation in mobile robotics. The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene\nCompletion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level\ninformation, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.\nWhile PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images\nremain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches\nutilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene\nvolume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during\ntraining, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to\ndynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages\ncontext-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address\nvision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively\ninitializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image\ncontext and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding\nto reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships. Experimental results\nshow that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in overall panoptic\nmetrics PQ$^\\dagger$ and PQ-All, matches performance in individual metrics, and\nachieves a runtime reduction exceeding 14$\\times$. Furthermore, our ablation\nstudies reveal that dynamically deriving instance proposals from image context,\nas opposed to random initialization, leads to a 3.62% increase in PQ-All and a\nremarkable average improvement of 18.65% in combined Thing-metrics. These\nresults highlight our introduction of context-adaptive instance proposals as a\npioneering effort in addressing vision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion.",

Existing steering methods\nsuffer from inaccurate value estimation, especially at high noise levels, which\nbiases guidance.

Inspired by the\nsuccess of Monte Carlo Tree Search, we address these limitations by casting\ninference-time alignment as a search problem that reuses past computations. We\nintroduce a tree-based approach that samples from the reward-aligned target\ndensity by propagating terminal rewards back through the diffusion chain and\niteratively refining value estimates with each additional generation. Our\nproposed method, Diffusion Tree Sampling (DTS), produces asymptotically exact\nsamples from the target distribution in the limit of infinite rollouts, and its\ngreedy variant, Diffusion Tree Search (DTS$^\\star$), performs a global search\nfor high reward samples. On MNIST and CIFAR-10 class-conditional generation,\nDTS matches the FID of the best-performing baseline with up to $10\\times$ less\ncompute. In text-to-image generation and language completion tasks, DTS$^\\star$\neffectively searches for high reward samples that match best-of-N with up to\n$5\\times$ less compute.

    "abstract": "We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to\nperform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human\ndemonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand\nmotion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's\nend-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot\nmotion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted\nmotion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with\nplausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained\ngeneralist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows\nthe human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot\nactions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or\npaired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes\nwith minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the\nretargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the\npre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.

We introduce a new CMB lensing estimator based on the maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) reconstruction that is minimally sensitive to these\ninstrumental noise biases. By modifying the likelihood to rely exclusively on\ncorrelations between CMB map splits with independent noise realizations, we\nminimize auto-correlations that contribute to biases.

These value trade-offs are an\nintegral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools\nfor interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are\nlimited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal\naccounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a\nspeaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In\nthis work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the\nextent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to\nsystematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings:\ndegrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL\npost-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of\nhigher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in\nopen-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings\nfrom LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in\ntraining with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining\ndata, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method\nis responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with\ninsights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping\ntraining regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs\nbetween values during model training.",

We propose to unify\nthese tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the\nneed for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However,\nunlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear\nlabels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To\novercome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with\nreinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose\nthe complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the\nworst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly\nreduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context\nlength during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate\nan IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation,\nrouting, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B\nachieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of\nsimilar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain\ndatasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the\nrobustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we\nconducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization\nexperiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on\nin-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement.\nSurprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the\nbase model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the\nthoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance\nzero-shot LLM performance.",

We then\ninvestigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery,\nand extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D\n[[15,1,3]] codes, enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with logarithmic overhead.\nFinally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use, increasing experimental cycle\nrates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with\ndozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations with [[7,1,3]]\nand high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our\nexperiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving\nthe interplay between quantum logic and entropy removal, judiciously using\nphysical entanglement in logic gates and magic state generation, and leveraging\nteleportations for universality and physical qubit reset. These results\nestablish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and\nits practical implementation with neutral atom systems.",

While atom losses typically limit these systems\nto a pulsed mode, continuous operation could significantly enhance cycle rates,\nremove bottlenecks in metrology, and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution\nthrough quantum error correction.

Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor\nbelts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are\nrepeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of\nqubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per\nsecond, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage\nto assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than two hours.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic\nqubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while\npreserving the quantum state of stored qubits.

    "abstract": "The problem of matrix sensing, or trace regression, is a problem wherein one\nwishes to estimate a low-rank matrix from linear measurements perturbed with\nnoise. A number of existing works have studied both convex and nonconvex\napproaches to this problem, establishing minimax error rates when the number of\nmeasurements is sufficiently large relative to the rank and dimension of the\nlow-rank matrix, though a precise comparison of these procedures still remains\nunexplored. In this work we provide a high-dimensional statistical analysis for\nsymmetric low-rank matrix sensing observed under Gaussian measurements and\nnoise. Our main result describes a novel phenomenon: in this statistical model\nand in an appropriate asymptotic regime, the behavior of any local minimum of\nthe nonconvex factorized approach (with known rank) is approximately equivalent\nto that of the matrix hard-thresholding of a corresponding matrix denoising\nproblem, and the behavior of the convex nuclear-norm regularized least squares\napproach is approximately equivalent to that of matrix soft-thresholding of the\nsame matrix denoising problem. Here \"approximately equivalent\" is understood in\nthe sense of concentration of Lipchitz functions. As a consequence, the\nnonconvex procedure uniformly dominates the convex approach in mean squared\nerror. Our arguments are based on a matrix operator generalization of the\nConvex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT) together with studying the interplay\nbetween local minima of the convex and nonconvex formulations and their\n\"debiased\" counterparts, and several of these results may be of independent\ninterest.",

However,\nconcept studies of nulling interferometers often overlook the impact of\nsystematic noise caused by instrument perturbations. Earlier research\nintroduced analytical and numerical models to address instrumental noise and,\nbuilding on these results, we reproduce key simulations and report that the\nnoise in the differential output of nulling interferometers follows a\nnon-Gaussian distribution.

Our investigation reveals a core trade-off: these attacks\ncannot be both highly effective in reconstructing private data and sufficiently\nstealthy to evade detection -- especially in realistic FL settings that\nincorporate common normalization techniques and federated averaging.\n  Building on this insight, we argue that malicious gradient leakage attacks,\nwhile theoretically concerning, are inherently limited in practice and often\ndetectable through basic monitoring. As a complementary contribution, we\npropose a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable client-side detection\nmechanism that flags suspicious model updates before local training begins,\ndespite the fact that such detection may not be strictly necessary in realistic\nFL settings.

The versatility of these stacks allows for the freedom to customize\nthe spaceplate's bandwidth and angular range, impossible with previous optical\nexperimental spaceplates, which were made of bulk materials.

    "abstract": "The interpretation of the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray spectrum (UHECRs) and\ncomposition suggests a suppression of the flux below $\\sim$1 EeV, as observed\nby the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array. A natural explanation for\nthis phenomenon involves magnetic confinement effects. We investigate the\npossibility that UHECRs self-generate the magnetic turbulence necessary for\nsuch confinement via current-driven plasma instabilities. Specifically, we show\nthat the electric current produced by escaping UHECRs can excite a non-resonant\nstreaming instability in the surrounding plasma. This instability reduces the\ndiffusion coefficient in the source environment, effectively trapping particles\nwith energies $E \\lesssim 0.6$ EeV $\\mathcal{L}_{45}^{1/2} R_{\\text{Mpc}}^{-1}\n\\lambda_{10}^{2}$ for times exceeding the age of the Universe. Here,\n$\\mathcal{L}_{45}$ is the source luminosity in units of $10^{45}$ erg/s,\n$R_{\\text{Mpc}}$ is the radial size in Mpc, and $\\lambda_{10}$ is the\nintergalactic magnetic field coherence length in units of 10 Mpc. We discuss in\ndetail the conditions, in terms of source luminosity, initial magnetic field,\nand the environment in which this phenomenon occurs, that need to be fulfilled\nin order for self-confinement to take place near a source of UHECRs. By\nmodeling a population of UHECR sources with a luminosity function typical of\nextragalactic gamma-ray sources, we connect the spectrum of escaping particles\nto the luminosity distribution. Furthermore, we calculate the contribution of\nthese confined particles to cosmogenic neutrino production, finding consistency\nwith current observational constraints. Our results suggest that self-induced\nturbulence may play an important role in shaping the UHECR spectrum and, in\nparticular, may account for the flux suppression near their sources, offering a\npromising framework for interpreting current observations.",

To\naddress these issues, we propose a new federated learning scheme on edge\ndevices that called Federated Learning with Encrypted Data Sharing(FedEDS).\nFedEDS uses the client model and the model's stochastic layer to train the data\nencryptor. The data encryptor generates encrypted data and shares it with other\nclients. The client uses the corresponding client's stochastic layer and\nencrypted data to train and adjust the local model. FedEDS uses the client's\nlocal private data and encrypted shared data from other clients to train the\nmodel. This approach accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning\ntraining and mitigates the negative impact of data heterogeneity, making it\nsuitable for application services deployed on edge devices requiring rapid\nconvergence.

While conventional\napproaches mostly rely on synthetic plant protection products, posing high\nrisks for the environment, harnessing plant signaling processes can lead to\ninnovative approaches for nature-inspired sustainable pest control. In this\npaper, we investigate an approach for sustainable pest control and reveal how\nthe MC paradigm can be employed for analysis and optimization. In particular,\nwe consider a system where herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs),\nspecifically methyl salicylate (MeSA), is encapsulated into microspheres\ndeployed on deployed on plant leaves. The controlled release of MeSA from the\nmicrospheres, acting as transmitters (TXs), supports pest deterrence and\nantagonist attraction, providing an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic plant\nprotection products. Based on experimental data, we investigate the MeSA\nrelease kinetics and obtain an analytical model. To describe the propagation of\nMeSA in farming environments, we employ a three dimensional (3D)\nadvection-diffusion model, incorporating realistic wind fields which are\npredominantly affecting particle propagation, and solve it by a finite\ndifference method (FDM). The proposed model is used to investigate the MeSA\ndistribution for different TX arrangements, representing different practical\nmicrosphere deployment strategies. Moreover, we introduce the coverage\neffectiveness index (CEI) as a novel metric to quantify the environmental\ncoverage of MeSA. This analysis offers valuable guidance for the practical\ndevelopment of microspheres and their deployment aimed at enhancing coverage\nand, consequently, the attraction of antagonistic insects.",

The\ndensity is reconstructed using a parametrized psi_N grid and the five channels\nof the line-averaged density measured by a two-colored interferometer. The\nreconstruction procedure is accelerated by deploying a multi-layer perceptron\nto run in about 120 microseconds and is fast enough for real-time control. A\nproportional-integration controller is adopted, with the controller gains being\nestimated from the system identification processes. The experimental results\nshow that the developed controller can follow a dynamic target while\nexclusively using both actuators. The absolute percentage errors between the\nelectron density at psi_N=0.89 and the target are approximately 1.5% median and\na 2.5% average value. The developed controller can even lower the density by\nusing the pump-out mechanism under RMP, and it can follow a more dynamic target\nthan a single actuator controller.

At the base level, CCUP formalizes inference as\ndirectional entropy minimization, establishing a variational gradient that\nfavors content-first structuring. Building upon this, we identify four\nhierarchical layers of operational principles: (\\textbf{L1}) \\emph{Core\nInference Constraints}, including structure-before-specificity, asymmetric\ninference flow, cycle-consistent bootstrapping, and conditional compression,\nall shown to be mutually reducible; (\\textbf{L2}) \\emph{Resource Allocation\nPrinciples}, such as precision-weighted attention, asymmetric learning rates,\nand attractor-based memory encoding; (\\textbf{L3}) \\emph{Temporal Bootstrapping\nDynamics}, which organize learning over time via structure-guided curricula;\nand (\\textbf{L4}) \\emph{Spatial Hierarchical Composition}, which integrates\nthese mechanisms into self-organizing cycles of memory, inference, and\nplanning.

This paper introduces a\nsystems-based framework for understanding trait-stability, integrating findings\nfrom the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study on Aging (SATSA) with a biologically\ngrounded system of coupled ordinary differential equations. To enable dynamical\nmodeling, Shannon entropy is extracted from longitudinal Likert-scale\npsychometric data, and is treated as a population-level signal of behavioral\ndispersion, reducing high-dimensional Likert data into low-dimensional\ntrajectories. These trajectories serve as dynamical variables in the ODE\nframework, which is governed by principles from evolutionary biology, including\nmutation-selection balance, genetic pleiotropy, and metabolic constraints. The\nmodel is benchmarked against a null (uncoupled) system and additionally\nvalidated through multiple stress tests using RMSE, R^2, and dynamic time\nwarping metrics. By embedding environmental feedback as a recursive driver of\nphenotypic expression, traits such as neuroticism are framed not as stochastic\nbyproducts, but as emergent, multi-stable attractors within a biologically\nconstrained system. The resulting Entropy-Coupled Trait ODEs (ECTO) reveal\nstructured attractor dynamics and demonstrate that entropy functions not merely\nas a descriptive measure, but as a functional driver of behavioral evolution.\nThis approach provides a scalable, mathematically grounded foundation for\nmodeling phenotypic traits, with future applications to machine learning,\nmulti-omic behavioral modeling, and related complex systems domains.

However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in\nthese biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it\nappears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by\nthe poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic\nResonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate\nsegmentation. The objective of this work is to introduce a new handcraft\nfeature that provides a novel visualisation of 4D Flow MRI images, which is\nuseful in the segmentation task. This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies\n(WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has\nbeen passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the\nhull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under\ndiscussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved\nsegmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning\nmethods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of\nIoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with\nthe PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task.

Our analysis\nindicates that the transverse momentum spectra with different event shapes can\nbe well described by this model. Events exhibiting higher activity or a greater\ndegree of angular isotropy consistently show stronger radial flow and smaller\nnon-extensive parameters across different event shape classifiers, reflecting\nthe increasing role of soft quantum chromodynamics (QCD) processes. Compared to\nthe charged multiplicity classified events for pp collisions and PbPb\ncollisions, a universal scaling in the kinetic freeze-out temperature and\nnon-extensive parameter across all collision system types and event shape\nmeasurements is observed, suggesting a unified partonic evolution stage\ngoverned by similar QCD dynamics. It has been shown that the introduction of\nevent-shape observables in pp collisions has significantly expanded the\naccessible freeze-out parameter space, enabling a more comprehensive\nexploration of its boundaries. Among the event shape classifiers, flattenicity\nemerges as a unique observable for disentangling hard process contributions\nfrom additive MPI effects, allowing the isolation of collective motion effects\nencoded by the radial flow velocity.

Our experiments, including\nthose on highly stiff dynamical systems, demonstrate that H-FEX can recover\nHamiltonian functions of complex systems that accurately capture system\ndynamics and preserve energy over long time horizons. These findings highlight\nthe potential of H-FEX as a powerful framework for discovering closed-form\nexpressions of complex dynamical systems.",

However, deploying LLM-based agents\nin high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.\nUnethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world\nconsequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer\nthe ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model\nediting task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area\nof research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while\npreserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate\nthis approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in\npsychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and\nediting of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier\nintroducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that\nBehavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within\nspecific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only\nscenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an\nagent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be\nused to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce\nharmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents\nbased on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior\nEditing across different models and scenarios.

    "abstract": "As a computer vision task, automatic object segmentation remains challenging\nin specialized image domains without massive labeled data, such as synthetic\naperture sonar images, remote sensing, biomedical imaging, etc. In any domain,\nobtaining pixel-wise segmentation masks is expensive. In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a\nsupervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could\nprovide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences. We conduct experiments\non side-scan and synthetic aperture sonar in which our approach succeeds\ncompared to previous unsupervised segmentation baselines that were only tested\non natural images.

Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as\narchitectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent\napproaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of\nlarge language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation\nmodels. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,\nwhich restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.\nMeanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in\nviewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present\nVideo Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework\nthat exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in\nvideo generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object\nplacements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and\nseamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and\nopen-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze\neach object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism\nand structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce\nFirst-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,\nutilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning\nability of multimodal large language models.

Existing forgery detection methods typically rely on single visual\nfeatures to capture predefined artifacts, such as spatial-domain cues to detect\nforged objects like roads or buildings in RSI, or frequency-domain features to\nidentify artifacts from up-sampling operations in adversarial generative\nnetworks (GANs). However, the nature of artifacts can significantly differ\ndepending on geographic terrain, land cover types, or specific features within\nthe RSI. Moreover, these complex artifacts evolve as generative models become\nmore sophisticated.

However, a\nkey challenge in current 3D generation methods is the limited explorability,\nwhich cannot render high-quality images during larger maneuvers beyond the\noriginal viewpoint, particularly when attempting to move forward into unseen\nareas. To address this challenge, we propose WonderFree, the first model that\nenables users to interactively generate 3D worlds with the freedom to explore\nfrom arbitrary angles and directions. Specifically, we decouple this challenge\ninto two key subproblems: novel view quality, which addresses visual artifacts\nand floating issues in novel views, and cross-view consistency, which ensures\nspatial consistency across different viewpoints. To enhance rendering quality\nin novel views, we introduce WorldRestorer, a data-driven video restoration\nmodel designed to eliminate floaters and artifacts. In addition, a data\ncollection pipeline is presented to automatically gather training data for\nWorldRestorer, ensuring it can handle scenes with varying styles needed for 3D\nscene generation. Furthermore, to improve cross-view consistency, we propose\nConsistView, a multi-view joint restoration mechanism that simultaneously\nrestores multiple perspectives while maintaining spatiotemporal coherence.\nExperimental results demonstrate that WonderFree not only enhances rendering\nquality across diverse viewpoints but also significantly improves global\ncoherence and consistency.

To address this problem, we propose a graph-based\npartition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within\ntwo stages. For the ``partition\" stage, a whole event proposal is split into\nshort video segments for captioning at a finer level.

Tiny neutrino masses naturally arise\nthrough the Type-I seesaw mechanism, which involves lepton number violation.\nMeanwhile, the baryon asymmetry can be generated via leptogenesis, where the\nout-of-equilibrium decay of RHNs produces a lepton asymmetry that is partially\nconverted into a baryon asymmetry through sphaleron processes. The Dirac Yukawa\ncouplings play the crucial role for both Type-I seesaw and leptogenesis. In\nthis work, we derive an analytic expression for the CP asymmetry parameter in a\ngeneral parametrization. Focusing on a hierarchical RHN mass spectrum, we\nevaluate the lowest mass of the lightest RHN that reproduce both neutrino\noscillation data and the observed baryon asymmetry. We study the case with two\nand three generations of RHNs for both thermal and non-thermal leptogenesis\nscenarios. Besides the standard Type-I seesaw involving SM Higgs doublet, we\nalso examine the Type-I seesaw with a new neutrinophillic Higgs doublet. In\nthis case for non-thermal leptogenesis, the minimum value for the lightest RHN\nmass can be as low as sphaleron decoupling temperature.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of collaborative navigation in an unknown\nenvironment, where two robots, referred to in the sequel as the Seeker and the\nSupporter, traverse the space simultaneously. The Supporter assists the Seeker\nby transmitting a compressed representation of its local map under bandwidth\nconstraints to support the Seeker's path-planning task. We introduce a bit-rate\nmetric based on the expected binary codeword length to quantify communication\ncost. Using this metric, we formulate the compression design problem as a\nrate-distortion optimization problem that determines when to communicate, which\nregions of the map should be included in the compressed representation, and at\nwhat resolution (i.e., quantization level) they should be encoded. Our\nformulation allows different map regions to be encoded at varying quantization\nlevels based on their relevance to the Seeker's path-planning task. We\ndemonstrate that the resulting optimization problem is convex, and admits a\nclosed-form solution known in the information theory literature as reverse\nwater-filling, enabling efficient, low-computation, and real-time\nimplementation. Additionally, we show that the Seeker can infer the compression\ndecisions of the Supporter independently, requiring only the encoded map\ncontent and not the encoding policy itself to be transmitted, thereby reducing\ncommunication overhead. Simulation results indicate that our method effectively\nconstructs compressed, task-relevant map representations, both in content and\nresolution, that guide the Seeker's planning decisions even under tight\nbandwidth limitations.",

A key\nfeature of helical MHD is the appearance of an infrared-unstable ``mass-like''\nterm in the loop diagrams of the magnetic response function. Physically, this\nterm corresponds to the relevant perturbation of the Joule damping,\nproportional to $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\times \\boldsymbol{b}$ ($\\boldsymbol{b} =$\nmagnetic field). Its presence destabilizes the trivial ground state $\\langle\n\\boldsymbol{b} \\rangle = 0$ and forces us to look for a mechanism for\nstabilizing the system. We show that such stabilization can be achieved in two\nways: (i) by introducing into induction equation an external mass-like\nparameter that precisely cancels these dangerous loop corrections (kinematic\nregime), or (ii) via spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry, leading\nto a new ground state with nonzero large-scale magnetic field (turbulent dynamo\nregime). For the latter case, we study the two-loop correction to the\nspontaneously generated magnetic field and demonstrate that Goldstone-like\ncorrections to Alfv\\'en modes along with some other anisotropic structures\narise. Our results also confirm that the emergent mean magnetic field leads to\na steeper slope of the magnetic energy spectrum, $-11/3 + 2\\gamma_{b\\star}$\n(with $\\gamma_{b\\star} = -0.1039 - 0.4202\\rho^2$, for $|\\rho| \\leqslant 1$ as\nthe degree of helicity), compared to the Kolmogorov velocity spectrum of\n$-11/3$, thereby breaking equipartition.",

While\ngraph-transformer (GT) backbones have recently outperformed traditional\nmessage-passing neural networks (MPNNs) in multiple in-distribution (ID)\nbenchmarks, their effectiveness under distribution shifts remains largely\nunexplored.\n  In this work, we address the challenge of out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization for graph neural networks, with a special focus on the impact of\nbackbone architecture. We systematically evaluate GT and hybrid backbones in\nOOD settings and compare them to MPNNs. To do so, we adapt several leading\ndomain generalization (DG) algorithms to work with GTs and assess their\nperformance on a benchmark designed to test a variety of distribution shifts.\nOur results reveal that GT and hybrid GT-MPNN backbones consistently\ndemonstrate stronger generalization ability compared to MPNNs, even without\nspecialized DG algorithms.\n  Additionally, we propose a novel post-training analysis approach that\ncompares the clustering structure of the entire ID and OOD test datasets,\nspecifically examining domain alignment and class separation.

Therefore, the question of\nwhether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate\ndownstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction\nof principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in\nthe sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners\nfrom corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic\nRobust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures\nthat minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first\ninstantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber\nestimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness\nresult on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering\nprocedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a\nheterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared\nto the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually.\nWe explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem\nparameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data,\nobserving statistically significant reduction in utility.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformer has recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image\nsegmentation task due to its superior capability in capturing long-range\ndependencies. However, transformer requires a large amount of labeled data to\nbe effective, which hinders its applicability in annotation scarce\nsemi-supervised learning scenario where only limited labeled data is available.\nState-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods propose combinatorial\nCNN-Transformer learning to cross teach a transformer with a convolutional\nneural network, which achieves promising results. However, it remains a\nchallenging task to effectively train the transformer with limited labeled\ndata. In this paper, we propose an adversarial masked image modeling method to\nfully unleash the potential of transformer for semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation. The key challenge in semi-supervised learning with transformer\nlies in the lack of sufficient supervision signal. To this end, we propose to\nconstruct an auxiliary masked domain from original domain with masked image\nmodeling and train the transformer to predict the entire segmentation mask with\nmasked inputs to increase supervision signal. We leverage the original labels\nfrom labeled data and pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to learn the masked\ndomain. To further benefit the original domain from masked domain, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis of our method from a multi-domain learning perspective and\ndevise a novel adversarial training loss to reduce the domain gap between the\noriginal and masked domain, which boosts semi-supervised learning performance.\nWe also extend adversarial masked image modeling to CNN network. Extensive\nexperiments on three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method, where our method outperforms existing methods\nsignificantly.

    "abstract": "Detecting brain lesions as abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment. In the search of\nabnormalities, such as tumors and malformations, radiologists may benefit from\ncomputer-aided diagnostics that use computer vision systems trained with\nmachine learning to segment normal tissue from abnormal brain tissue. While\nsupervised learning methods require annotated lesions, we propose a new\nunsupervised approach (Patch2Loc) that learns from normal patches taken from\nstructural MRI. We train a neural network model to map a patch back to its\nspatial location within a slice of the brain volume. During inference, abnormal\npatches are detected by the relatively higher error and/or variance of the\nlocation prediction. This generates a heatmap that can be integrated into\npixel-wise methods to achieve finer-grained segmentation. We demonstrate the\nability of our model to segment abnormal brain tissues by applying our approach\nto the detection of tumor tissues in MRI on T2-weighted images from BraTS2021\nand MSLUB datasets and T1-weighted images from ATLAS and WMH datasets. We show\nthat it outperforms the state-of-the art in unsupervised segmentation. The\ncodebase for this work can be found on our\n\\href{https://github.com/bakerhassan/Patch2Loc}{GitHub page}.",

GJ\n12b is a newly-discovered temperate (Teq ~ 300 K), Earth-sized (Rp = 0.96 +/-\n0.05 Earth radii) planet orbiting an inactive M dwarf that might be a good\nalternate to the TRAPPIST-1 planets for atmospheric characterization. In this\npaper, we use MAROON-X radial velocities to measure a mass of 0.71 +/- 0.12\nEarth masses for GJ 12b. We also find moderate evidence that the planet has an\neccentric (e ~ 0.16) orbit. GJ 12b's mass results in a planetary density\ncomparable to or less dense than Earth, possibly indicating the presence of\nwater or a low bulk iron mass fraction. With its low mass, GJ 12b is likely\nwithin reach of JWST transmission spectroscopy observations, making it an\nexcellent target for determining the location of the cosmic shoreline. Its low\nmass may mean that the planet could have trouble retaining its primary\natmosphere during the star's active pre-main-sequence phase.

By incorporating cheap and abundant auxiliary\nmeasurements (for example, simulator outputs) as control variates for costly\nreal-world samples, our method provably reduces the variance of Monte Carlo\nestimates and thus requires significantly fewer real-world samples to attain a\nspecified confidence bound on the mean performance. We provide theoretical\nanalysis characterizing the variance and sample-efficiency improvement, and\ndemonstrate empirically in autonomous driving and quadruped robotics settings\nthat our approach achieves high-probability bounds with markedly improved\nsample efficiency. Our technique can lower the real-world testing burden for\nvalidating the performance of the stack, thereby enabling more efficient and\ncost-effective experimental evaluation of robotic systems.",

Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects\"\nintroduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and\nprimarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive\nArtifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and\nthe ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules:\nBlock Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to\nhandle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both\npaired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26\ndatasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake\ndetection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with\nlimited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the\n``block effect\" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust\nsolution for open-world scenarios.

However, despite many successful applications, machine\nlearning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These\nchallenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge\nby machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge\nrepresented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to\ntrain machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the\nConceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of\nguidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual\nmodeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine\nlearning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate\nits impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data\nscientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the\nvalue of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.",

Similar variability was\nsimultaneously observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths with other facilities\nthroughout the campaign. This variability and the flat radio/mm/MIR spectral\nindex ($\\alpha = 0.04 \\pm 0.01$) suggest that the MIR excess at and longward of\n21 $\\mu$m in V404 Cyg does not arise from the accretion disk or circumbinary\nmaterial.

Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA\nachieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models\ntrained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data\naugmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively\naligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive experiments such as multi-armed bandits offer efficiency gains over\ntraditional randomized experiments but pose two major challenges: invalid\ninference on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) due to adaptive sampling and\nlow statistical power for sub-optimal treatments. We address both issues by\nextending the Mixture Adaptive Design framework (arXiv:2311.05794). First, we\npropose MADCovar, a covariate-adjusted ATE estimator that is unbiased and\npreserves anytime-valid inference guarantees while substantially improving ATE\nprecision. Second, we introduce MADMod, which dynamically reallocates samples\nto underpowered arms, enabling more balanced statistical power across\ntreatments without sacrificing valid inference. Both methods retain MAD's core\nadvantage of constructing asymptotic confidence sequences (CSs) that allow\nresearchers to continuously monitor ATE estimates and stop data collection once\na desired precision or significance criterion is met. Empirically, we validate\nboth methods using simulations and real-world data. In simulations, MADCovar\nreduces CS width by up to $60\\%$ relative to MAD. In a large-scale political\nRCT with $\\approx32,000$ participants, MADCovar achieves similar precision\ngains. MADMod improves statistical power and inferential precision across all\ntreatment arms, particularly for suboptimal treatments.

    "abstract": "Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit\ndivergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL),\nespecially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model\nsuitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question\nis essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next\ngeneration. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL\ndynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our\nstudy reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as\nMegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,\nwhile existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further\nadding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nexamples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this\neffect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce\nverbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the\nimportance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to\nstronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a\ntwo-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are\nfirst trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B\ntokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields\nOctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and\nclosing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.\nWe hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models\nin the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models\nalong with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens\n(i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).",

Finally, from those\nsources with Gaia spectroscopic data, we built a low-resolution spectral\ntemplate that characterizes the unique features of these systems, including\nH$\\alpha$ emission from interaction with the giant's wind and radiation from\nthe hot star. We then queried the full GDR3 archive for sources with\nspectroscopic data that are bright (< 17 mag in G-band), have modest relative\nparallax uncertainties (< 20%), and fall within a region of color-magnitude\nspace characteristic of red giants, keeping only sources with spectra that\nquantitatively match our template.

This\npaper investigates two recent explanations for this observation: confounding\neffects from logging policies and model identifiability issues.

We also\ninvestigate the effect of logging policies on two-tower models, finding that\nthey introduce no bias when models perfectly capture user behavior.

We focus on systems where this\nrelaxation time is comparable to the diffusion time and significantly larger\nthan the relaxation times of all other non-conserved operators. In such\nsystems, late-time diffusion is influenced by this relaxation process, leading\nto a theory of quasi-diffusion. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field\nTheory (SK-EFT) framework, we compare the theories of diffusion and\nquasi-diffusion by analyzing the real-time dynamics of correlation functions\nboth in linear response and at one-loop order. In particular, we show that the\none-loop corrections in the causal (quasi-diffusion) theory, in both the\nunderdamped and the overdamped cases, are governed by two universal functions.\nIn the overdamped case, the behavior mirrors that of the acausal (diffusion)\ntheory, which has recently been applied for precision tests of SK-EFT in\ndiffusive systems. We suggest that our results in the underdamped limit can\nalso be used for precision tests in quasi-diffusive systems.",

    "abstract": "Geographic experiments are a gold-standard for measuring incremental return\non ad spend (iROAS) at scale, yet their design is challenging: the unit count\nis small, heterogeneity is large, and the optimal Supergeo partitioning problem\nis NP-hard. We introduce Adaptive Supergeo Design (ASD), a two-stage framework\nthat renders Supergeo designs practical for thousands of markets. A bespoke\ngraph-neural network first learns geo-embeddings and proposes a concise\ncandidate set of 'supergeos'; a CP-SAT solver then selects a partition that\nbalances both baseline outcomes and pre-treatment covariates believed to modify\nthe treatment effect. We prove that ASD's objective value is within (1+epsilon)\nof the global optimum under mild community-structure assumptions. In\nsimulations with up to 1,000 Designated Market Areas ASD completes in minutes\non standard hardware, retains every media dollar, and cuts iROAS bias\nsubstantively relative to existing methods. ASD therefore turns geo-lift\ntesting into a routine, scalable component of media planning while preserving\nstatistical rigour.",

We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal\nstructure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to\nthose substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on\nthe experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we\napply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full\nmomentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing\ninteraction. We find that the electronic structure, including the\npresence/absence of the so-called $\\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface\noriginating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the\ncrystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the\nband structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains\nrobust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the\n$s\\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap\nfunction of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and\n$(k_x,k_y)=(\\pi,\\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin\nfluctuations.

CAPTAiN significantly improved surgical completion rates\nof target anatomy (87.99% vs. 74.42%) and reduced cognitive load across\nmultiple NASA-TLX domains. It also minimized performance gaps across experience\nlevels, enabling novices to perform on par with advanced trainees.

To tackle this issue, we\npropose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel\nframework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes.

Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially\nboosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially\non the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised\nfine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities.\nWe apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and\nDAPO), all achieving consistent improvements.

    "abstract": "Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation\n(QSVT), have emerged as unifying frameworks in the context of quantum algorithm\ndesign. These techniques allow to carry out efficient polynomial\ntransformations of matrices block-encoded in unitaries, involving a single\nancilla qubit. Recent efforts try to extend QSP to the multivariate setting\n(M-QSP), where multiple matrices are transformed simultaneously. However, this\ngeneralization faces problems not encountered in the univariate counterpart: in\nparticular, the class of polynomials achievable by M-QSP seems hard to\ncharacterize. In this work we borrow tools from query complexity, namely the\nstate conversion problem and the adversary bound: we first recast QSP as a\nstate conversion problem over the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions.\nWe then show that the adversary bound for a $|0\\rangle \\mapsto (P, Q)$ state\nconversion in this space precisely identifies all and only the QSP protocols\nover $SU(2)$ in the univariate case. Motivated by this result, we extend the\nformalism to M-QSP: the computation of a M-QSP protocol of minimal space is\nthus reduced to a rank minimization problem involving the feasible solution\nspace of the adversary bound.",

The emergence of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)\nprocessors has sparked great interest in developing quantum algorithms to\ncompute band structure properties of materials. While significant research has\nbeen reported on computing ground state and excited state energy bands in the\npresence of noise that breaks the degeneracy, identifying the symmetry at\ncrossing points using quantum computers is still an open question. In this\nwork, we propose a method for identifying the symmetry of bands around\ncrossings and anti-crossings in the band structure of bilayer graphene with two\ndistinct configurations on a NISQ device. The method utilizes eigenstates at\nneighbouring $\\mathbf{k}$ points on either side of the touching point to\nrecover the local symmetry by implementing a character-checking quantum circuit\nthat uses ancilla qubit measurements for a probabilistic test. We then evaluate\nthe performance of our method under a depolarizing noise model, using four\ndistinct matrix representations of symmetry operations to assess its\nrobustness. Finally, we demonstrate the reliability of our method by correctly\nidentifying the correct band crossings of AA-stacked bilayer graphene around\n$K$ point, using the character-checking circuit implemented on a noisy IBM\nquantum processor $ibm\\_marrakesh$.",

Counterfactual\nself-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the\nmodel's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in\nthe training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be\naffected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in\nparticular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization\ntreating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into\naccount how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a\nsmall language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training\nsamples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking\nat self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with\nmemorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces\nself-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We\nobserve similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the\ninfluence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10.\nOur findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across\ntraining data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by\nself-influence alone.",

We detect HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 emission within the\ncentral region (< 500 pc) of the galaxy, while the J=1-0 emission lines exhibit\na more extended spatial distribution (> 700 pc). The dense gas shows a clear\ndouble-lobed structure in both spatial distribution and kinematics, with the\nHCN and HCO^+ J=4-3 lines in the southwest lobe blueshifted by ~ 40 km/s\nrelative to the J=1-0 lines. The HCN J=4-3/1-0 and HCO^+ J=4-3/1-0\nline-luminosity ratios range from 0.09 to 0.53 and from 0.14 to 0.87,\nrespectively, with mean values of 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.36 +/- 0.06. The HCN\nratio is lower than the typical average observed in nearby star-forming\ngalaxies, whereas the HCO^+ ratio is comparatively higher, suggesting that the\nhigh-J HCN emission in M82 is significantly sub-thermally excited. Spatially,\nthe peak values of the J=4-3/1-0 ratios are found in the northwest region of\nM82, coinciding with the galaxy-scale outflow. Elevated HCN/HCO^+ ratios are\nalso detected in roughly the same area, potentially tracing local excitation\nenhancements driven by the outflow. The HCN/HCO^+ J=4-3 ratio across all\ndetected regions ranges from 0.19 to 1.07 with a mean value of 0.41 +/- 0.11,\nwhich is significantly lower than the average J=1-0 ratio of 0.76 +/- 0.08.\nBoth ratios are significantly lower than the average values observed in nearby\nstar-forming galaxies, which could be related to the relatively low gas density\nand the presence of an extended photo-dissociation region in M82.",

Our approach begins with a\ngeneral finite-difference discretization and applies the Schrodingerisation\ntechnique to transform the resulting system into one that admits unitary\nquantum evolution, enabling quantum simulation.\n  For the Schrodinger equation corresponding to the discretized PDE, we\nconstruct an efficient block-encoding of the Hamiltonian $H$ that scales\npolylogarithmically with the number of grid points $N$. This encoding is\ncompatible with quantum signal processing and allows for the implementation of\nthe evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$. The oracle-free nature of our method permits\ncomplexity to be measured in fundamental gate units-namely, CNOT gates and\nsingle-qubit rotations-bypassing the inefficiencies of oracle queries.\nConsequently, the overall algorithm scales polynomially with $N$ and linearly\nwith the spatial dimension $d$, achieving a polynomial speedup in $N$ and an\nexponential advantage in $d$, thereby mitigating the classical curse of\ndimensionality. The validity and efficiency of the proposed approach are\nfurther substantiated by numerical simulations.\n  By explicitly defining the quantum operations and quantifying their resource\nrequirements, our approach offers a practical alternative for numerically\nsolving PDEs, distinct from others that rely on oracle queries and purely\nasymptotic scaling methods.",

We show that CoDoT\nresults in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For\nexample, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of\nthe time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.\nAdditionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two\ntimes. Given the rapid and widespread adoption of LLMs, CoDoT underscores the\ncritical need to evaluate safety efforts from first principles, ensuring that\nsafety and capabilities advance together.",

    "abstract": "Rock bolts are crucial components of the subterranean support systems in\nunderground mines that provide adequate structural reinforcement to the rock\nmass to prevent unforeseen hazards like rockfalls. This makes frequent\nassessments of such bolts critical for maintaining rock mass stability and\nminimising risks in underground mining operations. Where manual surveying of\nrock bolts is challenging due to the low light conditions in the underground\nmines and the time-intensive nature of the process, automated detection of rock\nbolts serves as a plausible solution. To that end, this study focuses on the\nautomatic identification of rock bolts within medium to large-scale 3D point\nclouds obtained from underground mines using mobile laser scanners. Existing\ntechniques for automated rock bolt identification primarily rely on feature\nengineering and traditional machine learning approaches. However, such\ntechniques lack robustness as these point clouds present several challenges due\nto data noise, varying environments, and complex surrounding structures.\nMoreover, the target rock bolts are extremely small objects within large-scale\npoint clouds and are often partially obscured due to the application of\nreinforcement shotcrete. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an\napproach termed DeepBolt, which employs a novel two-stage deep learning\narchitecture specifically designed for handling severe class imbalance for the\nautomatic and efficient identification of rock bolts in complex 3D point\nclouds. The proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art semantic segmentation\nmodels by up to 42.5% in Intersection over Union (IoU) for rock bolt points.\nAdditionally, it outperforms existing rock bolt identification techniques,\nachieving a 96.41% precision and 96.96% recall in classifying rock bolts,\ndemonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in complex underground\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Band alignment (or band convergence) is a strategy suggested to provide\nimprovements in the thermoelectric power factor (PF) of materials with complex\nbandstructures. The addition of more bands at the energy region that\ncontributes to transport, can provide more conducting paths and could improve\nthe electrical conductivity and PF of a material. However, this can lead to\nincreased inter-valley scattering, which will tend to degrade the conductivity.\nUsing the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) and a multi-band model, we\ntheoretically investigate the conditions under which band alignment can improve\nthe PF. We show that PF improvements are realized when intra-band scattering\nbetween the aligned bands dominates over inter-band scattering, with larger\nimprovements reached when a light-band is brought into alignment. In the more\nrealistic scenario of intra-and inter-band scattering co-existence, we show\nthat in the light band alignment case, possibilities of PF improvement are\npresent even down to the level where the intra- and inter-band scattering are\nof similar strength. For heavy band alignment this tolerance is weaker, and\nweaker inter-band scattering is necessary to realize PF improvements. On the\nother hand, when inter-band scattering dominates, it is not possible to realize\nany PF improvements upon band alignment, irrespective of bringing a light or a\nheavy band into alignment. Overall, to realize PF improvements upon band\nalignment, the valleys that are brought into alignment need to be as\nelectrically conducting as possible compared to the lower energy base valleys\nand interact as little as possible with those.",

    "abstract": "Radio pulsating white dwarf (WD) systems, known as WD pulsars, are\nnon-accreting binary systems where the rapidly spinning WD interacts with a\nlow-mass companion producing pulsed non-thermal emission that can be observed\nacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Only two such systems are known: AR\nSco and eRASSU J191213.9$-$441044. Here we present the discovery of a third WD\npulsar, SDSS J230641.47$+$244055.8. The optical spectrum is dominated by\nmolecular bands from an M-dwarf companion, with additional narrow emission\nlines from the Balmer series and He I. The long-term optical light-curve folded\non its orbital period ($P_\\mathrm{orb} = 3.49$ h) exhibits large scatter\n(roughly 10 per cent). High-cadence photometry reveals a short period signal,\nwhich we interpret to be the spin period of the WD primary ($P_\\mathrm{spin}\n\\simeq 92$ s). The WD spin period is slightly shorter than that of AR Sco ($\\rm\n\\sim 117$ s), the WD pulsar prototype. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals\nemission from the irradiated companion and Na I absorption lines approximately\ntracing its centre of mass, which yields a binary mass function of $f(M) \\simeq\n0.2 {\\rm M_\\odot}$. The H$\\alpha$ emission includes a low-amplitude broad\ncomponent, resembling the energetic emission line flashes seen in AR Sco. Using\nspectral templates, we classify the companion to be most likely a $\\rm M4.0\\pm\n0.5$ star with $T_\\mathrm{\\rm eff} \\approx 3300$ K. Modelling the stellar\ncontribution constrains the secondary mass ($0.19\\,{\\rm M_\\odot}\\lesssim\nM_2\\lesssim 0.28\\,{\\rm M_\\odot}$), system distance ($\\simeq1.25\\,{\\rm kpc}$),\nand inclination ($i \\simeq 45-50^\\circ$). We discuss the proposed evolutionary\nscenarios and summarize the observational properties of all three known WD\npulsars, establishing a benchmark for identifying and classifying future\nmembers of this emerging class.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis,\ndemonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training\ndiffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and\nexisting zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond\ntraining resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and\nspatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free,\nzero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural\ncoherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion\nmodels. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from\nthe pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel\nwavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion\nmethods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the\nbase image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer\nretains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural\nconsistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine\ndetails and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL\ndemonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in\nprior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed\nHiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art\nalternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for\nhigh-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring\nretraining or architectural modifications.",

However, the visual\nobservation of these colors is subjective and difficult to characterize. In\ndigital image analysis, the RGB intensities are affected by staining and\nimaging variations, hindering direct quantification of color in\nPapanicolaou-stained samples. Stain unmixing is a promising alternative that\nquantifies the amounts of dyes. In previous work, multispectral imaging was\nutilized to estimate the dye amounts of Papanicolaou stain for quantitative\ndiagnosis. Still, its application to RGB images presents a challenge since the\nnumber of dyes exceeds the three RGB channels. This paper proposes a novel\nPapanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images that incorporates three key\nassumptions: nonnegative stain abundances; a sparse spatial distribution of\nhematoxylin, which binds to nuclei; and piecewise smoothness of stain\nabundances. By formulating this as an optimization problem with nonnegativity,\nweighted nucleus sparsity, and total variation regularizations, our method\nachieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against\nthe results of multispectral imaging. We also adopted the proposed method for\ndiscriminating lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), a\nprecancerous lesion of gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The resulting\nquantification distinctly characterized differences between LEGH and normal\nendocervical cells with stain abundance, and a classifier based on the\nquantification results achieved 98.0% accuracy. This demonstrates the\nsignificant potential of RGB-based stain unmixing for quantitative diagnosis.",

The galaxy has a\nluminous optical AGN and a very extended distribution of molecular gas. We used\nthese observations (together with available CO(2-1) data) to trace the impact\nof the AGN across the extent of the radio emission and beyond on scales of a\nfew kpc. Despite the strength of the optical AGN, the kinematics of the cold\nmolecular gas is strongly affected only in the central kpc, and is more weakly\naffected around the northern lobe. We found other signatures of the substantial\nimpact of the radio AGN, however. Most notably, extreme line ratios of the CO\ntransitions in a region aligned with the radio axis indicate conditions very\ndifferent from those observed in the undisturbed gas at large radii. The\nnon-detection of CO(1-0) at the location of the core of the radio source\nimplies extreme conditions at this location. Furthermore, on the scale of a few\nkpc, the cold molecular gas appears to be wrapped around the northern radio\nlobe. This suggests that a strong jet-cloud interaction has depleted the\nnorthern lobe of molecular gas, perhaps as a result of the hot wind behind the\njet-induced shock that shreds the clouds via hydrodynamic instabilities. The\nhigher gas velocity dispersion and molecular excitation that we observed close\nto this location may then be the result of a milder interaction in which the\nexpanding jet cocoon induces turbulence in the surrounding interstellar medium.\nThese results highlight that the impact of an AGN can manifest itself not only\nin the kinematics of the gas, but also in molecular line ratios and in the\ndistribution of the gas. Although the radio plasma and the cold molecular gas\nare clearly coupled, the kinetic energy that is transferred to the ISM is only\na small fraction of the energy available from the AGN.",

On the other hand, the Darboux transformation\nallows for constructing new exotic but solvable Schr\\\"odinger equations. This\nframework relates the quantum harmonic oscillator and its rational deformations\nto exotic scalar theories featuring non-trivial potentials. Depending on the\nstructure of the spectrum of perturbation frequencies, these potentials may\nhave various local maximums, minimums, and inflection points. The stationary\nsolutions take the form of the definite integral over a finite interval of a\nfunction times the Gaussian bell distribution, including the Error and the Owen\n$T$ functions.

At the nanoscale the\ninteraction energies of hydrogen on different sites of the iron lattice are\nstudied using DFT. At the microscale, this information is used to feed a\nlattice object kinetic Monte Carlo code (OKMC) which aims to evolve the\narrangement of a large set of hydrogen atoms into the iron lattice considering\npoint defects and the presence of dislocations. At the continuum level, an\narray of dislocations is introduced using a phase-field approach to accurately\nconsider their elastic fields and core regions. The OKMC model includes both\nthe chemical energies of H and vacancies and the elastic interactions between\nthese point defects and the dislocations. The elastic interaction is obtained\nby an FFT-based approach which allows a very efficient computation of the\nelastic microfields created by the defects in an anisotropic medium. The\nframework has been used to obtain the diffusivity tensor of hydrogen as a\nfunction of the external stress state, temperature, and the presence of\ndislocations. It has been found that dislocations strongly affect the\ndiffusivity tensor by breaking its isotropy and reducing its value by the\neffect of the microstresses around the dislocations.",

Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must\nland safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an\nessential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate\nlanding remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To\naddress this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings,\npowered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model\nintegrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection\nand incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We\nintroduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the\nsystem's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new\ndataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to\nsupport training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system\nachieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\\%,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability.

Most existing methods overlook the\nscenario where only a small portion of clients participate in training within a\nlarge-scale client setting, whereas our experiments show that this scenario\npresents a more challenging federated learning task. Therefore, we propose a\nKnowledge Distillation with teacher-student Inequitable Aggregation (KDIA)\nstrategy tailored to address the federated learning setting mentioned above,\nwhich can effectively leverage knowledge from all clients. In KDIA, the student\nmodel is the average aggregation of the participating clients, while the\nteacher model is formed by a weighted aggregation of all clients based on three\nfrequencies: participation intervals, participation counts, and data volume\nproportions. During local training, self-knowledge distillation is performed.\nAdditionally, we utilize a generator trained on the server to generate\napproximately independent and identically distributed (IID) data features\nlocally for auxiliary training. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nCIFAR-10/100/CINIC-10 datasets and various heterogeneous settings to evaluate\nKDIA.

    "abstract": "Signaling quantum channels are fundamental to quantum communication, enabling\nthe transfer of information from input to output states. In contrast,\nthermalisation erases information about the initial state. This raises a\ncrucial question: How does the thermalising tendency of a quantum channel\nconstrain its signaling power and vice versa? In this work, we address this\nquestion by considering three thermodynamic tasks associated with a quantum\nchannel: the generation, preservation, and transmission of athermality. We\nprovide faithful measures for athermality generation and athermality\npreservation of quantum channels, and prove that their difference quantifies\nathermality transmission. Analysing these thermodynamic tasks, we find that the\nsignaling ability of a quantum channel is upper-bounded by its athermality\npreservation and lower-bounded by its athermality transmission, thereby\nestablishing a fundamental relationship between signaling and thermodynamic\nproperties of channels for quantum communication. We demonstrate this interplay\nfor the example of the quantum switch, revealing an explicit trade-off between\nthe signaling ability and athermality of the quantum channels it can implement.",

Here we investigate this problem by molecular dynamics\nsimulation for two-dimensional ball-stick polygon systems, where pentagon,\nhexagon, and octagon systems all undergo an isostructural solid-solid phase\ntransition. During heating, the translational motion exhibits merely a\nhomogeneous expansion, whereas the time evolution of body-orientation is\nshape-determined. The local defects of body-orientation self-organize into a\nvague stripe for pentagon, a random pattern for hexagon, while a distinct\nstripe for octagon. The underlying kinetic pathway of octagon satisfies the\nquasi-equilibrium assumption, while that of hexagon and pentagon is dominated\nby translational motion and by rotational motion, respectively. This diversity\nis originated from different kinetic coupling modes determined by the\nanisotropy of molecules, and can affect the phase transition rates. The reverse\nprocess in terms of cooling follows the same mechanism, but the kinetic\npathways are more diverse attributed to the possible kinetic traps.

Inferences of\noutflow properties from Lyman-$\\alpha$, however, often lack contextual\ncomparisons with more direct outflow diagnostics from down-the-barrel metal\nabsorption lines and driving-source properties from metal emission lines. Here,\nwe make such checks by taking advantage of the lensing magnification provided\nby galaxy clusters for 338 Lyman-$\\alpha$ sources observed with the Multi-Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Using metal emission lines to measure systemic\nredshifts, we confirm that the Lyman-$\\alpha$ profiles are consistent with\noutflowing gas: single peaks redshifted relative to, or double peaks\nstraddling, the systemic redshift. In cases where metal absorption lines are\ndetected, blueshifted velocities indicate outflows, while line ratios point to\nabsorption by a clumpy medium. We find systematic differences in both metal\nabsorption and emission lines associated with single- versus double-peaked\nLyman-$\\alpha$ profiles, such that the latter are preferentially associated\nwith weaker and narrower metal absorption profiles, but stronger emission lines\nindicating younger stellar ages ($\\lesssim4\\,$Myr for double-peaked\nLyman-$\\alpha$ vs $\\gtrsim10\\,$Myr for single-peaked Lyman-$\\alpha$).\nDouble-peaked Lyman-$\\alpha$ profiles may therefore reflect weaker feedback in\nextremely young starbursts due to the delayed onset of core-collapse\nsupernovae.

    "abstract": "Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical\nimperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due\nto significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and\nadaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable\ncapabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced\nreasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond\nmonolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent\nsystems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more\neffectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel\nmulti-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security\nverification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification\nquestion answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan\nand property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug\nvalidation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in\nthese diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as\nin-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The\nsystem aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate\nsecurity analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks\nearly in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware\nsecurity practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that\nshowcase its applicability and efficacy.",

The calculated results suggest that the\nmodified model can improve the trend of changes of the differential charge\nradii along Ca, Ni, Sn, and Pb isotopic chains, especially the shell closure\neffect at the neutron numbers $N=28$, 82 and 126. The shell quenching phenomena\nof charge radii can also be predicted at the neutron number $N=50$ along the\ncorresponding Ni and Sn isotopes, respectively. The inverted parabolic-like\nshapes between the two fully filled shells can also be observed, but the\namplitude is gradually weakened from Ca to Pb isotopic chains.

    "abstract": "Laboratory robotics offer the capability to conduct experiments with a high\ndegree of precision and reproducibility, with the potential to transform\nscientific research. Trivial and repeatable tasks; e.g., sample transportation\nfor analysis and vial capping are well-suited for robots; if done successfully\nand reliably, chemists could contribute their efforts towards more critical\nresearch activities. Currently, robots can perform these tasks faster than\nchemists, but how reliable are they? Improper capping could result in human\nexposure to toxic chemicals which could be fatal. To ensure that robots perform\nthese tasks as accurately as humans, sensory feedback is required to assess the\nprogress of task execution. To address this, we propose a novel methodology\nbased on behaviour trees with multimodal perception. Along with automating\nrobotic tasks, this methodology also verifies the successful execution of the\ntask, a fundamental requirement in safety-critical environments. The\nexperimental evaluation was conducted on two lab tasks: sample vial capping and\nlaboratory rack insertion. The results show high success rate, i.e., 88% for\ncapping and 92% for insertion, along with strong error detection capabilities.\nThis ultimately proves the robustness and reliability of our approach and that\nusing multimodal behaviour trees should pave the way towards the next\ngeneration of robotic chemists.",

Chapter 1 addresses\neffective theories with nonlinearly realized supersymmetry, constructed using\nthe formalism of constrained superfields. We establish a criterion for\nidentifying inconsistent constraints, formulate their improved versions, and\npropose, along these lines, improved supergravity models of inflation. In\nChapter 2, we discuss a peculiar application of this framework: the\ngravitational production of massive gravitinos in time-dependent backgrounds.\nWe emphasize some physical subtleties in the standard description of this\nmechanism, which become particularly severe in the case of the gravitino. Next,\nthe focus shifts to linear supersymmetry, and we investigate the leading-order\ncoupling of the massive spin-2 field supermultiplet to pure supergravity in\nfour dimensions. This analysis is carried out using the supercurrent superfield\nformalism, and it shows that only a single class of such couplings can be\nconsistently defined. This is fundamentally distinct from the coupling obtained\nby compactifying higher-dimensional supergravities, and it has interesting\nconnections to string theory and the string lamppost principle. Finally, in\nChapter 3, we present a novel orientifold projection of type IIB string theory.\nThis is a Scherk--Schwarz orientifold in which supersymmetry is entirely\nbroken, and the O-planes couple only to the twisted sector of the theory. We\nargue that this model is invariant under S-duality and can be formulated as an\nF-theory compactification. We also analyze the D-brane spectrum of the theory\nand compare the results with earlier similar constructions.

A density-tuned\nmetal-insulator transition (MIT) occurring at 3.1E10^11 cm-2 (corresponding to\nr_s~32) and pronounced nonlinear charge transport in the insulating regime at\nlow temperatures signify the formation of Wigner crystals. Thermal melting of\nthe crystalline phase is observed below approximately 2 K via\ntemperature-dependent nonlinear transport. Magnetoresistance measurements\nfurther reveal a substantial enhancement of spin susceptibility as approaching\nthe MIT. The temperature dependence of spin susceptibility in the Wigner\ncrystal phase closely follows the Curie-Weiss law, with the extracted negative\nWeiss constant illustrating antiferromagnetic exchange interactions.\nFurthermore, we have found the system exhibits metallic-like differential\nresistivity under finite DC bias, possibly indicating the existence of a\nnon-equilibrium coherent state in the depinning of Wigner crystals.

The distribution of KK dark matter particles within\nUCMHs tends to be steeper than in classical dark matter halo structures, such\nas the Navarro-Frenk-White model. Consequently, the annihilation rate of KK\ndark matter particles in UCMHs is significant.

The formation of\nsuch a system is puzzling because orbital stability generally breaks down due\nto the large mass loss from the system caused by the SN explosion while forming\nthe unseen component. Analytical solutions of the variable-mass two-body\nproblem suggest that the explosion should have occurred when the component was\nclose to its apocenter to explain the near-circular remnant system. This\nprovides a strong constraint on the total mass and orbital configuration of the\nprogenitor system. The nearly circular orbit of G3425 rules out type II SN\nscenarios and allows only for a fine-tuned SN~Ib/c explosion to occur when the\nsecondary was close to its apocenter. Such a scenario, although possible, is\nhighly unlikely. However, the most likely scenario is a failed SN that produced\na black hole, for which no additional constraints on the position of the\nsecondary are needed.

    "abstract": "The Diversification Quotient (DQ), introduced by Han et al. (2025), is a\nrecently proposed measure of portfolio diversification that quantifies the\nreduction in a portfolio's risk-level parameter attributable to\ndiversification. Grounded in a rigorous theoretical framework, DQ effectively\ncaptures heavy tails, common shocks, and enhances efficiency in portfolio\noptimization. This paper further explores the convergence properties and\nasymptotic normality of empirical DQ estimators based on Value at Risk (VaR)\nand Expected Shortfall (ES), with explicit calculation of the asymptotic\nvariance. In contrast to the diversification ratio (DR) proposed by Tasche\n(2007), which may exhibit diverging asymptotic variance due to its lack of\nlocation invariance, the DQ estimators demonstrate greater robustness under\nvarious distributional settings. We further evaluate their performance under\nelliptical distributions and conduct a simulation study to examine their\nfinite-sample behavior. The results offer a solid statistical foundation for\nthe application of DQ in financial risk management and decision-making.",

The\ninitial release of PBjam was restricted to only identifying modes of $\\ell=0$\nand $\\ell=2$, since these are the simplest to treat consistently across\ndifferent stellar evolutionary stages.

These\ninclude a simple asymptotic relation for p-modes which can be applied to\nmain-sequence stars, a matrix formalism aimed at treating frequency dependent\ncoupling in sub-giants, and a uniform coupling model which is suitable for red\ngiants. These models follow the Bayesian methodology established in the first\nrelease of PBjam, where a large set of previous observations is used to\nconstruct a nonparametric prior probability density for the new set of model\nparameters.

To address this challenge, we present HiT, a novel family of efficient\ntracking models that achieve high performance while maintaining fast operation\nacross various devices. The core innovation of HiT lies in its Bridge Module,\nwhich connects lightweight transformers to the tracking framework, enhancing\nfeature representation quality. Additionally, we introduce a dual-image\nposition encoding approach to effectively encode spatial information. HiT\nachieves an impressive speed of 61 frames per second (fps) on the NVIDIA Jetson\nAGX platform, alongside a competitive AUC of 64.6% on the LaSOT benchmark,\noutperforming all previous efficient trackers.Building on HiT, we propose\nDyHiT, an efficient dynamic tracker that flexibly adapts to scene complexity by\nselecting routes with varying computational requirements. DyHiT uses search\narea features extracted by the backbone network and inputs them into an\nefficient dynamic router to classify tracking scenarios. Based on the\nclassification, DyHiT applies a divide-and-conquer strategy, selecting\nappropriate routes to achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy and speed.\nThe fastest version of DyHiT achieves 111 fps on NVIDIA Jetson AGX while\nmaintaining an AUC of 62.4% on LaSOT.Furthermore, we introduce a training-free\nacceleration method based on the dynamic routing architecture of DyHiT.

In this work, we simulate a large LGRB sample that\nreflects the observed situation, aiming to study the impact of peak flux $P$ on\nthe observed LGRB E$_{\\rm p,i}$--L$_{\\rm iso}$ correlation. We find that the\noverall (E$_{\\rm p,i}$, L$_{\\rm iso}$) distribution, which will directly affect\nthe best-fit result of the correlation, is significantly dependent on the value\nof $P$. This indicates that the impact of peak flux selection should be\ncarefully considered in the studies and applications of the E$_{\\rm\np,i}$--L$_{\\rm iso}$ correlation.

The objective is to determine the positions of\nexternal dampers in such a way that the influence of the input on the output is\nminimized. The energy response serves as an optimization criterion, whose\ncomputation involves solving Lyapunov equations. Hence, in order to find the\nbest positions, many of these equations need to be solved, and so the\nminimization process can have a high computational cost.\n  To accelerate the process of finding the optimal positions, we propose a new\nreduction method. Our algorithm generates a basis spanning an approximation to\nthe solution space of the Lyapunov equations for all possible positions of the\ndampers. We derive an adaptive scheme that generates the reduced solution space\nby adding the subspaces of interest, and then we define the corresponding\nreduced optimization problem that is solvable in a reasonable amount of time.\nWe decouple the solution spaces of the problem to obtain a space that\ncorresponds to the system without external dampers and serves as a starting\npoint for the reduction of the optimization problem. In addition, we derive\nspaces corresponding to the different damper positions that are used to expand\nthe reduced basis if needed. To evaluate the quality of the basis, we introduce\nan error indicator based on the space decomposition.

    "abstract": "Accounting for dispersion interactions is essential in approximate density\nfunctional theory (DFT). Often, a correction potential based on the London\nformula is added, which is damped at short distances to avoid divergence and\ndouble counting of interactions treated locally by the exchange-correlation\nfunctional. Most commonly, two forms of damping, known as zero- and\nBecke-Johnson (BJ)-damping, are employed and it is generally assumed that the\nchoice has only a minor impact on performance even though the resulting\ncorrection potentials differ quite dramatically. Recent studies have cast doubt\non this assumption pointing to a significant effect of damping for liquid\nwater, but the underlying reasons have not yet been investigated. Here, we\nanalyze this effect in detail for the widely used Tkatchenko-Scheffler and\nDFT-D3 dispersion models. We demonstrate that, regardless of the dispersion\nmodel, both types of damping perform equally well for interaction energies of\nwater clusters, but find that for the two investigated functionals zero-damping\noutperforms BJ-damping in dynamic simulations of liquid water. Compared to\nBJ-damping, zero-damping provides, e.g., an improved structural description,\nself-diffusion, and density of liquid water. This can be explained by the\nrepulsive gradient at small distances resulting from damping to zero that\nartificially destabilizes water's tetrahedral hydrogen-bonding network.\nTherefore, zero-damping can compensate for deficiencies often observed for\ngeneralized gradient functionals, which is not possible for strictly attractive\nBJ-damping. Consequently, the improvement that can be achieved by applying a\ndispersion correction strongly depends on the employed damping function\nsuggesting that the role of damping in dispersion-corrected DFT needs to be\ngenerally reevaluated.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for robust image\nzero-watermarking based on distortion-invariant feature learning. As a\nzero-watermarking scheme, our method leaves the original image unaltered and\nlearns a reference signature through optimization in the feature space. The\nproposed framework consists of two key modules. In the first module, a feature\nextractor is trained via noise-adversarial learning to generate representations\nthat are both invariant to distortions and semantically expressive. This is\nachieved by combining adversarial supervision against a distortion\ndiscriminator and a reconstruction constraint to retain image content. In the\nsecond module, we design a learning-based multibit zero-watermarking scheme\nwhere the trained invariant features are projected onto a set of trainable\nreference codes optimized to match a target binary message. Extensive\nexperiments on diverse image datasets and a wide range of distortions show that\nour method achieves state-of-the-art robustness in both feature stability and\nwatermark recovery. Comparative evaluations against existing self-supervised\nand deep watermarking techniques further highlight the superiority of our\nframework in generalization and robustness.",

During the two and half years of operations, a\nseries of calibration observations were performed, to fully characterize its\nperformance and calibrate the instrumental properties. In this paper, we\npresent the results of the in-flight calibration campaign of LEIA, focusing on\nthe properties of the PSF, source positional accuracy, effective area, energy\nresponse and the instrumental background. The calibration sources used are the\nCrab nebula, Sco X-1 and Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Specifically, it is\nfound that the spatial resolution remains almost unchanged compared to the\npre-launch values, ranging from 3.6'-9.3' with a median of 5.9'. The\npost-calibration source positional accuracy is found to be ~2' (at the 90%\nC.L.). The Crab spectra can be well reproduced by the absorbed power-law model\nwith the best-fit parameters in large agreement with the literature values,\nindicating that the in-orbit effective area is overall consistent with the\nmodel predictions and ground measurements. The effective area exhibits a\nsystematic of $\\lesssim10\\%$ (at the 68% C.L.), and a mild deterioration of\n~15% at the lower energy end after one year of operation. The Cas A spectral\nanalysis shows that the energy scale and spectral resolution of the detectors\nare generally consistent with ground values. The instrumental background is\nfound to be largely consistent among the four detectors, with strong\nmodulations by the geomagnetic activity and the spectrum qualitatively\nconsistent with our previous simulations. These instrumental performances well\nmeet the design requirements. This work paves the way for the in-orbit\ncalibration of the EP-WXT.",

Although\nthe research community has made impressive progress in addressing the\nchallenges of this complex task, existing methods often generate environments\nthat are only front-facing, lack visual fidelity, exhibit limited scene\nunderstanding, and are typically fine-tuned for either indoor or outdoor\nsettings. In this work, we address these issues and propose DreamAnywhere, a\nmodular system for the fast generation and prototyping of 3D scenes. Our system\nsynthesizes a 360{\\deg} panoramic image from text, decomposes it into\nbackground and objects, constructs a complete 3D representation through hybrid\ninpainting, and lifts object masks to detailed 3D objects that are placed in\nthe virtual environment. DreamAnywhere supports immersive navigation and\nintuitive object-level editing, making it ideal for scene exploration, visual\nmock-ups, and rapid prototyping -- all with minimal manual modeling. These\nfeatures make our system particularly suitable for low-budget movie production,\nenabling quick iteration on scene layout and visual tone without the overhead\nof traditional 3D workflows. Our modular pipeline is highly customizable as it\nallows components to be replaced independently. Compared to current\nstate-of-the-art text and image-based 3D scene generation approaches,\nDreamAnywhere shows significant improvements in coherence in novel view\nsynthesis and achieves competitive image quality, demonstrating its\neffectiveness across diverse and challenging scenarios. A comprehensive user\nstudy demonstrates a clear preference for our method over existing approaches,\nvalidating both its technical robustness and practical usefulness.",

A key aspect is evaluating consistency between direct and indirect\nsources. Existing methods to detect inconsistency, although widely used, have\nlimitations. For example, they do not account for differences within indirect\nsources or cannot estimate inconsistency when direct evidence is absent.\n  In this paper, we introduce a path-based approach that explores all sources\nof evidence without separating direct and indirect. We introduce a measure\nbased on the square of differences to quantitatively capture inconsistency, and\npropose a Netpath plot to visualize inconsistencies between various paths.

Via application to fictional and real-world examples, we show that our\nmethod is able to detect and visualize inconsistency between multiple paths of\nevidence that would otherwise be masked by considering all indirect sources\ntogether.

Internal gravity waves (IGW), excited by convective motions,\ndrive turbulent mixing in non-convective regions, altering stellar surface and\nwind chemistry. Aims: Investigate IGW-induced extra-mixing in the radiative\nzone between thermal pulses and convective envelopes of AGB stars and its\nimpact on Li production. Derive the total Li contribution from\nintermediate-mass AGB stars using stellar models and initial mass functions.\nMethods: Construct stellar models (from zero-age main sequence to AGB end) with\nMESA, incorporating IGW-induced mixing and element diffusion. Calculate Li\nyields for stars of varying masses and metallicities using grids and population\nsynthesis. Results: IGW triggers extra-mixing during He-shell flashes,\ntransporting Be-7 from the radiative zone to the convective envelope, where it\ndecays into Li-7. The positive effect of IGW on Li yield decreases with initial\nstellar mass but increases with metallicity. Most AGB stars (3.5-7.5 solar\nmasses) produce positive Li yields. The total Li yield with IGW mixing\n(approximately 15 solar masses) is twice that without, contributing about 10\npercent to Galactic Li. Conclusions: Through this extra-mixing mechanism\ninduced by IGW, AGB stars can achieve a maximum A(Li) exceeding 5 and\nintermediate-mass AGB stars significantly contribute to Li in the Galactic ISM.\nThese findings underscore the crucial role of IGW in stellar evolution,\nparticularly in enhancing Li production.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory analysis is not only about obtaining movement data, but it is also\nof paramount importance in understanding the pattern in which an object moves\nthrough space and time, as well as in predicting its next move. Due to the\nsignificant interest in the area, data collection has improved substantially,\nresulting in a large number of features becoming available for training and\npredicting models. However, this introduces a high-dimensionality-induced\nfeature explosion problem, which reduces the efficiency and interpretability of\nthe data, thereby reducing the accuracy of machine learning models. To overcome\nthis issue, feature selection has become one of the most prevalent tools. Thus,\nthe objective of this paper was to introduce a taxonomy-based feature selection\nmethod that categorizes features based on their internal structure. This\napproach classifies the data into geometric and kinematic features, further\ncategorizing them into curvature, indentation, speed, and acceleration. The\ncomparative analysis indicated that a taxonomy-based approach consistently\nachieved comparable or superior predictive performance. Furthermore, due to the\ntaxonomic grouping, which reduces combinatorial space, the time taken to select\nfeatures was drastically reduced. The taxonomy was also used to gain insights\ninto what feature sets each dataset was more sensitive to. Overall, this study\nprovides robust evidence that a taxonomy-based feature selection method can add\na layer of interpretability, reduce dimensionality and computational\ncomplexity, and contribute to high-level decision-making. It serves as a step\ntoward providing a methodological framework for researchers and practitioners\ndealing with trajectory datasets and contributing to the broader field of\nexplainable artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional optics leverages the simultaneous control of materials in\nspace and time to manipulate light. A key challenge in experimentally realizing\nmany intriguing phenomena is the need for rapid modulation, which is hindered\nby the inherently adiabatic relaxation of optical materials. Here, we\ntheoretically demonstrate that broadband amplification can be achieved without\nthe need for sub-cycle temporal responses, instead leveraging adiabatic\nspatiotemporal modulation patterns. The proposed modulation scheme is\ncompatible with recent demonstrations of the temporal modulation of\nepsilon-near-zero materials. We also show that the same phenomenon may be\nrealized by modulating bianisotropic nonreciprocal media in time. This\nbroadband gain mechanism opens new avenues for the generation of high-energy,\nultrashort optical pulses, with potential impact in ultrafast optics and\nelectron microscopy.",

We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a\ngenerative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the\nevolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future\nefforts by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest\npublicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of\nrecordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to\nachieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level\nperformance in several iEEG tasks.

This paper develops, presents and compares two different\naccelerated solvers that both utilize the matrix structure to determine antenna\nproperties. Both methods use a novel mesh-partitioning algorithm and its\nassociated data representation, reducing storage and computational costs. The\nfirst solver is an iterative method based on multilevel fast Fourier transform\nto accelerate matrix multiplications. The second solver approach is based on an\nextension of a fast direct Toeplitz solver, adapted to a block-matrix\nstructure. This fast direct solver is demonstrated to have close to machine\nepsilon accuracy. Both accelerated methods are evaluated on two different array\nelement types, for arrays with up to 900 elements. The results are compared\nwith conventional direct and iterative matrix solvers. Improvements are seen in\nboth the time and required storage to solve the problem. The choice of the most\nefficient method depends on the residual thresholds in the iterative method,\ngeometry of the element and frequency.

    "abstract": "Despite its wide range of applications across various domains, the\noptimization foundations of deep matrix factorization (DMF) remain largely\nopen. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive study\nof the loss landscape of the regularized DMF problem. Toward this goal, we\nfirst provide a closed-form characterization of all critical points of the\nproblem. Building on this, we establish precise conditions under which a\ncritical point is a local minimizer, a global minimizer, a strict saddle point,\nor a non-strict saddle point. Leveraging these results, we derive a necessary\nand sufficient condition under which every critical point is either a local\nminimizer or a strict saddle point. This provides insights into why\ngradient-based methods almost always converge to a local minimizer of the\nregularized DMF problem. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to visualize\nits loss landscape to support our theory.",

To address\nthis, numerous studies have been conducted to learn body schema, particularly\nthe relationships among joint angles, muscle tension, and muscle length. These\nstudies typically rely solely on data collected from the actual robot, but this\ndata collection process is labor-intensive, and learning becomes difficult when\nthe amount of data is limited. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method\nthat applies the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the\nlearning of body schema in musculoskeletal humanoids, enabling high-accuracy\nlearning even with a small amount of data. By utilizing not only data obtained\nfrom the actual robot but also the physical laws governing the relationship\nbetween torque and muscle tension under the assumption of correct joint\nstructure, more efficient learning becomes possible.

To focus on action-relevant regions\nbeyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors.

One of the\ndominant effects of atmospheric losses is the photochemical escape of atomic\noxygen from Mars. Increasing the magnitude of the irradiation changes the\nresponse of the atmosphere. The purpose of the current paper is to analyze the\neffects of enhanced EUV irradiation on the escape rates of oxygen atoms. We\nhave used the solar flare of 2017 September 10 as the baseline flare intensity\nand varied the intensity of the flare from a factor of 3 up to 10 times the\nbaseline flare. We see an increase in the escape flux by 40% for flares up to\n5x the intensity of the baseline flare. However, beyond this point, the\nincrease in escape flux tapers off, reaching only about 17% above the baseline.\nAt 10x the baseline flare intensity, the escape flux decreases by nearly 25%\ncompared to the escape rate of the original flare. We also found that the total\nescape amount of hot O peaks at 7x the original flare intensity. Additionally,\nwe have studied the effects of the time scales over which the flare energy is\ndelivered. We find that energy dissipative processes like radiative cooling and\nthermal collisions do not come into play instantaneously.

Our training framework consists of three\nstages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level\nreward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn\ntrajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error\ncorrection capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance\nimprovements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese\napplications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new\nbenchmark with 500 trajectories. We will open source all resources, including\nthe dataset, benchmark, model weight, and codes:\nhttps://mobile-r1.github.io/Mobile-R1/.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from\nPubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language\nmodel annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning\nscores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical,\nbiomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score\n(rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning.\nThese annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which\npropagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata\nallows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs\nwith over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,\nand to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.\nClinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as\nhospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an\nalternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from\nPubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.\nPreliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated\nsubsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting\nperformance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving\nMedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster\nconvergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,\nindicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining\nstrategies.",

The variability in integrated flux in RCas\nand oCet followed that in the optical with the same period, but with a lag of\nabout one-third in phase. RLeo was too often below our sensitivity threshold\nfor us to determine a radio period. No maser was detected in ChiCyg. The\nvariability in the masers in RCas has a distinctive pattern that confirms the\nexistence of a zone in the CSE with favourable conditions for maser excitation.\nThe total flux, modulated by the pulsations of the star, gradually increases to\na maximum, which is followed by a similar decrease. This takes about 20 years.\nThe pattern is repeated after an interval of quiescence of several years.\nDuring its decline, the variation in the flux resembles a damped harmonic\noscillator. There are two dominant emission components that move almost\ntangentially on either side of the star with respect to the observer. The\nredshifted one is consistent with an origin in a single cloud that lived for at\nleast about eight years, falling back towards the star. The blue component,\nmoving in the CSE hemisphere nearest to us, has no drift in the line-of-sight\nvelocity and appears to originate in a time series of short-living clouds with\nline-of-sight velocities within ca. 1 km/s of each other. No systematic drifts\nare found in RLeo and oCet. A few bursts of emission were detected in RCas and\nRLeo that lasted about a year and caused an increase in the flux density by 1-2\norders of magnitude. The velocity range of the maser emission is < 10 km/s and\nis clearly correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the stars.",

PSP observed an unusual\nvelocity-dispersion signature: particles below $\\sim$1 MeV exhibited a normal\nvelocity dispersion, while higher-energy particles displayed an inverse\nvelocity arrival feature, with the most energetic particles arriving later than\nthose at lower energies. The maximum energy increased from about 20-30 MeV\nupstream to over 60 MeV downstream of the shock.

To understand these\nfeatures, we simulate particle acceleration and transport from the shock to the\nobservers with our newly developed SEP model - Particle ARizona and MIchigan\nSolver on Advected Nodes (PARMISAN). Our results reveal that the inverse\nvelocity arrival and delayed particle onset detected by PSP originate from the\ntime-dependent diffusive shock acceleration processes. After shock passage,\nPSP's magnetic connectivity gradually shifted due to its high velocity near\nperihelion, detecting high-energy SEPs streaming sunward.

Our results with the ANYmal robot demonstrate that we can survey\nplots up to 1 ha plot under 30 min, while also identifying trees with typical\nDBH accuracy of 2cm. The findings of this project are presented as five lessons\nand challenges. Particularly, we discuss the maturity of hardware development,\nstate estimation limitations, open problems in forest navigation, future\navenues for robotic forest inventory, and more general challenges to assess\nautonomous systems.

We argue that in the context of set-based face recognition\n(SFR), burstiness exists widely and degrades the performance in two aspects:\nFirstly, the bursty faces, where faces with particular attributes %exist\nfrequently in a face set, dominate the training instances and dominate the\ntraining face sets and lead to poor generalization ability to unconstrained\nscenarios. Secondly, the bursty faces %dominating the evaluation sets interfere\nwith the similarity comparison in set verification and identification when\nevaluation. To detect the bursty faces in a set, we propose three strategies\nbased on Quickshift++, feature self-similarity, and generalized max-pooling\n(GMP). We apply the burst detection results on training and evaluation stages\nto enhance the sampling ratios or contributions of the infrequent faces. When\nevaluation, we additionally propose the quality-aware GMP that enables\nawareness of the face quality and robustness to the low-quality faces for the\noriginal GMP. We give illustrations and extensive experiments on the SFR\nbenchmarks to demonstrate that burstiness is widespread and suppressing\nburstiness considerably improves the recognition performance.",

In unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs), most research emphasizes visual SLAM, sensor fusion,\nand path planning.

Building upon past\nresearch, it focuses on designing navigation algorithms for unfamiliar and\nhazardous environments, aiming to improve rescue efficiency and safety through\nUAV-based early warning and rapid response.\n  The work unfolds in phases. First, a 2D fusion navigation strategy is\nexplored, initially for mobile robots, enabling safe movement in dynamic\nsettings. This sets the stage for advanced features such as adaptive obstacle\nhandling and decision-making enhancements. Next, a novel 3D reactive navigation\nstrategy is introduced for collision-free movement in forest fire simulations,\naddressing the unique challenges of UAV operations in such scenarios.\n  Finally, the report proposes a unified control approach that integrates UAVs\nand unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for coordinated rescue missions in forest\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "Solving high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with\ndeep learning methods is often computationally and memory intensive, primarily\ndue to the need for automatic differentiation (AD) to compute large Hessian\nmatrices in the PDE. In this work, we propose a deep random difference method\n(DRDM) that addresses these issues by approximating the convection-diffusion\noperator using only first-order differences and the solution by deep neural\nnetworks, thus, avoiding explicit Hessian computation. When incorporated into a\nGalerkin framework, the DRDM eliminates the need for pointwise evaluation of\nexpectations, resulting in efficient implementation. We further extend the\napproach to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Notably, the DRDM recovers\nexisting martingale deep learning methods for PDEs (Cai et al., 2024,\narXiv:2405.03169), without using the tools of stochastic calculus. The proposed\nmethod offers two main advantages: it removes the dependence on AD for PDE\nderivatives and enables parallel computation of the loss function in both time\nand space. We provide rigorous error estimates for the DRDM in the linear case,\nwhich shows a first order accuracy in $\\Delta t$ used in the sampling of the\npaths by the Euler-Maruyama scheme.

Existing radiomic\napproaches use a fixed set of radiomic features (the signature), selected at\nthe population level and applied uniformly to all patients. While\ninterpretable, these signatures are often too constrained to represent\nindividual pathological variations. As a result, conventional radiomic-based\napproaches are found to be limited in performance, compared with recent\nend-to-end deep learning (DL) alternatives without using interpretable radiomic\nfeatures. We argue that the individual-agnostic nature in current radiomic\nselection is not central to its intepretability, but is responsible for the\npoor generalization in our application. Here, we propose a novel radiomic\nfingerprint framework, in which a radiomic feature set (the fingerprint) is\ndynamically constructed for each patient, selected by a DL model. Unlike the\nexisting radiomic signatures, our fingerprints are derived on a per-patient\nbasis by predicting the feature relevance in a large radiomic feature pool, and\nselecting only those that are predictive of clinical conditions for individual\npatients. The radiomic-selecting model is trained simultaneously with a\nlow-dimensional (considered relatively explainable) logistic regression for\ndownstream classification. We validate our methods across multiple diagnostic\ntasks including general knee abnormalities, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)\ntears, and meniscus tears, demonstrating comparable or superior diagnostic\naccuracy relative to state-of-the-art end-to-end DL models.

Our experiments reveal that Transformers can successfully decode\nQR codes, even beyond the theoretical error-correction limit, by learning the\nstructure of embedded texts. They generalize from English-rich training data to\nother languages and even random strings. Moreover, we observe that the\nTransformer-based QR decoder focuses on data bits while ignoring\nerror-correction bits, suggesting a decoding mechanism distinct from standard\nQR code readers.",

However, this learned climbing often converges\nto local optima with plausible but suboptimal generations due to latent space\ncomplexity and suboptimal initialization. While prior efforts often strengthen\nguidance signals or introduce fixed exploration strategies to address this,\nthey exhibit limited capacity to escape steep local maxima.

In each diffusion step, we first identify potential local maxima\nusing a reward model. Upon such detection, we inject noise and revert to a\nprevious, noisier state to escape the current plateau. The reward model then\nevaluates candidate trajectories, accepting only those that offer improvement,\notherwise scheming progressively deeper explorations when nearby alternatives\nfail. This controlled zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward\nrefinement and backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual\nquality in the generated outputs.

To\naddress the registration challenge, most existing methods employ spatial\ntransformations on the HSI to achieve alignment with the MSI. However, due to\nthe substantial differences in spatial resolution of the images, the\nperformance of these methods is often unsatisfactory. Moreover, the\nregistration process tends to be time-consuming when dealing with large-sized\nimages in remote sensing. To address these issues, we propose tackling the\nregistration problem from the spectral domain. Initially, a lightweight\nSpectral Prior Learning (SPL) network is developed to extract spectral features\nfrom the HSI and enhance the spectral resolution of the MSI. Following this,\nthe obtained image undergoes spatial downsampling to produce the registered\nHSI. In this process, subspace representation and cyclic training strategy are\nemployed to improve spectral accuracy of the registered HSI obtained. Next, we\npropose a blind sparse fusion (BSF) method, which utilizes group sparsity\nregularization to equivalently promote the low-rankness of the image. This\napproach not only circumvents the need for rank estimation, but also reduces\ncomputational complexity. Then, we employ the Proximal Alternating Optimization\n(PAO) algorithm to solve the BSF model, and present its convergence analysis.\nFinally, extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets are\nconducted to verify the effectiveness of our method in registration and fusion.\nWe also demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing classification performance.",

Furthermore,\nsequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:\nquadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these\nlimitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less\nreliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce\nEcho State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves\nthis challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.\nEST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from\nReservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.\nDrawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of\nthe Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module\ncalled ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent\nnetworks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory\nunits with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical\nreservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the\nEST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By\nmaintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST\nachieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively\nbreaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on\nthe STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,\ndemonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of\nthese tasks.

In LDP, many protocols rely on hash\nfunctions to implement user-side encoding and perturbation. However, the\nsecurity and privacy implications of hash function selection have not been\npreviously investigated. In this paper, we expose that the hash functions may\nact as a source of unfairness in LDP protocols. We show that although users\noperate under the same protocol and privacy budget, differences in hash\nfunctions can lead to significant disparities in vulnerability to inference and\npoisoning attacks. To mitigate hash-induced unfairness, we propose Fair-OLH\n(F-OLH), a variant of OLH that enforces an entropy-based fairness constraint on\nhash function selection.

Our approach\ncombines a speaker-independent (SI) model for standard operation with a\nspeaker-conditioned (SC) model selectively applied in overlapping scenarios.\nOverlap detection is achieved using a compact binary classifier trained on\nfrozen SI model output, offering accurate segmentation at negligible cost. The\nSC model employs Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to incorporate speaker\nembeddings and is trained on synthetically mixed data to transcribe only the\ntarget speaker. Our method supports dynamic speaker tracking and reuses\nexisting modules with minimal modifications. Evaluated on a challenging set of\nCzech television debates with 16% overlap, the system reduced WER on\noverlapping segments from 68.0% (baseline) to 35.78% while increasing total\ncomputational load by only 44%.

In this architecture, conventional digital fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) processors are replaced by two\nlinear-chirp phasers with opposite group delay dispersions, respectively.\nTheoretical analysis demonstrates that, under specific phaser conditions, the\nOFDM signal generated by the RTFT-based analog system is mathematically\nequivalent to that of a conventional digital OFDM system. This equivalence is\nfurther supported by simulation results, which confirm accurate symbol\ntransmission and recovery, as well as robustness to multipath fading when a\nprefix is applied.

However,\nexisting methods often overlook the shared information across clusters, which\nrepresents the generalizable knowledge valuable to all participants in the\nFederated Learning (FL) system. To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces a novel FL framework that distills a universal expert model from the\nknowledge of multiple clusters. This universal expert captures globally shared\ninformation across all clients and is subsequently distributed to each client\nas the initialization for the next round of model training. The proposed FL\nframework operates in three iterative steps: (1) local model training at each\nclient, (2) cluster-specific model aggregation, and (3) universal expert\ndistillation. This three-step learning paradigm ensures the preservation of\nfine-grained non-IID characteristics while effectively incorporating shared\nknowledge across clusters. Compared to traditional gradient-based aggregation\nmethods, the distillation-based model aggregation introduces greater\nflexibility in handling model heterogeneity and reduces conflicts among\ncluster-specific experts.

    "abstract": "Droplet interactions with solid surfaces are fundamental to natural phenomena\nand hold significant commercial relevance across diverse applications. While\nthe impingement dynamics of conventional aqueous droplets on solid substrates\nare well-characterized, the behavior of non-aqueous droplets, particularly\nthose influenced by external force fields like electric or magnetic fields,\nremains a less explored domain. This study addresses this gap by investigating\nthe impact of a magnetic field on the impingement dynamics of ferrofluid\ndroplets on a heated solid surface. Ferrofluids are unique colloidal\nsuspensions of magnetic nanoparticles within a non-magnetic carrier fluid,\nenabling external manipulation of their dynamic properties through magnetic\nforces. The application of a magnetic field introduces an attractive force\nwithin the ferrofluid, fundamentally altering the droplet's spreading behavior\nand, consequently, its transport characteristics upon impact. Our findings\nreveal a substantial increase in both the maximum spreading diameter and the\ncontact time between the droplet and the substrate, directly leading to\nenhanced thermal transport efficiency. Furthermore, the magnetic force\neffectively suppresses droplet bounce-off from hydrophobic surfaces. These\ncritical parameters can be precisely controlled by adjusting the strength of\nthe induced magnetic force. Such interactions can be used in the design of\nthermal switches and thermal management systems. The multi-physics interactions\nof magnetic fields, fluid flow, interface tracking, and heat transfer within\nthe multiphase system are computationally modelled to examine the effect of\nWeber number and contact angle on maximum spreading and associated heat\ntransfer characteristics.",

    "abstract": "When irradiation is performed with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a different\nshape of cells in suspension or adherent to walls may result in different\nprobability of cell survival. In a recent study, differences of up to a factor\nof 2 were found between the predicted survival of floating and adherent cells.\nThe present work aims to quantify the biases introduced by the simulation setup\nand the use of voxelized geometry in conjunction with the local effect model\nfor cell survival. The results show that simulated irradiation of a cell near\nthe surface with an incident beam matched to the cell dimensions results in\ndose values that are by a factor of about 50 lower than the dose to cells\ndeeper in the medium when irradiated with a Co-60 spectrum and lateral beam\ndimensions in the centimeter range. Furthermore, the number of ionizing photon\ninteractions in gold nanoparticles in a cell near the surface is lower by a\nfactor of about 2 than for cells at 5 mm and 1 cm depth. Using the average dose\nin voxels of size in the order of 200 nm for assessing cell survival with the\nlocal effect model (LEM) leads to an underestimation of the number of lesions\nfrom a single ionized AuNP by roughly two orders of magnitude and thus to an\noverestimation of cell survival. The effect of cell geometry on the survival\nrate was examined for approximate cell geometries and 100 kV x-ray irradiation,\nfor which the probability of photon interaction in gold nanoparticles is by\nmore than two orders of magnitude higher than for Co-60 irradiation. The\nresults show that the effects are negligible for 5 nm nanoparticles at the\nconcentration of AuNPs considered in preceding work. For 50 nm nanoparticles\nand thus a thousand times higher mass fraction of gold, significant reduction\nin cell survival is found, with a clear additional reduction predicted by the\nLEM as compared to the prediction based on mean dose to the nucleus.",

This\nresearch evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting\nmiscommunications in robot dialogue. Using a multi-modal dataset of 240\nhuman-robot conversations, where four distinct types of conversational failures\nwere systematically introduced, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art\ncomputer vision models. After each conversational turn, users provided feedback\non whether they perceived an error, enabling an analysis of the models' ability\nto accurately detect robot mistakes. Despite using state-of-the-art models, the\nperformance barely exceeds random chance in identifying miscommunication, while\non a dataset with more expressive emotional content, they successfully\nidentified confused states. To explore the underlying cause, we asked human\nraters to do the same. They could also only identify around half of the induced\nmiscommunications, similarly to our model. These results uncover a fundamental\nlimitation in identifying robot miscommunications in dialogue: even when users\nperceive the induced miscommunication as such, they often do not communicate\nthis to their robotic conversation partner. This knowledge can shape\nexpectations of the performance of computer vision models and can help\nresearchers to design better human-robot conversations by deliberately\neliciting feedback where needed.",

    "abstract": "In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing\nmodels for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with\ndifferent random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises\nwhen these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for\nwhich ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.\nProviding recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under\nMM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,\nthe CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of\nproviding recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We\npropose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be\nconsidered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and\nrecourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six\ndesirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose\na novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs\nunder MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to\nexplicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding\nprediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to\nresolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is\nparametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the\nspecification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further\ncustomisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we\ncharacterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different\nargumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of\nour method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)",

    "abstract": "Gradient descent-ascent (GDA) flows play a central role in finding saddle\npoints of bivariate functionals, with applications in optimization, game\ntheory, and robust control. While they are well-understood in Hilbert and\nBanach spaces via maximal monotone operator theory, their extension to general\nmetric spaces, particularly Wasserstein spaces, has remained largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory of GDA flows on the\nproduct of two complete metric spaces, formulating them as solutions to a\nsystem of evolution variational inequalities (EVIs) driven by a proper, closed\nfunctional $\\phi$. Under mild convex-concave and regularity assumptions on\n$\\phi$, we prove the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the flows via a\nnovel minimizing-maximizing movement scheme and a minimax theorem on metric\nspaces. We establish a $\\lambda$-contraction property, derive a quantitative\nerror estimate for the discrete scheme, and demonstrate regularization effects\nanalogous to classical gradient flows. Moreover, we obtain an exponential decay\nbound for the Nikaid\\^o--Isoda duality gap along the flow. Focusing on\nWasserstein spaces over Hilbert spaces, we show the global existence in time\nand the exponential convergence of the Wasserstein GDA flow to the unique\nsaddle point for strongly convex-concave functionals.

While recent\nsurgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer\npromising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by\ndomain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To\naddress this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight\nframework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation\nmodels to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages\nfew-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with\ninstitution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal\nconsistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived\nfrom institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time\nadaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase\nprediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a\nself-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution\nshifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to\nrapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural\nlanguage text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a\ntask graph defining phase transitions. The experimental results show that the\nSPA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot surgical phase\nrecognition across multiple institutions and procedures, even outperforming\nfull-shot models with 32-shot labeled data.

Although the combined imposition of material incompressibility and\nboundary inextensibility theoretically prevents any deformation of the disc, it\nis shown that the problem still admits non-trivial solutions. This apparent\nparadox is resolved by recognizing the approximations inherent in the\nlinearized theory, as confirmed by a geometrically nonlinear numerical\nanalysis. Nonetheless, the linear solution retains significance: it may\nrepresent a valid stress distribution within a rigid system and can identify\ncritical conditions of interest for design applications.",

To address the challenge of bridging\ngaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE)\ndiscovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from\nmicro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining\nparticle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary\nexperiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a differentially private algorithm for publishing\nmatrices aggregated from sparse vectors. These matrices include social network\nadjacency matrices, user-item interaction matrices in recommendation systems,\nand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA data. Traditionally,\ndifferential privacy in vector collection relies on randomized response, but\nthis approach incurs high communication costs. Specifically, for a matrix with\n$N$ users, $n$ columns, and $m$ nonzero elements, conventional methods require\n$\\Omega(n \\times N)$ communication, making them impractical for large-scale\ndata. Our algorithm significantly reduces this cost to $O(\\varepsilon m)$,\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the privacy budget. Notably, this is even lower than the\nnon-private case, which requires $\\Omega(m \\log n)$ communication. Moreover, as\nthe privacy budget decreases, communication cost further reduces, enabling\nbetter privacy with improved efficiency. We theoretically prove that our method\nyields results identical to those of randomized response, and experimental\nevaluations confirm its effectiveness in terms of accuracy, communication\nefficiency, and computational complexity.",

Decades of algorithmic refinement have brought considerable\nimprovements, and led to a variety of employed solutions. These often feature\nan underlying, common structure that is rarely acknowledged or investigated. In\nthis paper, we present a unifying perspective on sparse-view tomographic\nreconstructions for plasma imaging, highlighting how many inversion approaches\nreported in the literature can be naturally understood within a Bayesian\nframework. In this setting, statistical modelling of acquired data leads to a\nlikelihood term, while the assumed properties of the profile to be\nreconstructed are encoded within a prior term. Together, these terms yield the\nposterior distribution, which models all the available information on the\nprofile to be reconstructed. We show how credible reconstructions, uncertainty\nquantification and further statistical quantities of interest can be\nefficiently obtained from noisy tomographic data by means of a stochastic\ngradient flow algorithm targeting the posterior. This is demonstrated by\napplication to soft x-ray imaging at the TCV tokamak. We validate the proposed\nimaging pipeline on a large dataset of generated model phantoms, showing how\nposterior-based inference can be leveraged to perform principled statistical\nanalysis of quantities of interest.

As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model\nBoltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with\nnear-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of\ngas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of\nmagnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the\nnear-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip\ncoefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer\ncorrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems\n(i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and\ninhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the\nslip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform\ntemperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are\nvalidated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the\nsame problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on\nthe plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall\npotential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall\npotential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to\nthermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.",

Sulphur bearing molecules, such as H2S, are sensitive to\nthe physical and chemical environments in which they reside and are potential\ntracers of shocked, dense gas in galactic outflows and active galactic nuclei\n(AGN). We aim to investigate the origin of H2S emission and its relation to\ndense gas and outflow activity in the central regions of nearby infrared\nluminous galaxies. We present ALMA Band 5 observations of the ortho H2S 1(1,0)\n1(0,1) transition in three nearby galaxies: NGC 1377, NGC 4418, and NGC 1266.\nWe perform radiative transfer modelling using RADEX to constrain the physical\nconditions of the H2S emitting gas and compare the results to ancillary CO and\ncontinuum data. We detect compact H2S emission in all three galaxies, arising\nfrom regions smaller than approximately 150 parsecs. The H2S spectral profiles\nexhibit broad line wings, suggesting an association with outflowing or shocked\ngas. In NGC 4418, H2S also appears to be tracing gas that is counterrotating. A\npeculiar red shifted emission feature may correspond to inflowing gas, or\npossibly a slanted outflow. RADEX modelling indicates that the H2S emitting gas\nhas high densities (molecular hydrogen density greater than 10^7 cm^-3) and\nmoderately warm temperatures (between 40 and 200 Kelvin). The derived densities\nexceed those inferred from CO observations, implying that H2S traces denser\nregions of the interstellar medium.",

We suppose that, at the\nbeginning of the process, there is some initial additive bias towards some\nplurality opinion, that is, there is an opinion that is supported by $x$ nodes\nwhile any other opinion is supported by strictly fewer nodes. We prove that,\nwith high probability, if the bias is $\\omega(\\sqrt{x})$ and the initial\nplurality opinion is supported by at least $x = \\omega(\\log n)$ nodes, then the\nprocess converges to plurality consensus in $O(\\log n)$ rounds whenever $h =\n\\omega(n \\log n / x)$. A main corollary is the following: if $k = o(n / \\log\nn)$ and the process starts from an almost-balanced configuration with an\ninitial bias of magnitude $\\omega(\\sqrt{n/k})$ towards the initial plurality\nopinion, then any function $h = \\omega(k \\log n)$ suffices to guarantee\nconvergence to consensus in $O(\\log n)$ rounds, with high probability. Our\nupper bound shows that the lower bound of $\\Omega(k / h^2)$ rounds to reach\nconsensus given by Becchetti et al. (2017) cannot be pushed further than\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}(k / h)$. Moreover, the bias we require is asymptotically\nsmaller than the $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n\\log n})$ bias that guarantees plurality\nconsensus in the $3$-majority dynamics: in our case, the required bias is at\nmost any (arbitrarily small) function in $\\omega(\\sqrt{x})$ for any value of $k\n\\ge 2$.",

    "abstract": "Network design problems have been studied from the 1950s, as they can be used\nin a wide range of real-world applications, e.g., design of communication and\ntransportation networks. In classical network design problems, the objective is\nto minimize the cost of routing the demand flow through a graph. In this paper,\nwe introduce a generalized version of such a problem, where the objective is to\ntradeoff routing costs and delivery speed; we introduce the concept of\nspeed-coverage, which is defined as the number of unique items that can be sent\nto destinations in less than 1-day. Speed-coverage is a function of both the\nnetwork design and the inventory stored at origin nodes, e.g., an item can be\ndelivered in 1-day if it is in-stock at an origin that can reach a destination\nwithin 24 hours. Modeling inventory is inherently complex, since inventory\ncoverage is described by an integer function with a large number of points\n(exponential to the number of origin sites), each one to be evaluated using\nhistorical data. To bypass this complexity, we first leverage a parametric\noptimization approach, which converts the non-linear joint routing and\nspeed-coverage optimization problem into an equivalent mixed-integer linear\nprogram. Then, we propose a sampling strategy to avoid evaluating all the\npoints of the speed-coverage function. The proposed method is evaluated on a\nseries of numerical tests with representative scenarios and network sizes. We\nshow that when considering the routing costs and monetary gains resulting from\nspeed-coverage, our approach outperforms the baseline by 8.36% on average.",

Moreover, the\nalignment of our visual tokens with textual semantics enables seamless\nintegration with pretrained diffusion decoders, supporting high-quality visual\nsynthesis with minimal adaptation.

While XMM-Newton and NuSTAR X-ray light curves exhibit the\ncharacteristic high- and low-mode bimodality, the source faintness prevents\nfirm evidence for similar bimodality in the ultraviolet and near-infrared light\ncurves, presented here for the first time. A re-analysis of archival\nXMM-Newton/OM data reveals an optical flare without an X-ray counterpart,\nlikely originating from the outer accretion disk or the companion star. During\nour observations, no radio emission was detected, with a 3$\\sigma$ flux density\nupper limit of 8 $\\mu$Jy at 6 GHz. While past works have already reported radio\nvariability in the source, this limit is a factor of 3.5 below the average\nvalue measured in 2019 in similar conditions, underscoring significant radio\nvariability despite the relatively stable X-ray flux. Simultaneous optical\nlight curves in five filters with GTC/HiPERCAM revealed flickering and dipping\nactivities that resemble the observed X-ray variability, along with a reddening\ntrend at lower fluxes. The latter is consistent with discrete mass ejections\nthat disrupt the inner flow and reduce both X-ray and optical fluxes, thereby\ndriving the high-to-low-mode switches. This suggests a common origin for most\noptical and X-ray emission at the boundary region between the pulsar wind and\nthe inner disk, as also supported by our modelling of the spectral energy\ndistribution in the high mode. Overall, our findings reinforce the mini-pulsar\nnebula picture for tMSPs in the sub-luminous state and demonstrate how\ncoordinated, high-time resolution, multi-wavelength campaigns are essential to\nprobe the processes governing rapid mode switches in these systems.",

Notably, nine out of the thirty-six sources are situated\nnear the centers of galaxy clusters, including one with giant radio jets that\nextend over 811 kpc. Our analysis reveals that the majority of HyMoRSs are\nhigh-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs), hosted by actively star-forming\ngalaxies that exhibit elevated star formation rates.

    "abstract": "Segmenting muscle compartments and measuring their architecture can\nfacilitate movement function assessment, accurate musculoskeletal modeling, and\nsynergy-based electromyogram simulation. Here, we presented a novel method for\nvolumetric segmentation of muscle compartments using in vivo imaging, focusing\non the independent compartments for finger control of flexor digitorum\nsuperficialis (FDS). Besides, we measured the architectural properties of FDS\ncompartments and validated the segmentation. Specifically, ultrasound and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 10 healthy subjects were used for\nsegmentation and measurement, while electromyography was utilized for\nvalidation. A two-step piecewise segmentation was proposed, first annotating\ncompartment regions in the cross-sectional ultrasound image based on\ncompartment movement, and then performing minimum energy matching to register\nthe ultrasound data to the three-dimensional MRI coordinate system.\nAdditionally, the architectural properties were measured in the compartment\nmasks from the segmentation using MRI tractography. Anatomical correctness was\nverified by comparing known anatomy with reconstructed fiber tracts and\nmeasured properties, while segmentation accuracy was quantified as the\npercentage of finger electromyogram centers falling within their corresponding\ncompartments. Results demonstrated agreement for the fiber orientation between\nthe tractography and cadaveric photographs. Significant differences in\narchitectural properties (P < 0.001) were observed between compartments. The\nproperties of FDS and its compartments were within the physiological ranges (P\n< 0.01). 95% (38/40) of the electromyogram centers were located within\nrespective compartments, with 2 errors occurring in the index and little\nfingers. The validated segmentation method and derived architectural properties\nmay advance biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Biocatalysis is an emerging field that provides an environmentally friendly\nalternative to conventional catalysis, but still it faces some challenges. One\nof the major difficulties for biocatalysts that require reactive species like\nH2O2 as co-substrates lies in the concentration of these reactive species. On\nthe one hand, they are used as reactants, but on the other hand, they\ninactivate the enzymes at high concentrations. When utilizing non-thermal\nplasma to deliver H2O2 for biocatalysis, it is essential to understand the\npotential interactions between plasma-generated species (PGS) and enzymes. This\nis particularly important because, alongside \\ch{H2O2}, other reactive species\nsuch as hydroxyl radicals, atomic oxygen, superoxide, and nitric oxide are also\nproduced. The investigation of the localized reactivity of the solvent\naccessible surface area (SASA) of an enzyme, with certain species, is an\nimportant tool for predicting these interactions. In combination with reactive\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations this enabled us to identify amino acid\nresidues that are likely targets for modifications by the PGS. A subset of the\ntheoretical predictions made in the present study were confirmed experimentally\nby mass spectrometry, underlining the utility of the SASA and MD based\nscreening approach to direct time-consuming experiments and assist their\ninterpretation.",

    "abstract": "Affective priming exemplifies the challenge of ambiguity in affective\ncomputing. While the community has largely addressed this issue from a\nlabel-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by\nthe priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in\nphysiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead\nto misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the\nAffective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points\ninfluenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point,\nquantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this\nmethod, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient\ntransitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train\nmodels with the same configuration using both the original data and\npriming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced\nwhen using priming-free sequences compared to the original data. This work\ncontributes to the broader challenge of ambiguity by identifying and mitigating\npriming effects at the data level, enhancing model robustness, and offering\nvaluable insights for the design and collection of affective computing\ndatasets.",

In this paper, we propose a hybrid rendering\nframework that combines rasterization and ray tracing to achieve efficient and\nhigh-fidelity clipping of Gaussian Splatting data. At the core of our method is\nthe RaRa strategy, which first leverages rasterization to quickly identify\nGaussians intersected by the clipping plane, followed by ray tracing to compute\nattenuation weights based on their partial occlusion. These weights are then\nused to accurately estimate each Gaussian's contribution to the final image,\nenabling smooth and continuous clipping effects. We validate our approach on\ndiverse datasets, including general Gaussians, hair strand Gaussians, and\nmulti-layer Gaussians, and conduct user studies to evaluate both perceptual\nquality and quantitative performance.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has gained widespread adoption across\nvarious applications. Among PEFT techniques, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its\nextensions have emerged as particularly effective, allowing efficient model\nadaptation while significantly reducing computational overhead. However,\nexisting approaches typically rely on global low-rank factorizations, which\noverlook local or multi-scale structure, failing to capture complex patterns in\nthe weight updates. To address this, we propose WaRA, a novel PEFT method that\nleverages wavelet transforms to decompose the weight update matrix into a\nmulti-resolution representation. By performing low-rank factorization in the\nwavelet domain and reconstructing updates through an inverse transform, WaRA\nobtains compressed adaptation parameters that harness multi-resolution\nanalysis, enabling it to capture both coarse and fine-grained features while\nproviding greater flexibility and sparser representations than standard LoRA.\nThrough comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that WaRA\nperforms superior on diverse vision tasks, including image generation,\nclassification, and semantic segmentation, significantly enhancing generated\nimage quality while reducing computational complexity. Although WaRA was\nprimarily designed for vision tasks, we further showcase its effectiveness in\nlanguage tasks, highlighting its broader applicability and generalizability.\nThe code is publicly available at\n\\href{GitHub}{https://github.com/moeinheidari7829/WaRA}.",

In this work, we employ a YourTTS-based TTS system to compare\nthree different speaker encoders - YourTTS's original H/ASP encoder, x-vector\nembeddings, and ECAPA-TDNN embeddings - within an otherwise fixed zero-shot TTS\nframework. All models were trained on the same dataset of Czech read speech and\nevaluated on 24 out-of-domain target speakers using both subjective and\nobjective methods.

In this paper, we present LeoAM, the\nfirst efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single\ncommodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system\nemploys an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into\nvariable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights\nacross different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission\noverheads.

We propose a new gradient-based MCIS scheme for rare event\nestimation, called affine invariant interacting Langevin dynamics for\nimportance sampling~(ALDI-IS), in which the affine invariant interacting\nLangevin dynamics~(ALDI) is used to sample particles according to the smoothed\nzero-variance density.

Furthermore, by comparing the nominal\nanomalous Nernst coefficient under different wavelength excitations, we observe\na clear enhancement in the mid-infrared region, originating from the\ntopological contribution from the large Berry curvature of Weyl bands. Our\nresults reveal the interplay among light, magnetism, and topological order in\nmagnetic Weyl semimetals, which not only offers insights for fundamental\nphysics but also advances potential applications in quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based pansharpening has been shown to effectively generate\nhigh-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. To create supervised ground-truth\nHRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly\nemployed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial\nlow-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However,\nwell-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between\nreduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into\nthe Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world\ndegradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module\n(PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and\nPDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying\non predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds\nhigh-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM\nmodules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process\nlearning. These innovations enable effective integration of high-resolution\npanchromatic and multispectral images, significantly enhancing spatial\nsharpness and quality. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the\nproposed method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show\npromise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit\nvisual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety\nviolations despite understanding textual rules.

Previous work adopts\nthe split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of\nadmissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often\ncontain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address\nthis, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that\ncalibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer\nper question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical\nerror rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as\nClopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error\nrate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty\nthreshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing\nsample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong\ntest-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency\nunder limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text\ngeneration tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound\nconstructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance,\nwhich underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced\ndocument understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,\nexisting models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world\nscenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the\ncurrent response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation\nand ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned\nvisual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently\nresults in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise\nanswer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and\nproblem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR\nhallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test\nsamples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world\ndegradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'\ncapacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and\nanswer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding\nhallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and\nthereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based\nframework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness\nof visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer\nto increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement\nlearning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous\nregions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model\nachieves a 22\\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o\non KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks,\nhighlighting both effectiveness and robustness.",

Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for\nembedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder\nfor patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language\nmodel embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to\ntask-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular\narchitecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling\nefficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent\nimprovements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets\nconfirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.",

However, recent studies have shown that these models are prone to\ngenerating vulnerable or even malicious code under adversarial settings.\nExisting red-teaming approaches rely on extensive human effort, limiting their\nscalability and practicality, and generally overlook the interactive nature of\nreal-world AI-assisted programming, which often unfolds over multiple turns. To\nbridge these gaps, we present RedCoder, a red-teaming agent that engages victim\nmodels in multi-turn conversation to elicit vulnerable code. The pipeline to\nconstruct RedCoder begins with a multi-agent gaming process that simulates\nadversarial interactions, yielding a set of prototype conversations and an\narsenal of reusable attack strategies. We then fine-tune an LLM on these\nprototype conversations to serve as the backbone of RedCoder. Once deployed,\nRedCoder autonomously engages Code LLMs in multi-turn conversations,\ndynamically retrieving relevant strategies from the arsenal to steer the\ndialogue toward vulnerability-inducing outputs. Experiments across multiple\nCode LLMs show that our approach outperforms prior single-turn and multi-turn\nred-team methods in inducing vulnerabilities in code generation, offering a\nscalable and effective tool for evaluating the security boundaries of modern\ncode-generation systems.",

In this study, we propose a novel\nstrategy for enlarging amplitude death (AD) regime to enhance flutter\nsuppression in two coupled identical airfoils with structural nonlinearity.\nSpecifically, we introduce an intermittent mixed coupling strategy, i.e., a\nlinear combination of intermittent instantaneous coupling and intermittent\ntime-delayed coupling between two airfoils. Numerical simulations are performed\nto reveal the influence mechanisms of different coupling scenarios on the\ndynamical behaviors of the coupled airfoil systems. The obtained results\nindicate that the coupled airfoil systems experience the expected AD behaviors\nwithin a certain range of the coupling strength and time-delayed parameters.\nThe continuous mixed coupling favors the onset of AD over a larger parameter\nset of coupling strength than the continuous purely time-delayed coupling.\nMoreover, the presence of intermittent interactions can lead to a further\nenlargement of the AD regions, that is, flutter suppression enhancement. Our\nfindings support the structural design and optimization of an aircraft wing for\nmitigating the unwanted aeroelastic instability behaviors.",

The\nautomatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria\nfrom a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each\npruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of\nthe training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the\nnetwork is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of\nfloating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in\nthe network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual\nallocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on\nthe VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, removing\nundesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality\nremains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive\nModel (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept\nerasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation\n(WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and\nThresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the\ntarget concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark,\nErase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more\nrigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR\nmodels. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of\ntarget-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from\nthese prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to\nensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted\non the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR\nachieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility\npreservation.

Current advances in doping, heterojunction\nformation and composite engineering that enhances its catalytic and electronic\nperformance has been summarized. The article also presents future research\ndirections to unlock the full potential of graphitic carbon nitride as a useful\nmaterial in sustainable and intelligent systems.",

    "abstract": "A growing trend in the database and system communities is to augment\nconventional index structures, such as B+-trees, with machine learning (ML)\nmodels. Among these, error-bounded Piecewise Linear Approximation\n($\\epsilon$-PLA) has emerged as a popular choice due to its simplicity and\neffectiveness. Despite its central role in many learned indexes, the design and\nanalysis of $\\epsilon$-PLA fitting algorithms remain underexplored. In this\npaper, we revisit $\\epsilon$-PLA from both theoretical and empirical\nperspectives, with a focus on its application in learned index structures. We\nfirst establish a fundamentally improved lower bound of $\\Omega(\\kappa \\cdot\n\\epsilon^2)$ on the expected segment coverage for existing $\\epsilon$-PLA\nfitting algorithms, where $\\kappa$ is a data-dependent constant. We then\npresent a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art $\\epsilon$-PLA algorithms\nwhen used in different learned data structures. Our results highlight key\ntrade-offs among model accuracy, model size, and query performance, providing\nactionable guidelines for the principled design of future learned data\nstructures.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the flame macrostructures observed during self-sustained\nthermoacoustic oscillations in a model can combustor featuring a novel\ncounter-rotating swirler. The swirler is designed to achieve high shear,\ndistributing 60% of the airflow through the primary passage and 40% through the\nsecondary passage, with radial fuel injection introduced via a central lance.\nTo examine the influence of flame macrostructures on combustion instabilities,\nthe flow expansion angles at the combustor's dump plane are systematically\nvaried. In the present study, we consider three different flare angles\ncomprising $90^\\circ$, $60^\\circ$, and $40^\\circ$ for Reynolds numbers and\nthermal powers ranging from 10500-16800 and $10-16.2$ kW, respectively.\nAcoustic pressure, high-speed stereo PIV, and high-speed OH$^*$\nchemiluminescence measurements are conducted to scrutinize flow and flame\nmacrostructures during combustion instability. Large-amplitude acoustic\noscillations are observed for a flare angle of $40^\\circ$, accompanied by\nshorter flames and wider central recirculation zones. In contrast, a flare\nangle of $90^\\circ$ results in low-amplitude acoustic oscillations\ncharacterized by longer flames and narrower central recirculation zones. The\nphase-averaged Rayleigh index is utilized to pinpoint regions that drive or\ndampen thermoacoustic instability, enabling the identification of potential\nstrategies for its mitigation. Additionally, time-series analysis is employed\nto reveal the dominant acoustic modes and their interaction with heat release\nrate fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that discrete quantum walks, when extended to\nquantum cellular automata (QCA), can, in the continuum limit, reproduce\nrelativistic wave equations and quantum field theories (QFTs), including free\nquantum electrodynamics (QED). This QCA/QFT correspondence bridges quantum\ninformation processing and high-energy physics, raising fundamental questions\nabout the nature of spacetime: whether it is the continuum QFT or the discrete\nQCA that is fundamental. For while Lorentz invariance appears robust\nexperimentally, it may only approximate a deeper discrete structure,\nparticularly at Planck-scale energies. This high-energy Lorentz violation is\npotentially observable either through cumulative effects over cosmic distances\nor via small deviations at accessible energies. In this paper, we analyze the\nQCA corresponding to QED and show that it implies both a deviation from the\nspeed of light and spatial anisotropies. Using current experimental and\nastrophysical constraints, we place upper bounds on the QCA lattice spacing,\nproviding insight into the plausibility of a fundamentally discrete spacetime.",

    "abstract": "Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have shown remarkable potential due to their\ncapability of representing complex functions within exponentially large Hilbert\nspaces. However, their application to multivariate regression tasks has been\nlimited, primarily due to inherent constraints of traditional approaches that\nrely on Pauli expectation values. In this work, we introduce a novel and simple\npost-processing method utilizing log-ratio probabilities (LRPs) of quantum\nstates, enabling efficient and unbounded multivariate regression within\nexisting QNN architectures. Our approach exponentially expands the number of\nregression outputs relative to qubit count, thus significantly improving\nparameter and qubit efficiency. Additionally, by enhancing parameter\ndependencies in the cost function and leveraging gradient pumping effects from\nthe log-ratio transformation, our method mitigates the well-known barren\nplateau phenomenon, thereby stabilizing training. We further demonstrate that\nthis approach facilitates robust uncertainty quantification, capturing both\nepistemic and aleatoric uncertainties simultaneously. Our findings underscore\nthe practical potential of LRP-QNNs for complex multi-output regression tasks,\nparticularly within current resource-constrained quantum hardware environments.",

We introduce a position texture to subdivide\nthe Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) body model's surface and grow the human\npoint cloud. To capture fine details of human dynamics and deformations, we\nincorporate a convolutional neural network structure to predict human body\npoint cloud features based on texture.

This approach ensures high-quality human\nreconstruction and reduces GPU resource consumption during training. As a\nresult, our method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art HUGS in\nreconstruction metrics while maintaining the ability to generalize to novel\nposes and views. Furthermore, our technique achieves real-time rendering at\nover 100 FPS, $\\sim$6$\\times$ the HUGS speed using only Linear Blend Skinning\n(LBS) weights for human transformation.

    "abstract": "RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is\ncrucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information.\nHowever, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects\nsuch as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and\ninformational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation\nmethods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for\ncapturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with\nintermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized\njudge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we\npropose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five\nmetrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot,\nend-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance\n(QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall\n(IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the\nchallenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively\ndiscriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the\nMistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of\nCCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant\nvalidity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared\nto the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior\ndiscriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being\nsignificantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical,\ncomprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving\nRAG systems.",

    "abstract": "Tree ensembles are non-parametric methods widely recognized for their\naccuracy and ability to capture complex interactions. While these models excel\nat prediction, they are difficult to interpret and may fail to uncover useful\nrelationships in the data. We propose an estimator to extract compact sets of\ndecision rules from tree ensembles. The extracted models are accurate and can\nbe manually examined to reveal relationships between the predictors and the\nresponse. A key novelty of our estimator is the flexibility to jointly control\nthe number of rules extracted and the interaction depth of each rule, which\nimproves accuracy. We develop a tailored exact algorithm to efficiently solve\noptimization problems underlying our estimator and an approximate algorithm for\ncomputing regularization paths, sequences of solutions that correspond to\nvarying model sizes. We also establish novel non-asymptotic prediction error\nbounds for our proposed approach, comparing it to an oracle that chooses the\nbest data-dependent linear combination of the rules in the ensemble subject to\nthe same complexity constraint as our estimator. The bounds illustrate that the\nlarge-sample predictive performance of our estimator is on par with that of the\noracle. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our estimator outperforms\nexisting algorithms for rule extraction.",

Purpose: To assess whether a three-pass LLM framework enhances PPV\nand reduces operational costs compared with baseline approaches. Materials and\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology\nreports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III\ndatabase. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.\nThree LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor\nplus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.\nPrecision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).\nEfficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer\nremuneration. Statistical significance was tested using cluster bootstrap,\nexact McNemar tests, and Holm-Bonferroni correction. Results: Framework PPV\nincreased from 0.063 (95% CI, 0.036-0.101, Framework 1) to 0.079 (0.049-0.118,\nFramework 2), and significantly to 0.159 (0.090-0.252, Framework 3; P<.001 vs.\nbaselines). aTPR remained stable (0.012-0.014; P>=.84). Operational costs per\n1,000 reports dropped to USD 5.58 (Framework 3) from USD 9.72 (Framework 1) and\nUSD 6.85 (Framework 2), reflecting reductions of 42.6% and 18.5%, respectively.\nHuman-reviewed reports decreased from 192 to 88. External validation supported\nFramework 3's superior PPV (CheXpert 0.133, Open-i 0.105) and stable aTPR\n(0.007). Conclusion: A three-pass LLM framework significantly enhanced PPV and\nreduced operational costs, maintaining detection performance, providing an\neffective strategy for AI-assisted radiology report quality assurance.",

However, the assumption of source code is\ncontrary to typical binary scenarios where only the binary is available. In\nthis work, we investigate an approach with minimal assumptions and a sound\napproach to disassembly error evaluation that does not require source code. Any\nsource code does not address the fundamental problem of binary disassembly and\nfails when only the binary exists. As far as we know, this is the first work to\nevaluate disassembly errors using only the binary. We propose TraceBin, which\nuses dynamic execution to find disassembly errors. TraceBin targets the use\ncase where the disassembly is used in an automated fashion for security tasks\non a target binary, such as static binary instrumentation, binary hardening,\nautomated code repair, and so on, which may be affected by disassembly errors.\nDiscovering disassembly errors in the target binary aids in reducing problems\ncaused by such errors. Furthermore, we are not aware of existing approaches\nthat can evaluate errors given only a target binary, as they require source\ncode. Our evaluation shows TraceBin finds: (i) errors consistent with existing\nstudies even without source; (ii) disassembly errors due to control flow; (iii)\nnew interesting errors; (iv) errors in non-C/C++ binaries; (v) errors in\nclosed-source binaries; and (vi) show that disassembly errors can have\nsignificant security implications.

Using annual gross provincial product\n(GPP) per capita data from 1982 to 2022 and high-resolution reanalysis weather\ndata, I estimate fixed-effects panel regressions that isolate plausibly\nexogenous within-province year-to-year variation in temperature. The results\nindicate a statistically significant inverted-U relationship between\ntemperature and annual growth in GPP per capita, with adverse effects\nconcentrated in the agricultural sector. Industrial and service outputs appear\ninsensitive to short-term weather variation. Distributed lag models suggest\nthat temperature shocks have persistent effects on growth trajectories,\nparticularly in lower-income provinces with higher average temperatures. I\ncombine these estimates with climate projections under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5\nemission scenarios to evaluate province-level economic impacts through 2090.\nWithout adjustments for biases in climate projections or lagged temperature\neffects, climate change is projected to reduce per capita output for 63-86% of\nThai population, with median GDP per capita impacts ranging from -4% to +56%\nfor RCP4.5 and from -52% to -15% for RCP8.5. When correcting for projected\nwarming biases - but omitting lagged dynamics - median losses increase to\n57-63% (RCP4.5) and 80-86% (RCP8.5).

    "abstract": "The convergence of IT and OT has created hyper-connected ICS, exposing\ncritical infrastructure to a new class of adaptive, intelligent adversaries\nthat render static defenses obsolete. Existing security paradigms often fail to\naddress a foundational \"Trinity of Trust,\" comprising the fidelity of the\nsystem model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the\nanalytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC\nframework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous,\nclosed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms\nrace within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the \"Red\nAgent,\" is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy,\nphysically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while\nevading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based \"Blue Agent\" defender is\ncontinuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats\ndiscovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to\nbecome progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously\nprobe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the\nTEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A\ncomprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including\nROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is\nresponsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks.\nBy integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC\narchitecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a\nnecessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future\nof critical infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE), proposed by Lopez-Alt et al. (STOC\n2012), allows for performing arithmetic computations directly on ciphertexts\nencrypted under distinct keys. Subsequent works by Chen and Dai et al. (CCS\n2019) and Kim and Song et al. (CCS 2023) extended this concept by proposing\nmulti-key BFV/CKKS variants, referred to as the CDKS scheme. These variants\nincorporate asymptotically optimal techniques to facilitate secure computation\nacross multiple data providers. In this paper, we identify a critical security\nvulnerability in the CDKS scheme when applied to multiparty secure computation\ntasks, such as privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL). In particular, we\nshow that CDKS may inadvertently leak plaintext information from one party to\nothers. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new scheme, SMHE (Secure Multi-Key\nHomomorphic Encryption), which incorporates a novel masking mechanism into the\nmulti-key BFV and CKKS frameworks to ensure that plaintexts remain confidential\nthroughout the computation. We implement a PPFL application using SMHE and\ndemonstrate that it provides significantly improved security with only a modest\noverhead in homomorphic evaluation. For instance, our PPFL model based on\nmulti-key CKKS incurs less than a 2\\times runtime and communication traffic\nincrease compared to the CDKS-based PPFL model.

However, supervised\nECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking\nfine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity\nBias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but\ninformative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence\nof SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while\nsimultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate\nit, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL\nparadigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1)\nTemporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features\nreflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this,\nMulti-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation\nlearning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG\nanalyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million\nrecordings from over 300 clinical centers.

    "abstract": "Recently, there have been significant improvements in the accuracy of CNN\nmodels for semantic segmentation. However, these models are often heavy and\nsuffer from low inference speed, which limits their practical application. To\naddress this issue, knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising approach\nto achieve a good trade-off between segmentation accuracy and efficiency. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel dual relation distillation (DRD) technique that\ntransfers both spatial and channel relations in feature maps from a cumbersome\nmodel (teacher) to a compact model (student). Specifically, we compute spatial\nand channel relation maps separately for the teacher and student models, and\nthen align corresponding relation maps by minimizing their distance. Since the\nteacher model usually learns more information and collects richer spatial and\nchannel correlations than the student model, transferring these correlations\nfrom the teacher to the student can help the student mimic the teacher better\nin terms of feature distribution, thus improving the segmentation accuracy of\nthe student model. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three segmentation\ndatasets, including two widely adopted benchmarks in the remote sensing field\n(Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets) and one popular benchmark in general scene\n(Cityscapes dataset). The experimental results demonstrate that our novel\ndistillation framework can significantly boost the performance of the student\nnetwork without incurring extra computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "AI inference at the edge is becoming increasingly common for low-latency\nservices. However, edge environments are power- and resource-constrained, and\nsusceptible to failures. Conventional failure resilience approaches, such as\ncloud failover or compressed backups, often compromise latency or accuracy,\nlimiting their effectiveness for critical edge inference services. In this\npaper, we propose Multi-Level Ensemble Learning (MEL), a new framework for\nresilient edge inference that simultaneously trains multiple lightweight backup\nmodels capable of operating collaboratively, refining each other when multiple\nservers are available, and independently under failures while maintaining good\naccuracy. Specifically, we formulate our approach as a multi-objective\noptimization problem with a loss formulation that inherently encourages\ndiversity among individual models to promote mutually refining representations,\nwhile ensuring each model maintains good standalone performance. Empirical\nevaluations across vision, language, and audio datasets show that MEL provides\nperformance comparable to original architectures while also providing fault\ntolerance and deployment flexibility across edge platforms. Our results show\nthat our ensemble model, sized at 40\\% of the original model, achieves similar\nperformance, while preserving 95.6\\% of ensemble accuracy in the case of\nfailures when trained using MEL.",

However, effectively\nintegrating these high-dimensional temporal signals with natural language for\ndynamic, interactive tasks remains a significant challenge. To address this, we\nintroduce the Time-Series Question Answering (Time-Series QA) task and release\nEngineMT-QA, the first large-scale, multi-task, temporal-textual QA dataset\ndesigned to capture complex interactions between time-series signals and\nnatural language. Building on this resource, we propose the Instruct Time\nTransformer (ITFormer), a novel framework that bridges time-series encoders\nwith frozen large language models (LLMs). ITFormer effectively extracts,\naligns, and fuses temporal and textual features, achieving a strong improvement\nin QA accuracy over strong baselines with fewer than 1\\% additional trainable\nparameters.

This source was bright in February to March and showed time\nvariations in count rate by more than one order of magnitude in one week. The\n2-10 keV X-ray luminosity was ~$10^{35}$ erg/s for the assumed distance of 8\nkpc. However, after six months, it was below the detection limit. We found a\nhint of periodicity of 1537 s from timing analysis. The XRISM/Xtend spectrum\nhas emission lines from helium-like iron (Fe He$\\alpha$) at 6.7 keV and\nhydrogen-like iron (Fe Ly$\\alpha$) at 6.97 keV; their intensity ratio is\nunusual with the latter being four times stronger than the former. If the\nemission is of thermal origin, the ionization temperature estimated from the\niron-line intensity ratio is ~30 keV, which is inconsistent with the electron\ntemperature estimated from the thermal bremsstrahlung, ~7 keV. Spectral models\nof magnetic cataclysmic variables, which are often seen in the Galactic center\nin this luminosity range, are found to fail to reproduce the obtained spectrum.\nBy contrast, we found that the spectrum is well reproduced with the models of\nlow-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star plus two narrow Gaussian\nlines. We consider that the source is intrinsically bright reaching $10^{37}$\nerg/s, but is blocked from direct view due to a high inclination and only the\nscattered emission is visible. The photoionized plasma above the accretion disk\nwith an ionization parameter of ~$10^{5}$ may explain the unusual iron line\nratio.

Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational\ndigital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a\nsingle Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT\nupdating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while\nproducing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design,\ncontrol algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four\nenergy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven\nactive learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third\nthe training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin\nmaintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind\nforecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A\nnuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with\nR2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating\nrobustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion\nbattery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared\nerror by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting\nits credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results\ndemonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update\nschemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient,\nand computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across\nindustrial and scientific energy systems.",

    "abstract": "Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks aim to infer which websites a user is\nvisiting by analyzing traffic patterns, thereby compromising user anonymity.\nAlthough this technique has been demonstrated to be effective in controlled\nexperimental environments, it remains largely limited to small-scale scenarios,\ntypically restricted to recognizing website homepages. In practical settings,\nhowever, users frequently access multiple subpages in rapid succession, often\nbefore previous content fully loads. WebPage Fingerprinting (WPF) generalizes\nthe WF framework to large-scale environments by modeling subpages of the same\nsite as distinct classes. These pages often share similar page elements,\nresulting in lower inter-class variance in traffic features. Furthermore, we\nconsider multi-tab browsing scenarios, in which a single trace encompasses\nmultiple categories of webpages. This leads to overlapping traffic segments,\nand similar features may appear in different positions within the traffic,\nthereby increasing the difficulty of classification. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an attention-driven fine-grained WPF attack, named\nADWPF. Specifically, during the training phase, we apply targeted augmentation\nto salient regions of the traffic based on attention maps, including attention\ncropping and attention masking. ADWPF then extracts low-dimensional features\nfrom both the original and augmented traffic and applies self-attention modules\nto capture the global contextual patterns of the trace. Finally, to handle the\nmulti-tab scenario, we employ the residual attention to generate class-specific\nrepresentations of webpages occurring at different temporal positions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently\nsurpasses state-of-the-art baselines across datasets of different scales.",

To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we\nconstruct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework\nwith metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.\nExperimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM\nbaselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,\nreasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios.

    "abstract": "Label-free optical absorption microscopy techniques continue to evolve as\npromising tools for label-free histopathological imaging of cells and tissues.\nHowever, critical challenges relating to specificity and contrast, as compared\nto current gold-standard methods continue to hamper adoption. This work\nintroduces Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS), a new absorption microscope\nmodality, which simultaneously captures the dominant de-excitation processes\nfollowing an absorption event. In PARS, radiative (auto-fluorescence) and\nnon-radiative (photothermal and photoacoustic) relaxation processes are\ncollected simultaneously, providing enhanced specificity to a range of\nbiomolecules. As an example, a multiwavelength PARS system featuring UV (266\nnm) and visible (532 nm) excitation is applied to imaging human skin, and\nmurine brain tissue samples. It is shown that PARS can directly characterize,\ndifferentiate, and unmix, clinically relevant biomolecules inside complex\ntissues samples using established statistical processing methods. Gaussian\nmixture models (GMM) are used to characterize clinically relevant biomolecules\n(e.g., white, and gray matter) based on their PARS signals, while non-negative\nleast squares (NNLS) is applied to map the biomolecule abundance in murine\nbrain tissues, without stained ground truth images or deep-learning methods.\nPARS unmixing and abundance estimates are directly validated and compared\nagainst chemically stained ground truth images, and deep learning based-image\ntransforms. Overall, it is found that the PARS unique and rich contrast may\nprovide comprehensive, and otherwise inaccessible, label-free characterization\nof molecular pathology, representing a new source of data to develop AI and\nmachine learning methods for diagnostics and visualization.",

    "abstract": "The Zwicky Transient Facility Census of the Local Universe survey yielded a\nsample of 330 Type IIP supernovae (SNe) with well-constrained peak\nluminosities. In paper I (arXiv:2502.19493), we measured their luminosity\nfunction and volumetric rate. Here (paper II), we present the largest\nsystematic study of lightcurve properties for Type IIP SNe from a\nvolume-limited survey, analyzing a selected subset of 129 events, including 16\nlow-luminosity Type IIP (LLIIP) SNe with M${r,peak} \\geq -16$ mag. We find that\nplateau slope correlates with peak brightness, with many LLIIP SNe showing\npositive slopes--suggesting smaller progenitor radii and distinct density\nprofiles compared to brighter Type IIP SNe. The plateau duration shows only a\nweak dependence on peak brightness, likely suggesting binary interaction. One\nSN exhibits a plateau-to-tail drop of >3.5 mag, consistent with an\nelectron-capture or failed SN with very low or zero nickel mass. We derive\nexplosion and progenitor parameters of the entire Type IIP SN sample using\nsemi-analytical and radiation-hydrodynamical models. Based on\nradiation-hydrodynamical model fitting, LLIIP SNe are characterized by low\nnickel masses (0.001-0.025 $\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), low explosion energies\n(0.1-0.28 $\\times 10^{51}$ erg), low ejecta masses ($8.1^{+0.8}_{-1.7}$\n$\\mathrm{M\\odot}$), and ZAMS masses below 11 $\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. In comparison,\nthe full Type IIP SN sample spans a wider range with nickel masses (0.001-0.222\n$\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), explosion energies (0.10-4.43 $\\times 10^{51}$ erg),\nejecta masses (5.4-24.8 $\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$), and ZAMS masses (9.3-16.7\n$\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$). We find strong correlations between peak brightness,\nexplosion energy, and nickel mass that extend to the low-luminosity end. We\nconclude that LLIIP SNe represent the faint, low-energy end of the Type IIP\npopulation and originate from the lowest-mass core-collapse progenitors.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the maximization of the harvested power efficiency (HPE)\nin a modular extremely large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system,\nwhich supports energy harvesting (EH) for near-field users. These users are\nlocated in spatially distinct visibility regions (VRs) with non-stationary\nchannel characteristics. We propose to determine which sub-arrays are switched\non or off as well the power control coefficients at the sub-arrays to maximize\nthe HPE. The design can be processed via a multi-tier joint optimization\nframework based on fractional programming. The numerical results showcase that\nthe HPE performance of the proposed algorithm is nearly optimal, comparable to\nthat of exhaustive search. As a matter of fact, it achieves up to a 120% gain\nover the benchmark scheme which uses the entire XL-MIMO array with equal power\nallocation (PA) across sub-arrays, while significantly reducing the\ncomputational time.",
