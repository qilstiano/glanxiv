    "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) can achieve near-unity quantum efficiency of light\nharvesting in ideal conditions and can dissipate excess light energy as heat to\nprevent formation of reactive oxygen species under light stress. Understanding\nhow this pigment-protein complex accomplishes these opposing goals is a topic\nof great interest that has so far been explored primarily through the lens of\nthe system energetics. Despite PSII's known flat energy landscape, a thorough\nconsideration of the entropic effects on energy transfer in PSII is lacking. In\nthis work, we aim to discern the free energetic design principles underlying\nthe PSII energy transfer network. To accomplish this goal, we employ a\nstructure-based rate matrix and compute the free energy terms in time following\na specific initial excitation to discern how entropy and enthalpy drive\nensemble system dynamics. We find that the interplay between the entropy and\nenthalpy components differs among each protein subunit, which allows each\nsubunit to fulfill a unique role in the energy transfer network. This\nindividuality ensures PSII can accomplish efficient energy trapping in the RC,\neffective NPQ in the periphery, and robust energy trapping in the other-monomer\nRC if the same-monomer RC is closed. We also show that entropy, in particular,\nis a dynamically tunable feature of the PSII free energy landscape accomplished\nthrough regulation of LHCII binding. These findings help rationalize natural\nphotosynthesis and provide design principles for novel, more efficient solar\nenergy harvesting technologies.",

    "abstract": "Phishing attacks on enterprise employees present one of the most costly and\npotent threats to organizations. We explore an understudied facet of enterprise\nphishing attacks: the email relay infrastructure behind successfully delivered\nphishing emails. We draw on a dataset spanning one year across thousands of\nenterprises, billions of emails, and over 800,000 delivered phishing attacks.\nOur work sheds light on the network origins of phishing emails received by\nreal-world enterprises, differences in email traffic we observe from networks\nsending phishing emails, and how these characteristics change over time.\n  Surprisingly, we find that over one-third of the phishing email in our\ndataset originates from highly reputable networks, including Amazon and\nMicrosoft. Their total volume of phishing email is consistently high across\nmultiple months in our dataset, even though the overwhelming majority of email\nsent by these networks is benign. In contrast, we observe that a large portion\nof phishing emails originate from networks where the vast majority of emails\nthey send are phishing, but their email traffic is not consistent over time.\nTaken together, our results explain why no singular defense strategy, such as\nstatic blocklists (which are commonly used in email security filters deployed\nby organizations in our dataset), is effective at blocking enterprise phishing.\nBased on our offline analysis, we partnered with a large email security company\nto deploy a classifier that uses dynamically updated network-based features. In\na production environment over a period of 4.5 months, our new detector was able\nto identify 3-5% more enterprise email attacks that were previously undetected\nby the company's existing classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning is transforming medical research by improving diagnostic\naccuracy and personalizing treatments. General ML models trained on large\ndatasets identify broad patterns across populations, but their effectiveness is\noften limited by the diversity of human biology. This has led to interest in\nsubject-specific models that use individual data for more precise predictions.\nHowever, these models are costly and challenging to develop. To address this,\nwe propose a novel validation approach that uses a general ML model to ensure\nreproducible performance and robust feature importance analysis at both group\nand subject-specific levels. We tested a single Random Forest (RF) model on\nnine datasets varying in domain, sample size, and demographics. Different\nvalidation techniques were applied to evaluate accuracy and feature importance\nconsistency. To introduce variability, we performed up to 400 trials per\nsubject, randomly seeding the ML algorithm for each trial. This generated 400\nfeature sets per subject, from which we identified top subject-specific\nfeatures. A group-specific feature importance set was then derived from all\nsubject-specific results. We compared our approach to conventional validation\nmethods in terms of performance and feature importance consistency. Our\nrepeated trials approach, with random seed variation, consistently identified\nkey features at the subject level and improved group-level feature importance\nanalysis using a single general model. Subject-specific models address\nbiological variability but are resource-intensive. Our novel validation\ntechnique provides consistent feature importance and improved accuracy within a\ngeneral ML model, offering a practical and explainable alternative for clinical\nresearch.",

In these contexts, the sparsity patterns of the linear systems\nfrequently change across successive calls to the Cholesky solver, necessitating\nrepeated symbolic analyses that dominate the overall solver runtime.\n  To address this bottleneck, we evaluate our method on over 150,000 linear\nsystems generated from diverse nonlinear problems with dynamic sparsity changes\nin Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) and patch remeshing on a wide range of\ntriangular meshes of various sizes. Our analysis using three leading sparse\nCholesky libraries, Intel MKL Pardiso, SuiteSparse CHOLMOD, and Apple\nAccelerate, reveals that the primary performance constraint lies in the\nsymbolic re-ordering phase of the solver. Recognizing this, we introduce Parth,\nan innovative re-ordering method designed to update ordering vectors only where\nlocal connectivity changes occur adaptively. Parth employs a novel hierarchical\ngraph decomposition algorithm to break down the dual graph of the input matrix\ninto fine-grained subgraphs, facilitating the selective reuse of fill-reducing\norderings when sparsity patterns exhibit temporal coherence.\n  Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that Parth achieves up to a 255x and\n13x speedup in fill-reducing ordering for our IPC and remeshing benchmark and a\n6.85x and 10.7x acceleration in symbolic analysis.

This study\napplies unsupervised learning and deep learning techniques to investigate FRB\ndynamic spectra, focusing on two approaches: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nand a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) enhanced by an Information-Ordered\nBottleneck (IOB) layer. PCA served as a computationally efficient baseline,\ncapturing broad trends, identifying outliers, and providing valuable insights\ninto large datasets.

Agents act\nby their response functions to observations and external forces, while\nobservations change by the aggregated actions of all agents, weighted by their\nrespective influence, i.e. power or wealth. Agents wealth dynamically adjust\nbased on the alignment between an agents actions and observation outcomes:\nagents gain wealth when their actions align with observed trends and lose\nwealth otherwise. A reward function, that describes the change of agents wealth\nat each time step, manifests the differences of response functions of agents to\nobservations. When all agents responses are set to zero and feedback loop is\nbroken, agents wealth follow a normal or lognormal distribution. Otherwise,\nthis response-reward iterative feedback mechanism results in concentrated\nwealth distributions, characterized by a small number of dominant agents and\nthe marginalization of the majority. Contrasted to past studies, such\nconcentration is not limited only to asymptotic behavior at the upper tail for\nlarge variables, nor does it require the reward function to be linear to agents\nprevious wealth as formulated in random growth model and network preferential\nattachment. Probability density functions for various distributions are more\nvisually distinguishable for small values at the lower tail.

With known calibration, a simple modification\nto the system achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks.\nAltogether, we propose a plug-and-play monocular SLAM system capable of\nproducing globally-consistent poses and dense geometry while operating at 15\nFPS.",

Existing research has introduced quantum differential\nprivacy (QDP) for privacy protection in central quantum computing, but there is\nno dedicated privacy protection mechanisms for QDC. To fill this research gap,\nour paper introduces a novel concept called quantum R\\'enyi differential\nprivacy (QRDP), which incorporates the advantages of classical R\\'enyi DP and\nis applicable in the QDC domain. Based on the new quantum R\\'enyi divergence,\nQRDP provides delicate and flexible privacy protection by introducing parameter\n$\\alpha$. In particular, the QRDP composition is well suited for QDC, since it\nallows for more precise control of the total privacy budget in scenarios\nrequiring multiple quantum operations. We analyze a variety of noise mechanisms\nthat can implement QRDP, and derive the lowest privacy budget provided by these\nmechanisms.

    "abstract": "Conversational Swarm Intelligence (CSI) is an AI-facilitated method for\nenabling real-time conversational deliberations and prioritizations among\nnetworked human groups of potentially unlimited size. Based on the biological\nprinciple of Swarm Intelligence and modelled on the decision-making dynamics of\nfish schools, CSI has been shown in prior studies to amplify group\nintelligence, increase group participation, and facilitate productive\ncollaboration among hundreds of participants at once. It works by dividing a\nlarge population into a set of small subgroups that are woven together by\nreal-time AI agents called Conversational Surrogates. The present study focuses\non the use of a CSI platform called Thinkscape to enable real-time\nbrainstorming and prioritization among groups of 75 networked users. The study\nemployed a variant of a common brainstorming intervention called an Alternative\nUse Task (AUT) and was designed to compare through subjective feedback, the\nexperience of participants brainstorming using a CSI structure vs brainstorming\nin a single large chat room. This comparison revealed that participants\nsignificantly preferred brainstorming with the CSI structure and reported that\nit felt (i) more collaborative, (ii) more productive, and (iii) was better at\nsurfacing quality answers. In addition, participants using the CSI structure\nreported (iv) feeling more ownership and more buy-in in the final answers the\ngroup converged on and (v) reported feeling more heard as compared to\nbrainstorming in a traditional text chat environment. Overall, the results\nsuggest that CSI is a very promising AI-facilitated method for brainstorming\nand prioritization among large-scale, networked human groups.",

For functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), while\ndata may be abundantly available from healthy controls, clinical data is often\nscarce, especially for rare diseases, limiting the ability of models to\nidentify clinically-relevant features. We overcome this limitation by\nintroducing a novel representation learning strategy integrating meta-learning\nwith self-supervised learning to improve the generalization from normal to\nclinical features.

To explore the\ngeneralizability of the learned representations to unseen clinical\napplications, we apply the model to four distinct clinical datasets featuring\nscarce and heterogeneous data for neurological disorder classification.

The functional\nvolume product of an even $s$-concave function $g$ is \\[\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}g(x)dx\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}}\\mathcal{L}_{s}g(y)dy, \\] where\n$\\mathcal{L}_{s}g$ is the $s$-polar function associated to $g$.

    "abstract": "Distributed inference techniques can be broadly classified into\ndata-distributed and model-distributed schemes. In data-distributed inference\n(DDI), each worker carries the entire Machine Learning (ML) model but processes\nonly a subset of the data. However, feeding the data to workers results in high\ncommunication costs, especially when the data is large. An emerging paradigm is\nmodel-distributed inference (MDI), where each worker carries only a subset of\nML layers. In MDI, a source device that has data processes a few layers of ML\nmodel and sends the output to a neighboring device, i.e., offloads the rest of\nthe layers. This process ends when all layers are processed in a distributed\nmanner. In this paper, we investigate the design and development of MDI when\nmultiple data sources co-exist. We consider that each data source has a\ndifferent importance and, hence, a priority. We formulate and solve a\npriority-aware model allocation optimization problem. Based on the structure of\nthe optimal solution, we design a practical Priority-Aware Model- Distributed\nInference (PA-MDI) algorithm that determines model allocation and distribution\nover devices by taking into account the priorities of different sources.\nExperiments were conducted on a real-life testbed of NVIDIA Jetson Xavier and\nNano edge devices as well as in the Colosseum testbed with ResNet-50, ResNet-\n56, and GPT-2 models. The experimental results show that PA-MDI performs\npriority-aware model allocation successfully while reducing the inference time\nas compared to baselines.",

Because DEP\nrelies upon the creation of sharp electrode edges, its sensitivity is\nfundamentally limited by the electrode thickness. Graphene, with its monolayer\nthickness, enables scaling of the DEP force, allowing trapping of particles at\ngraphene edges at ultra-low voltages.

This four-terminal\nmulti-functional hybrid device structure operates in three distinct modes: DEP,\nGFET, and DEP-GFET. By segmenting the channel of the GFET into multiple\nparallel channels, greatly increased density of particle trapping is\ndemonstrated using fluorescence microscopy analysis.

    "abstract": "Fundamental mathematical constants appear in nearly every field of science,\nfrom physics to biology. Formulas that connect different constants often bring\ngreat insight by hinting at connections between previously disparate fields.\nDiscoveries of such relations, however, have remained scarce events, relying on\nsporadic strokes of creativity by human mathematicians. Recent developments of\nalgorithms for automated conjecture generation have accelerated the discovery\nof formulas for specific constants. Yet, the discovery of connections between\nconstants has not been addressed. In this paper, we present the first library\ndedicated to mathematical constants and their interrelations. This library can\nserve as a central repository of knowledge for scientists from different areas,\nand as a collaborative platform for development of new algorithms. The library\nis based on a new representation that we propose for organizing the formulas of\nmathematical constants: a hypergraph, with each node representing a constant\nand each edge representing a formula. Using this representation, we propose and\ndemonstrate a systematic approach for automatically enriching this library\nusing PSLQ, an integer relation algorithm based on QR decomposition and lattice\nconstruction. During its development and testing, our strategy led to the\ndiscovery of 75 previously unknown connections between constants, including a\nnew formula for the `first continued fraction' constant $C_1$, novel formulas\nfor natural logarithms, and new formulas connecting $\\pi$ and $e$. The latter\nformulas generalize a century-old relation between $\\pi$ and $e$ by Ramanujan,\nwhich until now was considered a singular formula and is now found to be part\nof a broader mathematical structure. The code supporting this library is a\npublic, open-source API that can serve researchers in experimental mathematics\nand other fields of science.",

Gradient computation is implemented\nwithin the JAX framework and based on the property of time reversibility in\nMaxwell's equations. This approach significantly reduces computational time and\nmemory requirements compared to traditional FDTD methods.

In contrast, the visual modality\nenhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content,\nspatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities\nwork synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially\nreveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often\ndominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance\noccurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can\nsignificantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a\ndirection for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce\nModality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS\neffectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where\nthe key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations\nin the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we\ncomposed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS\nmethod. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models\nrequire, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while\nstill achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight\nvisual question-answering tasks.

    "abstract": "Many supervised machine learning methods have revolutionised the empirical\nmodelling of complex systems. These empirical models, however, are usually\n\"black boxes\" and provide only limited physical explanations about the\nunderlying systems. Instead, so-called \"knowledge discovery\" methods can be\nused to explore the governing equations that describe observed phenomena. This\npaper focuses on how we can use such methods to explore underlying physics and\nalso model a commonly observed yet not fully understood phenomenon - the\nbreaking of ocean waves. In our work, we use symbolic regression to explore the\nequation that describes wave-breaking evolution from a dataset of in silico\nwaves generated using expensive numerical methods. Our work discovers a new\nboundary equation that provides a reduced-order description of how the surface\nelevation (i.e., the water-air interface) evolves forward in time, including\nthe instances when the wave breaks - a problem that has defied traditional\napproaches. Compared to the existing empirical models, the unique\nequation-based nature of our model allows further mathematical interpretation,\nwhich provides an opportunity to explore the fundamentals of breaking waves.\nFurther expert-AI collaborative research reveals the physical meaning of each\nterm of the discovered equation, which suggests a new characteristic of\nbreaking waves in deep water - a decoupling between the water-air interface and\nthe fluid velocities. This novel reduced-order model also hints at\ncomputationally efficient ways to simulate breaking waves for engineering\napplications.",

However,\nautomated scientific laboratories are currently limited by human intuition in\ntheir ability to efficiently design and interpret experiments in\nhigh-dimensional spaces, throttling scientific discovery. We present\nAutoSciLab, a machine learning framework for driving autonomous scientific\nexperiments, forming a surrogate researcher purposed for scientific discovery\nin high-dimensional spaces. AutoSciLab autonomously follows the scientific\nmethod in four steps: (i) generating high-dimensional experiments (x \\in R^D)\nusing a variational autoencoder (ii) selecting optimal experiments by forming\nhypotheses using active learning (iii) distilling the experimental results to\ndiscover relevant low-dimensional latent variables (z \\in R^d, with d << D)\nwith a 'directional autoencoder' and (iv) learning a human interpretable\nequation connecting the discovered latent variables with a quantity of interest\n(y = f(z)), using a neural network equation learner. We validate the\ngeneralizability of AutoSciLab by rediscovering a) the principles of projectile\nmotion and b) the phase transitions within the spin-states of the Ising model\n(NP-hard problem). Applying our framework to an open-ended nanophotonics\nchallenge, AutoSciLab uncovers a fundamentally novel method for directing\nincoherent light emission that surpasses the current state-of-the-art (Iyer et\nal. 2023b, 2020).",

However, a supercurrent diode with robust field\ntolerance is currently lacking. Here, we demonstrate a field-resilient\nsupercurrent diode by incorporating a multiferroic material into a Josephson\njunction. We first observed a pronounced supercurrent diode effect at zero\nmagnetic field.

We focus on\nthe case in which the network consists of a single connected component.\nStarting from a random initial node $i$ at time $t=0$, an NBW hops into a\nrandom neighbor of $i$ at time $t=1$ and at each subsequent step it continues\nto hop into a random neighbor of its current node, excluding the previous node.\nWe calculate the tail distribution $P ( T_{\\rm FR} > t )$ of first return times\nfrom a random node to itself. It is found that $P ( T_{\\rm FR} > t )$ is given\nby a discrete Laplace transform of the degree distribution $P(k)$. This result\nexemplifies the relation between structural properties of a network, captured\nby the degree distribution, and properties of dynamical processes taking place\non the network. Using the tail-sum formula, we calculate the mean first return\ntime ${\\mathbb E}[ T_{\\rm FR} ]$. Surprisingly, ${\\mathbb E}[ T_{\\rm FR} ]$\ncoincides with the result obtained from the Kac's lemma that applies to\nclassical random walks (RWs). We also calculate the variance ${\\rm Var}(T_{\\rm\nFR})$, which accounts for the variability of first return times between\ndifferent NBW trajectories. We apply this formalism to random regular graphs,\nErdos-R\\'enyi networks and configuration model networks with exponential and\npower-law degree distributions and obtain closed-form expressions for $P (\nT_{\\rm FR} > t )$ as well as its mean and variance. These results provide\nuseful insight on the advantages of NBWs over classical RWs in network\nexploration, sampling and search processes.",

Most existing transportability analysis methods require individual\npatient-level data (IPD) for both the source and the target population,\nnarrowing its applicability when only target aggregate-level data (AgD) is\navailable. Besides, accounting for censoring is essential to reduce bias in\nlongitudinal data, yet AgD-based transportability methods in the presence of\ncensoring remain underexplored. Here, we propose a two-stage weighting\nframework named \"Target Aggregate Data Adjustment\" (TADA) to address the\nmentioned challenges simultaneously. TADA is designed as a two-stage weighting\nscheme to simultaneously adjust for both censoring bias and distributional\nimbalances of effect modifiers (EM), where the final weights are the product of\nthe inverse probability of censoring weights and participation weights derived\nusing the method of moments. We have conducted an extensive simulation study to\nevaluate TADA's performance. Our results indicate that TADA can effectively\ncontrol the bias resulting from censoring within a non-extreme range suitable\nfor most practical scenarios, and enhance the application and clinical\ninterpretability of transportability analyses in settings with limited data\navailability.",

Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave received tremendous attention due to their unparalleled capabilities in\nvarious Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and generating context-aware\ninsights, offering transformative potential for automating diverse\ncommunication NSM tasks. Contrasting existing surveys that consider a single\nnetwork domain, this survey investigates the integration of LLMs across\ndifferent communication network domains, including mobile networks and related\ntechnologies, vehicular networks, cloud-based networks, and fog/edge-based\nnetworks. First, the survey provides foundational knowledge of LLMs, explicitly\ndetailing the generic transformer architecture, general-purpose and\ndomain-specific LLMs, LLM model pre-training and fine-tuning, and their\nrelation to communication NSM. Under a novel taxonomy of network monitoring and\nreporting, AI-powered network planning, network deployment and distribution,\nand continuous network support, we extensively categorize LLM applications for\nNSM tasks in each of the different network domains, exploring existing\nliterature and their contributions thus far. Then, we identify existing\nchallenges and open issues, as well as future research directions for\nLLM-driven communication NSM, emphasizing the need for scalable, adaptable, and\nresource-efficient solutions that align with the dynamic landscape of\ncommunication networks. We envision that this survey serves as a holistic\nroadmap, providing critical insights for leveraging LLMs to enhance NSM.",

Despite its practical relevance, sequential unlearning in the context of\ncopyright infringement has not been rigorously explored in existing literature.\nTo address this gap, we propose Stable Sequential Unlearning (SSU), a novel\nframework designed to unlearn copyrighted content from LLMs over multiple time\nsteps. Our approach works by identifying and removing specific weight updates\nin the model's parameters that correspond to copyrighted content using task\nvectors. We improve unlearning efficacy by introducing random labeling loss and\nensuring the model retains its general-purpose knowledge by adjusting targeted\nparameters with gradient-based weight saliency. Extensive experimental results\nshow that SSU sometimes achieves an effective trade-off between unlearning\nefficacy and general-purpose language abilities, outperforming existing\nbaselines, but it's not a cure-all for unlearning copyrighted material.",

The experimental results are compared with\nfirst-principles calculations of the lattice thermal conductivity of ThO$_2$,\nemploying an iterative solution of the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation.\nAdditionally, the non-perturbative Greens function methodology is utilized to\ncompute phonon-point defect scattering rates, accounting for local distortions\naround point defects, including mass difference changes, interatomic force\nconstants, and structural relaxation. The congruence between the predicted\nresults from first-principles calculations and the measured\ntemperature-dependent thermal conductivity validates the computational\nmethodology.

Unlike\ntraditional cooperative MARL solutions that involve sharing rewards, values,\nand policies or designing intrinsic rewards to encourage agents to learn\ncollectively optimal policies, we propose a novel MARL approach where agents\nexchange action suggestions.

    "abstract": "We consider two models of predator-prey community with prey-taxis, one relies\non Patlak-Keller-Segel law (Lee et al, 2009), the other one employs the\nCattaneo model of heat transfer following Dolak and Hillen (2003). Thus, the\nformer one uses the prey density gradient for directing the predators flux, and\nthe latter one -- for directing the vector density of sources of the predators\nflux. We assume the predators to be also capable of responding to an external\nsignal in the same manner. Additionally, we assume that some scaling makes the\ndimensionless prey diffusivity and the wavelength of the external signal small\nquantities of the same order. In the case of Cattaneo's model, we additionally\nassume the resistivity to varying the predators flux to be as high as the\nreciprocal of the prey diffusivity. With these assumptions we construct the\ncomplete asymptotic expansion of the short-wave solution. We use this\nasymptotic to examine the effect of the short-wave signal on the formation of\nspatiotemporal patterns. We do so by comparing the stability of equilibria with\nno signal to that of the quasi-equilibria, by which we mean the simplest\npatterns directly forced by the external signal. Historically, such an approach\ngoes back to Kapitza's theory for upside-down pendulum, and it had been already\napplied to examining other predator-prey systems and/or other limits (Morgulis\nand Ilin, 2020, Morgulis, 2023). This time the overall conclusion is that the\nexternal signal is likely not capable of creating the instability domain in the\nparametric space from nothing but it can substantially widen the one that is\nnon-empty with no signal. The details, however, essentially depend on the speed\nat which the external signal propagates and on the system kinetics, at least\nwhen the signal amplitude is small",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet services has led to an increasing need to\nprotect private data. User authentication serves as a crucial mechanism to\nensure data security. Although robust authentication forms the cornerstone of\nremote service security, it can still leave users vulnerable to credential\ndisclosure, device-theft attacks, session hijacking, and inadequate adaptive\nsecurity measures. Risk-based Authentication (RBA) emerges as a potential\nsolution, offering a multi-level authentication approach that enhances user\nexperience without compromising security. In this paper, we propose a Federated\nRisk-based Authentication (F-RBA) framework that leverages Federated Learning\nto ensure privacy-centric training, keeping user data local while distributing\nlearning across devices. Whereas traditional approaches rely on centralized\nstorage, F-RBA introduces a distributed architecture where risk assessment\noccurs locally on users' devices. The framework's core innovation lies in its\nsimilarity-based feature engineering approach, which addresses the\nheterogeneous data challenges inherent in federated settings, a significant\nadvancement for distributed authentication. By facilitating real-time risk\nevaluation across devices while maintaining unified user profiles, F-RBA\nachieves a balance between data protection, security, and scalability. Through\nits federated approach, F-RBA addresses the cold-start challenge in risk model\ncreation, enabling swift adaptation to new users without compromising security.\nEmpirical evaluation using a real-world multi-user dataset demonstrates the\nframework's effectiveness, achieving a superior true positive rate for\ndetecting suspicious logins compared to conventional unsupervised anomaly\ndetection models.

However, in addition to\nthe assignment costs incurred from these decisions, the decision-maker is also\npenalized for deviating from exogenously given, nonstationary target\nallocations throughout the horizon. The goal is to minimize the total expected\nassignment and deviation penalty costs incurred throughout the horizon when the\ndistribution of assignment costs is unknown. In contrast to traditional online\nresource allocation, in our setting the timing of allocation decisions is\ncritical due to the nonstationarity of allocation targets. Examples of\npractical problems that fit this framework include many physical resource\nsettings where capacity is time-varying, such as manual warehouse processes\nwhere staffing levels change over time, and assignment of packages to outbound\ntrucks whose departure times are scheduled throughout the day.

    "abstract": "Cross-sectional incidence estimation based on recency testing has become a\nwidely used tool in HIV research. Recently, this method has gained prominence\nin HIV prevention trials to estimate the \"placebo\" incidence that participants\nmight experience without preventive treatment. The application of this approach\nfaces challenges due to non-representative sampling, as individuals aware of\ntheir HIV-positive status may be less likely to participate in screening for an\nHIV prevention trial. To address this, a recent phase 3 trial excluded\nindividuals based on whether they have had a recent HIV test. To the best of\nour knowledge, the validity of this approach has yet to be studied. In our\nwork, we investigate the performance of cross-sectional HIV incidence\nestimation when excluding individuals based on prior HIV tests in realistic\ntrial settings. We develop a statistical framework that incorporates a\ntesting-based criterion and possible non-representative sampling. We introduce\na metric we call the effective mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) that\nmathematically quantifies bias in incidence estimation. We conduct an extensive\nsimulation study to evaluate incidence estimator performance under various\nscenarios. Our findings reveal that when screening attendance is affected by\nknowledge of HIV status, incidence estimators become unreliable unless all\nindividuals with recent HIV tests are excluded. Additionally, we identified a\ntrade-off between bias and variability: excluding more individuals reduces bias\nfrom non-representative sampling but in many cases increases the variability of\nincidence estimates. These findings highlight the need for caution when\napplying testing-based criteria and emphasize the importance of refining\nincidence estimation methods to improve the design and evaluation of future HIV\nprevention trials.",

This design is\nespecially suited for the turbulent, dynamic, non-uniform flow conditions found\nclose to the ground, and has enabled applications from entomology to flight on\nMars. However, due to the high dimensionality of fan-array actuation and the\ncomplexity of unsteady fluid flow, the physics of fan arrays are not fully\ncharacterized, making it difficult to prescribe arbitrary flow fields.\nAccessing the full capability of fan arrays requires resolving the map from\ntime-varying grids of fan speeds to three-dimensional unsteady flow fields,\nwhich remains an open problem. This map is unfeasible to span in a single\nstudy, but it can be partitioned and studied in subsets. In this paper, we\nstudy the special case of constant fan-speeds and time-averaged streamwise\nvelocities with one homogeneous spanwise axis. We produce a proof-of-concept\nsurrogate model by fitting a regularized linear map to a dataset of fan-array\nmeasurements. We use this model as the basis for an open-loop control scheme to\ndesign flow profiles subject to constraints on fan speeds. In experimental\nvalidation, our model scored a mean prediction error of 1.02 m/s and our\ncontrol scheme a mean tracking error of 1.05 m/s in a fan array with velocities\nup to 12 m/s. We empirically conclude that the physics relating constant fan\nspeeds to time-averaged streamwise velocities are dominated by linear dynamics,\nand present our method as a foundational step to fully resolve fan-array wind\ntunnel control.",

Variations in optical brightness with the same\nperiod were observed, with an average amplitude of 0.04 magnitudes. The total\namplitude of the He II radial velocity variations was approximately 380\nkilometers per second. The equivalent width of the line varied on timescales of\ntens of minutes as well as with the orbital period, reaching maximum values\nwhen the companion passed the descending node of the orbit. The intensity of\nthe He II 4686 emission has gradually increased over time. Our photometric\nmonitoring revealed pulsations of the main B component of the CI Cam system.\nBetween 2005 and 2009, the B star exhibited multiperiodic pulsations, however,\nsince 2012, it pulsated in a single mode. We interpret the pulsations from 2005\nto 2009 as a resonance of radial modes, with the residual stable mode being the\nfirst overtone. The pulsations are coherent over several months, with average\namplitudes from 0.02 to 0.04 magnitudes in the V band. The pulsation data\nconstrain the spectral type of the primary component of B0 to B2 III, the\ndistance to the system from 2.5 to 4.5 kpc. The classification of the main\ncomponent of CI Cam as a supergiant is ruled out due to the observed pulsation\nperiods.

However, the exact details of the Milky Way's assembly history remain\nuncertain. In this study, we show that the Milky Way's merger history is\nuniquely encoded in the vertical thickness of its stellar disk. By leveraging\nage estimates from the value-added LAMOST DR8 catalog and the StarHorse ages\nfrom SDSS-IV DR12 data, we investigate the relationship between disk thickness\nand stellar ages in the Milky Way using a sample comprising Red Giants (RG),\nRed Clump Giants (RCG), and metal-poor stars (MPS). Guided by the\nIllustrisTNG50 simulations, we show that an increase in the dispersion of the\nvertical displacement of stars in the disk traces its merger history. This\nanalysis reveals the epoch of a major merger event that assembled the Milky Way\napproximately 11.13 billion years ago, as indicated by the abrupt increase in\ndisk thickness among stars of that age, likely corresponding to the\nGaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE) event. The data do not exclude an earlier major\nmerger, which may have occurred about 1.3 billion years after the Big Bang.\nFurthermore, the analysis suggests that the geometric thick disk of the Milky\nWay was formed around 11.13 billion years ago, followed by a transition period\nof approximately 2.6 billion years leading to the formation of the geometric\nthin disk, illustrating the galaxy's structural evolution. Additionally, we\nidentified three more recent events -- 5.20 billion, 2.02 billion, and 0.22\nbillion years ago -- potentially linked to multiple passages of the Sagittarius\ndwarf galaxy. Our study not only elucidates the complex mass assembly history\nof the Milky Way and highlights its past interactions but also introduces a\nrefined method for examining the merger histories of external galaxies.",

    "abstract": "One of the central challenges in modern cosmology is understanding the nature\nof dark energy and its evolution throughout the history of the Universe. Dark\nenergy is commonly modeled as a perfect fluid with a time-varying\nequation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$, often modeled under CPL parametrization\nusing two parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. In this study, we explore both parametric\nand non-parametric methods to reconstruct the dark energy Equation of State\n(EoS) using Gravitational Wave (GW) sources, with and without electromagnetic\n(EM) counterparts called bright sirens and dark sirens respectively. In the\nparametric approach, we extend the widely used $w_0$-$w_a$ model by introducing\nan additional term, $w_b$, to better capture the evolving dynamics of dark\nenergy up to high redshift which is accessible from GW sources. This extension\nprovides increased flexibility in modeling the EoS and enables a more detailed\ninvestigation of dark energy's evolution. Our analysis indicates that, with\nfive years of observation time and a $75\\%$ duty cycle using Cosmic Explorer\nand the Einstein Telescope, it will be possible to measure the dark energy EoS\nwith remarkable precision, better than any other cosmological probe in the\ncoming years, from bright standard sirens using a multi-messenger approach.\nThese findings highlight the potential of GW observations in synergy with EM\ntelescopes to offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy,\novercoming the current limitations in cosmological measurements.",

One example is that the\ndefinitions of parton densities and fragmentation functions for different types\nof hadrons differ only in the identity of the nonperturbative states that form\nthe matrix elements, but are otherwise the same. This leads to independence of\nperturbative calculations on nonperturbative details of external states. It\nalso lends support to interpretations of correlation functions as\nencapsulations of intrinsic nonperturbative properties. These characteristics\nhave usually been presumed to still hold true in fragmentation functions even\nwhen the observed nonperturbative state is a small-mass cluster of $n$ hadrons\nrather than simply a single isolated hadron. However, the multidifferential\naspect of cross sections that rely on these latter types of fragmentation\nfunctions complicates the treatment of kinematical approximations in\nfactorization derivations. That has led to recent claims that the operator\ndefinitions for fragmentation functions need to be modified from the single\nhadron case with nonuniversal prefactors. With such concerns as our motivation,\nwe retrace the steps for factorizing the unpolarized semi-inclusive $e^+e^-$\nannihilation cross section and confirm that they do apply without modification\nto the case of a small-mass multihadron observed in the final state. In\nparticular, we verify that the standard operator definition from single hadron\nfragmentation, with its usual prefactor, remains equally valid for the\nsmall-mass $n$-hadron case with the same hard parts and evolution kernels,\nwhereas the more recently proposed definitions with nonuniversal prefactors do\nnot. Our results reaffirm the reliability of most past phenomenological\napplications of dihadron fragmentation functions.",

Further, we demonstrate that the quality of\ntask encoding inferred from representations predicts ICL performance, and that,\nsurprisingly, finetuning the earlier layers can improve the task encoding and\nperformance more than finetuning the latter layers.

The most important among these concepts are topology, which enables\nthe construction of robust zero-mode laser devices, and supersymmetry (SUSY),\nwhich holds the potential for achieving phase locking in laser arrays. In this\nwork, we show that the relation between supersymmetric coupled bosonic and\nfermionic oscillators on one side, and bipartite networks (and hence chiral\nsymmetry) on another side can be exploited together with non-Hermitian\nengineering for building one- and two-dimensional laser arrays with in-phase\nsynchronization. To demonstrate our strategy, we present a concrete design\nstarting from the celebrated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model to arrive at a\nSUSY laser structure that enjoys two key advantages over those reported in\nprevious works. Firstly, the design presented here features a near-uniform\ngeometry for both the laser array and supersymmetric reservoir (i.e. the widths\nand distances between the cavity arrays are almost the same). Secondly, the\nuniform field distribution in the presented structure leads to a far-field\nintensity that scales as N^2 where N is the number of lasing elements. Taken\ntogether, these two features can enable the implementation of higher-power\nlaser arrays that are easy to fabricate, and hence provide a roadmap for\npushing the frontier of SUSY laser arrays beyond the proof-of-concept phase.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in quantum computing software are gradually increasing\nthe scope and size of quantum programs being developed. At the same time,\nhowever, these larger programs provide more possibilities for functional errors\nthat are harder to detect and resolve. Meanwhile, debugging tools that could\naid developers in resolving these errors are still barely existent and far from\nwhat we take for granted in classical design automation and software\nengineering. As a result, even if one manages to identify the incorrect\nbehavior of a developed quantum program, detecting and resolving the underlying\nerrors in the program remains a time-consuming and tedious task. Moreover, the\nexponential growth of the state space in quantum programs makes the efficient\nmanual investigation of errors radically difficult even for respectively simple\nalgorithms, and almost impossible as the number of qubits increases. To address\nthis problem, this work proposes a debugging framework, available as an\nopen-source implementation at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-debugger. It\nassists developers in debugging errors in quantum programs, allowing them to\nefficiently identify the existence of errors and diagnose their causes. Users\nare given the ability to place assertions in the code that test for the\ncorrectness of a given algorithm and are evaluated using classical simulations\nof the underlying quantum program. Once an assertion fails, the proposed\nframework employs different diagnostic methods to point towards possible error\ncauses. This way, the debugging workload for quantum programs is drastically\nreduced.",

    "abstract": "The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($\\,a_{\\mu}\\,$) provides a\nstringent test of the quantum nature of the Standard Model (SM) and its\nextensions. To probe beyond the SM physics, one needs to be able to subtract\nthe SM contributions, which consists of a non-perturbative part, namely, the\nhadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) of the photon. The state of the art is to\npredominantly use two different methods to extract this HVP: lattice\ncomputation, and dispersion relation-based, data-driven method. Thus one can\nconstruct different forms of the ``$a_{\\mu}$ test\" which compares the precise\nmeasurement of $a_{\\mu}$ to its theory prediction. Additionally, this opens the\npossibility for another subtle test, where these two ``theory\" predictions\nthemselves are compared against each other, which is denoted as the\n``HVP-test\". This test is particularly sensitive to hadronic scale new physics.\nTherefore, in this work, we consider a SM extension consisting of a generic,\nlight $\\sim(100~{\\rm MeV}-1~{\\rm GeV})$ vector boson and study its impact on\nboth tests. We develop a comprehensive formalism for this purpose. We find that\nin the case of data-driven HVP being used in the $a_{\\mu}$ test, the new\nphysics contributions effectively cancels for a flavor-universal vector boson.\nAs an illustration of these general results, we consider two benchmark models:\ni)~the dark photon ($\\,A'\\,$) and ii)~a gauge boson coupled to baryon-number\n($\\,B\\,$). Using a combination of these tests, we are able to constrain the\nparameter space of $B$ and $A'$, complementarily to the existing limits. As a\nspin-off, our preliminary analysis of the spectrum of invariant mass of $3\\pi$\nin events with ISR at the $B-$ factories (BaBar, Belle) manifests the value of\nsuch a study in searching for $B\\to 3\\pi$ decay, thus motivating a dedicated\nsearch by experimental collaborations.",

A promising approach involves variational\nalgorithms, which combine classical Runge-Kutta methods with quantum\ncomputations. However, a rigorous error analysis, essential for assessing\nreal-world feasibility, has so far been lacking. In this paper, we provide an\nextensive analysis of error sources and determine the resource requirements\nneeded to achieve specific target errors. In particular, we derive analytical\nerror and resource estimates for scenarios with and without shot noise,\nexamining shot noise in quantum measurements and truncation errors in\nRunge-Kutta methods. Our analysis does not take into account representation\nerrors and hardware noise, as these are specific to the instance and the used\ndevice. We evaluate the implications of our results by applying them to two\nscenarios: classically solving a $1$D ordinary differential equation and\nsolving an option pricing linear partial differential equation with the\nvariational algorithm, showing that the most resource-efficient methods are of\norder 4 and 2, respectively. This work provides a framework for optimizing\nquantum resources when applying Runge-Kutta methods, enhancing their efficiency\nand accuracy in both solving differential equations and simulating quantum\nsystems. Further, this work plays a crucial role in assessing the suitability\nof these variational algorithms for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The\nresults may also be of interest to the numerical analysis community as they\ninvolve the accumulation of errors in the function description, a topic that\nhas hardly been explored even in the context of classical differential equation\nsolvers.",

We aim to address the observed\nmultiplicity of M dwarfs by conducting a systematic analysis using the latest\navailable astrophotometric data. For every star in a sample of 2214 M dwarfs\nfrom the CARMENES catalogue, we investigated the existence of resolved and\nunresolved physical companions in the literature and in all-sky surveys,\nespecially in Gaia DR3 data products. We covered a very wide range of\nseparations, from known spectroscopic binaries in tight arrangements $\\sim$0.01\nau to remarkably separated ultra-wide pairs ($\\sim$10$^5$ au). We identified\n835 M dwarfs in 720 multiple systems, predominantly binaries. Thus, we propose\n327 new binary candidates based on Gaia data. If these candidates are finally\nconfirmed, we expect the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs to be\n40.3$^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ %. When only considering the systems already identified,\nthe multiplicity fraction is reduced to 27.8$^{+1.9}_{-1.8}$ %. This result is\nin line with most of the values published in the literature. We also identified\nM-dwarf multiple systems with FGK, white dwarf, ultra-cool dwarf, and exoplanet\ncompanions, as well as those in young stellar kinematic groups. We studied\ntheir physical separations, orbital periods, binding energies, and mass ratios.\nWe argue that based on reliable astrometric data and spectroscopic\ninvestigations from the literature (even when considering detection biases),\nthe multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs could still be significantly\nunderestimated.

Using lattice simulations, we study\nthe classical dynamics of superconducting strings and confirm that they relax\nto the vorton configuration through Nambu-Goldstone boson radiation, with no\nevidence of over-shooting that would destabilize the vorton. We explore the\ntunneling of fermion zero modes out of the strings. Both our classical analysis\nand quantum calculations yield consistent results: the maximum energy of the\nzero mode significantly exceeds the fermion mass, in contrast to previous\nliterature. Additionally, we introduce a world-sheet formalism to evaluate the\ndecay rate of zero modes into other particles, which constitute the dominant\ndecay channel. We also identify additional processes that trigger zero-mode\ndecay due to non-adiabatic changes of the string configuration. In these decay\nprocesses, the rates are suppressed by the curvature of string loops, with\nexponential suppression for large masses of the final states.

This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other\nmethods are imprecise. However, the observed dispersion in rotation rates for\nsimilar coeval stars has historically been difficult to characterize. To\nproperly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized\ndata catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of $\\approx$8,000\nstars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr.\nWe have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which\naccurately captures observed rotational dispersion.

We recover cluster ages with a statistical\nuncertainty of 0.06 dex ($\\approx$15%), and individual stellar ages with a\nstatistical uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust\nsystematic tests to analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster\nmembership, and calibration ages. These contribute an additional 0.06 dex of\nuncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget of 0.08\ndex. We apply ChronoFlow to estimate ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC 6709, and the\nTheia 456 stellar stream.

The latter profile causes severe disagreement with\nthe observed bulk flow curve at $z < 0.1$ (Mazurenko et al.), so the tension\nwith higher redshift data further highlights that the deepest part of the KBC\nvoid is probably near its centre. The observations show a decline of $H_0(z)$\ntowards the background $Planck$ value in qualitative agreement with the\nconsidered models, even if we use a larger void.

Metallic helimagnets provide a realization\nof $p$-wave magnetism, but such order often occurs in systems lacking inversion\nsymmetry so that Rashba spin-orbit interactions can be prominent. An important\nquestion is therefore how the magnitude and the existence of $p$-wave spin\npolarization is affected by Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Here, we prove that\nwhile the $p$-wave symmetry of the spin-polarized bands is strictly speaking\nremoved by such spin-orbit interactions in helimagnets unless the period of the\nhelix is fine-tuned, the actual quantitative deviation from $p$-wave symmetry\nis extremely weak unless the period of the helix is only a few lattice sites.\nThereafter, we show that the $p$-wave magnetism becomes completely robust in\npairs of antiferromagnetically coupled helices. More precisely, the $p$-wave\nspin-polarization of the bands then appears regardless of the periodicity and\nregardless of the strength of the spin-orbit interactions.

Exploration can also be directed using intrinsic rewards,\nsuch as curiosity or model epistemic uncertainty. However, effectively\nbalancing task and intrinsic rewards is challenging and often task-dependent.\nIn this work, we introduce a framework, MaxInfoRL, for balancing intrinsic and\nextrinsic exploration. MaxInfoRL steers exploration towards informative\ntransitions, by maximizing intrinsic rewards such as the information gain about\nthe underlying task. When combined with Boltzmann exploration, this approach\nnaturally trades off maximization of the value function with that of the\nentropy over states, rewards, and actions. We show that our approach achieves\nsublinear regret in the simplified setting of multi-armed bandits. We then\napply this general formulation to a variety of off-policy model-free RL methods\nfor continuous state-action spaces, yielding novel algorithms that achieve\nsuperior performance across hard exploration problems and complex scenarios\nsuch as visual control tasks.",

We\nperform Monte Carlo simulations of BH and binary BH formation, evolution and\nmergers across the observed AGN mass function using a novel physically\nmotivated treatment for the gas-capture process derived from hydrodynamical\nsimulations of BH-BH encounters in AGN and varying assumptions on the AGN disc\nphysics. The results suggest that gas-captured binaries could result in merger\nrates of 0.73 - 7.1Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. Most mergers take place near the outer\nboundary of the accretion disk, but this may be subject to change when\nmigration is considered. The BH merger rate in the AGN channel in the Universe\nis dominated by AGN with supermassive BH masses on the order of 10$^{7}\nM_\\odot$ , with 90% of mergers occurring in the range 10$^{6} M_\\odot$ -\n10$^{8} M_\\odot$ . The merging mass distribution is flatter than the initial BH\nmass power law by a factor $\\Delta \\xi$ = 1.1 to 1.2, as larger BHs can align\nwith the disc and successfully form binaries more efficiently. Similarly, the\nmerging mass ratio distribution is flatter, therefore the AGN channel could\neasily explain the high mass and unequal mass ratio detections such as GW190521\nand GW190814. When modelling the BH binary formation process using a simpler\ndynamical friction treatment, we observe very similar results, where the\nprimary bottleneck is the alignment time with the disk. We find the most\ninfluential parameters on the rates are the anticipated number of BHs and their\nmass function.

We extend the results of Collins [1] by allowing for\nadditional noisy evolution on the spectator qubits in the $n$-qubit protocol.\nWe provide simple algebraic expressions that will determine when the $n$-qubit\nprotocol is superior and provide techniques that can alleviate certain types of\nnoise. We show that for certain types of noisy evolution the $n$-qubit protocol\nwill be inferior but for others it will be superior.",

Traditional\noptimization-based methods often require hours of computational time to\nreconstruct geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from\ndense multi-view inputs, while still struggling with inherent ambiguities\nbetween lighting and material. On the other hand, learning-based approaches\nleverage rich material priors from existing 3D object datasets but face\nchallenges with maintaining multi-view consistency. In this paper, we introduce\nIDArb, a diffusion-based model designed to perform intrinsic decomposition on\nan arbitrary number of images under varying illuminations.

To address this gap, we introduce\nCG-Bench, a novel benchmark designed for clue-grounded question answering in\nlong videos. CG-Bench emphasizes the model's ability to retrieve relevant clues\nfor questions, enhancing evaluation credibility. It features 1,219 manually\ncurated videos categorized by a granular system with 14 primary categories, 171\nsecondary categories, and 638 tertiary categories, making it the largest\nbenchmark for long video analysis. The benchmark includes 12,129 QA pairs in\nthree major question types: perception, reasoning, and hallucination.\nCompensating the drawbacks of pure MCQ-based evaluation, we design two novel\nclue-based evaluation methods: clue-grounded white box and black box\nevaluations, to assess whether the model generates answers based on the correct\nunderstanding of the video. We evaluate multiple closed-source and open-source\nMLLMs on CG-Bench. Results indicate that current models significantly\nunderperform in understanding long videos compared to short ones, and a\nsignificant gap exists between open-source and commercial models.

    "abstract": "The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation, which characterizes the signature of a\nstochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays\n(PTA), is derived using a harmonic formalism. This approach closely follows the\nframework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature\nfluctuations in the CMB. This parallel enables a direct comparison between the\ncorrelations observed in PTA and those in CMB. After providing analytic\nestimates of the transmission functions, we show that the covariance matrix in\nfrequency space becomes very non-diagonal. We then build formally the quadratic\nestimator for the HD correlation in multipolar space, for both a perfect\nexperiment, and for a realistic pulsar noise model. For a perfect experiment,\nwe show that the SNR grows with the observation time and the number of\nfrequency bins, in turn determined by the cadence of observation. For an\nimperfect experiment, the behaviour is similar, with an effective\nmultipole-dependent number of frequency, obtained after weighting with noise.\nWe predict that with $\\sim 200$ pulsars monitored for $25$ years, multipoles of\nthe HD correlation up to $\\ell=4$ can be measured. Our findings clarify that is\ncalled \\emph{cosmic variance} in previous literature is not an intrinsic\nlimitation for PTA measurements. Instead, with optimal estimators, it can be\nmitigated by accumulating more observation time or improving the cadence of\npulsar monitoring. Therefore, unlike CMB angular correlations, where cosmic\nvariance represents an irreducible constraint, it can be reduced in PTA\nmeasurements. Finally, we show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor\nfluctuations was very blue with $n_T>4$, the CMB angular correlation due to\nthese tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation. We also discuss the\ncase in which the graviton distribution function is anisotropic.",

However, sPA imaging is highly\nsusceptible to noise, leading to poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and\ncompromised image quality. Traditional denoising techniques like frame\naveraging, though effective in improving SNR, can be impractical for dynamic\nimaging scenarios due to reduced frame rates. Advanced methods, including\nlearning-based approaches and analytical algorithms, have demonstrated promise\nbut often require extensive training data and parameter tuning, limiting their\nadaptability for real-time clinical use. In this work, we propose a sPA\ndenoising using a tuning-free analytical and data-free enhancement (SPADE)\nframework for denoising sPA images. This framework integrates a data-free\nlearning-based method with an efficient BM3D-based analytical approach while\npreserves spectral linearity, providing noise reduction and ensuring that\nfunctional information is maintained. The SPADE framework was validated through\nsimulation, phantom, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments.

While this issue has been studied, it has not been\nestablished a clear threshold for a significant impact on the estimated\nphysical properties of galaxies due to accounting for both stellar and nebular\nemission. We analyse galaxies from SDSS-DR7 across a wide range of star-forming\nactivity levels, comparing the results obtained from two spectral fitting\ntools: FADO (which considers both stellar and nebular continuum) and STARLIGHT\n(only considers the stellar continuum). A strong linear correlation is found\nbetween the rest-frame H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ equivalent widths (EWs) and the\noptical nebular contribution, identifying these as reliable tracers. The\nresults show that when the nebular contribution exceeds 8% (corresponding to\nEW(H$\\alpha$)$\\simeq$500 \\r{A} and EW(H$\\beta$)$\\simeq$110 \\r{A}), there is a\nsignificant impact on the estimation of galaxy properties, namely stellar mass,\nage and metallicity. Our results highlight the importance of taking into\naccount both the stellar and nebular continuum when analysing the optical\nspectra of star-forming galaxies. In particular, this is a fundamental aspect\nfor galaxies with a rest-frame EW(H$\\alpha$)$\\gtrsim$500 \\r{A} (or the scaled\nvalue of 375 \\r{A} for pseudo-continuum measures). At low redshifts, this\nmostly impacts extreme emission line galaxies, while at higher redshifts it\nbecomes a dominant aspect given the higher star-forming activity in the younger\nUniverse.

When two drops meet at their contact line on a substrate, the\nliquid bridge connecting the two drops increases in size with time. The height\nand radius of the liquid bridge have a power law dependence on time. In the\nearly stage of drop coalescence, the exponents $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ of the\npower law are influenced by the properties of the polymer solution. We argued\nthat the balance between capillarity and viscoelasticity controls the process,\nwhere viscoelasticity must be considered in its full time and shear-rate\ndependency. As a simple proxy for the processes involved, the ratio of the\npolymer relaxation time to the viscous time of the drop, the elastocapillary\n($Ec$), is instructive. In the vicinity of $Ec= 1$ the exponents showed a\nminimum and increased to lower and higher values of $Ec$. A similar dependency\nis observed for the damping timescales of the capillary waves. For high\nelastocapillary numbers, i.e. high polymer relaxation time, drop coalescence on\nshort timescales behaved as in the low viscosity case. In addition, the bridge\nprofile is influenced by a combination of factors including surface tension,\nviscosity and polymer stress.

There are still many uncertainties, however,\nregarding the existence and habitability of these worlds. Here, we consider the\nretention of water during post-main-sequence evolution of a Sun-like star, and\nduring the subsequent migration of planets to the white dwarf's habitable zone.\nThis inward migration is driven by dynamical mechanisms such as planet-planet\ninteractions in packed systems, which can excite planets to high\neccentricities, setting the initial conditions for tidal migration into\nshort-period orbits. In order for water to persist on the surfaces of planets\norbiting white dwarfs, the water must first survive the AGB phase of stellar\nevolution, then avoid being lost due to photoevaporation due to X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation from the newly-formed white dwarf, and then\nfinally survive the tidal migration of the planet inwards to the habitable\nzone. We find that while this journey will likely desiccate large swaths of\npost-main-sequence planetary systems, planets with substantial reservoirs of\nwater may retain some surface water, especially if their migration occurs at\nlater white dwarf cooling ages. Therefore, although stellar evolution may pose\na challenge for the retention of water on exoplanet surfaces, it is possible\nfor planets to retain surface oceans even as their host stars die and their\norbits evolve.",

Through three-dimensional direct\nnumerical simulations, our findings reveal that introducing a secondary Thom\ndisk near the ground significantly reduces the three-dimensional flow pattern\ninduced by the ground, leading to a more uniform pressure distribution along\nthe rotor's surface. We also explore how the vertical placement of a secondary\nThom disk influences wake dynamics and aerodynamic forces.

    "abstract": "We discuss symmetrical monoidal $\\infty$-categoricalizations in relevant\n$p$-adic functional analysis and $p$-adic analytic geometry. Our motivation has\nthree sources relevant in $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence: one is the\ncorresponding foundation from Bambozzi-Ben-Bassat-Kremnizer on derived\nfunctional analysis and Clausen-Scholze on derived topologicalization, and the\nsecond one is representations of derived $E_1$-rings which is relevant in\nintegral deformed version of the $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence with\neventually Banach coefficients, and the third one is the corresponding\ncomparison of the solid quasicoherent sheaves over two kinds of generalized\nprismatization stackifications over small arc stacks and small $v$-stacks: one\nfrom the de Rham Robba stackification, and the other one from the de Rham\nprismatization stackification. Small arc stacks imperfectize the prismatization\nstackification, which will then perfectize the prismatization stackification\nwhen we regard them as small $v$-stacks. After Scholze's philosophy, one can in\nfact imperfectize those significant $v$-stacks in Fargues-Scholze to still have\nthe geometrization at least by using Berkovich motives. Both small arc-stacks\nand small $v$-stacks can be studied using local totally disconnectedness which\nis the key observation for condensed mathematics, theory of diamonds and\nperfectoid rings. Following Scholze, Richarz-Scholbach and Ayoub we then study\nthe $p$-adic local Langlands correspondence by using $p$-adic motivic\ncohomology theories. We study in some uniform way many significant $p$-adic\nmotivic cohomology theories in families, after the general framework and\nformalism in the recent work of Ayoub. We extend in some sense Ayoub's\nformalism after Scholze's recent theory of Berkovich motives, Scholze's theory\nof small $v$-stacks and Clausen-Scholze's analytic stacks.",

Indeed, the lack of asymmetry between the two main roads to the brain,\ni.e. the two optical nerves, leads to perturbations in the brain central\nconnectivity, namely between the two hemispheres inducing too robust\ninterhemispheric visual connections, beyond the critical period of 7-8 years.\nThe symmetrical mirror-connections like b-d (observed for about 60% of children\nwith dyslexia) or the non-symmetrical connections like b-b (35%) induce\nconfusions and duplications in observers with dyslexia but remain erasable\nthanks to pulsed systems (glasses, lamps, screens. . .), using Hebbian\nprocesses in primary cortex synapses.

First, handling the vast data\nfrom these instruments requires subdivision and multi-node processing.

This creates a critical\nchallenge in radio astronomy software: pipelines must be optimized to process\ndata efficiently, but unforeseen artefacts from increased sensitivity require\nongoing development of new techniques.

    "abstract": "Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) seeks to utilize source\ndomain data exclusively to enhance the generalization of semantic segmentation\nacross unknown target domains. Prevailing studies predominantly concentrate on\nfeature normalization and domain randomization, these approaches exhibit\nsignificant limitations. Feature normalization-based methods tend to confuse\nsemantic features in the process of constraining the feature space\ndistribution, resulting in classification misjudgment. Domain\nrandomization-based methods frequently incorporate domain-irrelevant noise due\nto the uncontrollability of style transformations, resulting in segmentation\nambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, named\nSCSD for Semantic Consistency prediction and Style Diversity generalization. It\ncomprises three pivotal components: Firstly, a Semantic Query Booster is\ndesigned to enhance the semantic awareness and discrimination capabilities of\nobject queries in the mask decoder, enabling cross-domain semantic consistency\nprediction. Secondly, we develop a Text-Driven Style Transform module that\nutilizes domain difference text embeddings to controllably guide the style\ntransformation of image features, thereby increasing inter-domain style\ndiversity. Lastly, to prevent the collapse of similar domain feature spaces, we\nintroduce a Style Synergy Optimization mechanism that fortifies the separation\nof inter-domain features and the aggregation of intra-domain features by\nsynergistically weighting style contrastive loss and style aggregation loss.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SCSD significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-theart methods. Notably, SCSD trained on GTAV\nachieved an average of 49.11 mIoU on the four unseen domain datasets,\nsurpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by +4.08 mIoU.

Existing adaptive methods predominantly rely\non deterministic formulations, while stochastic approaches often adopt a\ndoubly-stochastic framework with impractical variance assumptions, enforces a\nfixed number of lower-level iterations, and requires extensive tuning. In this\nwork, we focus on bilevel learning with strongly convex lower-level problems\nand a nonconvex sum-of-functions in the upper-level.

This resulted in a directed network with\nself-connections allowed. The model proposed by Abe and Suzuki for earthquake\nnetworks was followed. The incoming degree for each node was calculated, and\nthe degree distribution was analyzed. It was found that for each solar cycle,\nthe degree distribution follows a power law, indicating that solar flares tend\nto appear in correlated active zones rather than being evenly distributed.\nAdditionally, a variation in the characteristic exponent {\\gamma} for each\ncycle was observed, with higher values in even cycles compared to odd cycles. A\nmore detailed analysis was performed by constructing 11-year networks and\nshifting them in one-year intervals.

In\nboth workflows, radiologists reviewed the cases and modified either a standard\ntemplate (standard workflow) or an AI-generated draft report (AI-assisted\nworkflow) to create the final report. For controlled evaluation, we used GPT-4\nto generate simulated AI drafts and deliberately introduced 1-3 errors in half\nthe cases to mimic real AI system performance. The AI-assisted workflow\nsignificantly reduced average reporting time from 573 to 435 seconds (p=0.003),\nwithout a statistically significant difference in clinically significant errors\nbetween workflows. These findings suggest that AI-generated drafts can\nmeaningfully accelerate radiology reporting while maintaining diagnostic\naccuracy, offering a practical solution to address mounting workload challenges\nin clinical practice.",

Additionally, we are able to resolve a second set of peaks\nfor films with in-plane ferroelectric polarization. We hypothesize these\nresults to be due to either the Er3+ substituting different sites of the PbTiO3\ncrystal, differences in charges between the Er3+ dopant and the original\nsubstituent ion, or selection rules. Systematically studying the relationship\nbetween the Er3+ emission and the epitaxial strain of the ferroelectric matrix\nlays the pathway for future optical studies of spin manipulation by altering\nferroelectric order parameters",

    "abstract": "Metasurfaces, with their ability to control electromagnetic waves, hold\nimmense potential in optical device design, especially for applications\nrequiring precise control over dispersion. This work introduces an approach to\ndispersion engineering using heterogeneous freeform metasurfaces, which\novercomes the limitations of conventional metasurfaces that often suffer from\npoor transmission, narrow bandwidth, and restricted polarization responses. By\ntransitioning from single-layer, canonical meta-atoms to bilayer architectures\nwith non-intuitive geometries, our design decouples intrinsic material\nproperties (refractive index and group index), enabling independent engineering\nof phase and group delays as well as higher-order dispersion properties, while\nachieving high-efficiency under arbitrary polarization states. We implement a\ntwo-stage multi-objective optimization process to generate libraries of\nmeta-atoms, which are then utilized for the rapid design of\ndispersion-engineered metasurfaces. Additionally, we present a bilayer\nmetasurface stacking technique, paving the way for the realization of\nhigh-performance, dispersion-engineered optical devices. Our approach is\nvalidated through the demonstration of metasurfaces exhibiting superior\nchromatic aberration correction and broadband performance, with over 81%\naveraged efficiency across the 420-nm visible-to-near-infrared bandwidth. Our\nsynergistic combination of advanced design physics, powerful freeform\noptimization methods, and bi-layer nanofabrication techniques represents a\nsignificant breakthrough compared to the state-of-the-art while opening new\npossibilities for broadband metasurface applications.",

    "abstract": "It is thought that isolated neutron stars receive a natal kick velocity at\nbirth nearly aligned with their spin axis. Direct observational confirmation of\nthis alignment is currently limited to a single source in a supernova remnant\n(PSR J0538+2817), for which the three-dimensional velocity has been well\nconstrained. Meanwhile, pulsar polarisation statistics suggest the existence of\na spin-kick correlation, though both aligned and orthogonal cases remain\npossible. However, if the velocities of radiopulsars are predominantly aligned\nwith their spin axes, a systematic difference in the observed transverse\nvelocities of pulsars with small and large magnetic obliquities would be\nexpected. In particular, due to projection effects, weakly oblique rotators\nshould exhibit smaller, less scattered transverse velocities. Conversely, the\ntransverse velocities of pulsars with large magnetic inclination should reflect\ntheir actual three-dimensional velocities. This study uses this idea to analyse\nsamples of 13 weakly and 25 strongly oblique pulsars with known distances and\nproper motions. We find that their peculiar velocities are distributed\ndifferently, with statistical confidence levels of 0.007 and 0.016 according to\nthe Anderson-Darling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, respectively. We performed a\ndetailed population synthesis of isolated pulsars, considering the evolution of\ntheir viewing geometry in isotropic and spin-aligned kick scenarios. The\nobserved split in the transverse velocity distributions and its amplitude are\nconsistent with the spin-aligned kick model, but not with the isotropic case.\nAt the same time, an orthogonal kick would predict a similar effect, but with\nthe opposite sign. This provides robust support for pulsar spin kick alignment\nbased on statistics, independently of polarisation.",

We approach this problem from two\nangles. On the one hand, we derive a parameter-counting bound that scales with\nthe overall size of the neural networks. On the other hand, we provide a\nnorm-based bound that scales with the norms of neural networks' weight\nmatrices. Ignoring logarithmic factors, the bounds are independent of $k$, the\nsize of the tuples provided for contrastive learning. To the best of our\nknowledge, this property is only shared by one other work, which employed a\ndifferent proof strategy and suffers from very strong exponential dependence on\nthe depth of the network which is due to a use of the peeling technique. Our\nresults circumvent this by leveraging powerful results on covering numbers with\nrespect to uniform norms over samples. In addition, we utilize loss\naugmentation techniques to further reduce the dependency on matrix norms and\nthe implicit dependence on network depth. In fact, our techniques allow us to\nproduce many bounds for the contrastive learning setting with similar\narchitectural dependencies as in the study of the sample complexity of ordinary\nloss functions, thereby bridging the gap between the learning theories of\ncontrastive learning and DNNs.",

The resulting quantum gate\ncorresponds to the holonomy associated with the closed path traced by the\ncomputational space. The isoholonomic inequality for gates establishes a\nfundamental lower bound on the path length of such cyclic transports, which\ndepends only on the spectrum of the holonomy, that is, the eigenvalues of the\nimplemented quantum gate. The isoholonomic inequality also gives rise to an\nestimate of the minimum time required to execute a holonomic quantum gate,\nunderscoring the central role of the inequality in quantum computation. In this\npaper, we show that when the codimension of the computational space is\nsufficiently large, any quantum gate can be implemented using a parallel\ntransporting Hamiltonian in a way that saturates the isoholonomic inequality\nand the corresponding time estimate. We call such implementations tight.

In typical regions of moduli space, the fuzzy axion, the QCD axion, and\nother axions have comparable decay constants of $f_a \\approx 10^{16}$ GeV. We\nfind that overproduction of heavier axions is problematic, except at special\nloci in moduli space where decay constant hierarchies can occur: without a\ncontrived reheating epoch, it is necessary to fine-tune initial displacements.\nThe resulting dark matter is typically a mix of fuzzy axions and heavier\naxions, including the QCD axion. Dark photons are typically present as a\nconsequence of the orientifold projection. We examine the signatures of these\nmodels by simulating halos with multiple fuzzy axions, and by computing new\ncosmological constraints on ultralight axions and dark radiation.

Using the\ndensity-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase\nand the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase, we\nconstruct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) consistent with\nastrophysical constraints. Including hyperons and delta baryons soften the EoS,\nreducing maximum mass, while phase transition to the quark matter further\nsoftens the EoS, decreasing the speed of sound and hence the maximum mass. We\nconfirm the well-known overestimation of $f$-mode frequencies by the Cowling\napproximation (by about 10-30\\%) compared to full General Relativity\ncalculation, and show that this discrepancy persists across models including\nhyperons, $\\Delta$ baryons, and a phase transition to quark matter. While the\ndiscrepancy generally decreases with stellar mass, it increases near the\nmaximum mass in the presence of a phase transition compared to EoSs without\nthis phenomenology. We derive universal relations connecting the frequencies of\nthe $f$-mode to the average density, compactness, and tidal deformability,\nfinding significant deviations due to hyperons and delta baryons. These\ndeviations could provide distinct observational signatures in gravitational\nwave data, offering new insights into dense matter physics and advancing\ngravitational wave asteroseismology of neutron star interiors. Empirical\nrelations for mass-scaled and radius-scaled frequencies are also provided,\nhighlighting the importance of GR calculations for accurate modeling.",

    "abstract": "Drafting radiology reports is a complex task requiring flexibility, where\nradiologists tail content to available information and particular clinical\ndemands. However, most current radiology report generation (RRG) models are\nconstrained to a fixed task paradigm, such as predicting the full ``finding''\nsection from a single image, inherently involving a mismatch between inputs and\noutputs. The trained models lack the flexibility for diverse inputs and could\ngenerate harmful, input-agnostic hallucinations. To bridge the gap between\ncurrent RRG models and the clinical demands in practice, we first develop a\ndata generation pipeline to create a new MIMIC-RG4 dataset, which considers\nfour common radiology report drafting scenarios and has perfectly corresponded\ninput and output. Secondly, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) based\nRRG framework, namely LLM-RG4, which utilizes LLM's flexible\ninstruction-following capabilities and extensive general knowledge. We further\ndevelop an adaptive token fusion module that offers flexibility to handle\ndiverse scenarios with different input combinations, while minimizing the\nadditional computational burden associated with increased input volumes.\nBesides, we propose a token-level loss weighting strategy to direct the model's\nattention towards positive and uncertain descriptions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LLM-RG4 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both clinical\nefficiency and natural language generation on the MIMIC-RG4 and MIMIC-CXR\ndatasets. We quantitatively demonstrate that our model has minimal\ninput-agnostic hallucinations, whereas current open-source models commonly\nsuffer from this problem.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative Perception (CP) has shown a promising technique for autonomous\ndriving, where multiple connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) share their\nperception information to enhance the overall perception performance and expand\nthe perception range. However, in CP, ego CAV needs to receive messages from\nits collaborators, which makes it easy to be attacked by malicious agents. For\nexample, a malicious agent can send harmful information to the ego CAV to\nmislead it. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel method,\nCP-Guard, a tailored defense mechanism for CP that can be deployed by each\nagent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration\nnetwork. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a\nconflict against the ego CAV's perception results. Based on this idea, we first\ndevelop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively\nsample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior\nprobabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define a collaborative\nconsistency loss (CCLoss) to capture the discrepancy between the ego CAV and\nits collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus.\nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments in collaborative bird's eye view\n(BEV) tasks and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CP-Guard.

The current state of the art is driven by resource-intensive\nconstruction of models for every new domain-specific application. Such models\nmust be trained on enormous labeled datasets of unrelated objects (e.g., cars,\ntrains, animals) so that their ``knowledge'' can be transferred to new types of\nobjects. In this paper, we show how to leverage existing vision foundation\nmodels (VFMs) to reduce the incremental cost of creating few-shot segmentation\nmodels for new domains.

Theoretical studies of atmospheres on lava planets have assumed that\nconvection is the only process involved in setting the atmospheric temperature\nstructure. This significantly influences the ability for a magma ocean to cool.\nIt has been suggested that convective stability in these atmospheres could\npreclude permanent magma oceans. We develop a new 1D radiative-convective model\nin order to investigate when the atmospheres overlying magma oceans are\nconvectively stable. Using a coupled interior-atmosphere framework, we simulate\nthe early evolution of two terrestrial-mass exoplanets: TRAPPIST-1 c and HD\n63433 d. Our simulations suggest that the atmosphere of HD 63433 d exhibits\ndeep isothermal layers which are convectively stable. However, it is able to\nmaintain a permanent magma ocean and an atmosphere depleted in H2O. It is\npossible to maintain permanent magma oceans underneath atmospheres without\nconvection. Absorption features of CO2 and SO2 within synthetic emission\nspectra are associated with mantle redox state, meaning that future\nobservations of HD 63433 d may provide constraints on the geochemical\nproperties of a magma ocean analogous with the early Earth. Simulations of\nTRAPPIST-1 c indicate that it is expected to have solidified within 100 Myr,\noutgassing a thick atmosphere in the process. Cool isothermal stratospheres\ngenerated by low molecular-weight atmospheres can mimic the emission of an\natmosphere-less body.

However, these models heavily depend on a\nsubstantial amount of high-quality labeled data for training, which is often\ncostly to obtain. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), a promising\napproach is to utilize their exceptional zero-shot capabilities and extensive\nknowledge for node labeling. Despite encouraging results, this approach either\nrequires numerous queries to LLMs or suffers from reduced performance due to\nnoisy labels generated by LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce\nLocle, an active self-training framework that does Label-free node\nClassification with LLMs cost-Effectively. Locle iteratively identifies small\nsets of \"critical\" samples using GNNs and extracts informative pseudo-labels\nfor them with both LLMs and GNNs, serving as additional supervision signals to\nenhance model training. Specifically, Locle comprises three key components: (i)\nan effective active node selection strategy for initial annotations; (ii) a\ncareful sample selection scheme to identify \"critical\" nodes based on label\ndisharmonicity and entropy; and (iii) a label refinement module that combines\nLLMs and GNNs with a rewired topology. Extensive experiments on five benchmark\ntext-attributed graph datasets demonstrate that Locle significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods under the same query budget to LLMs in terms of\nlabel-free node classification. Notably, on the DBLP dataset with 14.3k nodes,\nLocle achieves an 8.08% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art at a\ncost of less than one cent.

Here we build an ESN to model the coarsening\ndynamics of charge-density waves (CDW) in a semi-classical Holstein model,\nwhich exhibits a checkerboard electron density modulation at half-filling\nstabilized by a commensurate lattice distortion. The inputs to the ESN are\nlocal CDW order-parameters in a finite neighborhood centered around a given\nsite, while the output is the predicted CDW order of the center site at the\nnext time step. Special care is taken in the design of couplings between hidden\nlayer and input nodes to ensure lattice symmetries are properly incorporated\ninto the ESN model. Since the model predictions depend only on CDW\nconfigurations of a finite domain, the ESN is scalable and transferrable in the\nsense that a model trained on dataset from a small system can be directly\napplied to dynamical simulations on larger lattices.

In agreement with quanta scaling theory, we find that\nagents optimize state loss in descending order of frequency, even though this\norder scales inversely with modelling complexity.

    "abstract": "Realistic shadow generation is a critical component for high-quality image\ncompositing and visual effects, yet existing methods suffer from certain\nlimitations: Physics-based approaches require a 3D scene geometry, which is\noften unavailable, while learning-based techniques struggle with control and\nvisual artifacts. We introduce a novel method for fast, controllable, and\nbackground-free shadow generation for 2D object images. We create a large\nsynthetic dataset using a 3D rendering engine to train a diffusion model for\ncontrollable shadow generation, generating shadow maps for diverse light source\nparameters. Through extensive ablation studies, we find that rectified flow\nobjective achieves high-quality results with just a single sampling step\nenabling real-time applications. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that\nthe model generalizes well to real-world images. To facilitate further research\nin evaluating quality and controllability in shadow generation, we release a\nnew public benchmark containing a diverse set of object images and shadow maps\nin various settings.

Recent government regulations have shifted this focus to\nanother important area related to engine health and performance monitoring.\nAlthough the advancements in the use of deep learning methods for system\nmonitoring have shown promising results in this direction, designing efficient\nmethods suitable for field systems remains an open research challenge. The\nobjective of this study is to develop a computationally efficient neural\nnetwork-based approach for identifying unknown parameters of a mean value\ndiesel engine model to facilitate physics-based health monitoring and\nmaintenance forecasting. We propose a hybrid method combining physics informed\nneural networks, PINNs, and a deep neural operator, DeepONet to predict unknown\nparameters and gas flow dynamics in a diesel engine. The operator network\npredicts independent actuator dynamics learnt through offline training, thereby\nreducing the PINNs online computational cost. To address PINNs need for\nretraining with changing input scenarios, we propose two transfer learning (TL)\nstrategies. The first strategy involves multi-stage transfer learning for\nparameter identification. While this method is computationally efficient as\ncompared to online PINN training, improvements are required to meet field\nrequirements. The second TL strategy focuses solely on training the output\nweights and biases of a subset of multi-head networks pretrained on a larger\ndataset, substantially reducing computation time during online prediction. We\nalso evaluate our model for epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by\nincorporating dropout in pretrained networks and Gaussian noise in the training\ndataset.

Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular\nLLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference\nand are causally linked to the model's predictions.

While recent\nmultimodal models have achieved significant progress by aligning pairs of\nmodalities via contrastive learning, their solutions are unsuitable when\nscaling to multiple modalities. These models typically align each modality to a\ndesignated anchor without ensuring the alignment of all modalities with each\nother, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring a joint\nunderstanding of multiple modalities. In this paper, we structurally rethink\nthe pairwise conventional approach to multimodal learning and we present the\nnovel Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM), which overcomes the\nabove-mentioned limitations. GRAM learns and then aligns $n$ modalities\ndirectly in the higher-dimensional space in which modality embeddings lie by\nminimizing the Gramian volume of the $k$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by\nthe modality vectors, ensuring the geometric alignment of all modalities\nsimultaneously. GRAM can replace cosine similarity in any downstream method,\nholding for 2 to $n$ modalities and providing more meaningful alignment with\nrespect to previous similarity measures. The novel GRAM-based contrastive loss\nfunction enhances the alignment of multimodal models in the higher-dimensional\nembedding space, leading to new state-of-the-art performance in downstream\ntasks such as video-audio-text retrieval and audio-video classification.

    "abstract": "Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a\nfractionalization distinct from the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\mathcal{C}}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\mathcal{R}}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\mathcal{T}}$\nfor scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by\ninternal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension\nof the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is\ndefined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the\nspacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion\n(dim$_{\\mathbb{R}}\\chi_{\\mathcal{C}\\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension\nof Dirac fermion (dim$_{\\mathbb{R}}\\psi_{\\mathcal{C}\\ell(d)}$), rather than\nbeing half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana\nfermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To\ninclude these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in\n$n_{\\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of\nthe real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian\nformalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general\ndimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of\nthe complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we\ndiscover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity\nthat is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain\ndimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal\nsymmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall\nreduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries\nacross different dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Social and economic networks are often multiplexed, meaning that people are\nconnected by different types of relationships -- such as borrowing goods and\ngiving advice. We make three contributions to the study of multiplexing. First,\nwe document empirical multiplexing patterns in Indian village data:\nrelationships such as socializing, advising, helping, and lending are\ncorrelated but distinct, while commonly used proxies for networks based on\nethnicity and geography are nearly uncorrelated with actual relationships.\nSecond, we examine how these layers and their overlap affect information\ndiffusion in a field experiment. The advice network is the best predictor of\ndiffusion, but combining layers improves predictions further. Villages with\ngreater overlap between layers (more multiplexing) experience less overall\ndiffusion. This leads to our third contribution: developing a model and\ntheoretical results about diffusion in multiplex networks. Multiplexing slows\nthe spread of simple contagions, such as diseases or basic information, but can\neither impede or enhance the spread of complex contagions, such as new\ntechnologies, depending on their virality. Finally, we identify differences in\nmultiplexing by gender and connectedness. These have implications for\ninequality in diffusion-mediated outcomes such as access to information and\nadherence to norms.",

To\nenhance interpretability and generalization properties, it has been proposed to\nfavor small decision trees. Accordingly, in the minimum-size decision tree\ntraining problem (MSDT), the input is a set of training examples in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ with class labels and we aim to find a decision tree that\nclassifies all training examples correctly and has a minimum number of nodes.\nMSDT is NP-hard and therefore presumably not solvable in polynomial time.\nNevertheless, Komusiewicz et al.

    "abstract": "Hydroelectric power generation is a critical component of the global energy\nmatrix, particularly in countries like Brazil, where it represents the majority\nof the energy supply. However, its strong dependence on river discharges, which\nare inherently uncertain due to climate variability, poses significant\nchallenges. River discharges are linked to precipitation patterns, making the\ndevelopment of accurate probabilistic forecasting models crucial for improving\noperational planning in systems heavily reliant on this resource.\nTraditionally, statistical models have been used to represent river discharges\nin energy optimization. Yet, these models are increasingly unable to produce\nrealistic scenarios due to structural shifts in climate behavior. Changes in\nprecipitation patterns have altered discharge dynamics, which traditional\napproaches struggle to capture. Machine learning methods, while effective as\nuniversal predictors for time series, often focus solely on historical data,\nignoring key external factors such as meteorological and climatic conditions.\nFurthermore, these methods typically lack a probabilistic framework, which is\nvital for representing the inherent variability of hydrological processes. The\nlimited availability of historical discharge data further complicates the\napplication of large-scale deep learning models to this domain. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a framework based on a modified recurrent neural\nnetwork architecture. This model generates parameterized probability\ndistributions conditioned on projections from global circulation models,\neffectively accounting for the stochastic nature of river discharges.\nAdditionally, the architecture incorporates enhancements to improve its\ngeneralization capabilities.

The\ndevelopment of a reliable, accurate, available and inexpensive method to\npredict the molecular subtypes using medical images plays an important role in\nthe diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. Recently, deep learning methods\nhave shown good performance in the breast cancer classification tasks using\nvarious medical images. Despite all that success, classical deep learning\ncannot deliver the predictive uncertainty. The uncertainty represents the\nvalidity of the predictions. Therefore, the high predicted uncertainty might\ncause a negative effect in the accurate diagnosis of breast cancer molecular\nsubtypes. To overcome this, uncertainty quantification methods are used to\ndetermine the predictive uncertainty. Accordingly, in this study, we proposed\nan uncertainty-aware Bayesian deep learning model using the full mammogram\nimages. In addition, to increase the performance of the multi-class molecular\nsubtype classification task, we proposed a novel hierarchical classification\nstrategy, named the two-stage classification strategy. The separate AUC of the\nproposed model for each subtype was 0.71, 0.75 and 0.86 for HER2-enriched,\nluminal and triple-negative classes, respectively.

Recent research suggests\nthat generalization techniques can improve the balance between privacy and\nutility. One focus of this work is sharpness-aware training (SAT) and its\nintegration with differential privacy (DP-SAT) to further improve this balance.\nAdditionally, we examine fairness in both private and non-private learning\nmodels trained on datasets with synthetic and real-world biases. We also\nmeasure the privacy risks involved in these scenarios by performing membership\ninference attacks (MIAs) and explore the consequences of eliminating\nhigh-privacy risk samples, termed outliers. Moreover, we introduce a new\nmetric, named \\emph{harmonic score}, which combines accuracy, privacy, and\nfairness into a single measure.\n  Through empirical analysis using generalization techniques, we achieve an\naccuracy of 81.11\\% under $(8, 10^{-5})$-DP on CIFAR-10, surpassing the 79.5\\%\nreported by De et al.

Moreover, our experiments show that memorization\nof training samples can begin before the overfitting point, and generalization\ntechniques do not guarantee the prevention of this memorization. Our analysis\nof synthetic biases shows that generalization techniques can amplify model bias\nin both private and non-private models. Additionally, our results indicate that\nincreased bias in training data leads to reduced accuracy, greater\nvulnerability to privacy attacks, and higher model bias. We validate these\nfindings with the CelebA dataset, demonstrating that similar trends persist\nwith real-world attribute imbalances.

    "abstract": "A primary target of the \\Euclid space mission is to constrain early-universe\nphysics by searching for deviations from a primordial Gaussian random field. A\nsignificant detection of primordial non-Gaussianity would rule out the simplest\nmodels of cosmic inflation and transform our understanding of the origin of the\nUniverse. This paper forecasts how well field-level inference of galaxy\nredshift surveys can constrain the amplitude of local primordial\nnon-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$), within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, in the\nupcoming \\Euclid data. We design and simulate mock data sets and perform Markov\nchain Monte Carlo analyses using a full-field forward modelling approach. By\nincluding the formation history of the cosmic matter field in the analysis, the\nmethod takes into account all available probes of primordial non-Gaussianity,\nand goes beyond statistical summary estimators of $f_{NL}$. Probes include, for\nexample, two-point and higher-order statistics, peculiar velocity fields, and\nscale-dependent galaxy biases. Furthermore, the method simultaneously handles\nsystematic survey effects, such as selection effects, survey geometries, and\ngalaxy biases. The forecast shows that the method can reach precision levels of\nup to $\\sigma (f_{NL}) = 2.3$ (68.3\\% CI, and at the grid resolution $\\Delta L\n= 62.5\\,h^{-1}$Mpc) with \\Euclid data. We also provide data products, including\nrealistic $N$-body simulations with nonzero values of $f_{NL}$ and maps of\nadiabatic curvature fluctuations. The results underscore the feasibility and\nadvantages of field-level inference to constrain $f_{NL}$ in galaxy redshift\nsurveys. Our approach consistently captures all the information available in\nthe large-scale structure to constrain $f_{NL}$, and resolves the degeneracy\nbetween early-universe physics and late-time gravitational effects, while\nmitigating the impact of systematic and observational effects.",

We present DRUM (Diffusion-based Runoff Model), a\ngenerative AI solution for probabilistic runoff prediction. DRUM builds up an\niterative refinement process that generates ensemble runoff estimates from\nnoise, guided by past meteorological conditions, present meteorological\nforecasts, and static catchment attributes. This framework allows learning\ncomplex hydrological behaviors without imposing explicit distributional\nassumptions, particularly benefiting extreme event prediction and uncertainty\nquantification. Using data from 531 representative basins across the contiguous\nUnited States, DRUM outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods in\nrunoff forecasting regarding both deterministic and probabilistic skills, with\nparticular advantages in extreme flow (0.1%) predictions. DRUM demonstrates\nsuperior flood early warning skill across all magnitudes and lead times (1-7\ndays), achieving F1 scores near 0.4 for extreme events under perfect forecasts\nand maintaining robust performance with operational forecasts, especially for\nlonger lead times and high-magnitude floods. When applied to climate\nprojections through the 21st century, DRUM reveals increasing flood\nvulnerability in 47.8-57.1% of basins across emission scenarios, with\nparticularly elevated risks along the West Coast and Southeast regions.

    "abstract": "Word-by-word language model surprisal is often used to model the incremental\nprocessing of human readers, which raises questions about how various choices\nin language modeling influence its predictive power. One factor that has been\noverlooked in cognitive modeling is the granularity of subword tokens, which\nexplicitly encodes information about word length and frequency, and ultimately\ninfluences the quality of vector representations that are learned. This paper\npresents experiments that manipulate the token granularity and evaluate its\nimpact on the ability of surprisal to account for processing difficulty of\nnaturalistic text and garden-path constructions. Experiments with naturalistic\nreading times reveal a substantial influence of token granularity on surprisal,\nwith tokens defined by a vocabulary size of 8,000 resulting in surprisal that\nis most predictive. In contrast, on garden-path constructions, language models\ntrained on coarser-grained tokens generally assigned higher surprisal to\ncritical regions, suggesting a greater sensitivity to garden-path effects than\npreviously reported. Taken together, these results suggest a large role of\ntoken granularity on the quality of language model surprisal for cognitive\nmodeling.",

This not only\ncomplicates the coherent description near the spectral singularities where the\nresponse qualitatively changes, but also impedes the application to practical\nsystems. Here we develop a general response theory of non-Hermitian systems\nthat uniformly applies across all spectral scenarios. We unravel this response\nby formulating uniform expansions of the spectral quantization condition and\nGreen's function, where both expansions exclusively involve directly calculable\ndata from the Hamiltonian. This data smoothly varies with external parameters\nas spectral singularities are approached, and nevertheless captures the\nqualitative differences of the response in these scenarios. We furthermore\npresent two direct applications of this framework. Firstly, we determine the\nprecise conditions for spectral degeneracies of geometric multiplicity greater\nthan unity, as well as the perturbative behavior around these cases. Secondly,\nwe formulate a hierarchy of spectral response strengths that varies\ncontinuously across all parameter space, and thereby also reliably determines\nthe response strength of exceptional points. Finally, we demonstrate both\ngenerally and in concrete examples that the previously inaccessible scenarios\nof higher geometric multiplicity result in unique variants of super-Lorentzian\nresponse.

    "abstract": "The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm~II (NSGA-II) is the most popular\nmulti-objective optimization heuristic. Recent mathematical runtime analyses\nhave detected two shortcomings in discrete search spaces, namely, that the\nNSGA-II has difficulties with more than two objectives and that it is very\nsensitive to the choice of the population size. To overcome these difficulties,\nwe analyze a simple tie-breaking rule in the selection of the next population.\nSimilar rules have been proposed before, but have found only little acceptance.\nWe prove the effectiveness of our tie-breaking rule via mathematical runtime\nanalyses on the classic OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and\nOneJumpZeroJump benchmarks. We prove that this modified NSGA-II can optimize\nthe three benchmarks efficiently also for many objectives, in contrast to the\nexponential lower runtime bound previously shown for OneMinMax with three or\nmore objectives. For the bi-objective problems, we show runtime guarantees that\ndo not increase when moderately increasing the population size over the minimum\nadmissible size. For example, for the OneJumpZeroJump problem with\nrepresentation length $n$ and gap parameter $k$, we show a runtime guarantee of\n$O(\\max\\{n^{k+1},Nn\\})$ function evaluations when the population size is at\nleast four times the size of the Pareto front. For population sizes larger than\nthe minimal choice $N = \\Theta(n)$, this result improves considerably over the\n$\\Theta(Nn^k)$ runtime of the classic NSGA-II.",

    "abstract": "Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) enables fast adaptation to new testing\ntasks. Despite recent advancements, it is still challenging to learn performant\npolicies across multiple complex and high-dimensional tasks. To address this,\nwe propose a novel architecture with three hierarchical levels for 1) learning\ntask representations, 2) discovering task-agnostic macro-actions in an\nautomated manner, and 3) learning primitive actions. The macro-action can guide\nthe low-level primitive policy learning to more efficiently transition to goal\nstates. This can address the issue that the policy may forget previously\nlearned behavior while learning new, conflicting tasks. Moreover, the\ntask-agnostic nature of the macro-actions is enabled by removing task-specific\ncomponents from the state space. Hence, this makes them amenable to\nre-composition across different tasks and leads to promising fast adaptation to\nnew tasks. Also, the prospective instability from the tri-level hierarchies is\neffectively mitigated by our innovative, independently tailored training\nschemes. Experiments in the MetaWorld framework demonstrate the improved sample\nefficiency and success rate of our approach compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

We showed that\nhigh frequency exact solutions are well approximated in $H^1$ by much simpler\napproximate solutions constructed from explicit solutions to profile equations.\nThat result depends on two geometric assumptions, referred to here as the\ngrazing set (GS) and reflected flow map (RFM) assumptions, that are both\ndifficult to verify in general. The GS assumption states that the grazing set,\nthat is, the set of points on the spacetime boundary at which incoming\ncharacteristics meet the boundary tangentially, is a codimension two, $C^1$\nsubmanifold of spacetime. The second is that the reflected flow map, which\nsends points on the spacetime boundary forward in time to points on reflected\nand grazing rays, is injective and has appropriate regularity properties near\nthe grazing set. In this paper we analyze these assumptions for incoming plane,\nspherical, and more general ``convex waves\" when the governing hyperbolic\noperator is the wave operator $\\Box:=\\Delta-\\partial_t^2$.

We then cluster these synthetic\ndemonstrations, sample specific sets of in-context demonstrations from each\ncluster, and predict entity mentions using each set independently. Finally, we\nuse self-verification to select the final set of entity mentions.

We study the growth of PBH masses in the early Universe due to\nthe accretion of radiation, highlighting uncertainties which arise from\nestimates of the PBH formation time. For baryonic accretion, we review the\ntraditional Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) and its refined version known as the\nPark-Ricotti (PR) model, which also includes radiative feedback. We find that\nin the BHL model, PBHs heavier than $\\sim 100 \\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ can grow in\nmass by several orders of magnitude by $z \\lesssim 10$, though only when\nsurrounded by DM halos and only when the accretion efficiency is large. By\ncontrast, the inclusion of radiation feedback in the PR model can drastically\nsuppress the baryonic accretion rate of PBHs, leading to a negligible change in\nPBH mass over cosmic time. Furthermore our calculations show that the accretion\nrate depends sensitively on the modelling of various parameters such as the\nspeed of sound in the baryonic gas and the velocity of PBHs. These findings\nhighlight the uncertainties associated with accretion onto PBHs, and we find\nthat a large increase in the PBH mass due to accretion is by no means\nguaranteed.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but\noften suffer from hallucinations. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers\nan effective solution by incorporating external knowledge, but existing methods\nstill face several limitations: additional deployment costs of separate\nretrievers, redundant input tokens from retrieved text chunks, and the lack of\njoint optimization of retrieval and generation. To address these issues, we\npropose \\textbf{RetroLLM}, a unified framework that integrates retrieval and\ngeneration into a single, cohesive process, enabling LLMs to directly generate\nfine-grained evidence from the corpus with constrained decoding. Moreover, to\nmitigate false pruning in the process of constrained evidence generation, we\nintroduce (1) hierarchical FM-Index constraints, which generate\ncorpus-constrained clues to identify a subset of relevant documents before\nevidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding space; and (2) a\nforward-looking constrained decoding strategy, which considers the relevance of\nfuture sequences to improve evidence accuracy. Extensive experiments on five\nopen-domain QA datasets demonstrate RetroLLM's superior performance across both\nin-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

While several proposals\nfor the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum exist, less\nattention has been paid to other quantum resources, such as non-stabilizerness,\ncommonly dubbed {\\em magic} and quantified by the Stabilizer R\\'enyi Entropy\n(SRE). In this work, we show how to harvest SRE from the vacuum state of a\nmassless field using accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detectors in Minkowski spacetime.\nIn particular, one can harvest a particular non-local form of SRE that cannot\nbe erased by local unitary operations. This non-local SRE is a fundamental\nquantity to study the interplay between entanglement and non-stabilizer\nresources. We conclude our work with an analysis of the CHSH inequalities: when\nrestricting to stabilizer measurements, i.e. Pauli measurements, one cannot\nextract a violation from the quantum field.",

VLM classification can be\nimproved with descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). However,\nit is difficult to determine the contribution of actual description semantics,\nas the performance gain may also stem from a semantic-agnostic ensembling\neffect, where multiple modified text prompts act as a noisy test-time\naugmentation for the original one. We propose an alternative evaluation\nscenario to decide if a performance boost of LLM-generated descriptions is\ncaused by such a noise augmentation effect or rather by genuine description\nsemantics. The proposed scenario avoids noisy test-time augmentation and\nensures that genuine, distinctive descriptions cause the performance boost.\nFurthermore, we propose a training-free method for selecting discriminative\ndescriptions that work independently of classname-ensembling effects. Our\napproach identifies descriptions that effectively differentiate classes within\na local CLIP label neighborhood, improving classification accuracy across seven\ndatasets.

Extensive experiments across various robot types and assistive tasks\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework not only enhances task success and\nefficiency but also significantly improves user satisfaction, paving the way\nfor more personalized and adaptive assistive robotic systems.

Solutions of the\nNavier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system exhibit strong non-local effects due to the\nvelocity divergence constraint and the fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard operator. We\nsuggest a new first-order approximative system for the inviscid sub-system. It\nrelies on the artificial-compressibility ansatz for the Navier-Stokes\nequations, a friction-type approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and a\nrelaxation of a third-order capillarity term. We show under reasonable\nassumptions that the first-order operator within the approximative system is\nhyperbolic; precisely we prove for the spatially one-dimensional case that it\nis equipped with an entropy-entropy flux pair with convex (mathematical)\nentropy. For specific states we present a numerical characteristic analysis.\nThanks to the hyperbolicity of the system, we can employ all standard numerical\nmethods from the field of hyperbolic conservation laws. We conclude the paper\nwith preliminary numerical results in one spatial dimension.",

Both gaps are formed from the narrow Drude\ncomponent, whereas the broad Drude component remains ungapped. The calculated\nfrom infrared data total dc resistivity of the films with Ni contents $x=0.05$\nand $x=0.08$ as well as the low-temperature scattering rate for the narrow\nDrude component show a hidden Fermi-liquid behavior.

It is shown that\noxygen-assisted, Ni diffusion to the top surface of the metallic contact\nthrough the formation of a nickel oxide (NiOx) is accompanied by Au diffusion\ndown to the GaN surface, and by Ga out-diffusion through the GaN/metal\ninterface. Electrical characterizations of the contact by Transmission Line\nMethod (TLM) show that an ohmic contact is obtained as soon as a thin, Au-Ga\ninterfacial layer is formed, even after complete diffusion of Ni or NiOx to the\ntop surface of the contact. Our results clarify that the presence of Ni or NiOx\nat the interface is not the main origin of the ohmic-like behavior in such\ncontacts. Auto-cleaning of the interface during the interdiffusion process may\nplay a role, but TEM-EDX analysis evidences that the creation of Ga vacancies\nassociated to the formation of a Ga-Au interfacial layer is crucial for\nreducing the Schottky barrier height, and maximizing the amount of current\nflowing through the contact.",

Recent reports on the bottom-up synthesis of\nantiferromagnetic molecular spin chains provided insights into paradigmatic\nquantum phenomena such as fractionalization. In contrast to antiferromagnetism,\ndemonstration of ferromagnetic coupling between PCHs has been scarce. Previous\nattempts in this direction were limited by the formation of non-benzenoid rings\nleading to spin quenching, or the use of spacer motifs that considerably weaken\nthe magnitude of ferromagnetic exchange. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface\nsynthesis of short ferromagnetic spin chains based on dibenzotriangulene (DBT),\na PCH with a triplet ground state. Our synthetic strategy centers on achieving\na direct (that is, without a spacer motif) majority-minority sublattice\ncoupling between adjacent units. This leads to a global sublattice imbalance in\nspin chains scaling with the chain length, and therefore a ferromagnetic ground\nstate with a strong intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange. By means of scanning\nprobe measurements and multiconfigurational quantum chemistry calculations, we\nanalyze the electronic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic dimers and\ntrimers of DBT, and confirm their quintet and septet ground states,\nrespectively, with an intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange of 7 meV.\nFurthermore, we elucidate the role of sublattice coupling on magnetism through\ncomplementary experiments on antiferromagnetic DBT dimers with\nmajority-majority and minority-minority couplings.

Evaluate potential bias in IT-LLM codings. Methods:\nAnalyzing publicly available text narratives of police-public interactions\nrecorded by Boston Police Department, we provide humans and IT-LLMs with\nqualitative labelling codebooks and compare labels generated by both, seeking\nto identify situations associated with (i) mental ill health; (ii) substance\nmisuse; (iii) alcohol dependence; and (iv) homelessness. We explore multiple\nprompting strategies and model sizes, and the variability of labels generated\nby repeated prompts. Additionally, to explore model bias, we utilize\ncounterfactual methods to assess the impact of two protected characteristics -\nrace and gender - on IT-LLM classification. Results: Results demonstrate that\nIT-LLMs can effectively support human qualitative coding of police incident\nnarratives. While there is some disagreement between LLM and human generated\nlabels, IT-LLMs are highly effective at screening narratives where no\nvulnerabilities are present, potentially vastly reducing the requirement for\nhuman coding. Counterfactual analyses demonstrate that manipulations to both\ngender and race of individuals described in narratives have very limited\neffects on IT-LLM classifications beyond those expected by chance. Conclusions:\nIT-LLMs offer effective means to augment human qualitative coding in a way that\nrequires much lower levels of resource to analyze large unstructured datasets.\nMoreover, they encourage specificity in qualitative coding, promote\ntransparency, and provide the opportunity for more standardized, replicable\napproaches to analyzing large free-text police data sources.",

Each MIR is a minimal equivalence relation on variable\noccurrences that results in inconsistency, while each MCR is a maximal\nequivalence relation designed to prevent inconsistency. Notably, MIRs capture\nconflicts overlooked by minimal inconsistent subsets. Using MCRs, we develop a\nseries of non-explosive inference relations. The main strategy involves\nrestoring consistency by modifying the propositional base according to each\nMCR, followed by employing the classical inference relation to derive\nconclusions. Additionally, we propose an unusual semantics that assigns truth\nvalues to variable occurrences instead of the variables themselves.

Event camera, a bio-inspired sensor\noffering continuous visual information could enhance the deblurring\nperformance. Effectively utilizing the high-temporal-resolution event data is\ncrucial for extracting precise motion information and enhancing deblurring\nperformance. However, existing event-based image deblurring methods usually\nutilize voxel-based event representations, losing the fine-grained temporal\ndetails that are mathematically essential for fast motion deblurring. In this\npaper, we first introduce point cloud-based event representation into the image\ndeblurring task and propose a Multi-Temporal Granularity Network (MTGNet). It\ncombines the spatially dense but temporally coarse-grained voxel-based event\nrepresentation and the temporally fine-grained but spatially sparse point\ncloud-based event.

Our empirical evaluation investigates how SB-MoE\ncompares, in terms of retrieval effectiveness, to standard fine-tuning.

The findings show the effectiveness of SB-MoE especially for\nDRMs with a low number of parameters (i.e., TinyBERT), as it consistently\noutperforms the fine-tuned underlying model on all four benchmarks.

The well-known \"declarative vs. procedural\ncontroversy\" is concerned with the choice of utilizing declarations or\nprocedures as the primary mode of knowledge representation. The ongoing debate\nbetween symbolic AI and connectionist AI also revolves around the question of\nwhether knowledge should be represented implicitly (e.g., as parametric\nknowledge in deep learning and large language models) or explicitly (e.g., as\nlogical theories in traditional knowledge representation and reasoning). To\naddress these issues, we propose a general framework to capture various\nknowledge representation formalisms in which we are interested. Within the\nframework, we find a family of universal knowledge representation formalisms,\nand prove that all universal formalisms are recursively isomorphic. Moreover,\nwe show that all pairwise intertranslatable formalisms that admit the padding\nproperty are also recursively isomorphic.

Leveraging the assumption that the causal\noutcome model remains invariant across heterogeneous environments,\nstate-of-the-art methods attempt to identify causal outcome models by learning\ninvariant prediction models and rely on exhaustive searches over all\n(exponentially many) covariate subsets. These approaches present two major\nchallenges: 1) determining the conditions under which the invariant prediction\nmodel aligns with the causal outcome model, and 2) devising computationally\nefficient causal discovery algorithms that scale polynomially, instead of\nexponentially, with the number of covariates. To address both challenges, we\nfocus on the additive intervention regime and propose nearly necessary and\nsufficient conditions for ensuring that the invariant prediction model matches\nthe causal outcome model. Exploiting the essentially necessary identifiability\nconditions, we introduce Negative Weight Distributionally Robust Optimization\n(NegDRO), a nonconvex continuous minimax optimization whose global optimizer\nrecovers the causal outcome model. Unlike standard group DRO problems that\nmaximize over the simplex, NegDRO allows negative weights on environment\nlosses, which break the convexity. Despite its nonconvexity, we demonstrate\nthat a standard gradient method converges to the causal outcome model, and we\nestablish the convergence rate with respect to the sample size and the number\nof iterations. Our algorithm avoids exhaustive search, making it scalable\nespecially when the number of covariates is large. The numerical results\nfurther validate the efficiency of the proposed method.",

The Unruh state is designed to be a\nstate that mimics the late-time behaviors of quantized fields that Hawking\npredicted for the black holes that form from collapse. Evidence is provided\nthat the late-time behaviors of some of the modes of the quantum fields and the\nsymmetric two-point function are determined by infrared effects. In four\ndimensions, a spacetime is considered in which a black hole forms from the\ncollapse of a spherically symmetric null shell. A method is developed to\ncompute the semi-classical stress-energy tensor for a massless\nminimally-coupled scalar field in the $in$ vacuum state outside the event\nhorizon of the black hole. The computation of the stress-energy tensor involves\nfinding the mode solutions of the scalar field and renormalizing the\nstress-energy tensor. The former has been done by expanding the modes of the\nscalar field in terms of a complete set of modes for an eternal Schwarzschild\nblack hole. The latter is done by subtracting the stress-energy tensor for the\nscalar field in the Unruh state. The computation of the mode solutions of the\nscalar field in the $in$ vacuum state is discussed. The results are shown for\nthree cases. They are the continuity of the modes for the scalar field across\nthe null shell surface, their high-frequency behaviors for a fixed spacetime\npoint, and their late-time behaviors for a fixed frequency and a fixed spatial\npoint. The preliminary results for the contribution to the stress-energy tensor\nfrom the part of the scalar field modes that are ingoing inside the null shell\nare presented and an approximation for the contribution to the stress-energy\ntensor from the part of the modes that are outgoing inside the null shell is\ndiscussed.",

    "abstract": "We show the existence of a phase transition between a localisation and a\nnon-localisation regime for a branching random walk with a catalyst at the\norigin. More precisely, we consider a continuous-time branching random walk\nthat jumps at rate one, with simple random walk jumps on $\\mathbb Z^d$, and\nthat branches (with binary branching) at rate $\\lambda>0$ everywhere, except at\nthe origin, where it branches at rate $\\lambda_0>\\lambda$. We show that, if\n$\\lambda_0$ is large enough, then the occupation measure of the branching\nrandom walk localises (i.e. when normalised by the total number of particles,\nit converges almost surely without spatial renormalisation), whereas, if\n$\\lambda_0$ is close enough to $\\lambda$, then the occupation measure\ndelocalises, in the sense that the proportion of particles in any finite given\nset converges almost surely to zero. The case $\\lambda = 0$ (when branching\nonly occurs at the origin) has been extensively studied in the literature and a\ntransition between localisation and non-localisation was also exhibited in this\ncase. Interestingly, the transition that we observe, conjecture, and partially\nprove in this paper occurs at the same threshold as in the case $\\lambda=0$.\nOne of the strengths of our result is that, in the localisation regime, we are\nable to prove convergence of the occupation measure, whilst existing results in\nthe case $\\lambda = 0$ give convergence of moments instead.",

AI can optimize simulation codes where computational bottlenecks arise\nfrom the time required to generate forward models. One such example is PHOEBE,\na modeling code for eclipsing binaries (EBs), where simulating individual\nsystems is feasible, but analyzing observables for extensive parameter\ncombinations is highly time-consuming.\n  To address this, we present a fully connected feedforward artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) trained on a dataset of over one million synthetic light curves\ngenerated with PHOEBE. Optimization of the ANN architecture yielded a model\nwith six hidden layers, each containing 512 nodes, provides an optimized\nbalance between accuracy and computational complexity. Extensive testing\nenabled us to establish ANN's applicability limits and to quantify the\nsystematic and statistical errors associated with using such networks for EB\nanalysis. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of dilution effects in\nparameter estimation for EBs, and we outline methods to incorporate these\neffects in AI-based models.\n  This proposed ANN framework enables a speedup of over four orders of\nmagnitude compared to traditional methods, with systematic errors not exceeding\n1\\%, and often as low as 0.01\\%, across the entire parameter space.",

With this different\ndeep-learning techniques are devised for the development of factual and\nstylized image captioning models. Previous models focused more on the\ngeneration of factual and stylized captions separately providing more than one\ncaption for a single image. The descriptions generated from these suffer from\nout-of-vocabulary and repetition issues. To the best of our knowledge, no such\nwork exists that provided a description that integrates different captioning\nmethods to describe the contents of an image with factual and stylized\n(romantic and humorous) elements. To overcome these limitations, this paper\npresents a novel Unified Attention and Multi-Head Attention-driven Caption\nSummarization Transformer (UnMA-CapSumT) based Captioning Framework. It\nutilizes both factual captions and stylized captions generated by the Modified\nAdaptive Attention-based factual image captioning model (MAA-FIC) and Style\nFactored Bi-LSTM with attention (SF-Bi-ALSTM) driven stylized image captioning\nmodel respectively. SF-Bi-ALSTM-based stylized IC model generates two prominent\nstyles of expression- {romance, and humor}. The proposed summarizer UnMHA-ST\ncombines both factual and stylized descriptions of an input image to generate\nstyled rich coherent summarized captions. The proposed UnMHA-ST transformer\nlearns and summarizes different linguistic styles efficiently by incorporating\nproposed word embedding fastText with Attention Word Embedding (fTA-WE) and\npointer-generator network with coverage mechanism concept to solve the\nout-of-vocabulary issues and repetition problem. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on Flickr8K and a subset of FlickrStyle10K with supporting ablation\nstudies to prove the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed framework.",

A promising strategy is to develop policies that are\nrobust across a wide range of parameters. Domain adaptation and domain\nrandomization are widely used, but they tend to either limit generalization to\nnew instances or perform conservatively due to neglecting instance-specific\ninformation. \\textit{Explicit motor adaptation} addresses these issues by\nestimating system parameters online and then retrieving the\nparameter-conditioned policy from a parameter-augmented base policy. However,\nit typically requires precise system identification or additional training of a\nstudent policy, both of which are challenging in contact-rich manipulation\ntasks with diverse physical parameters.

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have achieved promising results in image generation,\nand various generative model hubs, e.g., Hugging Face and Civitai, have been\ndeveloped that enable model developers to upload models and users to download\nmodels. However, these model hubs lack advanced model management and\nidentification mechanisms, resulting in users only searching for models through\ntext matching, download sorting, etc., making it difficult to efficiently find\nthe model that best meets user requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsetting called Generative Model Identification (GMI), which aims to enable the\nuser to identify the most appropriate generative model(s) for the user's\nrequirements from a large number of candidate models efficiently. To our best\nknowledge, it has not been studied yet. In this paper, we introduce a\ncomprehensive solution consisting of three pivotal modules: a weighted Reduced\nKernel Mean Embedding (RKME) framework for capturing the generated image\ndistribution and the relationship between images and prompts, a pre-trained\nvision-language model aimed at addressing dimensionality challenges, and an\nimage interrogator designed to tackle cross-modality issues. Extensive\nempirical results demonstrate the proposal is both efficient and effective. For\nexample, users only need to submit a single example image to describe their\nrequirements, and the model platform can achieve an average top-4\nidentification accuracy of more than 80%.",

To address this challenge, previous studies have attempted to reduce\nthe domain gap between source and target data by incorporating a few labeled\ntarget samples during training - a technique known as semi-supervised domain\nadaptation (SSDA).

    "abstract": "In real life, many dynamic events, such as major disasters and large-scale\nsports events, evolve continuously over time. Obtaining an overview of these\nevents can help people quickly understand the situation and respond more\neffectively. This is challenging because the key information of the event is\noften scattered across multiple documents, involving complex event knowledge\nunderstanding and reasoning, which is under-explored in previous work.\nTherefore, we proposed the Event-Centric Multi-Document Summarization (ECS)\ntask, which aims to generate concise and comprehensive summaries of a given\nevent based on multiple related news documents. Based on this, we constructed\nthe EventSum dataset, which was constructed using Baidu Baike entries and\nunderwent extensive human annotation, to facilitate relevant research. It is\nthe first large scale Chinese multi-document summarization dataset, containing\n5,100 events and a total of 57,984 news documents, with an average of 11.4\ninput news documents and 13,471 characters per event. To ensure data quality\nand mitigate potential data leakage, we adopted a multi-stage annotation\napproach for manually labeling the test set. Given the complexity of\nevent-related information, existing metrics struggle to comprehensively assess\nthe quality of generated summaries. We designed specific metrics including\nEvent Recall, Argument Recall, Causal Recall, and Temporal Recall along with\ncorresponding calculation methods for evaluation. We conducted comprehensive\nexperiments on EventSum to evaluate the performance of advanced long-context\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) on this task. Our experimental results indicate\nthat: 1) The event-centric multi-document summarization task remains\nchallenging for existing long-context LLMs; 2) The recall metrics we designed\nare crucial for evaluating the comprehensiveness of the summary information.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are nowadays witnessing a major success in\nsolving many pattern recognition tasks including skeleton-based classification.\nThe deployment of DNNs on edge-devices, endowed with limited time and memory\nresources, requires designing lightweight and efficient variants of these\nnetworks. Pruning is one of the lightweight network design techniques that\noperate by removing unnecessary network parts, in a structured or an\nunstructured manner, including individual weights, neurons or even entire\nchannels. Nonetheless, structured and unstructured pruning methods, when\napplied separately, may either be inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we\ndevise a novel semi-structured method that discards the downsides of structured\nand unstructured pruning while gathering their upsides to some extent. The\nproposed solution is based on a differentiable cascaded parametrization which\ncombines (i) a band-stop mechanism that prunes weights depending on their\nmagnitudes, (ii) a weight-sharing parametrization that prunes connections\neither individually or group-wise, and (iii) a gating mechanism which\narbitrates between different group-wise and entry-wise pruning. All these\ncascaded parametrizations are built upon a common latent tensor which is\ntrained end-to-end by minimizing a classification loss and a surrogate tensor\nrank regularizer. Extensive experiments, conducted on the challenging tasks of\naction and hand-gesture recognition, show the clear advantage of our proposed\nsemi-structured pruning approach against both structured and unstructured\npruning, when taken separately, as well as the related work.",

Checkpointing\ntechniques can reduce the memory requirements by only storing a subset of\nintermediate states, the checkpoints, but are still rarely used due to the\ncomputational overhead of the additional recomputation phase. This work\naddresses these challenges by introducing memory-efficient gradient\ncheckpointing strategies tailored for the general class of sparse RNNs and\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs). SNNs are energy efficient alternatives to RNNs\nthanks to their local, event-driven operation and potential neuromorphic\nimplementation. We use the Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU) as an exemplary\nplatform for architectures with distributed local memory. We exploit its\nsuitability for sparse and irregular workloads to scale SNN training on long\nsequence lengths. We find that Double Checkpointing emerges as the most\neffective method, optimizing the use of local memory resources while minimizing\nrecomputation overhead. This approach reduces dependency on slower large-scale\nmemory access, enabling training on sequences over 10 times longer or 4 times\nlarger networks than previously feasible, with only marginal time overhead. The\npresented techniques demonstrate significant potential to enhance scalability\nand efficiency in training sparse and recurrent networks across diverse\nhardware platforms, and highlights the benefits of sparse activations for\nscalable recurrent neural network training.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised visual anomaly detection is crucial for enhancing industrial\nproduction quality and efficiency. Among unsupervised methods, reconstruction\napproaches are popular due to their simplicity and effectiveness. The key\naspect of reconstruction methods lies in the restoration of anomalous regions,\nwhich current methods have not satisfactorily achieved. To tackle this issue,\nwe introduce a novel \\uline{A}daptive \\uline{M}ask \\uline{I}npainting\n\\uline{Net}work (AMI-Net) from the perspective of adaptive mask-inpainting. In\ncontrast to traditional reconstruction methods that treat non-semantic image\npixels as targets, our method uses a pre-trained network to extract multi-scale\nsemantic features as reconstruction targets. Given the multiscale nature of\nindustrial defects, we incorporate a training strategy involving random\npositional and quantitative masking. Moreover, we propose an innovative\nadaptive mask generator capable of generating adaptive masks that effectively\nmask anomalous regions while preserving normal regions. In this manner, the\nmodel can leverage the visible normal global contextual information to restore\nthe masked anomalous regions, thereby effectively suppressing the\nreconstruction of defects. Extensive experimental results on the MVTec AD and\nBTAD industrial datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nAdditionally, AMI-Net exhibits exceptional real-time performance, striking a\nfavorable balance between detection accuracy and speed, rendering it highly\nsuitable for industrial applications.

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in scientific\nresearch comes the need for reliable uncertainty quantification. When taking a\nmeasurement it is not enough to provide the result, we also have to declare how\nconfident we are in the measurement. This is also true when the results are\nobtained from a ML algorithm, and arguably more so since the internal workings\nof ML algorithms are often less transparent compared to traditional statistical\nmethods. Additionally, many ML algorithms do not provide uncertainty estimates\nand auxiliary algorithms must be applied. Conformal Prediction (CP) is a\nframework to provide such uncertainty quantifications for ML point predictors.\nIn this paper, we explore the use and properties of CP applied in the context\nof glitch classification in gravitational wave astronomy. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate the application of CP to the Gravity Spy glitch classification\nalgorithm. CP makes use of a score function, a nonconformity measure, to\nconvert an algorithm's heuristic notion of uncertainty to a rigorous\nuncertainty. We use the application on Gravity Spy to explore the performance\nof different nonconformity measures and optimise them for our application. Our\nresults show that the optimal nonconformity measure depends on the specific\napplication, as well as the metric used to quantify the performance.",

    "abstract": "Extracting anomaly causality facilitates diagnostics once monitoring systems\ndetect system faults. Identifying anomaly causes in large systems involves\ninvestigating a more extensive set of monitoring variables across multiple\nsubsystems. However, learning causal graphs comes with a significant\ncomputational burden that restrains the applicability of most existing methods\nin real-time and large-scale deployments. In addition, modern monitoring\napplications for large systems often generate large amounts of binary alarm\nflags, and the distinct characteristics of binary anomaly data -- the meaning\nof state transition and data sparsity -- challenge existing causality learning\nmechanisms. This study proposes an anomaly causal discovery approach\n(AnomalyCD), addressing the accuracy and computational challenges of generating\ncausal graphs from binary flag data sets. The AnomalyCD framework presents\nseveral strategies, such as anomaly flag characteristics incorporating\ncausality testing, sparse data and link compression, and edge pruning\nadjustment approaches. We validate the performance of this framework on two\ndatasets: monitoring sensor data of the readout-box system of the Compact Muon\nSolenoid experiment at CERN, and a public data set for information technology\nmonitoring. The results demonstrate the considerable reduction of the\ncomputation overhead and moderate enhancement of the accuracy of temporal\ncausal discovery on binary anomaly data sets.",

In the standard probabilistic\nsetting, for each pairing of players, one of the players wins the game with a\ncertain (a priori known) probability. Due to their competitive nature,\ntournaments are prone to manipulation. We investigate the computational problem\nof determining whether, for a given tournament, a coalition has a manipulation\nstrategy that increases the winning probability of a designated player above a\ngiven threshold. More precisely, in every round of the tournament, coalition\nplayers can strategically decide which games to throw based on the advancement\nof other players to the current round. We call this setting adaptive\nconstructive coalition manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, while\ncoalition manipulation has been studied in the literature, this is the first\nwork to introduce adaptiveness to this context.\n  We show that the above problem is hard for every complexity class in the\npolynomial hierarchy. On the algorithmic side, we show that the problem is\nsolvable in polynomial time when the coalition size is a constant. Furthermore,\nwe show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the\ncoalition size and the size of a minimum player set that must include at least\none player from each non-deterministic game.

The\nkey result of our a priori error analysis is that the dG solution is\nasymptotically optimal in an augmented energy norm that contains the dG\nstabilization. Specifically, up to a constant that tends to one as the mesh is\nrefined, the dG solution is as accurate as the best approximation in the same\nnorm.

However, the\nphysical conditions that play a role in disk formation, evolution, and the\npossibility of (sub)stellar companion formation, are significantly different.\nWe search for the mm counterparts of four intermediate- to high-mass (4-10\nSolar mass) young stellar objects (YSOs) in the giant Hii region M17 at a\ndistance of 1.7 kpc. These objects expose their photospheric spectrum such that\ntheir location on the pre-main-sequence (PMS) is well established. They have a\ncircumstellar disk that is likely remnant of the formation process. With ALMA\nwe have detected, for the first time, these four YSOs in M17, in Band 6 and 7,\nas well as four other serendipitous objects. Besides the flux measurements, the\nsource size and spectral index provide important constraints on the physical\nmechanism(s) producing the observed emission. We apply different models to\nestimate the dust and gas mass contained in the disks. All our detections are\nspatially unresolved, constraining the source size to <120 au, and have a\nspectral index in the range 0.5-2.7. The derived (upper limits on the) disk\ndust masses are on the order of a few Earth masses and estimations of the upper\nlimits on the gas mass vary between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$ Solar mass. In two\nobjects (B331 and B268) free-free emission indicates the presence of ionized\nmaterial around the star. The four serendipitous detections are likely\n(low-mass) YSOs. We compare the derived disk masses of our M17 targets to those\nobtained for YSOs in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) and Herbig stars, as\na function of stellar mass, age, luminosity, and outer disk radius.

Current models still fall short\nin phrasing and intonation; they not only miss or misplace breaks when\nsynthesizing long sentences with complex structures but also produce unnatural\nintonation. We propose ProsodyFM, a prosody-aware text-to-speech synthesis\n(TTS) model with a flow-matching (FM) backbone that aims to enhance the\nphrasing and intonation aspects of prosody. ProsodyFM introduces two key\ncomponents: a Phrase Break Encoder to capture initial phrase break locations,\nfollowed by a Duration Predictor for the flexible adjustment of break\ndurations; and a Terminal Intonation Encoder which learns a bank of intonation\nshape tokens combined with a novel Pitch Processor for more robust modeling of\nhuman-perceived intonation change. ProsodyFM is trained with no explicit\nprosodic labels and yet can uncover a broad spectrum of break durations and\nintonation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that ProsodyFM can\neffectively improve the phrasing and intonation aspects of prosody, thereby\nenhancing the overall intelligibility compared to four state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmodels. Out-of-distribution experiments show that this prosody improvement can\nfurther bring ProsodyFM superior generalizability for unseen complex sentences\nand speakers.

    "abstract": "Treatment effect heterogeneity plays an important role in many areas of\ncausal inference and within recent years, estimation of the conditional average\ntreatment effect (CATE) has received much attention in the statistical\ncommunity. While accurate estimation of the CATE-function through flexible\nmachine learning procedures provides a tool for prediction of the individual\ntreatment effect, it does not provide further insight into the driving features\nof potential treatment effect heterogeneity. Recent papers have addressed this\nproblem by providing variable importance measures for treatment effect\nheterogeneity. Most of the suggestions have been developed for continuous or\nbinary outcome, while little attention has been given to censored time-to-event\noutcome. In this paper, we extend the treatment effect variable importance\nmeasure (TE-VIM) proposed in Hines et al. (2022) to the survival setting with\ncensored outcome. We derive an estimator for the TE-VIM for two different CATE\nfunctions based on the survival function and RMST, respectively. Along with the\nTE-VIM, we propose a new measure of treatment effect heterogeneity based on the\nbest partially linear projection of the CATE and suggest accompanying\nestimators for that projection. All estimators are based on semiparametric\nefficiency theory, and we give conditions under which they are asymptotically\nlinear. The finite sample performance of the derived estimators are\ninvestigated in a simulation study. Finally, the estimators are applied and\ncontrasted in two real data examples.",

    "abstract": "Existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods have demonstrated their ability\nin achieving student network performance on par with their teachers. However,\nthe knowledge gap between the teacher and student remains significant and may\nhinder the effectiveness of the distillation process. In this work, we\nintroduce the structure of Neural Collapse (NC) into the KD framework. NC\ntypically occurs in the final phase of training, resulting in a graceful\ngeometric structure where the last-layer features form a simplex equiangular\ntight frame. Such phenomenon has improved the generalization of deep network\ntraining. We hypothesize that NC can also alleviate the knowledge gap in\ndistillation, thereby enhancing student performance. This paper begins with an\nempirical analysis to bridge the connection between knowledge distillation and\nneural collapse. Through this analysis, we establish that transferring the\nteacher's NC structure to the student benefits the distillation process.\nTherefore, instead of merely transferring instance-level logits or features, as\ndone by existing distillation methods, we encourage students to learn the\nteacher's NC structure. Thereby, we propose a new distillation paradigm termed\nNeural Collapse-inspired Knowledge Distillation (NCKD). Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that NCKD is simple yet effective, improving the\ngeneralization of all distilled student models and achieving state-of-the-art\naccuracy performance.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the dynamics of interacting objects is essential for both humans\nand intelligent systems. However, existing approaches are limited to\nsimplified, toy settings and lack generalizability to complex, real-world\nenvironments. Recent advances in generative models have enabled the prediction\nof state transitions based on interventions, but focus on generating a single\nfuture state which neglects the continuous dynamics resulting from the\ninteraction. To address this gap, we propose InterDyn, a novel framework that\ngenerates videos of interactive dynamics given an initial frame and a control\nsignal encoding the motion of a driving object or actor. Our key insight is\nthat large video generation models can act as both neural renderers and\nimplicit physics ``simulators'', having learned interactive dynamics from\nlarge-scale video data. To effectively harness this capability, we introduce an\ninteractive control mechanism that conditions the video generation process on\nthe motion of the driving entity. Qualitative results demonstrate that InterDyn\ngenerates plausible, temporally consistent videos of complex object\ninteractions while generalizing to unseen objects. Quantitative evaluations\nshow that InterDyn outperforms baselines that focus on static state\ntransitions. This work highlights the potential of leveraging video generative\nmodels as implicit physics engines. Project page:\nhttps://interdyn.is.tue.mpg.de/",

We investigate the\nbehaviour of population protocols under adversarial faults that cause agents to\nsilently crash and no longer interact with other agents. As a starting point,\nwe consider the property ``the number of agents exceeds a given threshold\n$t$'', represented by the predicate $x \\geq t$, and show that the standard\nprotocol for $x \\geq t$ is very fragile: one single crash in a computation with\n$x:=2t-1$ agents can already cause the protocol to answer incorrectly that $x\n\\geq t$ does not hold. However, a slightly less known protocol is robust: for\nany number $t' \\geq t$ of agents, at least $t' - t+1$ crashes must occur for\nthe protocol to answer that the property does not hold.\n  We formally define robustness for arbitrary population protocols, and\ninvestigate the question whether every predicate computable by population\nprotocols has a robust protocol. Angluin et al. proved in 2007 that population\nprotocols decide exactly the Presburger predicates, which can be represented as\nBoolean combinations of threshold predicates of the form $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\n\\cdot x_i \\geq t$ for $a_1,...,a_n, t \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and modulo prdicates of\nthe form $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\cdot x_i \\bmod m \\geq t $ for $a_1, \\ldots, a_n, m,\nt \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We design robust protocols for all threshold and modulo\npredicates. We also show that, unfortunately, the techniques in the literature\nthat construct a protocol for a Boolean combination of predicates given\nprotocols for the conjuncts do not preserve robustness.

This approach to quantum computing comes with two major problems.\nOn the one hand, it greatly hampers scalability towards fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputers, which are estimated to need a number of qubits -- and, therefore\ndriving lines -- on the order of $10^6$. On the other hand, these lines are a\nsource of electromagnetic noise, exacerbating frequency crowding and crosstalk,\nwhile also contributing to power dissipation inside the dilution fridge. We\nhere tackle these two overwhelming challenges by presenting a novel quantum\nprocessing unit (QPU) for a universal quantum computer which is globally\n(rather than locally) driven. Our QPU relies on a string of superconducting\nqubits with always-on ZZ interactions, enclosed into a closed geometry, which\nwe dub ``conveyor belt''. Strikingly, this architecture requires only\n$\\mathcal{O}(N)$ physical qubits to run a computation on $N$ computational\nqubits, in contrast to previous $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ proposals for global quantum\ncomputation. Additionally, universality is achieved via the implementation of\nsingle-qubit gates and a one-shot Toffoli gate.

For applications such as face recognition,\nfacial expression recognition, and facial attribute classification, alignment\nis widely utilized during both training and inference to standardize the\npositions of key landmarks in the face. It is well known that the application\nand method of face alignment significantly affect the performance of facial\nanalysis models. However, the impact of alignment on face image quality has not\nbeen thoroughly investigated. Current FIQA studies often assume alignment as a\nprerequisite but do not explicitly evaluate how alignment affects quality\nmetrics, especially with the advent of modern deep learning-based detectors\nthat integrate detection and landmark localization. To address this need, our\nstudy examines the impact of face alignment on face image quality scores. We\nconducted experiments on the LFW, IJB-B, and SCFace datasets, employing MTCNN\nand RetinaFace models for face detection and alignment. To evaluate face image\nquality, we utilized several assessment methods, including SER-FIQ, FaceQAN,\nDifFIQA, and SDD-FIQA. Our analysis included examining quality score\ndistributions for the LFW and IJB-B datasets and analyzing average quality\nscores at varying distances in the SCFace dataset.

Traditional quadrotor control approaches are limited by\ntheir reliance on flat trajectories or time-consuming optimization, which\nrestricts their flexibility. Recently, RL-based policy has emerged as a\npromising alternative due to its ability to directly map observations to\nactions, reducing the need for detailed system knowledge and actuation\nconstraints. However, a significant challenge remains in bridging the\nsim-to-real gap, where RL-based policies often experience instability when\ndeployed in real world. In this paper, we investigate key factors for learning\nrobust RL-based control policies that are capable of zero-shot deployment in\nreal-world quadrotors. We identify five critical factors and we develop a\nPPO-based training framework named SimpleFlight, which integrates these five\ntechniques. We validate the efficacy of SimpleFlight on Crazyflie quadrotor,\ndemonstrating that it achieves more than a 50% reduction in trajectory tracking\nerror compared to state-of-the-art RL baselines. The policy derived by\nSimpleFlight consistently excels across both smooth polynominal trajectories\nand challenging infeasible zigzag trajectories on small thrust-to-weight\nquadrotors.

We propose\na 3D LiDAR bundle adjustment approach to solve the global alignment problem and\njointly optimize the available data. Utilizing a continuous-time trajectory\nallows us to consider the ego-motion of the LiDAR scanner while recording a\nsingle scan directly in the least squares adjustment. Furthermore, pruning the\nsearch space of correspondences and utilizing out-of-core circular buffer\nenables our approach to align thousands of point clouds efficiently. We\nsuccessfully align point clouds recorded with a handheld LiDAR, as well as ones\nmounted on a vehicle, and are able to perform multi-session alignment.",

To address\nthese challenges, we investigate Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the\nad-hoc retrieval task. The study begins by developing essential language\nresources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection --\nwhich serve as foundational components for solutions tailored to Tetun text\nretrieval. Various strategies are investigated using both document titles and\ncontent to evaluate retrieval effectiveness. The results demonstrate that\nretrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes without\napplying stemming, significantly improves retrieval performance compared to the\nbaseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37%, while effectiveness achieves an\naverage relative gain of +9.40% in MAP@10 and +30.35% in NDCG@10 with DFR BM25.\nBeyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM shows strong performance across\nvarious retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics.

Although remarkable progress has been made\nin video generation models, generative inbetweening still faces challenges in\nmaintaining temporal stability due to the ambiguous interpolation path between\ntwo key frames. This issue becomes particularly severe when there is a large\nmotion gap between input frames. In this paper, we propose a straightforward\nyet highly effective Frame-wise Conditions-driven Video Generation (FCVG)\nmethod that significantly enhances the temporal stability of interpolated video\nframes. Specifically, our FCVG provides an explicit condition for each frame,\nmaking it much easier to identify the interpolation path between two input\nframes and thus ensuring temporally stable production of visually plausible\nvideo frames. To achieve this, we suggest extracting matched lines from two\ninput frames that can then be easily interpolated frame by frame, serving as\nframe-wise conditions seamlessly integrated into existing video generation\nmodels. In extensive evaluations covering diverse scenarios such as natural\nlandscapes, complex human poses, camera movements and animations, existing\nmethods often exhibit incoherent transitions across frames. In contrast, our\nFCVG demonstrates the capability to generate temporally stable videos using\nboth linear and non-linear interpolation curves.

This paper studies predictors in systems exhibiting\nprobabilistic and non-deterministic behavior modelled as Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs). Main contributions are the introduction of quantitative\nnotions that measure the effectiveness of predictors in terms of their average\ncapability to predict the occurrence of failures or other undesired system\nbehaviors. The average is taken over all memoryless policies. We study two\nclasses of such notions. One class is inspired by concepts that have been\nintroduced in statistical analysis to explain the impact of features on the\ndecisions of binary classifiers (such as precision, recall, f-score). Second,\nwe study a measure that borrows ideas from recent work on probability-raising\ncausality in MDPs and determines the quality of a predictor by the fraction of\nmemoryless policies under which (the set of states in) the predictor is a\nprobability-raising cause for the considered failure scenario.",

The\ncore of our method is generating event frames from conventional intensity\nframes, and the other is a newly designed Attention Driving State Network\n(ADSN). Compared to event cameras, conventional cameras offer complete\ninformation and lower hardware costs, enabling captured frames to encode rich\nspatial information. However, these textures lack temporal information, posing\nchallenges in effectively identifying driving status. DriveGazen addresses this\nissue from three perspectives. First, we utilize video frames to generate\nrealistic synthetic dynamic vision sensor (DVS) events. Second, we adopt a\nspiking neural network to decode pertinent temporal information. Lastly, ADSN\nextracts crucial spatial cues from corresponding intensity frames and conveys\nspatial attention to convolutional spiking layers during both training and\ninference through a novel guide attention module to guide the feature learning\nand feature enhancement of the event frame. We specifically collected the\nDriving Status (DriveGaze) dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach. Additionally, we validate the superiority of the DriveGazen on the\nSingle-eye Event-based Emotion (SEE) dataset.

Recent works\nhighlight that leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to explicitly\nmodel multimodal item-item relations can significantly enhance recommendation\nperformance. However, due to the inherent over-smoothing issue of GCNs,\nexisting models benefit only from shallow GCNs with limited representation\npower. This drawback is especially pronounced when facing complex and\nhigh-dimensional patterns such as multimodal data, as it requires\nlarge-capacity models to accommodate complicated correlations. To this end, in\nthis paper, we investigate bypassing GCNs when modeling multimodal item-item\nrelationship. More specifically, we propose a Topology-aware Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (TMLP), which uses MLPs instead of GCNs to model the relationships\nbetween items. TMLP enhances MLPs with topological pruning to denoise item-item\nrelations and intra (inter)-modality learning to integrate higher-order\nmodality correlations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets\nverify TMLP's superiority over nine baselines. We also find that by discarding\nthe internal message passing in GCNs, which is sensitive to node connections,\nTMLP achieves significant improvements in both training efficiency and\nrobustness against existing models.",

    "abstract": "Conditional independence (CI) testing is a fundamental task in modern\nstatistics and machine learning. The conditional randomization test (CRT) was\nrecently introduced to test whether two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, are\nconditionally independent given a potentially high-dimensional set of random\nvariables, $Z$. The CRT operates exceptionally well under the assumption that\nthe conditional distribution $X|Z$ is known. However, since this distribution\nis typically unknown in practice, accurately approximating it becomes crucial.\nIn this paper, we propose using conditional diffusion models (CDMs) to learn\nthe distribution of $X|Z$. Theoretically and empirically, it is shown that CDMs\nclosely approximate the true conditional distribution. Furthermore, CDMs offer\na more accurate approximation of $X|Z$ compared to GANs, potentially leading to\na CRT that performs better than those based on GANs. To accommodate complex\ndependency structures, we utilize a computationally efficient classifier-based\nconditional mutual information (CMI) estimator as our test statistic. The\nproposed testing procedure performs effectively without requiring assumptions\nabout specific distribution forms or feature dependencies, and is capable of\nhandling mixed-type conditioning sets that include both continuous and discrete\nvariables. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposed test achieves a valid\ncontrol of the type I error. A series of experiments on synthetic data\ndemonstrates that our new test effectively controls both type-I and type-II\nerrors, even in high dimensional scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) is a method that merges principles from\nBayesian statistics and reinforcement learning to make optimal decisions in\nuncertain environments. As a model-based RL method, it has two key components:\n(1) inferring the posterior distribution of the model for the data-generating\nprocess (DGP) and (2) policy learning using the learned posterior. We propose\nto model the dynamics of the unknown environment through deep generative\nmodels, assuming Markov dependence. In the absence of likelihood functions for\nthese models, we train them by learning a generalized predictive-sequential (or\nprequential) scoring rule (SR) posterior. We used sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)\nsamplers to draw samples from this generalized Bayesian posterior distribution.\nIn conjunction, to achieve scalability in the high-dimensional parameter space\nof the neural networks, we use the gradient-based Markov kernels within SMC. To\njustify the use of the prequential scoring rule posterior, we prove a\nBernstein-von Mises-type theorem. For policy learning, we propose expected\nThompson sampling (ETS) to learn the optimal policy by maximising the expected\nvalue function with respect to the posterior distribution. This improves upon\ntraditional Thompson sampling (TS) and its extensions, which utilize only one\nsample drawn from the posterior distribution. This improvement is studied both\ntheoretically and using simulation studies, assuming a discrete action space.\nFinally, we successfully extended our setup for a challenging problem with a\ncontinuous action space without theoretical guarantees.",

In this work, we demonstrate that\nwhen the electric field is slowly modulated with time, new non-trivial phases\nwith multiple mobility edges emerge in place of WS localized phase, which\npersists up to a certain strength of the non-Hermiticity. On the other hand,\nfor a large driving frequency, we retrieve the usual sharp\ndelocalization-localization transition to the usual (no WS) localized phase,\nsimilar to the static non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper type without any\nelectric field. This vanishing of WS localization can be attributed solely to\nthe time-periodic drive and occurs irrespective of the non-Hermiticity.\nInterestingly, under the open boundary condition (OBC), we find that contrary\nto the undriven systems where an external electric field destroys the SE\ncompletely, the SE appears in certain regime of the parameter space when the\nelectric field is temporally driven. This appearance of SE is closely related\nto the absence of extended unitarity. In addition, in the presence of the\ndrive, the skin states are found to be multifractal, contrary to its usual\nnature in such non-Hermitian systems. An in-depth understanding about the\nbehavior of the states in the driven system is established from the long-time\ndynamics of an initial excitation.",

In this paper, we design\nan efficient and high-accuracy bidirectional privacy-preserving scheme for\nfederated learning to complete secure model training and secure aggregation. To\nefficiently achieve bidirectional privacy, we design an efficient and\naccuracy-lossless model perturbation method on the server side (called\n$\\mathbf{MP\\_Server}$) that can be combined with local differential privacy\n(LDP) to prevent clients from accessing the model, while ensuring that the\nlocal gradients obtained on the server side satisfy LDP. Furthermore, to ensure\nmodel accuracy, we customize a distributed differential privacy mechanism on\nthe client side (called $\\mathbf{DDP\\_Client}$). When combined with\n$\\mathbf{MP\\_Server}$, it ensures LDP of the local gradients, while ensuring\nthat the aggregated result matches the accuracy of central differential privacy\n(CDP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art bidirectional privacy-preservation baselines\n(SOTAs) in terms of computational cost, model accuracy, and defense ability\nagainst privacy attacks.

    "abstract": "While the mining of modalities is the focus of most multimodal recommendation\nmethods, we believe that how to fully utilize both collaborative and multimodal\ninformation is pivotal in e-commerce scenarios where, as clarified in this\nwork, the user behaviors are rarely determined entirely by multimodal features.\nIn order to combine the two distinct types of information, some additional\nchallenges are encountered: 1) Modality erasure: Vanilla graph convolution,\nwhich proves rather useful in collaborative filtering, however erases\nmultimodal information; 2) Modality forgetting: Multimodal information tends to\nbe gradually forgotten as the recommendation loss essentially facilitates the\nlearning of collaborative information. To this end, we propose a novel approach\nnamed STAIR, which employs a novel STepwise grAph convolution to enable a\nco-existence of collaborative and multimodal Information in e-commerce\nRecommendation. Besides, it starts with the raw multimodal features as an\ninitialization, and the forgetting problem can be significantly alleviated\nthrough constrained embedding updates. As a result, STAIR achieves\nstate-of-the-art recommendation performance on three public e-commerce datasets\nwith minimal computational and memory costs.

    "abstract": "Code retrieval, which retrieves code snippets based on users' natural\nlanguage descriptions, is widely used by developers and plays a pivotal role in\nreal-world software development. The advent of deep learning has shifted the\nretrieval paradigm from lexical-based matching towards leveraging deep learning\nmodels to encode source code and queries into vector representations,\nfacilitating code retrieval according to vector similarity. Despite the\neffectiveness of these models, managing large-scale code database presents\nsignificant challenges. Previous research proposes deep hashing-based methods,\nwhich generate hash codes for queries and code snippets and use Hamming\ndistance for rapid recall of code candidates. However, this approach's reliance\non linear scanning of the entire code base limits its scalability. To further\nimprove the efficiency of large-scale code retrieval, we propose a novel\napproach SECRET (Scalable and Efficient Code Retrieval via SegmEnTed deep\nhashing). SECRET converts long hash codes calculated by existing deep hashing\napproaches into several short hash code segments through an iterative training\nstrategy. After training, SECRET recalls code candidates by looking up the hash\ntables for each segment, the time complexity of recall can thus be greatly\nreduced. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SECRET can drastically\nreduce the retrieval time by at least 95% while achieving comparable or even\nhigher performance of existing deep hashing approaches. Besides, SECRET also\nexhibits superior performance and efficiency compared to the classical hash\ntable-based approach known as LSH under the same number of hash tables.",

Nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of\nsuperconductors. In this work, we show how $^1$H NMR measurements can be\nrealized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in\nlanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. In the newly discovered\nsuperhydride LaH$_{12}$, we observed a pronounced suppression of the $^1$H NMR\nsignal intensity below $\\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of\n7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses. Below the\ncritical temperature of superconductivity, all $^1$H NMR characteristics,\nincluding the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate\npronounced features, evidencing the bulk nature of the superconducting\ntransition. In zero field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the\nLaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267\nK, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish nonlinear Landau damping below survival threshold\nfor collisionless charged particles following the meanfield Vlasov theory near\ngeneral radial equilibria. In absence of collisions, the long-range Coulomb\npair interaction between particles self-consistently gives rise to\noscillations, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or\nLangmuir's oscillatory waves, that disperse in space like a Klein-Gordon's\ndispersive wave. As a matter of fact, there is a non-trivial survival threshold\nof wave numbers that characterizes the large time dynamics of a plasma: {\\em\nphase mixing} above the threshold driven by the free transport dynamics and\n{\\em plasma oscillations} below the threshold driven by the collective\nmeanfield interaction. The former mechanism provides exponential damping, while\nthe latter is much slower and dictated by Klein-Gordon's dispersion which gives\ndecay of the electric field precisely at rate of order $t^{-3/2}$. Up to date,\nall the works in the mathematical literature on nonlinear Landau damping fall\ninto the phase mixing regime, in which plasma oscillations were absent. The\npresent work resolves the problem in the plasma oscillation regime. Our\nnonlinear analysis includes (1) establishing the existence and dispersion of\nLangmuir's waves, (2) decoupling oscillations from phase mixing in different\ntime regimes, (3) detailing the oscillatory structure of particle trajectories\nin the phase space, (4) treating plasma echoes via a detailed analysis of\nparticle-particle, particle-wave, and wave-wave interaction, and (5) designing\na nonlinear iterative scheme in the physical space that captures both phase\nmixing and dispersion in low norms and allows growth in time in high norms. As\na result, we establish nonlinear plasma oscillations and Landau damping below\nsurvival threshold for data with finite Sobolev regularity.",

In contrast to the more\nconventional broad area cooling (BAC), LAC targets local, concentrated heat\nflows e.g. through tank support structures. This yields important practical\nbenefits, especially for large-scale tanks, due to the order-of-magnitude\nreduction in the size of the cooling system.

This paper presents a\ndeep-reinforcement-learning-based approach for path planning to efficiently\nlocalize weeds in agricultural fields using UAVs with minimal flight-path\nlength. The method combines prior knowledge about the field containing\nuncertain, low-resolution weed locations with in-flight weed detections. The\nsearch policy was learned using deep Q-learning. We trained the agent in\nsimulation, allowing a thorough evaluation of the weed distribution, typical\nerrors in the perception system, prior knowledge, and different stopping\ncriteria on the planner's performance. When weeds were non-uniformly\ndistributed over the field, the agent found them faster than a row-by-row path,\nshowing its capability to learn and exploit the weed distribution. Detection\nerrors and prior knowledge quality had a minor effect on the performance,\nindicating that the learned search policy was robust to detection errors and\ndid not need detailed prior knowledge. The agent also learned to terminate the\nsearch. To test the transferability of the learned policy to a real-world\nscenario, the planner was tested on real-world image data without further\ntraining, which showed a 66% shorter path compared to a row-by-row path at the\ncost of a 10% lower percentage of found weeds. Strengths and weaknesses of the\nplanner for practical application are comprehensively discussed, and directions\nfor further development are provided. Overall, it is concluded that the learned\nsearch policy can improve the efficiency of finding non-uniformly distributed\nweeds using a UAV and shows potential for use in agricultural practice.",

However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient\nagents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into\nhuman-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this\ngap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a\npatient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through\nmulti-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the\nquality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor\ntraining. Extensive experiments on various cases demonstrate that, by providing\nonly overall SP requirements, our framework improves over existing reasoning\nmethods by more than 10\\% in requirement alignment and better human preference,\nwhile achieving an optimal balance of resource consumption after evolving over\n200 cases for 10 hours, with excellent generalizability.

Exception handling\nmechanisms require developers to detect, capture, and manage exceptions\naccording to high standards, but many developers struggle with these tasks,\nleading to fragile code. This problem is particularly evident in open-source\nprojects and impacts the overall quality of the software ecosystem. To address\nthis challenge, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to improve\nexception handling in code. Through extensive analysis, we identify three key\nissues: Insensitive Detection of Fragile Code, Inaccurate Capture of Exception\nBlock, and Distorted Handling Solution. These problems are widespread across\nreal world repositories, suggesting that robust exception handling practices\nare often overlooked or mishandled. In response, we propose Seeker, a\nmulti-agent framework inspired by expert developer strategies for exception\nhandling. Seeker uses agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler\nto assist LLMs in detecting, capturing, and resolving exceptions more\neffectively. Our work is the first systematic study on leveraging LLMs to\nenhance exception handling practices in real development scenarios, providing\nvaluable insights for future improvements in code reliability.",

    "abstract": "Editing videos with textual guidance has garnered popularity due to its\nstreamlined process which mandates users to solely edit the text prompt\ncorresponding to the source video. Recent studies have explored and exploited\nlarge-scale text-to-image diffusion models for text-guided video editing,\nresulting in remarkable video editing capabilities. However, they may still\nsuffer from some limitations such as mislocated objects, incorrect number of\nobjects. Therefore, the controllability of video editing remains a formidable\nchallenge. In this paper, we aim to challenge the above limitations by\nproposing a Re-Attentional Controllable Video Diffusion Editing (ReAtCo)\nmethod. Specially, to align the spatial placement of the target objects with\nthe edited text prompt in a training-free manner, we propose a Re-Attentional\nDiffusion (RAD) to refocus the cross-attention activation responses between the\nedited text prompt and the target video during the denoising stage, resulting\nin a spatially location-aligned and semantically high-fidelity manipulated\nvideo. In particular, to faithfully preserve the invariant region content with\nless border artifacts, we propose an Invariant Region-guided Joint Sampling\n(IRJS) strategy to mitigate the intrinsic sampling errors w.r.t the invariant\nregions at each denoising timestep and constrain the generated content to be\nharmonized with the invariant region content. Experimental results verify that\nReAtCo consistently improves the controllability of video diffusion editing and\nachieves superior video editing performance.",

To this aim, we measured the electronic transport of a carbon nanotube\nbased field effect transistor (CNTFET) constructed with an isolated single\ncarbon nanotube subjected to controlled environments. More precisely, this\ndistinction is made possible by observing the evolution of the transfer\ncharacteristic as a function of the electric field imposed by the gate voltage.\nIt appears that the presence of water results in a displacement of the\nelectrical neutrality point, corresponding to a charge transfer between the\nnanotube and its environment. Using this approach, we demonstrate the existence\nof 3 types of water molecules: (i) chemically adsorbed on the\nSiO\\textsubscript{2} surface of the substrate, i.e., forming silanol groups;\n(ii) physically adsorbed outside next to the nanotube; and (iii) confined\ninside the nanotube. The first one can only be eliminated by high temperature\ntreatment under vacuum, the second one desorbs in a moderate vacuum at room\ntemperature, while the confined water can be removed at room temperature at\nhigher vacuum, i.e. $10^{-3}$ mbar. We also observe that both water adsorption\noutside and water confinement inside the nanotube are spontaneous and rather\nfast, i.e. less than 1 minute in our experimental conditions, while removing\nthe water adsorbed outside and confined inside takes much longer, i.e. 40-60\nminutes, thus indicating that water confinement is thermodynamically favorable.\nIt is also shown that the metallicity of the nanotube has no qualitative\ninfluence on its interaction with water.

The proposed\ndesign achieves an improved throughput of up to 16X FxP4, 8X FxP8, 4X FxP16 and\n1X FxP32 in pipeline mode with 100% time multiplexed hardware. This work\nproposes an area efficient multiprecision iterative mode in the SIMD systolic\narrays for edge AI use cases. The design delivers superior performance with up\nto 62X and 371X reductions in DMA reads for input feature maps and weight\nfilters in VGG16, with an energy efficiency of 8.42 GOPS / W within the\naccuracy loss of 2%. The proposed architecture supports emerging 4-bit\ncomputations for DL inference while enhancing throughput in FxP8/16 modes for\ntransformers and other HPC applications. The proposed approach enables future\nenergy-efficient AI accelerators in edge and cloud environments.",

Achieving nanoscale control often\nrelies on finding an external stimulus that is able to act on that small length\nscales, which is highly challenging.

This helicity and texture-dependent effect contrasts\nwith the typical homogeneous growth of magnetic domains initiated by an\neffective magnetic field of a circularly polarized laser pulse. We corroborate\nour findings with a stochastic model for the nucleation of magnetic domains, in\nwhich the nucleation and annihilation probability not only depends on the\nhelicity of light but also on the relative magnetization orientation of\nneighboring domains.

A dataset from GZ2, comprising 11718 images filtered based on appropriate\ncriteria is used for training and evaluation. Both the EfficientNetV2M model\nfine-tuned on ImageNet and the EfficientNetB0 model with Zoobot pre-trained\nweights achieved high accuracy on the down-sampled dataset, with most\nperformance metrics exceeding 0.8 across all classes, except for galaxies with\n4 arms due to the limited number of samples in this category. Merging\nhigher-arm-number classes (more than 4 arms) improved the V2M model's accuracy\nsignificantly for 4-arm galaxies, as this approach allowed the model to focus\non more distinct features with a more balanced class distribution. GradCAM++\nand SmoothGrad highlight the networks' effectiveness in classifying galaxies,\nthrough the distinction of the galaxy structures and the extraction of the\nspiral arms, with the V2M model showing better capabilities in both tasks.\nLower-arm galaxies tend to be misclassified as \"can't tell\" when their spiral\narms are not clearly visible, while higher-arm galaxies tend to be\nmisclassified as having fewer arms when their features are only partially\ndetected. The study also found that galaxies with 3 arms tend to have lower\nstellar masses, and this tendency is reduced in the model predictions.

    "abstract": "Transfer learning for bio-signals has recently become an important technique\nto improve prediction performance on downstream tasks with small bio-signal\ndatasets. Recent works have shown that pre-training a neural network model on a\nlarge dataset (e.g. EEG) with a self-supervised task, replacing the\nself-supervised head with a linear classification head, and fine-tuning the\nmodel on different downstream bio-signal datasets (e.g., EMG or ECG) can\ndramatically improve the performance on those datasets.

Our findings\nindicate that the convolution-only part of our hybrid model can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on some low-data downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Tree-based priors for probability distributions are usually specified using a\npredetermined, data-independent collection of candidate recursive partitions of\nthe sample space. To characterize an unknown target density in detail over the\nentire sample space, candidate partitions must have the capacity to expand\ndeeply into all areas of the sample space with potential non-zero sampling\nprobability. Such an expansive system of partitions often incurs prohibitive\ncomputational costs and makes inference prone to overfitting, especially in\nregions with little probability mass. Thus, existing models typically make a\ncompromise and rely on relatively shallow trees. This hampers one of the most\ndesirable features of trees, their ability to characterize local features, and\nresults in reduced statistical efficiency. Traditional wisdom suggests that\nthis compromise is inevitable to ensure coherent likelihood-based reasoning in\nBayesian inference, as a data-dependent partition system that allows deeper\nexpansion only in regions with more observations would induce double dipping of\nthe data. We propose a simple strategy to restore coherency while allowing the\ncandidate partitions to be data-dependent, using Cox's partial likelihood. Our\npartial likelihood approach is broadly applicable to existing likelihood-based\nmethods and, in particular, to Bayesian inference on tree-based models. We give\nexamples in density estimation in which the partial likelihood is endowed with\nexisting priors on tree-based models and compare with the standard,\nfull-likelihood approach. The results show substantial gains in estimation\naccuracy and computational efficiency from adopting the partial likelihood.",

This success is complemented by a large body of theoretical results.\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of these results regard problems with binary\nor continuous decision variables -- the theoretical analysis of randomized\nsearch heuristics for unbounded integer domains is almost nonexistent. To\nresolve this shortcoming, we start the runtime analysis of multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithms, which are among the most successful randomized search\nheuristics, for unbounded integer search spaces. We analyze single- and\nfull-dimensional mutation operators with three different mutation strengths,\nnamely changes by plus/minus one (unit strength), random changes following a\nlaw with exponential tails, and random changes following a power-law. The\nperformance guarantees we prove on a recently proposed natural benchmark\nproblem suggest that unit mutation strengths can be slow when the initial\nsolutions are far from the Pareto front. When setting the expected change right\n(depending on the benchmark parameter and the distance of the initial\nsolutions), the mutation strength with exponential tails yields the best\nruntime guarantees in our results -- however, with a wrong choice of this\nexpectation, the performance guarantees quickly become highly uninteresting.\nWith power-law mutation, which is an essentially parameter-less mutation\noperator, we obtain good results uniformly over all problem parameters and\nstarting points. We complement our mathematical findings with experimental\nresults that suggest that our bounds are not always tight.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a privacy preserving machine learning paradigm\ndesigned to collaboratively learn a global model without data leakage.\nSpecifically, in a typical FL system, the central server solely functions as an\ncoordinator to iteratively aggregate the collected local models trained by each\nclient, potentially introducing single-point transmission bottleneck and\nsecurity threats. To mitigate this issue, decentralized federated learning\n(DFL) has been proposed, where all participating clients engage in peer-to-peer\ncommunication without a central server. Nonetheless, DFL still suffers from\ntraining degradation as FL does due to the non-independent and identically\ndistributed (non-IID) nature of client data. And incorporating personalization\nlayers into DFL may be the most effective solutions to alleviate the side\neffects caused by non-IID data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\nunit representation aided personalized decentralized federated learning\nframework, named UA-PDFL, to deal with the non-IID challenge in DFL. By\nadaptively adjusting the level of personalization layers through the guidance\nof the unit representation, UA-PDFL is able to address the varying degrees of\ndata skew. Based on this scheme, client-wise dropout and layer-wise\npersonalization are proposed to further enhance the learning performance of\nDFL.

It is therefore of interest\nto restrict the computation of decompositions by constraints and to guide this\ncomputation by preferences. To this end, we propose a novel framework based on\ncandidate tree decompositions, which allows us to introduce soft hypertree\nwidth (shw). This width measure is a relaxation of hypertree width (hw); it is\nnever greater than hw and, in some cases, shw may actually be lower than hw.\nMost importantly, shw preserves the tractability of deciding if a given CQ is\nbelow some fixed bound, while offering more algorithmic flexibility. In\nparticular, it provides a natural way to incorporate preferences and\nconstraints into the computation of decompositions.

    "abstract": "Currently, the prevalence of online handwriting has spurred a critical need\nfor effective retrieval systems to accurately search relevant handwriting\ninstances from specific writers, known as online writer retrieval. Despite the\ngrowing demand, this field suffers from a scarcity of well-established\nmethodologies and public large-scale datasets. This paper tackles these\nchallenges with a focus on Chinese handwritten phrases. First, we propose\nDOLPHIN, a novel retrieval model designed to enhance handwriting\nrepresentations through synergistic temporal-frequency analysis. For frequency\nfeature learning, we propose the HFGA block, which performs gated\ncross-attention between the vanilla temporal handwriting sequence and its\nhigh-frequency sub-bands to amplify salient writing details. For temporal\nfeature learning, we propose the CAIR block, tailored to promote channel\ninteraction and reduce channel redundancy. Second, to address data deficit, we\nintroduce OLIWER, a large-scale online writer retrieval dataset encompassing\nover 670,000 Chinese handwritten phrases from 1,731 individuals. Through\nextensive evaluations, we demonstrate the superior performance of DOLPHIN over\nexisting methods. In addition, we explore cross-domain writer retrieval and\nreveal the pivotal role of increasing feature alignment in bridging the\ndistributional gap between different handwriting data. Our findings emphasize\nthe significance of point sampling frequency and pressure features in improving\nhandwriting representation quality and retrieval performance.

With respect\nto the classical counterpart, in QSS the secret is encoded into quantum states\nand shared by a dealer such that only an authorized subsets of participants,\ni.e., the players, can reconstruct it. Several state-of-the-art studies aim to\ntranspose classical Secret Sharing into the quantum realm, while maintaining\ntheir reliance on traditional network topologies (e.g., star, ring,\nfully-connected) and require that all the n players calculate the secret. These\nstudies exploit the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, which is a type of\nmaximally entangled quantum state involving three or more qubits. However, none\nof these works account for redundancy, enhanced security/privacy features or\nauthentication mechanisms able to fingerprint players. To address these gaps,\nin this paper we introduce a new concept of QSS which leans on a generic\ndistributed quantum-network, based on a threshold scheme, where all the players\ncollaborate also to the routing of quantum information among them. The dealer,\nby exploiting a custom flexible weighting system, takes advantage of a newly\ndefined quantum Dijkstra algorithm to select the most suitable subset of t\nplayers, out of the entire set on n players, to involve in the computation. To\nfingerprint and authenticate users, CRYSTAL-Kyber primitives are adopted, while\nalso protecting each player's privacy by hiding their identities.

The main focus is on self-join free conjunctive queries and key\nconstraints, which is the most extensively studied case of consistent query\nanswering over standard databases.

This\nresult generalizes an analogous result of Koutris and Wijsen for ordinary\ndatabases, but also yields new results for a multitude of semirings, including\nthe bag semiring, the tropical semiring, and the fuzzy semiring. Further, for\nthe bag semiring, we show that computing the consistent answers of any\nself-join free conjunctive query whose attack graph has a strong cycle is not\nonly NP-hard but also it is NP-hard to even approximate the consistent answers\nwith a constant relative approximation guarantee.",

Existing UGDA methods primarily focus on\naligning features in the latent space learned by graph neural networks (GNNs)\nacross domains, often overlooking structural shifts, resulting in limited\neffectiveness when addressing structurally complex transfer scenarios. Given\nthe sensitivity of GNNs to local structural features, even slight discrepancies\nbetween source and target graphs could lead to significant shifts in node\nembeddings, thereby reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a novel approach for UGDA called Target-Domain\nStructural Smoothing (TDSS). TDSS is a simple and effective method designed to\nperform structural smoothing directly on the target graph, thereby mitigating\nstructural distribution shifts and ensuring the consistency of node\nrepresentations. Specifically, by integrating smoothing techniques with\nneighborhood sampling, TDSS maintains the structural coherence of the target\ngraph while mitigating the risk of over-smoothing. Our theoretical analysis\nshows that TDSS effectively reduces target risk by improving model smoothness.\nEmpirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that TDSS\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant\nimprovements across six transfer scenarios.

Prior work suggests extracting a claim representation that humans\nfind to be checkworthy and verifiable. This has two limitations: (1) the format\nmay not be optimal for a fact-checking model, and (2), it requires annotated\ndata to learn the extraction task from. We address both issues and propose a\nmethod to extract claims that is not reliant on labeled training data. Instead,\nour self-adaptive approach only requires a black-box fact checking model and a\ngenerative language model (LM). Given a tweet, we iteratively optimize the LM\nto generate a claim paraphrase that increases the performance of a fact\nchecking model. By learning from preference pairs, we align the LM to the fact\nchecker using direct preference optimization. We show that this novel setup\nextracts a claim paraphrase that is more verifiable than their original social\nmedia formulations, and is on par with competitive baselines.

In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been\nwidely used in text representation learning due to its ability to represent and\ncapture complex text information in a self-supervised setting. However, current\nmainstream graph contrastive learning methods often require the incorporation\nof domain knowledge or cumbersome computations to guide the data augmentation\nprocess, which significantly limits the application efficiency and scope of\nGCL. Additionally, many methods learn text representations only by constructing\nword-document relationships, which overlooks the rich contextual semantic\ninformation in the text. To address these issues and exploit representative\ntextual semantics, we present an event-based, simple, and effective graph\ncontrastive learning (SE-GCL) for text representation. Precisely, we extract\nevent blocks from text and construct internal relation graphs to represent\ninter-semantic interconnections, which can ensure that the most critical\nsemantic information is preserved. Then, we devise a streamlined, unsupervised\ngraph contrastive learning framework to leverage the complementary nature of\nthe event semantic and structural information for intricate feature data\ncapture. In particular, we introduce the concept of an event skeleton for core\nrepresentation semantics and simplify the typically complex data augmentation\ntechniques found in existing graph contrastive learning to boost algorithmic\nefficiency. We employ multiple loss functions to prompt diverse embeddings to\nconverge or diverge within a confined distance in the vector space, ultimately\nachieving a harmonious equilibrium. We conducted experiments on the proposed\nSE-GCL on four standard data sets (AG News, 20NG, SougouNews, and THUCNews) to\nverify its effectiveness in text representation learning.",

    "abstract": "Sequential inspection is a technique employed to monitor product quality\nduring the production process. For smaller batch sizes, the Acceptable Quality\nLimit(AQL) inspection theory is typically applied, whereas for larger batch\nsizes, the Poisson distribution is commonly utilized to determine the sample\nsize and rejection thresholds. However, due to the fact that the rate of\ndefective products is usually low in actual production, using these methods\noften requires more samples to draw conclusions, resulting in higher inspection\ntime. Based on this, this paper proposes a sequential inspection method with a\nfixed upper limit of sample size. This approach not only incorporates the\nPoisson distribution algorithm, allowing for rapid calculation of sample size\nand rejection thresholds to facilitate planning, but also adapts the concept of\nsequential inspection to dynamically modify the sampling plan and\ndecision-making process. This method aims to decrease the number of samples\nrequired while preserving the inspection's efficacy. Finally, this paper shows\nthrough Monte Carlo simulation that compared with the traditional Poisson\ndistribution algorithm, the sequential test method with a fixed sample size\nupper limit significantly reduces the number of samples compared to the\ntraditional Poisson distribution algorithm, while maintaining effective\ninspection outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Given a network $G=(V,E)$, where each node $v$ is associated with a vector\n$\\boldsymbol{p}_v \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ representing its opinion about $d$\ndifferent topics, how can we uncover subsets of nodes that not only exhibit\nexceptionally high density but also possess positively aligned opinions on\nmultiple topics? In this paper we focus on this novel algorithmic question,\nthat is essential in an era where digital social networks are hotbeds of\nopinion formation and dissemination. We introduce a novel methodology anchored\nin the well-established densest subgraph problem. We analyze the computational\ncomplexity of our formulation, indicating that our problem is NP-hard and\neludes practically acceptable approximation guarantees. To navigate these\nchallenges, we design two heuristic algorithms: the first is predicated on the\nLagrangian relaxation of our formulation, while the second adopts a peeling\nalgorithm based on the dual of a Linear Programming relaxation. We elucidate\nthe theoretical underpinnings of their performance and validate their utility\nthrough empirical evaluation on real-world datasets. Among others, we delve\ninto Twitter datasets we collected concerning timely issues, such as the\nUkraine conflict and the discourse surrounding COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, to gauge\nthe effectiveness of our methodology. Our empirical investigations verify that\nour algorithms are able to extract valuable insights from networks with opinion\ninformation.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a widely used and impactful distributed\noptimization framework that achieves consensus through averaging locally\ntrained models. While effective, this approach may not align well with Bayesian\ninference, where the model space has the structure of a distribution space.\nTaking an information-geometric perspective, we reinterpret FL aggregation as\nthe problem of finding the barycenter of local posteriors using a prespecified\ndivergence metric, minimizing the average discrepancy across clients. This\nperspective provides a unifying framework that generalizes many existing\nmethods and offers crisp insights into their theoretical underpinnings. We then\npropose BA-BFL, an algorithm that retains the convergence properties of\nFederated Averaging in non-convex settings. In non-independent and identically\ndistributed scenarios, we conduct extensive comparisons with statistical\naggregation techniques, showing that BA-BFL achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods while offering a geometric interpretation of the\naggregation phase. Additionally, we extend our analysis to Hybrid Bayesian Deep\nLearning, exploring the impact of Bayesian layers on uncertainty quantification\nand model calibration.",

Since\nthen, it has evolved into a flourishing research and development discipline,\noften associated with scheduling. Over the decades, various approaches to\nplanning have been developed with characteristics that make them appropriate\nfor specific tasks and applications. Most approaches represent the world as a\nstate within a state transition system; then the planning problem becomes that\nof searching a path in the state space from the current state to one which\nsatisfies the goals of the user. The notes begin by introducing the state model\nand move on to exploring classical planning, the foundational form of planning,\nand present fundamental algorithms for solving such problems. Subsequently, we\nexamine planning as a constraint satisfaction problem, outlining the mapping\nprocess and describing an approach to solve such problems. The most extensive\nsection is dedicated to Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning, one of the\nmost widely used and powerful planning techniques in the field.

All the scans were collected at the mean glandular\ndose of 2 mGy, using monochromatic X-rays with 32 keV energy, flat-panel\ndetectors with 0.1 mm pixels and 6 meter distance between the rotation stage\nand the detector. Paganin's phase retrieval method was used in conjunction with\nall three CT reconstruction algorithms. The reconstructed images were compared\nin terms of the objective image quality characteristics, including spatial\nresolution, contrast, signal-to-noise, and contrast-to-noise ratios. The images\nwere also evaluated by seven experienced medical imaging specialists, rating\nperceptible contrast, sharpness of tissue interfaces, image noise,\ncalcification visibility and overall image quality. Of the three compared\nalgorithms, cSART was clearly superior to UTR and FBP in terms of most measured\nobjective image quality characteristics. At the same time, the results of the\nsubjective quality evaluation consistently favoured the images reconstructed by\nFBP, followed by UTR, with cSART receiving lower scores on average. We argue\nthat this apparent disagreement between the objective and subjective\nassessments of image quality can be explained by the importance assigned to\nimage contrast in the subjective assessment, while the signal-to-noise ratio\nseemed to receive relatively low weighting.

Existing cloud-based model inference systems are costly, not easy to\nscale, and must be trusted in handling the models and user request data.\nServerless computing presents a new opportunity, as it provides elasticity and\nfine-grained pricing. Our goal is to design a serverless model inference system\nthat protects models and user request data from untrusted cloud providers. It\noffers high performance and low cost, while requiring no intrusive changes to\nthe current serverless platforms. To realize our goal, we leverage trusted\nhardware. We identify and address three challenges in using trusted hardware\nfor serverless model inference. These challenges arise from the high-level\nabstraction of serverless computing, the performance overhead of trusted\nhardware, and the characteristics of model inference workloads. We present\nSeSeMI, a secure, efficient, and cost-effective serverless model inference\nsystem. It adds three novel features non-intrusively to the existing serverless\ninfrastructure and nothing else.The first feature is a key service that\nestablishes secure channels between the user and the serverless instances,\nwhich also provides access control to models and users' data. The second is an\nenclave runtime that allows one enclave to process multiple concurrent\nrequests. The final feature is a model packer that allows multiple models to be\nexecuted by one serverless instance.

Experimental results show that, compared with\nthe current state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction methods, our reconstruction\nmethods obtain the best tradeoff between the reconstruction quality and speed.\nAdditionally, we design the FPGA implementation method of our algorithms to\nrealize the real-time (running at 20,000 FPS) visual reconstruction.

Building on an\ninformational approach, we derive geometric monotones of VQR using trace\ndistance, Hilbert-Schmidt distance, Schatten $p$-distances, Bures, and\nHellinger distances. We identify Bures and Hellinger distances as uniquely\nsatisfying all minimal criteria for a bona fide VQR monotone. Remarkably, these\ndistances can be expressed in terms of symmetric R\\'enyi and Sandwiched R\\'enyi\ndivergences, aligning geometric and entropic approaches. Our findings suggest\nthat the realism-information relation implies a deep connection between\ngeometric and entropic frameworks, with only those geometric distances\nexpressible as entropic quantities qualifying as valid monotones of VQR. This\nwork highlights the theoretical and practical advantages of geometric\ndistances, particularly in contexts where computational simplicity or symmetry\nis important.",

    "abstract": "Accurate human motion prediction is crucial for safe human-robot\ncollaboration but remains challenging due to the complexity of modeling\nintricate and variable human movements. This paper presents Parallel\nMulti-scale Incremental Prediction (PMS), a novel framework that explicitly\nmodels incremental motion across multiple spatio-temporal scales to capture\nsubtle joint evolutions and global trajectory shifts. PMS encodes these\nmulti-scale increments using parallel sequence branches, enabling iterative\nrefinement of predictions. A multi-stage training procedure with a\nfull-timeline loss integrates temporal context. Extensive experiments on four\ndatasets demonstrate substantial improvements in continuity, biomechanical\nconsistency, and long-term forecast stability by modeling inter-frame\nincrements. PMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing prediction\naccuracy by 16.3%-64.2% over previous methods.

    "abstract": "The Mapper algorithm is an essential tool for visualizing complex, high\ndimensional data in topology data analysis (TDA) and has been widely used in\nbiomedical research. It outputs a combinatorial graph whose structure implies\nthe shape of the data. However,the need for manual parameter tuning and fixed\nintervals, along with fixed overlapping ratios may impede the performance of\nthe standard Mapper algorithm. Variants of the standard Mapper algorithms have\nbeen developed to address these limitations, yet most of them still require\nmanual tuning of parameters. Additionally, many of these variants, including\nthe standard version found in the literature, were built within a deterministic\nframework and overlooked the uncertainty inherent in the data. To relax these\nlimitations, in this work, we introduce a novel framework that implicitly\nrepresents intervals through a hidden assignment matrix, enabling automatic\nparameter optimization via stochastic gradient descent. In this work, we\ndevelop a soft Mapper framework based on a Gaussian mixture model(GMM) for\nflexible and implicit interval construction. We further illustrate the\nrobustness of the soft Mapper algorithm by introducing the Mapper graph mode as\na point estimation for the output graph. Moreover, a stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithm with a specific topological loss function is proposed for\noptimizing parameters in the model. Both simulation and application studies\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the underlying topological\nstructures.

Structured pruning is an effective approach\nto reducing model size, but it often results in significant accuracy\ndegradation, necessitating parameter updates to adapt. Unfortunately, such\nfine-tuning requires substantial memory, which limits its applicability. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce quantization into the structured pruning\nframework to reduce memory consumption during both fine-tuning and inference.\nHowever, the combined errors from pruning and quantization increase the\ndifficulty of fine-tuning, requiring a more refined quantization scheme. To\nthis end, we propose QPruner, a novel framework that employs structured pruning\nto reduce model size, followed by a layer-wise mixed-precision quantization\nscheme. Quantization precisions are assigned to each layer based on their\nimportance to the target task, and Bayesian optimization is employed to refine\nprecision allocation strategies, ensuring a balance between model accuracy and\nmemory efficiency.

    "abstract": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) for understanding proteins primarily\ntreats amino acid sequences as a text modality. Meanwhile, Protein Language\nModels (PLMs), such as ESM-2, have learned massive sequential evolutionary\nknowledge from the universe of natural protein sequences. Furthermore,\nstructure-based encoders like ProteinMPNN learn the structural information of\nproteins through Graph Neural Networks. However, whether the incorporation of\nprotein encoders can enhance the protein understanding of LLMs has not been\nexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose EvoLlama, a multimodal framework that\nconnects a structure-based encoder, a sequence-based protein encoder and an LLM\nfor protein understanding. EvoLlama consists of a ProteinMPNN structure\nencoder, an ESM-2 protein sequence encoder, a multimodal projector to align\nprotein and text representations and a Llama-3 text decoder. To train EvoLlama,\nwe fine-tune it on protein-oriented instructions and protein property\nprediction datasets verbalized via natural language instruction templates. Our\nexperiments show that EvoLlama's protein understanding capabilities have been\nsignificantly enhanced, outperforming other fine-tuned protein-oriented LLMs in\nzero-shot settings by an average of 1%-8% and surpassing the state-of-the-art\nbaseline with supervised fine-tuning by an average of 6%. On protein property\nprediction datasets, our approach achieves promising results that are\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. We will release our\ncode in a future version.",

    "abstract": "The connection between inconsistent databases and Dung's abstract\nargumentation framework has recently drawn growing interest. Specifically, an\ninconsistent database, involving certain types of integrity constraints such as\nfunctional and inclusion dependencies, can be viewed as an argumentation\nframework in Dung's setting. Nevertheless, no prior work has explored the exact\nexpressive power of Dung's theory of argumentation when compared to\ninconsistent databases and integrity constraints. In this paper, we close this\ngap by arguing that an argumentation framework can also be viewed as an\ninconsistent database. We first establish a connection between subset-repairs\nfor databases and extensions for AFs, considering conflict-free, naive,\nadmissible, and preferred semantics. Further, we define a new family of\nattribute-based repairs based on the principle of maximal content preservation.\nThe effectiveness of these repairs is then highlighted by connecting them to\nstable, semi-stable, and stage semantics. Our main contributions include\ntranslating an argumentation framework into a database together with integrity\nconstraints. Moreover, this translation can be achieved in polynomial time,\nwhich is essential in transferring complexity results between the two\nformalisms.",

In this\ncontext, simultaneous spatial field and geometry estimation methods that\nexplicitly parameterize the background spatial field and the geometry of the\nembedded anomalies are of great interest. This paper introduces an advanced\ninversion procedure for simultaneous estimation using the domain independence\nproperty of the Karhunen-Lo\\`eve (K-L) expansion. Previous methods pursuing\nthis strategy face significant computational challenges. The associated\nintegral eigenvalue problem (IEVP) needs to be solved repeatedly on evolving\ndomains, and the shape derivatives in gradient-based algorithms require costly\ncomputations of the Moore-Penrose inverse. Leveraging the domain independence\nproperty of the K-L expansion, the proposed method avoids both of these\nbottlenecks, and the IEVP is solved only once on a fixed bounding domain.\nComparative studies demonstrate that our approach yields two orders of\nmagnitude improvement in K-L expansion gradient computation time. Inversion\nstudies on one-dimensional and two-dimensional seepage flow problems highlight\nthe benefits of incorporating geometry parameters along with spatial field\nparameters.

As a difference from the K2-based\ninvestigation, the ratio of SBCRs-to-asteroseismic radii did not depend on the\nmetallicity [Fe/H]. Moreover, the intriguing decreasing trend with\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] of the radius ratio for massive stars that was observed in K2\ndata was absent in Kepler data.

While diffusion models have demonstrated\nremarkable zero-shot capabilities in 2D image generation, their potential for\ncreating animatable 3D avatars from 2D inputs remains underexplored. In this\nwork, we introduce 3D$^2$-Actor, a novel approach featuring a pose-conditioned\n3D-aware human modeling pipeline that integrates iterative 2D denoising and 3D\nrectifying steps.

Complementing this, our Gaussian-based 3D\nrectifier renders images with enhanced 3D consistency through a two-stage\nprojection strategy and a novel local coordinate representation. Additionally,\nwe propose an innovative sampling strategy to ensure smooth temporal continuity\nacross frames in video synthesis. Our method effectively addresses the\nlimitations of traditional numerical solutions in handling ill-posed mappings,\nproducing realistic and animatable 3D human avatars.

Object part structures are first\ngenerated as their bounding primitives and articulation modes; a second\ntransformer, guided by these articulation structures, then generates each\npart's mesh triangles. To ensure coherency among generated parts, we introduce\nstructure-guided conditioning that also incorporates local part mesh\nconnectivity.

The installation of\ninstrumented baffles is part of the Advanced Virgo Plus upgrade in time for the\nO5 observing run. They were originally envisaged to be suspended, mounted on\nnew payloads and surrounding new larger end mirrors. The current Virgo upgrade\nplan includes the replacement of the mirrors with new ones of better quality\nand same dimensions, leaving the installation of new payloads and larger end\nmirrors to a post-O5 upgrade phase still to be defined. Here we demonstrate\nthat placing the instrumented baffles just beyond the cryotrap gate valve and\nin front of the end mirrors would be equally effective for monitoring scattered\nlight inside the cavities. This new location, more than a meter away from the\nmirror, further reduces the risk of contamination and any potential\ninterference with the mirrors, preserves the full capability to monitor\nscattered light, and decouples the instrumented baffle timeline from the plans\nfor installing large mirrors in the experiment.

We calculate the ground-state energies and excitation gaps of\nthe system and find that DWs with opposite chiralities form a well-defined\nlow-energy sector, distinctly isolated from higher excited states in the\npresence of anisotropies. This renders the chirality states suitable for\nencoding quantum information, serving as robust qubits. Interestingly, when a\nmagnetic field is applied, we observe tunneling between quantum DW states with\nopposite chiralities. Through quantum simulations, we construct an effective\nqubit Hamiltonian that exhibits strongly anisotropic $g$-factors, offering a\nway to implement single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we obtain an effective\ninteracting Hamiltonian for two mobile DWs in coupled quantum spin chains from\nDMRG simulations, enabling the implementation of two-qubit gates.Single-qubit\nand two-qubit gates are also demonstrated in real-time simulations using the\ntime-dependent variational principle.

Instead of using large-scale hair-text paired data for supervision,\nwe demonstrate that realistic hair strands can be generated from prompts by\ndistilling 2D generative models pre-trained on human mesh data.

However, these users are potentially being sensed, and/or\nactuated upon, by these devices, without their knowledge or consent. This\nnaturally triggers privacy, security, and safety issues.\n  To address this problem, some recent work explored device transparency in the\nIoT ecosystem. The intuitive approach is for each device to periodically and\nsecurely broadcast (announce) its presence and capabilities to all nearby\nusers. While effective, when no new users are present, this push-based approach\ngenerates a substantial amount of unnecessary network traffic and needlessly\ninterferes with normal device operation.\n  In this work, we construct DB-PAISA which addresses these issues via a\npull-based method, whereby devices reveal their presence and capabilities only\nupon explicit user request. Each device guarantees a secure timely response\n(even if fully compromised by malware) based on a small active Root-of-Trust\n(RoT). DB-PAISA requires no hardware modifications and is suitable for a range\nof current IoT devices.

For this reason, interatomic forces are usually computed\nas the derivatives of the potential energy, ensuring energy conservation.\nSeveral recent works have questioned this physically constrained approach,\nsuggesting that directly predicting the forces yields a better trade-off\nbetween accuracy and computational efficiency, and that energy conservation can\nbe learned during training.

Current practices in both\nindustry and academia advocate for the enhancement of device security through\nkey installation. However, it has been observed that, in practice, IoT vendors\nfrequently assign shared keys to batches of devices. This practice can expose\ndevices to risks, such as data theft by attackers or large-scale Distributed\nDenial of Service (DDoS) attacks. To address this issue, our intuition is to\nassign a unique key to each device. Unfortunately, this strategy proves to be\nhighly complex within the IoT context, as existing keys are typically hardcoded\ninto the firmware, necessitating the creation of bespoke firmware for each\ndevice. Furthermore, correct pairing of device keys with their respective\ndevices is crucial. Errors in this pairing process would incur substantial\nhuman and temporal resources to rectify and require extensive communication\nbetween IoT vendors, device manufacturers, and cloud platforms, leading to\nsignificant communication overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose\nthe OTA-Key scheme. This approach fundamentally decouples device keys from the\nfirmware features stored in flash memory, utilizing an intermediary server to\nallocate unique device keys in two distinct stages and update keys. We\nconducted a formal security verification of our scheme using ProVerif and\nassessed its performance through a series of evaluations. The results\ndemonstrate that our scheme is secure and effectively manages the large-scale\ndistribution and updating of unique device keys.

    "abstract": "Monitoring wildfires has become increasingly critical due to the sharp rise\nin wildfire incidents in recent years. Optical satellites like Sentinel-2 and\nLandsat are extensively utilized for mapping burned areas. However, the\neffectiveness of optical sensors is compromised by clouds and smoke, which\nobstruct the detection of burned areas. Thus, satellites equipped with\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), such as dual-polarization Sentinel-1 and\nquad-polarization RADARSAT-1/-2 C-band SAR, which can penetrate clouds and\nsmoke, are investigated for mapping burned areas. However, there is limited\nresearch on using compact polarisation (compact-pol) C-band RADARSAT\nConstellation Mission (RCM) SAR data for this purpose. This study aims to\ninvestigate the capacity of compact polarisation RCM data for burned area\nmapping through deep learning. Compact-pol m-chi decomposition and Compact-pol\nRadar Vegetation Index (CpRVI) are derived from the RCM Multi-look Complex\nproduct. A deep-learning-based processing pipeline incorporating ConvNet-based\nand Transformer-based models is applied for burned area mapping, with three\ndifferent input settings: using only log-ratio dual-polarization intensity\nimages images, using only compact-pol decomposition plus CpRVI, and using all\nthree data sources. The results demonstrate that compact-pol m-chi\ndecomposition and CpRVI images significantly complement log-ratio images for\nburned area mapping. The best-performing Transformer-based model, UNETR,\ntrained with log-ratio, m-chi decomposition, and CpRVI data, achieved an F1\nScore of 0.718 and an IoU Score of 0.565, showing a notable improvement\ncompared to the same model trained using only log-ratio images.",

To\nhighlight the impact of these tasks' performance, we start with gold-standard\nannotations, progressively add uniformly distributed errors, and observe their\nimpact in terms of character network quality. We demonstrate that NER\nperformance depends on the tested novel and strongly affects character\ndetection.

We also discuss the\naging effect in the FLEFE by investigating the influence of an aging time $t_a$\non the mean-squared displacement, time-averaged mean-squared displacement and\nautocovariance function of the increments.

Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit\nsentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence\ninformation into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly\ndecoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the\nsentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of\nsentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this\nend, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each\nlayer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next\nlayer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence\ninformation under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is\na plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly\nintegrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and\nautoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual\nSimilarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our\nproposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing\nprompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring\nnegligible additional inference cost.",

Although current models perform well, their effectiveness\ndiminishes when confronted with the diverse and evolving nature of real-world\ndeepfakes. To address this issue, we propose a continual learning method named\nRegion-Based Optimization (RegO) for audio deepfake detection. Specifically, we\nuse the Fisher information matrix to measure important neuron regions for real\nand fake audio detection, dividing them into four regions. First, we directly\nfine-tune the less important regions to quickly adapt to new tasks. Next, we\napply gradient optimization in parallel for regions important only to real\naudio detection, and in orthogonal directions for regions important only to\nfake audio detection. For regions that are important to both, we use sample\nproportion-based adaptive gradient optimization. This region-adaptive\noptimization ensures an appropriate trade-off between memory stability and\nlearning plasticity. Additionally, to address the increase of redundant neurons\nfrom old tasks, we further introduce the Ebbinghaus forgetting mechanism to\nrelease them, thereby promoting the capability of the model to learn more\ngeneralized discriminative features. Experimental results show our method\nachieves a 21.3% improvement in EER over the state-of-the-art continual\nlearning approach RWM for audio deepfake detection.

However,\nthe expensive computation cost prevents the application of diffusion models in\nresource-constrained scenarios. Quantization emerges as a practical solution\nthat significantly saves storage and computation by reducing the bit-width of\nparameters. However, the existing quantization methods for diffusion models\nstill cause severe degradation in performance, especially under extremely low\nbit-widths (2-4 bit). The primary decrease in performance comes from the\nsignificant discretization of activation values at low bit quantization. Too\nfew activation candidates are unfriendly for outlier significant weight channel\nquantization, and the discretized features prevent stable learning over\ndifferent time steps of the diffusion model. This paper presents MPQ-DM, a\nMixed-Precision Quantization method for Diffusion Models. The proposed MPQ-DM\nmainly relies on two techniques:(1) To mitigate the quantization error caused\nby outlier severe weight channels, we propose an Outlier-Driven Mixed\nQuantization (OMQ) technique that uses $Kurtosis$ to quantify outlier salient\nchannels and apply optimized intra-layer mixed-precision bit-width allocation\nto recover accuracy performance within target efficiency.(2) To robustly learn\nrepresentations crossing time steps, we construct a Time-Smoothed Relation\nDistillation (TRD) scheme between the quantized diffusion model and its\nfull-precision counterpart, transferring discrete and continuous latent to a\nunified relation space to reduce the representation inconsistency.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that MPQ-DM achieves significant accuracy\ngains under extremely low bit-widths compared with SOTA quantization methods.\nMPQ-DM achieves a 58\\% FID decrease under W2A4 setting compared with baseline,\nwhile all other methods even collapse.",

We aimed to\nstudy how cometary activity contributed to the formation and enlargement of\nthese depressions by analyzing Stardust flyby images and ground-based\nobservation data. Methods. We calculated the time-dependent water production\nrate of 81P inside the snow line (<3 au) and compared it with the observational\ndata. In addition, we estimated the fallback debris mass using an\nobservation-based model, where a dust ejection from 81P was considered to\nreproduce ground-based observations of the dust tail. We compared the total\nexcavated volume of water and dust with the total depression volume derived\nusing the 81P shape model. Results. We find that the total excavated volume\nafter 81P was injected into the inner Solar System accounts for up to only 30 %\nof the depression volume.

In addition, we estimate the dust-to-ice mass ratio for 81P\nto be 2-14. Conclusions. We suggest that most depressions were formed in the\nsource region of the Kuiper-belt objects.",

    "abstract": "Reaping the benefits of multi-antenna communication systems in frequency\ndivision duplex (FDD) requires channel state information (CSI) reporting from\nmobile users to the base station (BS). Over the last decades, the amount of CSI\nto be collected has become very challenging owing to the dramatic increase of\nthe number of antennas at BSs. To mitigate the overhead associated with CSI\nreporting, compressed CSI techniques have been proposed with the idea of\nrecovering the original CSI at the BS from its compressed version sent by the\nmobile users. Channel charting is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction\nmethod that consists in building a radio-environment map from CSIs. Such a\nmethod can be considered in the context of the CSI compression problem, since a\nchart location is, by definition, a low-dimensional representation of the CSI.\nIn this paper, the performance of channel charting for a task-based CSI\ncompression application is studied. A comparison of the proposed method against\nbaselines on realistic synthetic data is proposed, showing promising results.",

Continuous and\nuninterrupted light curves as well as high-resolution spectroscopic data are\ncrucial in determining the absolute physical parameters. Targets with both TMTS\nlight curves and LAMOST medium-resolution spectra were selected. The absolute\nphysical parameters were inferred with the W-D code for ten systems, all of\nthem are W-type shallow or medium contact binaries. The O'Connell effect\nobserved in the light curves can be explained by adding a spot on the primary\nor secondary component in the models. According to O-C analysis, the orbital\nperiods exhibit a long-term increasing or decreasing trend, amongst which\nJ0132, J1300, and J1402 show periodic variations that may be attributed to the\npresence of a third body or magnetic activity cycles.

Traditional auction mechanisms, like GSP, rely on\nthe independent CTR assumption and fail to account for the influence of other\ndisplayed items, termed externalities. Recent advancements in learning-based\nauctions have enhanced the encoding of high-dimensional contextual features.\nHowever, existing methods are constrained by the \"allocation-after-prediction\"\ndesign paradigm, which models set-level externalities within candidate ads and\nfails to consider the sequential context of the final allocation, leading to\nsuboptimal results. This paper introduces the Contextual Generative Auction\n(CGA), a novel framework that incorporates permutation-level externalities in\nmulti-slot ad auctions. Built on the structure of our theoretically derived\noptimal solution, CGA decouples the optimization of allocation and payment. We\nconstruct an autoregressive generative model for allocation and reformulate the\nincentive compatibility (IC) constraint into minimizing ex-post regret that\nsupports gradient computation, enabling end-to-end learning of the optimal\npayment rule. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that CGA\nsignificantly enhances platform revenue and CTR compared to existing methods,\nwhile effectively approximating the optimal auction with nearly maximal revenue\nand minimal regret.",

Recently,\nSharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown promise in this area by reducing\nthe sharpness of the loss landscape to obtain more generalized models. However,\nSAM and its variants sometimes fail to guide the model toward a flat minimum,\nand their training processes exhibit limitations, hindering further\nimprovements in model generalization. In this paper, we first propose an\nimproved model training process aimed at encouraging the model to converge to a\nflat minima. To achieve this, we design a curvature metric that has a minimal\neffect when the model is far from convergence but becomes increasingly\ninfluential in indicating the curvature of the minima as the model approaches a\nlocal minimum. Then we derive a novel algorithm from this metric, called Meta\nCurvature-Aware Minimization (MeCAM), to minimize the curvature around the\nlocal minima. Specifically, the optimization objective of MeCAM simultaneously\nminimizes the regular training loss, the surrogate gap of SAM, and the\nsurrogate gap of meta-learning. We provide theoretical analysis on MeCAM's\ngeneralization error and convergence rate, and demonstrate its superiority over\nexisting DG methods through extensive experiments on five benchmark DG\ndatasets, including PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet.

Proxy, which serves as abstract representations for simplifying\nfeature maps, enables global RF. However, existing proxy-based approaches face\ncritical limitations: Global proxies incur quadratic complexity for large-scale\npoint clouds and suffer positional ambiguity, while local proxy alternatives\nstruggle with 1) Unreliable sampling from the geometrically diverse point\ncloud, 2) Inefficient proxy interaction computation, and 3) Imbalanced\nlocal-global information fusion; To address these challenges, we propose Sparse\nProxy Point Transformer (SP$^{2}$T) -- a local proxy-based dual-stream point\ntransformer with three key innovations: First, for reliable sampling,\nspatial-wise proxy sampling with vertex-based associations enables robust\nsampling on geometrically diverse point clouds. Second, for efficient proxy\ninteraction, sparse proxy attention with a table-based relative bias\neffectively achieves the interaction with efficient map-reduce computation.\nThird, for local-global information fusion, our dual-stream architecture\nmaintains local-global balance through parallel branches. Comprehensive\nexperiments reveal that SP$^{2}$T sets state-of-the-art results with acceptable\nlatency on indoor and outdoor 3D comprehension benchmarks, demonstrating marked\nimprovement (+3.8% mIoU vs. SPoTr@S3DIS, +22.9% mIoU vs. PointASNL@Sem.KITTI)\ncompared to other proxy-based point cloud methods.",

Models and\ntheoretical considerations indicate that the runaway greenhouse on Earth-like\nexoplanets is generally accompanied by a dramatic increase in atmospheric\nH$_2$O and CO$_2$, which might be observed with the upcoming generation of\nspace telescopes. If an active biosphere extends the habitable timespan of\nexoplanets similarly to Earth, observing the atmospheric spectra of exoplanets\nnear the inner edge of the habitable zone could then give insights into whether\nthe planet is inhabited. Here, we explore this idea for Earth-like stagnant-lid\nplanets. We find that while for a reduced mantle, a surface biosphere extends\nthe habitable timespan of the planet by about 1 Gyr, for more oxidising\nconditions, the biologically enhanced rate of weathering becomes increasingly\ncompensated for by an increased supply rate of CO$_2$ to the atmosphere.\nObservationally, the resulting difference in atmospheric CO$_2$ near the inner\nedge of the habitable zone is clearly distinguishable between biotic planets\nwith active weathering and abiotic planets that have experienced a runaway\ngreenhouse. For an efficient hydrological cycle, the increased bioproductivity\nalso leads to a CH$_4$ biosignature observable with JWST. As the planet becomes\nuninhabitable, the H$_2$O infrared absorption bands dominate, but the\n4.3-micron CO$_2$ band remains a clear window into the CO$_2$ abundances. In\nsummary, while the effect of life on the carbonate-silicate cycle leaves a\nrecord in the atmospheric spectrum of Earth-like stagnant-lid planets, future\nwork is needed especially to determine the tectonic state and composition of\nexoplanets and to push forward the development of the next generation of space\ntelescopes.",

However, this scaling\nassumption often fails in real-world scenarios, where variations in drone\nflight states lead to scale mismatches between cross-view images, resulting in\nsevere performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a\nscale-adaptive partition learning framework that leverages known drone flight\nheight to predict scale factors and dynamically adjust feature extraction. Our\nkey contribution is a height-aware adjustment strategy, which calculates the\nrelative height ratio between drone and satellite views, dynamically adjusting\npartition sizes to explicitly align semantic information between partition\npairs. This strategy is integrated into a Scale-adaptive Local Partition\nNetwork (SaLPN), building upon an existing square partition strategy to extract\nboth finegrained and global features. Additionally, we propose a saliencyguided\nrefinement strategy to enhance part-level features, further improving retrieval\naccuracy.

Here, we\nstudy the properties of flares that are observed in the early afterglow phase\n(up to a few thousand of seconds). We split the sample into two groups: bursts\nwith and without X-ray plateau. We find that the distributions of flare\nproperties are similar in each group. Specifically, the peak time ($t_{\\rm\npk}$) of the flares and the ratio of the flare width to the flare peak time\n($w/t_{\\rm pk}$) which is found to be $\\approx 1$, regardless of the presence\nof a plateau. We discuss these results in view of the different theoretical\nmodels aimed at explaining the origin of the plateau. These results are\ndifficult to explain by viewing angle effects or late-time energy injection,\nbut do not contradict the idea that GRBs with X-ray plateau have low Lorentz\nfactor, of the order of tens. For these GRBs, the dissipation processes that\nproduce the flares naturally occur at smaller radii compared to GRBs with\nhigher Lorentz factors, while the flares maintain a similar behaviour. Our\nresults therefore provide an independent support for the idea that many GRBs\nhave a Lorentz factor of a few tens rather than a few hundreds.",

The Klein-Gordon and Dirac\nequations meet the same standard. We show that this standard can also be\napplied to quantum field theory (without collapse), examining two different\nways of assigning reduced density matrix states to regions of space. Our\npreferred method begins from field wave functionals and judges quantum field\ntheory to be local. Another method begins from particle wave functions (states\nin Fock space) and leads to either non-locality or an inability to assign\nstates to regions, depending on the choice of creation operators. We take this\nanalysis of quantum field theory (without collapse) to show that the\nmany-worlds interpretation of quantum physics is local at the fundamental\nlevel. We argue that this fundamental locality is compatible with either local\nor global accounts of the non-fundamental branching of worlds, countering an\nobjection that has been raised to the Sebens-Carroll derivation of the Born\nRule from self-locating uncertainty.",

In this work, we aim to understand when and how deep networks\n-- with standard architectures trained in a standard, supervised way -- learn\nsymmetries from data. Inspired by real-world scenarios, we study a\nclassification paradigm where data symmetries are only partially observed\nduring training: some classes include all transformations of a cyclic group,\nwhile others -- only a subset. In the infinite-width limit, where kernel\nanalogies apply, we derive a neural kernel theory of symmetry learning. The\ngroup-cyclic nature of the dataset allows us to analyze the Gram matrix of\nneural kernels in the Fourier domain; here we find a simple characterization of\nthe generalization error as a function of class separation (signal) and\nclass-orbit density (noise). This characterization reveals that generalization\ncan only be successful when the local structure of the data prevails over its\nnon-local, symmetry-induced structure, in the kernel space defined by the\narchitecture. We extend our theoretical treatment to any finite group,\nincluding non-abelian groups. Our framework also applies to equivariant\narchitectures (e.g., CNNs), and recovers their success in the special case\nwhere the architecture matches the inherent symmetry of the data. Empirically,\nour theory reproduces the generalization failure of finite-width networks (MLP,\nCNN, ViT) trained on partially observed versions of rotated-MNIST.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in 3D editing have highlighted the potential of\ntext-driven methods in real-time, user-friendly AR/VR applications. However,\ncurrent methods rely on 2D diffusion models without adequately considering\nmulti-view information, resulting in multi-view inconsistency. While 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) significantly improves rendering quality and speed,\nits 3D editing process encounters difficulties with inefficient optimization,\nas pre-trained Gaussians retain excessive source information, hindering\noptimization. To address these limitations, we propose EditSplat, a novel\ntext-driven 3D scene editing framework that integrates Multi-view Fusion\nGuidance (MFG) and Attention-Guided Trimming (AGT). Our MFG ensures multi-view\nconsistency by incorporating essential multi-view information into the\ndiffusion process, leveraging classifier-free guidance from the text-to-image\ndiffusion model and the geometric structure inherent to 3DGS. Additionally, our\nAGT utilizes the explicit representation of 3DGS to selectively prune and\noptimize 3D Gaussians, enhancing optimization efficiency and enabling precise,\nsemantically rich local editing. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations, EditSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a\nnew benchmark for text-driven 3D scene editing.",

    "abstract": "Optical computing is emerging as a promising platform for energy-efficient,\nhigh-throughput hardware in deep learning. A key challenge lies in the\nrealization of optical matrix-vector multiplication, which often requires\n$O(N^2)$ phase shifters for exact synthesis of $N \\times N$ matrices, limiting\nscalability. In this study, we propose an approximate matrix realization method\nusing multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) that reduces both the system size and\nthe number of phase shifters while maintaining acceptable error bounds. This\napproach uses low-entropy mode mixers, allowing more compact implementations\ncompared to conventional mixers. We introduce Shannon matrix entropy as a\nmeasure of mode coupling strength in mixers and demonstrate that low-entropy\nmixers can preserve computational accuracy while reducing the requirements for\nthe mixers. The approximation quality is evaluated using the maximum norm\nbetween the target and realized matrices. Numerical results show that the\nproposed method achieves sub-quadratic scaling of phase shifters by tolerating\npredefined error thresholds. To identify efficient architectures for\nimplementing general linear matrices, we compare block-encoding (BE) and\nsingular-value decomposition (SVD) schemes for realizing general linear\nmatrices using unitary converters based on MPLC. Results indicate that BE\nexhibits superior iterative configuration properties beyond the unitary group.\nBy characterizing the trade-offs between matrix entropy, number of phase\nshifter layers, and the error tolerance, this study provides a framework for\ndesigning scalable and efficient approximate optical converters.",

    "abstract": "Advanced large language models (LLMs) can generate text almost\nindistinguishable from human-written text, highlighting the importance of\nLLM-generated text detection. However, current zero-shot techniques face\nchallenges as white-box methods are restricted to use weaker open-source LLMs,\nand black-box methods are limited by partial observation from stronger\nproprietary LLMs. It seems impossible to enable white-box methods to use\nproprietary models because API-level access to the models neither provides full\npredictive distributions nor inner embeddings. To traverse the divide, we\npropose **Glimpse**, a probability distribution estimation approach, predicting\nthe full distributions from partial observations. Despite the simplicity of\nGlimpse, we successfully extend white-box methods like Entropy, Rank, Log-Rank,\nand Fast-DetectGPT to latest proprietary models. Experiments show that Glimpse\nwith Fast-DetectGPT and GPT-3.5 achieves an average AUROC of about 0.95 in five\nlatest source models, improving the score by 51% relative to the remaining\nspace of the open source baseline. It demonstrates that the latest LLMs can\neffectively detect their own outputs, suggesting that advanced LLMs may be the\nbest shield against themselves.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we derive a Fast Reflected Forward-Backward (Fast RFB)\nalgorithm to solve the problem of finding a zero of the sum of a maximally\nmonotone operator and a monotone and Lipschitz continuous operator in a real\nHilbert space. Our approach extends the class of reflected forward-backward\nmethods by introducing a Nesterov momentum term and a correction term,\nresulting in enhanced convergence performance. The iterative sequence of the\nproposed algorithm is proven to converge weakly, and the Fast RFB algorithm\ndemonstrates impressive convergence rates, achieving $o\\left( \\frac{1}{k}\n\\right)$ as $k \\to +\\infty$ for both the discrete velocity and the tangent\nresidual at the \\emph{last-iterate}. When applied to minimax problems with a\nsmooth coupling term and nonsmooth convex regularizers, the resulting algorithm\ndemonstrates significantly improved convergence properties compared to the\ncurrent state of the art in the literature. For convex optimization problems\nwith linear cone constraints, our approach yields a fully splitting primal-dual\nalgorithm that ensures not only the convergence of iterates to a primal-dual\nsolution, but also a \\emph{last-iterate} convergence rate of $o\\left(\n\\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ as $k \\to +\\infty$ for the objective function value,\nfeasibility measure, and complementarity condition.

The cooling\nlaser beams comprised the incident, retroreflected, and four diagonally\ndiffracted beams at an angle of 50{\\deg}. The intensity of the retroreflected\nbeam was carefully adjusted to balance the radiation forces acting on the\natoms. Despite the challenges posed by cesium atoms with high nuclear spin, a\nsignificant number of cold atoms ($7.0 {\\times} 10^6$) were captured when the\ndetuning and power of the incident beam were -10 MHz and 131 mW, respectively,\nwith the intensity of the retroreflected beam set to 69 % of that of the\nincident beam. The importance of the retroreflected beam in the trapping\nprocess was highlighted when the intensity ratio was reduced to 24 %, resulting\nin the absence of trapped atoms. This underscores the significance of the\nretroreflected beam in the trapping process. Notably, the distribution of the\ncold atom cloud differed from other magneto-optical traps, as it was not\ncentered in the region where the cooling beams overlapped. Instead, numerous\ncold atoms were observed when the cloud was positioned near the apex closer to\nthe grating side and an edge line of the overlapping region. Therefore,\ntrapping can be achieved with the assistance of attractive dipole forces\nexerted by the diffracted beams, which exhibits high intensities at these\npositions.",

Due to\nthe restricted nature of the mechanism and the potentially limited information\nit has to make its decision, it might not be always possible to choose the\noptimal alternative. We show tight bounds on the distortion of different\nmechanisms depending on the amount of the information they have access to; in\nparticular, we study full-information and ordinal mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Future Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) scenarios require high-speed, low-latency,\nand ultra-reliable communication services, particularly for applications such\nas autonomous driving and in-vehicle infotainment. Dense heterogeneous cellular\nnetworks, which incorporate both macro and micro base stations, can effectively\naddress these demands. However, they introduce more frequent handovers and\nhigher energy consumption. Proactive handover (PHO) mechanisms can\nsignificantly reduce handover delays and failure rates caused by frequent\nhandovers, especially with the mobility prediction capabilities enhanced by\nartificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies. Nonetheless,\nthe energy-efficient joint optimization of PHO and resource allocation (RA)\nremains underexplored. In this paper, we propose the AEPHORA framework, which\nleverages AI/ML-based predictions of vehicular mobility to jointly optimize PHO\nand RA decisions. This framework aims to minimize the average system\ntransmission power while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints on\ncommunication delay and reliability. Simulation results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the AEPHORA framework in balancing energy efficiency with QoS\nrequirements in high-demand V2X environments.",

In\ncontrast to previous works which reconstructed 2.223 MeV images over extended\ntime periods ($\\sim$20 minutes), we selected shorter integration times of the\norder of 2 to 3 minutes. Using simulations of the 2.223 MeV profile in\ncombination with observations of the prompt $\\gamma$-ray lines from the\nINTEGRAL mission, we obtain two separated integration time ranges representing\nthe peak of the flare and the start of the decay, respectively. The resulting\n$\\gamma$-ray images are then compared to GONG white-light (WL) observations to\nidentify where along the flaring ribbons electrons and protons precipitation\noccurs. We point out that previously reported results comparing RHESSI hard\nX-ray (HXR) and $\\gamma$-ray images only hold if the relative time evolution in\nthe two energy ranges is the same. As the decay times for the 28 October 2003\nis different at the considered two energy ranges (200-300 keV and around 2.223\nMeV), the previously published conclusion that electrons and protons\nprecipitate at different locations is an overstatement. Using shorter\nintegration times reveals that the $\\gamma$-ray and HXR sources spatially\ncoincide with the WL flare ribbons. Our key conclusion is that electron and\nproton precipitation sites coincide with the flare ribbons, suggesting that the\nelectron and proton precipitation sites are the same, at least within RHESSI's\nimaging capabilities.

However, radar point clouds suffer from pronounced\nsparsity and unavoidable angle estimation errors. To address these limitations,\nincorporating a camera may partially help mitigate the shortcomings.\nNevertheless, the direct fusion of radar and camera data can lead to negative\nor even opposite effects due to the lack of depth information in images and\nlow-quality image features under adverse lighting conditions. Hence, in this\npaper, we present the radar-camera fusion network with Hybrid Generation and\nSynchronization (HGSFusion), designed to better fuse radar potentials and image\nfeatures for 3D object detection. Specifically, we propose the Radar Hybrid\nGeneration Module (RHGM), which fully considers the Direction-Of-Arrival (DOA)\nestimation errors in radar signal processing. This module generates denser\nradar points through different Probability Density Functions (PDFs) with the\nassistance of semantic information. Meanwhile, we introduce the Dual Sync\nModule (DSM), comprising spatial sync and modality sync, to enhance image\nfeatures with radar positional information and facilitate the fusion of\ndistinct characteristics in different modalities.

A butterfly (a 2x2 bi-clique) is a critical substructure in\nbipartite graphs, playing a significant role in tasks like community detection,\nfraud detection, and link prediction. As more real-world data is presented in a\nstreaming format, efficiently counting butterflies in streaming bipartite\ngraphs has become increasingly important. However, most existing algorithms\ntypically assume that duplicate edges are absent, which is hard to hold in\nreal-world graph streams, as a result, they tend to sample edges that appear\nmultiple times, leading to inaccurate results. The only algorithm designed to\nhandle duplicate edges is FABLE, but it suffers from significant limitations,\nincluding high variance, substantial time complexity, and memory inefficiency\ndue to its reliance on a priority queue. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce DEABC (Duplicate-Edge-Aware Butterfly Counting), an innovative method\nthat uses bucket-based priority sampling to accurately estimate the number of\nbutterflies, accounting for duplicate edges. Compared to existing methods,\nDEABC significantly reduces memory usage by storing only the essential sampled\nedge data while maintaining high accuracy. We provide rigorous proofs of the\nunbiasedness and variance bounds for DEABC, ensuring they achieve high\naccuracy. We compare DEABC with state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world\nstreaming bipartite graphs. The results show that our DEABC outperforms\nexisting methods in memory efficiency and accuracy, while also achieving\nsignificantly higher throughput.",

We formulate a theoretical framework for inexact proximal point\n(IPP) methods for global optimization, establishing convergence guarantees\nunder mild assumptions when either deterministic or stochastic estimates of\nproximal operators are used. The quadratic regularization in the proximal\noperator and the scaling effect of a parameter $\\delta>0$ create a concentrated\nlandscape of an associated Gibbs measure that is practically effective for\nsampling. The convergence of the expectation under the Gibbs measure as\n$\\delta\\to 0^+$ is established, and the convergence rate of $\\mathcal\nO(\\delta)$ is derived under additional assumptions. These results provide a\ntheoretical foundation for evaluating proximal operators inexactly using\nsampling-based methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) integration. In addition, we\npropose a new approach based on tensor train (TT) approximation. This approach\nemploys a randomized TT cross algorithm to efficiently construct a low-rank TT\napproximation of a discretized function using a small number of function\nevaluations, and we provide an error analysis for the TT-based estimation. We\nthen propose two practical IPP algorithms, TT-IPP and MC-IPP.

This statistical paradigm has successfully guided the design of mobile\ncommunication systems from 1G to 5G. However, this approach relies on offline\nchannel measurements in specific environments, and the system passively adapts\nto new environments, resulting in deviation from the optimal performance. With\nthe pursuit of higher capacity and data rate of 6G, especially facing the\nubiquitous environments, there is an urgent need for a new paradigm to combat\nthe randomness of channel, i.e., more proactive and online manner. Motivated by\nthis, we propose an environment intelligence communication (EIC) based on\nwireless environmental information theory (WEIT) for 6G. The proposed EIC\narchitecture is composed of three steps: Firstly, wireless environmental\ninformation (WEI) is acquired using sensing techniques. Then, leveraging WEI\nand channel data, AI techniques are employed to predict channel fading, thereby\nmitigating channel uncertainty. Thirdly, the communication system autonomously\ndetermines the optimal air-interface transmission strategy based on real-time\nchannel predictions, enabling intelligent interaction with the physical\nenvironment. To make this attractive paradigm shift from theory to practice, we\nanswer three key problems to establish WEIT for the first time. How should WEI\nbe defined? Can it be quantified? Does it hold the same properties as\nstatistical communication information? Furthermore, EIC aided by WEI (EIC-WEI)\nis validated across multiple air-interface tasks, including CSI prediction,\nbeam prediction, and radio resource management.

In 2000 van Benthem shifted to the model-theoretic point\nof view by isolating a class of infinitary two-sorted properties, the flow\nformulas, which are preserved by all Chu transforms. D\\v{z}amonja and\nV\\\"a\\\"an\\\"anen in 2021 considered a special kind of Chu transforms, satisfying\na density condition. These authors used dense Chu transforms to compare\nabstract logics, in particular showing that such transforms preserve\ncompactness.\n  This motivates the problem of characterizing which properties are preserved\nby dense Chu transforms. We solve this problem by isolating the\ninconsistency-flow formulas, which are flow formulas with an added predicate to\nexpress inconsistency. Our main result characterizes the first-order\ninconsistency-flow formulas exactly as those first-order properties preserved\nby dense Chu transforms. Furthermore, we consider several instances of Chu\ntransforms in concrete situations such as topological spaces, graphs and\nultrafilters. In particular, we prove that Chu transforms between ultrafilters\ncorrespond to the Rudin-Keisler ordering.",

Thus, accurate\nautomated diagnostic coding of medical notes has become critical for a learning\nhealthcare system.

    "abstract": "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) offers a novel paradigm in machine\nlearning, enabling distinct entities to train models cooperatively while\nmaintaining data privacy. This method is particularly pertinent when entities\npossess datasets with identical sample identifiers but diverse attributes.\nRecent privacy regulations emphasize an individual's \\emph{right to be\nforgotten}, which necessitates the ability for models to unlearn specific\ntraining data. The primary challenge is to develop a mechanism to eliminate the\ninfluence of a specific client from a model without erasing all relevant data\nfrom other clients. Our research investigates the removal of a single client's\ncontribution within the VFL framework. We introduce an innovative modification\nto traditional VFL by employing a mechanism that inverts the typical learning\ntrajectory with the objective of extracting specific data contributions. This\napproach seeks to optimize model performance using gradient ascent, guided by a\npre-defined constrained model. We also introduce a backdoor mechanism to verify\nthe effectiveness of the unlearning procedure. Our method avoids fully\naccessing the initial training data and avoids storing parameter updates.\nEmpirical evidence shows that the results align closely with those achieved by\nretraining from scratch.

To\novercome this limitation, we introduce Controllable Website Fingerprint Defense\n(CWFD), a novel defense perspective based on backdoor learning. CWFD exploits\nbackdoor vulnerabilities in neural networks to directly control the attacker's\nmodel by designing trigger patterns based on network traffic. Specifically,\nCWFD injects only incoming packets on the server side into the target web\npage's traffic, keeping overhead low while effectively poisoning the attacker's\nmodel during training. During inference, the defender can influence the\nattacker's model through a 'red pill, blue pill' choice: traces with the\ntrigger (red pill) lead to misclassification as the target web page, while\nnormal traces (blue pill) are classified correctly, achieving directed control\nover the defense outcome. We use the Fast Levenshtein-like distance as the\noptimization objective to compute trigger patterns that can be effectively\nassociated with our target page.

These attributes should be factored into the\ntraining process, rather than blindly suppressed as in previous approaches.\nBased on this insight, we propose a structured multi-view-based\nout-of-distribution detection learning (MVOL) framework, which facilitates\nrational handling of the intrinsic in-distribution attributes in outliers. We\nprovide theoretical insights on the effectiveness of MVOL for OOD detection.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework to others.\nMVOL effectively utilizes both auxiliary OOD datasets and even wild datasets\nwith noisy in-distribution data.

The research on mechanism design using machine learning is\ncalled automated mechanism design or mechanism learning. In our research, we\nconstructed a new network based on the existing method for single auctions and\naimed to automatically design a mechanism by applying it to double auctions. In\nparticular, we focused on the following four desirable properties for the\nmechanism: individual rationality, balanced budget, Pareto efficiency, and\nincentive compatibility. We conducted experiments assuming a small-scale double\nauction and clarified how deterministic the trade matching of the obtained\nmechanism is. We also confirmed how much the learnt mechanism satisfies the\nfour properties compared to two representative protocols.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary image segmentation has been advanced through the synergy\nbetween mask generators and vision-language models like Contrastive\nLanguage-Image Pre-training (CLIP). Previous approaches focus on generating\nmasks while aligning mask features with text embeddings during training. In\nthis paper, we observe that relying on generated low-quality masks can weaken\nthe alignment of vision and language in regional representations. This\nmotivates us to present a new fine-tuning framework, named MaskCLIP++, which\nuses ground-truth masks instead of generated masks to enhance the mask\nclassification capability of CLIP. Due to the limited diversity of image\nsegmentation datasets with mask annotations, we propose incorporating a\nconsistency alignment principle during fine-tuning, which alleviates\ncategorical bias toward the fine-tuning dataset. After low-cost fine-tuning,\nMaskCLIP++ significantly improves the mask classification performance on\nmulti-domain datasets.

For medical image\nsegmentation from 3D data, such as computed tomography (CT), existing methods\ncan be broadly classified into 2D-based and 3D-based methods. One key\nlimitation in 2D-based methods is that the intra-slice information is ignored,\nwhile the limitation in 3D-based methods is the high computation cost and\nmemory consumption, resulting in a limited feature representation for\ninner-slice information. During the clinical examination, radiologists\nprimarily use the axial plane and then routinely review both axial and coronal\nplanes to form a 3D understanding of anatomy.

How to enhance and systematically evaluate the\ncross-view consistency of such models remains under-explored. To address this\nissue, we propose MOVIS to enhance the structural awareness of the\nview-conditioned diffusion model for multi-object NVS in terms of model inputs,\nauxiliary tasks, and training strategy. First, we inject structure-aware\nfeatures, including depth and object mask, into the denoising U-Net to enhance\nthe model's comprehension of object instances and their spatial relationships.\nSecond, we introduce an auxiliary task requiring the model to simultaneously\npredict novel view object masks, further improving the model's capability in\ndifferentiating and placing objects. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis\nof the diffusion sampling process and carefully devise a structure-guided\ntimestep sampling scheduler during training, which balances the learning of\nglobal object placement and fine-grained detail recovery. To systematically\nevaluate the plausibility of synthesized images, we propose to assess\ncross-view consistency and novel view object placement alongside existing\nimage-level NVS metrics.

However, owing to the most common methods do not\ntake into account the class imbalance problem in age estimation datasets, they\nsuffer from a large bias in recognizing long-tailed groups. To achieve\nhigh-quality imbalanced learning in long-tailed groups, the dominant solution\nlies in that the feature extractor learns the discriminative features of\ndifferent groups and the classifier is able to provide appropriate and unbiased\nmargins for different groups by the discriminative features. Therefore, in this\nnovel, we propose an innovative collaborative learning framework (GroupFace)\nthat integrates a multi-hop attention graph convolutional network and a dynamic\ngroup-aware margin strategy based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, to\nextract the discriminative features of different groups, we design an enhanced\nmulti-hop attention graph convolutional network. This network is capable of\ncapturing the interactions of neighboring nodes at different distances, fusing\nlocal and global information to model facial deep aging, and exploring diverse\nrepresentations of different groups. In addition, to further address the class\nimbalance problem, we design a dynamic group-aware margin strategy based on\nreinforcement learning to provide appropriate and unbiased margins for\ndifferent groups. The strategy divides the sample into four age groups and\nconsiders identifying the optimum margins for various age groups by employing a\nMarkov decision process. Under the guidance of the agent, the feature\nrepresentation bias and the classification margin deviation between different\ngroups can be reduced simultaneously, balancing inter-class separability and\nintra-class proximity.

Most existing studies\nprimarily focus on stable client states, neglecting the dynamic challenges\ninherent in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nTRust-Aware clIent scheduLing mechanism called TRAIL, which assesses client\nstates and contributions, enhancing model training efficiency through selective\nclient participation. We focus on a semi-decentralized FL framework where edge\nservers and clients train a shared global model using unreliable intra-cluster\nmodel aggregation and inter-cluster model consensus. First, we propose an\nadaptive hidden semi-Markov model to estimate clients' communication states and\ncontributions. Next, we address a client-server association optimization\nproblem to minimize global training loss. Using convergence analysis, we\npropose a greedy client scheduling algorithm. Finally, our experiments\nconducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that TRAIL outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving an improvement of 8.7% in test accuracy\nand a reduction of 15.3% in training loss.",

However, the growing scale of these\noptimization problems have outpaced commercial solvers commonly employed in\nproduction. To accelerate resource allocation, prior approaches either\ncustomize solutions for narrow domains or impose workload-specific assumptions.\nIn this work, we revisit real-world resource allocation problems and uncover a\ncommon underlying structure: the vast majority of these problems are inherently\nseparable, i.e., they optimize the aggregate utility of individual resource and\ndemand allocations, under separate constraints for each resource and each\ndemand. Building on this observation, we develop DeDe, a scalable and\ntheoretically rooted optimization framework for large-scale resource\nallocation. At the core of DeDe is a decouple-and-decompose approach: it\ndecouples entangled resource and demand constraints and thereby decomposes the\noverall optimization into alternating per-resource and per-demand subproblems\nthat can be solved efficiently and in parallel. We have implemented and\nreleased DeDe as a Python package with a familiar modeling interface. Our\nexperiments on three representative resource allocation tasks -- cluster\nscheduling, traffic engineering, and load balancing -- demonstrate that DeDe\ndelivers significant speedups while generating higher-quality allocations.",

In the first 2 periods, the source\nstayed in the low/hard state (LHS), where the X-ray (0.3--30 keV) and\noptical/UV SED can be both fitted with power-law models. We interpret that the\nX-ray emission arises from hot corona via Comptonization, whereas the\noptical/UV flux is dominated by synchrotron radiation from the jets, with a\npartial contribution from the irradiated disk. The optical/UV power-law\ncomponent smoothly connects to a simultaneous radio flux, supporting its jet\norigin.

It showed a much larger optical-to-X-ray\nluminosity ratio ($\\sim 8$) than in the initial outburst epoch. The primary\ncomponents of the spectral energy distribution (SED) can be best interpreted by\nradiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) spectrum showing a luminosity\npeak in the optical band.

In addition to the RIAF emission, a blue power-law component is\ndetected in the optical-UV SED, which is most likely synchrotron radiation from\nthe jet. The optical spectrum taken at the Seimei telescope shows a weak and\nnarrow H$\\alpha$ emission line, whose emitting region is constrained to be\n$\\gtrsim 2 \\times 10^{4}$ times the gravitational radius.

Existing backdoor attacks impose unconcealed triggers (e.g., a gray\nbox and eyeglasses) that contain evident patterns, rendering remarkable attack\neffects yet easy detection upon human inspection and defensive algorithms.\nWhile it is possible to improve stealthiness by reducing the strength of the\nbackdoor, doing so can significantly compromise its generality and\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose UIBDiffusion, the universal\nimperceptible backdoor attack for diffusion models, which allows us to achieve\nsuperior attack and generation performance while evading state-of-the-art\ndefenses. We propose a novel trigger generation approach based on universal\nadversarial perturbations (UAPs) and reveal that such perturbations, which are\ninitially devised for fooling pre-trained discriminative models, can be adapted\nas potent imperceptible backdoor triggers for DMs. We evaluate UIBDiffusion on\nmultiple types of DMs with different kinds of samplers across various datasets\nand targets. Experimental results demonstrate that UIBDiffusion brings three\nadvantages: 1) Universality, the imperceptible trigger is universal (i.e.,\nimage and model agnostic) where a single trigger is effective to any images and\nall diffusion models with different samplers; 2) Utility, it achieves\ncomparable generation quality (e.g., FID) and even better attack success rate\n(i.e., ASR) at low poison rates compared to the prior works; and 3)\nUndetectability, UIBDiffusion is plausible to human perception and can bypass\nElijah and TERD, the SOTA defenses against backdoors for DMs. We will release\nour backdoor triggers and code.",

While artificial\nintelligence (AI) has made significant advances in automating aspects of\nscientific reasoning, simulation, and experimentation, we still lack integrated\nAI systems capable of performing autonomous long-term scientific research and\ndiscovery. This paper examines the current state of AI for scientific\ndiscovery, highlighting recent progress in large language models and other AI\ntechniques applied to scientific tasks. We then outline key challenges and\npromising research directions toward developing more comprehensive AI systems\nfor scientific discovery, including the need for science-focused AI agents,\nimproved benchmarks and evaluation metrics, multimodal scientific\nrepresentations, and unified frameworks combining reasoning, theorem proving,\nand data-driven modeling. Addressing these challenges could lead to\ntransformative AI tools to accelerate progress across disciplines towards\nscientific discovery.",

Using\nLADUMA Data Release 1 (DR1), we analyze the HIMF via a new \"recovery matrix\"\n(RM) method that we benchmark against a more traditional Modified Maximum\nLikelihood (MML) method. Our analysis, which implements a forward modeling\napproach, corrects for survey incompleteness and uses extensive synthetic\nsource injections to ensure robust estimates of the HIMF parameters and their\nassociated uncertainties. This new method tracks the recovery of sources in\nmass bins different from those in which they were injected and incorporates a\nPoisson likelihood in the forward modeling process, allowing it to correctly\nhandle uncertainties in bins with few or no detections. The application of our\nanalysis to a high-purity subsample of the LADUMA DR1 spectral line catalog in\nturn mitigates any possible biases that could result from the inconsistent\ntreatment of synthetic and real sources. For the surveyed redshift range, the\nrecovered Schechter function normalization, low-mass slope, and \"knee\" mass are\n$\\phi_\\ast = 3.56_{-1.92}^{+0.97} \\times 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ dex$^{-1}$,\n$\\alpha = -1.18_{-0.19}^{+0.08}$, and $\\log(M_\\ast/M_\\odot) =\n10.01_{-0.12}^{+0.31}$, respectively, which together imply a comoving cosmic HI\ndensity of $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}=3.09_{-0.47}^{+0.65}\\times 10^{-4}$. Our results\nshow consistency between RM and MML methods and with previous low-redshift\nstudies, giving confidence that the cosmic volume probed by LADUMA, even at low\nredshifts, is not an outlier in terms of its HI content.",

This article looks at the published response to\nGibbs's book in the decade following its publication. What did these readers\nget from reading Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics? How did they\nput that to use? Was it fruitful? Samuel H. Burbury had been strongly critical\nof the assumptions on which Boltzmann's theory was built and had expressed a\nneed for a theory without them. Burbury was pleased with the foundation and\nrigor of Gibbs's approach, since in his first three chapters he had built on\nanalytical mechanics in the Hamiltonian formulation, a many-body dynamical\nsystem. Others found Gibbs hard to understand and some were critical. Hendrik\nA. Lorentz began teaching Gibbs's dynamical theory and supervised a thesis by\nLeonard Ornstein in which Orenstein developed applications built on grand\ncanonical ensembles and correlations, which were contrary to Boltzmann's\nmolecular disorder. Ornstein and Zernike expanded on material in that thesis to\ndevelop a theory of critical opalescence without infinities.",

Our method utilises score-based diffusion models to generate\nobject pose hypotheses to model the distribution of possible poses for the\nobject.

A common\napproach involves using a fixed decision tree as one player's strategy while\ntraining an RL agent as the opponent to identify vulnerabilities in the\ndecision tree, thereby improving its strategic strength iteratively. However,\nthis process often requires significant human intervention to refine the\ndecision tree after identifying its weaknesses, resulting in inefficiencies and\nhindering full automation of the strategy enhancement process. Fortunately, the\nadvent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a transformative opportunity to\nautomate the process. We propose RL-LLM-DT, an automatic decision tree\ngeneration method based on RL Evaluation and LLM Enhancement. Given an initial\ndecision tree, the method involves two important iterative steps. Response\nPolicy Search: RL is used to discover counter-strategies targeting the decision\ntree. Policy Improvement: LLMs analyze failure scenarios and generate improved\ndecision tree code. In our method, RL focuses on finding the decision tree's\nflaws while LLM is prompted to generate an improved version of the decision\ntree. The iterative refinement process terminates when RL can't find any flaw\nof the tree or LLM fails to improve the tree. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nthis integrated approach, we conducted experiments in a curling game. After\niterative refinements, our curling AI based on the decision tree ranks first on\nthe Jidi platform among 34 curling AIs in total, which demonstrates that LLMs\ncan significantly enhance the robustness and adaptability of decision trees,\nrepresenting a substantial advancement in the field of Game AI.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that generative language models often reflect and\namplify societal biases in their outputs. However, these studies frequently\nconflate observed biases with other task-specific shortcomings, such as\ncomprehension failure. For example, when a model misinterprets a text and\nproduces a response that reinforces a stereotype, it becomes difficult to\ndetermine whether the issue arises from inherent bias or from a\nmisunderstanding of the given content. In this paper, we conduct a\nmulti-faceted evaluation that distinctly disentangles bias from flaws within\nthe reading comprehension task. We propose a targeted stereotype mitigation\nframework that implicitly mitigates observed stereotypes in generative models\nthrough instruction-tuning on general-purpose datasets. We reduce stereotypical\noutputs by over 60% across multiple dimensions -- including nationality, age,\ngender, disability, and physical appearance -- by addressing\ncomprehension-based failures, and without relying on explicit debiasing\ntechniques. We evaluate several state-of-the-art generative models to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach while maintaining the overall\nutility. Our findings highlight the need to critically disentangle the concept\nof `bias' from other types of errors to build more targeted and effective\nmitigation strategies.

    "abstract": "Recently, a state-of-the-art family of algorithms, known as Goal-Conditioned\nWeighted Supervised Learning (GCWSL) methods, has been introduced to tackle\nchallenges in offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). GCWSL\noptimizes a lower bound of the goal-conditioned RL objective and has\ndemonstrated outstanding performance across diverse goal-reaching tasks,\nproviding a simple, effective, and stable solution. However, prior research has\nidentified a critical limitation of GCWSL: the lack of trajectory stitching\ncapabilities. To address this, goal data augmentation strategies have been\nproposed to enhance these methods. Nevertheless, existing techniques often\nstruggle to sample suitable augmented goals for GCWSL effectively. In this\npaper, we establish unified principles for goal data augmentation, focusing on\ngoal diversity, action optimality, and goal reachability. Based on these\nprinciples, we propose a Model-based Goal Data Augmentation (MGDA) approach,\nwhich leverages a learned dynamics model to sample more suitable augmented\ngoals. MGDA uniquely incorporates the local Lipschitz continuity assumption\nwithin the learned model to mitigate the impact of compounding errors.\nEmpirical results show that MGDA significantly enhances the performance of\nGCWSL methods on both state-based and vision-based maze datasets, surpassing\nprevious goal data augmentation techniques in improving stitching capabilities.",

Many attempts have been made to extract global spatial visual\ninformation from the RGB space of an spatial image. However, local and depth\nimage information are crucial for understanding the spatial environment, which\nprevious works have ignored. To address the issues, we propose a novel\nmulti-modal and multi-scale spatial environment understanding scheme to achieve\nimmersive VTTS, termed M2SE-VTTS. The multi-modal aims to take both the RGB and\nDepth spaces of the spatial image to learn more comprehensive spatial\ninformation, and the multi-scale seeks to model the local and global spatial\nknowledge simultaneously. Specifically, we first split the RGB and Depth images\ninto patches and adopt the Gemini-generated environment captions to guide the\nlocal spatial understanding. After that, the multi-modal and multi-scale\nfeatures are integrated by the local-aware global spatial understanding. In\nthis way, M2SE-VTTS effectively models the interactions between local and\nglobal spatial contexts in the multi-modal spatial environment.

To deal with the heterogeneity, lots of existing methods perform the\nweighted federation based on their calculated similarities between pairwise\nclients (i.e., subgraphs). However, their inter-subgraph similarities estimated\nwith the outputs of local models are less reliable, because the final outputs\nof local models may not comprehensively represent the real distribution of\nsubgraph data. In addition, they ignore the critical intra-heterogeneity which\nusually exists within each subgraph itself. To address these issues, we propose\na novel Federated learning method by integrally modeling the Inter-Intra\nHeterogeneity (FedIIH). For the inter-subgraph relationship, we propose a novel\nhierarchical variational model to infer the whole distribution of subgraph data\nin a multi-level form, so that we can accurately characterize the\ninter-subgraph similarities with the global perspective. For the\nintra-heterogeneity, we disentangle the subgraph into multiple latent factors\nand partition the model parameters into multiple parts, where each part\ncorresponds to a single latent factor. Our FedIIH not only properly computes\nthe distribution similarities between subgraphs, but also learns disentangled\nrepresentations that are robust to irrelevant factors within subgraphs, so that\nit successfully considers the inter- and intra- heterogeneity simultaneously.\nExtensive experiments on six homophilic and five heterophilic graph datasets in\nboth non-overlapping and overlapping settings demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method when compared with nine state-of-the-art methods.

Over the long term, accurately quantifying the\npower generation of renewable energy under the influence of climate change is\nessential for the development of sustainable power systems. However, due to\ninterdisciplinary differences in data requirements, climate data often lacks\nthe necessary hourly resolution to capture the short-term variability and\nuncertainties of renewable energy resources. To address this limitation, a\nsuper-resolution recurrent diffusion model (SRDM) has been developed to enhance\nthe temporal resolution of climate data and model the short-term uncertainty.\nThe SRDM incorporates a pre-trained decoder and a denoising network, that\ngenerates long-term, high-resolution climate data through a recurrent coupling\nmechanism. The high-resolution climate data is then converted into power value\nusing the mechanism model, enabling the simulation of wind and photovoltaic\n(PV) power generation on future long-term scales. Case studies were conducted\nin the Ejina region of Inner Mongolia, China, using fifth-generation reanalysis\n(ERA5) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) data under two climate\npathways: SSP126 and SSP585.

Our key idea\nis that both ASM and BCC rely on a shared depth estimation network.

Additionally, we leverage a non-aligned clear video and its\nestimated depth to independently regularize the dehazing and depth estimation\nnetworks.

This paper outlines a safety layer\nthat verifies the code generated by ChatGPT before executing it to control a\ndrone in a simulated environment. The safety layer consists of a fine-tuned\nGPT-4o model using Few-Shot learning, supported by knowledge graph prompting\n(KGP).

Application of our method\nyields 21 focal words whose increased occurrence in scientific abstracts is\nlikely the result of LLM usage. We then pose \"the puzzle of lexical\noverrepresentation\": WHY are such words overused by LLMs? We fail to find\nevidence that lexical overrepresentation is caused by model architecture,\nalgorithm choices, or training data. To assess whether reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) contributes to the overuse of focal words, we\nundertake comparative model testing and conduct an exploratory online study.\nWhile the model testing is consistent with RLHF playing a role, our\nexperimental results suggest that participants may be reacting differently to\n\"delve\" than to other focal words. With LLMs quickly becoming a driver of\nglobal language change, investigating these potential sources of lexical\noverrepresentation is important.

Despite the recent success of seeking global\ndata diversity, the diversity within each class and the similarity among\ndifferent classes are largely overlooked, resulting in data homogeneity and\nlimited performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel Relation-Guided\nAdversarial Learning method with triplet losses, which solves the homogeneity\nproblem from two aspects. To be specific, our method aims to promote both\nintra-class diversity and inter-class confusion of the generated samples. To\nthis end, we design two phases, an image synthesis phase and a student training\nphase. In the image synthesis phase, we construct an optimization process to\npush away samples with the same labels and pull close samples with different\nlabels, leading to intra-class diversity and inter-class confusion,\nrespectively. Then, in the student training phase, we perform an opposite\noptimization, which adversarially attempts to reduce the distance of samples of\nthe same classes and enlarge the distance of samples of different classes. To\nmitigate the conflict of seeking high global diversity and keeping inter-class\nconfusing, we propose a focal weighted sampling strategy by selecting the\nnegative in the triplets unevenly within a finite range of distance.

Deep learning-based landmark detection approaches have shown promise in\nmeasuring biometrics from US images, but the current state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nalgorithm, BiometryNet, is inadequate for FTD and FHC measurement due to its\ninability to account for the fuzzy edges of these structures and the complex\nshape of the FTD structure.

Codenames presents a highly interesting challenge\nfor achieving successful AI performance, requiring both a sophisticated\nunderstanding of language, theory of mind, and epistemic reasoning\ncapabilities. Prior attempts to develop agents for Codenames have largely\nrelied on word embedding techniques, which have a limited vocabulary range and\nperform poorly when paired with differing approaches. LLMs have demonstrated\nenhanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities for language-based tasks, but\ncan still suffer in lateral thinking challenges. We evaluate the capabilities\nof several state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5\nSonnet, and Llama 3.1, across a variety of board setups. Our results indicate\nthat while certain LLMs perform better than others overall, different models\nexhibit varying emergent behaviours during gameplay and excel at specific\nroles. We also evaluate the performance of different combinations of LLMs when\nplaying cooperatively together, demonstrating that LLM agents are more\ngeneralisable to a wider range of teammates than prior techniques.",

The inferred star formation history of 3C 59 shows\nsignificant star formation rejuvenation within the past 500 Myr, before which\nremains rather quiescent for most of the cosmic time. Three nearest satellite\ngalaxies of 3C 59 exhibit significant morphological disturbances, and two of\nthem present strong tidal tails pointing towards 3C 59. In addition, all the\nsatellite galaxies within a projected distance of 200 kpc show low star\nformation activities. They also have systematically lower effective radius\n($R_{\\rm e}$) than local late-type galaxies, while 3C 59 has significantly\nlarger $R_{\\rm e}$ than both early- and late-type galaxies. All these features\nsuggest that ongoing minor mergers between 3C 59 and its nearby satellites\ncould be causing gas to flow into 3C 59, which induces the star formation\nrejuvenation, and possibly also triggers the quasar activity. The enormous\npower from the large-scale radio jet of 3C 59 may in turn help keep the halo\nhot, prevent gas cooling, and further reduce star formation in its satellite\ngalaxies.

We show that\nthese electrostatic forces are governed by the negative gradient of orbital\nenergy, establishing a direct link between molecular orbital energy variations\nand nuclear motion. The forces generated by OROs, termed reactive-orbital-based\nelectrostatic forces (ROEFs), were systematically analyzed across 48\nrepresentative reactions. Our findings reveal that reactions can be classified\ninto four distinct types, with two dominant types emerging: those that maintain\nreaction-direction ROEFs either from the early stages or immediately preceding\nthe transition state. These ROEFs carve distinct grooves along the intrinsic\nreaction coordinates on the potential energy surface, shaping the reaction\npathway. Notably, ORO variations align directly with the curly arrow diagrams\nwidely employed in organic chemistry, bridging the curly arrow-like\nrepresentation of electron transfer with the rigorous potential energy surface\nframework.

    "abstract": "We present a novel method for collaborative robots (cobots) to learn\nmanipulation tasks and perform them in a human-like manner. Our method falls\nunder the learn-from-observation (LfO) paradigm, where robots learn to perform\ntasks by observing human actions, which facilitates quicker integration into\nindustrial settings compared to programming from scratch. We introduce Visual\nIRL that uses the RGB-D keypoints in each frame of the observed human task\nperformance directly as state features, which are input to inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL). The inversely learned reward function, which maps\nkeypoints to reward values, is transferred from the human to the cobot using a\nnovel neuro-symbolic dynamics model, which maps human kinematics to the cobot\narm. This model allows similar end-effector positioning while minimizing joint\nadjustments, aiming to preserve the natural dynamics of human motion in robotic\nmanipulation. In contrast with previous techniques that focus on end-effector\nplacement only, our method maps multiple joint angles of the human arm to the\ncorresponding cobot joints. Moreover, it uses an inverse kinematics model to\nthen minimally adjust the joint angles, for accurate end-effector positioning.\nWe evaluate the performance of this approach on two different realistic\nmanipulation tasks. The first task is produce processing, which involves\npicking, inspecting, and placing onions based on whether they are blemished.\nThe second task is liquid pouring, where the robot picks up bottles, pours the\ncontents into designated containers, and disposes of the empty bottles.

Considering weak probing of the magnon and driving of the\nskyrmion qubit, the second-order correlation function is analytically derived,\nand the optimal condition for realizing the magnon blockade is identified.\nUnder the optimal condition, we systematically analyze the behavior of the\nsecond-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ under different parameter\nregimes. Our analysis shows that with appropriate driving and probing field\nintensities, the magnon blockade effect can be significantly enhanced,\neffectively suppressing multi-magnon states and facilitating the generation of\nhigh-purity single-magnon states exhibiting pronounced antibunching.\nFurthermore, we explore the physical mechanisms underlying the magnon blockade,\nrevealing the coexistence and interplay of conventional and unconventional\nmagnon blockade.

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning is considered one of the flagship applications of\nquantum computers, where variational quantum circuits could be the leading\nparadigm both in the near-term quantum devices and the early fault-tolerant\nquantum computers. However, it is not clear how to identify the regime of\nquantum advantages from these circuits, and there is no explicit theory to\nguide the practical design of variational ansatze to achieve better\nperformance. We address these challenges with the stabilizer bootstrap, a\nmethod that uses stabilizer-based techniques to optimize quantum neural\nnetworks before their quantum execution, together with theoretical proofs and\nhigh-performance computing with 10000 qubits or random datasets up to 1000\ndata. We find that, in a general setup of variational ansatze, the possibility\nof improvements from the stabilizer bootstrap depends on the structure of the\nobservables and the size of the datasets. The results reveal that\nconfigurations exhibit two distinct behaviors: some maintain a constant\nprobability of circuit improvement, while others show an exponential decay in\nimprovement probability as qubit numbers increase. These patterns are termed\nstrong stabilizer enhancement and weak stabilizer enhancement, respectively,\nwith most situations falling in between. Our work seamlessly bridges techniques\nfrom fault-tolerant quantum computing with applications of variational quantum\nalgorithms.

    "abstract": "Device-to-device (D2D)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is one of the\ncritical technologies of future sixth generation (6G) networks. The core of\nD2D-assisted MEC is to reduce system latency for network edge UEs by supporting\ncloud computing services, thereby achieving high-speed transmission. Due to the\nsensitivity of communication signals to obstacles, relaying is adopted to\nenhance the D2D-assisted MEC system's performance and its coverage area.\nHowever, relay nodes and the base station (BS) are typically equipped with\nlarge-scale antenna arrays. This increases the cost of relay-assisted D2D MEC\nsystems and limits their deployment. Movable antenna (MA) technology is used to\nwork around this limitation without compromising performance. Specifically, the\ncore of MA technology lies in optimizing the antenna positions to increase\nsystem capacity. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel resource allocation\nscheme for MA-enhanced relay-assisted D2D MEC systems. Specifically, the MA\npositions and beamforming of user equipments (UEs), relay, and BS as well as\nthe allocation of resources and the computation task offloading rate at the MEC\nserver, all are optimized herein with the objective of minimizing the maximum\nlatency while satisfying computation and communication rate constraints. Since\nthis is a multivariable non-convex problem, a parallel and distributed penalty\ndual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm is developed and combined with\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) to solve this non-convex problem. The\nresults of extensive numerical analyses show that the proposed algorithm\nsignificantly improves the performance of the MA-enhanced relay-assisted D2D\ncommunication system compared to a counterpart where relays and the BS are\nequiped with traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA).",

Moreover, commonly imposed assumptions such\nas stationarity prevents them from capturing complex patterns in the data.\nWhile deep GPs can overcome this issue, training and making inference with them\nare difficult, again requiring crude approximations via inducing points. In\nthis work, we instead approach the problem through Bayesian deep learning,\nwhere spatiotemporal fields are represented by deep neural networks, whose\nlayers share the inductive bias of stationary GPs on the plane/sphere via\nrandom feature expansions. This allows one to (1) capture high frequency\npatterns in the data, and (2) use mini-batched gradient descent for large scale\ntraining.

In this context, fluorosis scores across tooth\nsurfaces present as zero-inflated, clustered, and longitudinal ordinal\noutcomes, prompting the development of a unified modeling framework.

Simulation studies validate the finite-sample performance of the\nproposed models, and a bootstrap-based power analysis further confirms the\nvalidity of the testing procedure. In our analysis of the IFS data, early-life\ntotal daily fluoride intake, average home water fluoride concentration, and\nspecific teeth and zones emerge as significant risk factors for dental\nfluorosis.

We characterize the time evolution of density\nprofiles, the penetration of free polymers into the gel and the connection\nbetween the gel and solution phase. The interfacial structure locally\nequilibrates after roughly 100 chain relaxation times. At late times, the free\nchains inside the gel undergo a percolation transition if the polymer\nconcentration in the gel exceeds a critical value, which is of the same order\nas the overlap concentration. The fluctuations of the interface can be\ndescribed by a capillary wave model that accounts for the elasticity of the\ngel. Based on this, we extract the interfacial tension of the gel-solution\ninterface. Interestingly, both the interfacial tension and the local\ninterfacial width increase with increasing free polymer concentration - in\ncontrast to liquid-liquid interfaces, where these two quantities are typically\nanticorrelated.",

    "abstract": "Detecting a pulsar associated with a supernova remnant (SNR) and/or pulsar\nwind nebula (PWN) is crucial for unraveling its formation history and pulsar\nwind dynamics, yet the association with a radio pulsar is observed only in a\nsmall fraction of known SNRs and PWNe. In this paper, we report the discovery\nof a young pulsar J1631$-$4722, associated with the Galactic SNR G336.7$+$0.5\nusing Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. It is also potentially\nassociated with a PWN revealed by the Rapid ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre\nArray Pathfinder) Continuum Survey (RACS). This 118 ms pulsar has a high\ndispersion measure of 873 $\\mathrm{pc\\,cm^{-3}}$ and a rotation measure of\n$-$1004 $\\mathrm{rad\\,m^{-2}}$. Because of such a high DM, at frequencies below\n2 GHz, the pulse profile is significantly scattered, making it effectively\nundetectable in previous pulsar surveys at $\\sim$1.4 GHz. Follow-up\nobservations yield a period derivative of $\\dot{P} = 3.6 \\times 10^{-15}$,\nimplying a characteristic age, $\\tau_{c} = 33\\,$kyr, and spin-down luminosity,\n$\\dot{E} = 1.3\\times10^{36}\\,$erg$\\,s^{-1}$. PSR$\\,$J1631$-$4722, with its high\nspin-down luminosity and potential link to a PWN, stands out as a promising\nsource of the high-energy $\\gamma$-ray emission observed in the region.",

    "abstract": "Information extraction from the scientific literature is one of the main\ntechniques to transform unstructured knowledge hidden in the text into\nstructured data which can then be used for decision-making in down-stream\ntasks. One such area is Trust in AI, where factors contributing to human trust\nin artificial intelligence applications are studied. The relationships of these\nfactors with human trust in such applications are complex. We hence explore\nthis space from the lens of information extraction where, with the input of\ndomain experts, we carefully design annotation guidelines, create the first\nannotated English dataset in this domain, investigate an LLM-guided annotation,\nand benchmark it with state-of-the-art methods using large language models in\nnamed entity and relation extraction. Our results indicate that this problem\nrequires supervised learning which may not be currently feasible with\nprompt-based LLMs.",
