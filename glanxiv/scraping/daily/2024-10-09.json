    "abstract": "The process of collecting blood from donors and making it available for\ntransfusion requires a complex series of operations involving multiple actors\nand resources at each step. Ensuring hospitals receive adequate and safe blood\nfor transfusion is a common challenge across low- and middle-income countries,\nbut is rarely addressed from a system level. This paper presents the first use\nof discrete event simulation to study the blood system in Kenya and to explore\nthe effect of variations and perturbations at different steps of the system on\nmeeting patient blood demand. A process map of the Kenyan blood system was\ndeveloped to capture critical steps from blood donation to transfusion using\ninterviews with blood bank, hospital, and laboratory personnel at four public\nhospitals across three counties in Kenya. The blood system was simulated\nstarting with blood collection, a blood bank where blood is tested and stored\nbefore it is issued, a major hospital attached to the blood bank, and several\nsmaller hospitals served by the same blood bank. Values for supply-side\nparameters were based mainly on expert opinion; demand-side parameters were\nbased on data from blood requisitions made in hospital wards, and dispatch of\nblood from the hospital laboratory. Illustrative examples demonstrate how the\nmodel can be used to explore the impacts of changes in blood collection (e.g.,\nprioritising different donor types), blood demand (e.g., differing clinical\ncase mix), and blood distribution (e.g., restocking strategies) on meeting\ndemand at patient level. The model can reveal potential process impediments in\nthe blood system and aid in choosing strategies for improving blood collection,\ndistribution or use. Such a systems approach allows for interventions at\ndifferent steps in the blood continuum to be tested on blood availability for\ndifferent patients presenting at diverse hospitals across the country.",

It shows significant improvement on various speech\napplications that are optimized with cross entropy criterion. However, it is\nnot straightforward to apply consistency regularization for the\ntransducer-based approaches, which are widely adopted for speech applications\ndue to the competitive performance and streaming characteristic. The main\nchallenge is from the vast alignment space of the transducer optimization\ncriterion and not all the alignments within the space contribute to the model\noptimization equally. In this study, we present Transducer Consistency\nRegularization (TCR), a consistency regularization method for transducer\nmodels. We apply distortions such as spec augmentation and dropout to create\ndifferent data views and minimize the distribution difference. We utilize\noccupational probabilities to give different weights on transducer output\ndistributions, thus only alignments close to oracle alignments would contribute\nto the model learning. Our experiments show the proposed method is superior to\nother consistency regularization implementations and could effectively reduce\nword error rate (WER) by 4.3\\% relatively comparing with a strong baseline on\nthe \\textsc{Librispeech} dataset.",

    "abstract": "An adaptive mesh refinement and error estimation method for numerically\nsolving optimal control problems is developed using Legendre-Gauss-Radau direct\ncollocation. In regions of the solution where the desired accuracy tolerance\nhas not been met, the mesh is refined by either increasing the degree of the\napproximating polynomial in a mesh interval or dividing a mesh interval into\nsubintervals. In regions of the solution where the desired accuracy tolerance\nhas been met, the mesh size may be reduced by either merging adjacent mesh\nintervals or decreasing the degree of the approximating polynomial in a mesh\ninterval. Coupled with the mesh refinement method described in this paper is a\nnewly developed relative error estimate that is based on the differences\nbetween solutions obtained from the collocation method and those obtained by\nsolving initial-value and terminal-value problems in each mesh interval using\nan interpolated control obtained from the collocation method. Because the error\nestimate is based on explicit simulation, the solution obtained via collocation\nis in close agreement with the solution obtained via explicit simulation using\nthe control on the final mesh, which ensures that the control is an accurate\napproximation of the true optimal control. The method is demonstrated on three\nexamples from the open literature, and the results obtained show an improvement\nin final mesh size when compared against previously developed mesh refinement\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Viral signal in wastewater offers a promising opportunity to assess and\npredict the burden of infectious diseases. That has driven the widespread\nadoption and development of wastewater monitoring tools by public health\norganizations. Recent research highlights a strong correlation between COVID-19\nhospitalizations and wastewater viral signals, and validates that increases in\nwastewater measurements may offer early warnings of an increase in hospital\nadmissions. Previous studies (e.g. Peng et al. 2023) utilize distributed lag\nmodels to explore associations of COVID-19 hospitalizations with lagged\nSARS-CoV-2 wastewater viral signals. However, the conventional distributed lag\nmodels assume the duration time of the lag to be fixed, which is not always\nplausible. This paper presents Markov-modulated models with distributed lasting\ntime, treating the duration of the lag as a random variable defined by a hidden\nMarkov chain. We evaluate exposure effects over the duration time and estimate\nthe distribution of the lasting time using the wastewater data and COVID-19\nhospitalization records from Ottawa, Canada during June 2020 to November 2022.\nThe different COVID-19 waves are accommodated in the statistical learning. In\nparticular, two strategies for comparing the associations over different time\nintervals are exemplified using the Ottawa data. Of note, the proposed Markov\nmodulated models, an extension of distributed lag models, are potentially\napplicable to many different problems where the lag time is not fixed.",

Such\napplications often involve datasets with numerical columns, but there has been\nmore emphasis placed on the semantics of categorical data in embeddings than on\nthe distinctive features of numerical data. In this paper, we propose a method\ncalled Gem (Gaussian mixture model embeddings) that creates embeddings that\nbuild on numerical value distributions from columns. The proposed method\nspecializes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify and cluster columns with\nsimilar value distributions. We introduce a signature mechanism that generates\na probability matrix for each column, indicating its likelihood of belonging to\nspecific Gaussian components, which can be used for different applications,\nsuch as to determine semantic types. Finally, we generate embeddings for three\nnumerical data properties: distributional, statistical, and contextual. Our\ncore method focuses solely on numerical columns without using table names or\nneighboring columns for context. However, the method can be combined with other\ntypes of evidence, and we later integrate attribute names with the Gaussian\nembeddings to evaluate the method's contribution to improving overall\nperformance. We compare Gem with several baseline methods for numeric only and\nnumeric + context tasks, showing that Gem consistently outperforms the\nbaselines on four benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Can large language models (LLMs) directly serve as powerful world models for\nmodel-based agents? While the gaps between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the\nspecified environment's dynamics do exist, our study reveals that the gaps can\nbe bridged by aligning an LLM with its deployed environment and such \"world\nalignment\" can be efficiently achieved by rule learning on LLMs. Given the rich\nprior knowledge of LLMs, only a few additional rules suffice to align LLM\npredictions with the specified environment dynamics. To this end, we propose a\nneurosymbolic approach to learn these rules gradient-free through LLMs, by\ninducing, updating, and pruning rules based on comparisons of agent-explored\ntrajectories and world model predictions. The resulting world model is composed\nof the LLM and the learned rules. Our embodied LLM agent \"WALL-E\" is built upon\nmodel-predictive control (MPC). By optimizing look-ahead actions based on the\nprecise world model, MPC significantly improves exploration and learning\nefficiency. Compared to existing LLM agents, WALL-E's reasoning only requires a\nfew principal rules rather than verbose buffered trajectories being included in\nthe LLM input. On open-world challenges in Minecraft and ALFWorld, WALL-E\nachieves higher success rates than existing methods, with lower costs on\nreplanning time and the number of tokens used for reasoning. In Minecraft,\nWALL-E exceeds baselines by 15-30% in success rate while costing 8-20 fewer\nreplanning rounds and only 60-80% of tokens.

Although robust methods for the\ntruncation-by-death problem in two-arm clinical trials have been previously\nstudied, its expansion to multi-arm clinical trials remains elusive. In this\narticle, we study the identification of a class of survivor average causal\neffect estimands with multiple treatments under monotonicity and principal\nignorability, and first propose simple weighting and regression approaches for\npoint estimation. As a further improvement, we derive the efficient influence\nfunction to motivate doubly robust estimators for the survivor average causal\neffects in multi-arm clinical trials. We also propose sensitivity methods under\nviolations of key causal assumptions.

    "abstract": "Using the semi-analytic model Serotina, we investigate the cosmic spin\nevolution of supermassive black holes incorporating recent results from general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of spin-down from relativistic\njets. We compare several variations of our model with compiled black hole spin\nmeasurements derived from X-ray reflection spectroscopy, correcting for a bias\narising from the spin-dependent radiative efficiency of accretion flows. We\nshow that the observed spin distribution is in agreement with a model that\nincludes jet-driven spin-down, a key mechanism that acts to modulate spins\nacross cosmic time at both high and very low specific accretion rates. The data\nalso clearly prefer models with coherent accretion over models in which\naccretion disks rapidly switch from prograde to retrograde. We further predict\nspin distributions accessible via spatially resolved event horizons by the\nnext-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and Black Hole Explorer (BHEX),\nas well as gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna\n(LISA), each of which offer unique and distinct windows into the population of\nspinning black holes. Jet-driven spin-down is most strongly imprinted on the\nabundance of very highly spinning objects in our model. In addition, we show\nthat the spin distribution sampled by LISA events may contain a signature of\nthe natal spin distribution of heavy seeds, but not of light seeds, offering\nadditional discrimination between these seeding pathways. Spin distributions\nfrom these future observed samples can be used to constrain the detailed\nphysical properties of the accretion flow on horizon scales around supermassive\nblack holes.",

This benchmark includes more than 3K instances spanning various\ntasks of attributable text generation.

This paper aims to fill this\nknowledge gap by systematically analyzing these choices including architecture,\nproblem formulation, pretraining scheme, use of image-based pretrained models,\nloss functions, noise injection, multi-step inputs, additional static masks,\nmulti-step finetuning (including larger stride models), as well as training on\na larger dataset. We study fixed-grid architectures such as UNet, fully\nconvolutional architectures, and transformer-based models, along with\ngrid-invariant architectures, including graph-based and operator-based models.\nOur results show that fixed-grid architectures outperform grid-invariant\narchitectures, indicating a need for further architectural developments in\ngrid-invariant models such as neural operators. We therefore propose a hybrid\nsystem that combines the strong performance of fixed-grid models with the\nflexibility of grid-invariant architectures. We further show that multi-step\nfine-tuning is essential for most deep-learning models to work well in\npractice, which has been a common practice in the past. Pretraining objectives\ndegrade performance in comparison to supervised training, while image-based\npretrained models provide useful inductive biases in some cases in comparison\nto training the model from scratch.

For instance, we can alter the\nbackground environment of a sounding object while keeping its appearance\nunchanged, or we can add new sounds contextualized to the visual content. To\naddress this task, we propose a new diffusion-based framework for joint\naudio-visual editing and introduce two key ideas.

    "abstract": "Network pruning has emerged as a potential solution to make LLMs cheaper to\ndeploy. However, existing LLM pruning approaches universally rely on the C4\ndataset as the calibration data for calculating pruning scores, leaving its\noptimality unexplored. In this study, we evaluate the choice of calibration\ndata on LLM pruning, across a wide range of datasets that are most commonly\nused in LLM training and evaluation, including four pertaining datasets as well\nas three categories of downstream tasks encompassing nine datasets. Each\ndownstream dataset is prompted with In-Context Learning (ICL) and\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), respectively. Besides the already intriguing\nobservation that the choice of calibration data significantly impacts the\nperformance of pruned LLMs, our results also uncover several subtle and often\nunexpected findings, summarized as follows: (1) C4 is not the optimal choice\nfor LLM pruning, even among commonly used pre-training datasets; (2) arithmetic\ndatasets, when used as calibration data, performs on par or even better than\npre-training datasets; (3) pruning with downstream datasets does not\nnecessarily help the corresponding downstream task, compared to pre-training\ndata; (4) ICL is widely beneficial to all data categories, whereas CoT is only\nuseful on certain tasks. Our findings shed light on the importance of carefully\nselecting calibration data for LLM pruning and pave the way for more efficient\ndeployment of these powerful models in real-world applications. We release our\ncode at: https://github.com/abx393/llm-pruning-calibration-data.",

    "abstract": "Guidewire segmentation during endovascular interventions holds the potential\nto significantly enhance procedural accuracy, improving visualization and\nproviding critical feedback that can support both physicians and robotic\nsystems in navigating complex vascular pathways. Unlike supervised segmentation\nnetworks, which need many expensive expert-annotated labels, sim-to-real domain\nadaptation approaches utilize synthetic data from simulations, offering a\ncost-effective solution. The success of models like Segment-Anything (SAM) has\ndriven advancements in image segmentation foundation models with strong\nzero/few-shot generalization through prompt engineering. However, they struggle\nwith medical images like X-ray fluoroscopy and the domain-shifts of the data.\nGiven the challenges of acquiring annotation and the accessibility of labeled\nsimulation data, we propose a sim-to-real domain adaption framework with a\ncoarse-to-fine strategy to adapt SAM to X-ray fluoroscopy guidewire\nsegmentation without any annotation on the target domain. We first generate the\npseudo-labels by utilizing a simple source image style transfer technique that\npreserves the guidewire structure. Then, we develop a weakly supervised\nself-training architecture to fine-tune an end-to-end student SAM with the\ncoarse labels by imposing consistency regularization and supervision from the\nteacher SAM network. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a\npublicly available Cardiac dataset and an in-house Neurovascular dataset, where\nour method surpasses both pre-trained SAM and many state-of-the-art domain\nadaptation techniques by a large margin.

    "abstract": "Context: Organizations opt for continuous delivery of incremental updates to\ndeal with uncertainty and minimize waste. However, applying continuous\nengineering (CSE) practices requires a continuous feedback loop with input from\ncustomers and end-users. Challenges: It becomes increasingly challenging to\napply traditional requirements elicitation and validation techniques with\never-shrinking software delivery cycles. At the same time, frequent deliveries\ngenerate an abundance of usage data and telemetry informing engineering teams\nof end-user behavior. The literature describing how practitioners work with\nuser feedback in CSE, is limited. Objectives: We aim to explore the state of\npractice related to utilization of user feedback in CSE. Specifically, what\npractices are used, how, and the shortcomings of these practices. Method: We\nconduct a qualitative survey and report analysis from 21 interviews in 13\nproduct development companies. We apply thematic and cross-case analysis to\ninterpret the data. Results: Based on our earlier work we suggest a conceptual\nmodel of how user feedback is utilized in CSE. We further report the identified\nchallenges with the continuous collection and analysis of user feedback and\nidentify implications for practice. Conclusions: Companies use a combination of\nqualitative and quantitative methods to infer end-user preferences. At the same\ntime, continuous collection, analysis, interpretation, and use of data in\ndecisions are problematic. The challenges pertain to selecting the right\nmetrics and analysis techniques, resource allocation, and difficulties in\naccessing vaguely defined user groups. Our advice to practitioners in CSE is to\nensure sufficient resources and effort for interpretation of the feedback,\nwhich can be facilitated by telemetry dashboards.",

    "abstract": "We consider a repeated Stackelberg game setup where the leader faces a\nsequence of followers of unknown types and must learn what commitments to make.\nWhile previous works have considered followers that best respond to the\ncommitment announced by the leader in every round, we relax this setup in two\nways. Motivated by natural scenarios where the leader's reputation factors into\nhow the followers choose their response, we consider followers with memory.\nSpecifically, we model followers that base their response on not just the\nleader's current commitment but on an aggregate of their past commitments. In\ndeveloping learning strategies that the leader can employ against such\nfollowers, we make the second relaxation and assume boundedly rational\nfollowers. In particular, we focus on followers employing quantal responses.\nInterestingly, we observe that the smoothness property offered by the quantal\nresponse (QR) model helps in addressing the challenge posed by learning against\nfollowers with memory. Utilizing techniques from online learning, we develop\nalgorithms that guarantee $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for quantal responding\nmemory-less followers and $O(\\sqrt{BT})$ regret for followers with bounded\nmemory of length $B$ with both scaling polynomially in game parameters.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in interpretability is to decompose model activations into\nmeaningful features. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising\ntool for this task. However, a central problem in evaluating the quality of\nSAEs is the absence of ground truth features to serve as an evaluation gold\nstandard. Current evaluation methods for SAEs are therefore confronted with a\nsignificant trade-off: SAEs can either leverage toy models or other proxies\nwith predefined ground truth features; or they use extensive prior knowledge of\nrealistic task circuits. The former limits the generalizability of the\nevaluation results, while the latter limits the range of models and tasks that\ncan be used for evaluations. We introduce SAGE: Scalable Autoencoder\nGround-truth Evaluation, a ground truth evaluation framework for SAEs that\nscales to large state-of-the-art SAEs and models. We demonstrate that our\nmethod can automatically identify task-specific activations and compute ground\ntruth features at these points. Compared to previous methods we reduce the\ntraining overhead by introducing a novel reconstruction method that allows to\napply residual stream SAEs to sublayer activations. This eliminates the need\nfor SAEs trained on every task-specific activation location. Then we validate\nthe scalability of our framework, by evaluating SAEs on novel tasks on\nPythia70M, GPT-2 Small, and Gemma-2-2. Our framework therefore paves the way\nfor generalizable, large-scale evaluations of SAEs in interpretability\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "A large-scale knowledge graph enhances reproducibility in biomedical data\ndiscovery by providing a standardized, integrated framework that ensures\nconsistent interpretation across diverse datasets. It improves generalizability\nby connecting data from various sources, enabling broader applicability of\nfindings across different populations and conditions. Generating reliable\nknowledge graph, leveraging multi-source information from existing literature,\nhowever, is challenging especially with a large number of node sizes and\nheterogeneous relations. In this paper, we propose a general theoretically\nguaranteed statistical framework, called RENKI, to enable simultaneous learning\nof multiple relation types. RENKI generalizes various network models widely\nused in statistics and computer science. The proposed framework incorporates\nrepresentation learning output into initial entity embedding of a neural\nnetwork that approximates the score function for the knowledge graph and\ncontinuously trains the model to fit observed facts. We prove nonasymptotic\nbounds for in-sample and out-of-sample weighted MSEs in relation to the\npseudo-dimension of the knowledge graph function class. Additionally, we\nprovide pseudo-dimensions for score functions based on multilayer neural\nnetworks with ReLU activation function, in the scenarios when the embedding\nparameters either fixed or trainable. Finally, we complement our theoretical\nresults with numerical studies and apply the method to learn a comprehensive\nmedical knowledge graph combining a pretrained language model representation\nwith knowledge graph links observed in several medical ontologies. The\nexperiments justify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effect of\nweighting in the presence of heterogeneous relations and the benefit of\nincorporating representation learning in nonparametric models.",

We show that certain measures on the\nspectrum of the empirical neural tangent kernel, specifically entropy and\ntrace, yield insight into the representations learned by a neural network and\nhow these can be improved through architecture scaling. These results are\ndemonstrated first on test cases before being shown on more complex networks,\nincluding transformers, auto-encoders, graph neural networks, and reinforcement\nlearning studies. In testing on a wide range of architectures, we highlight the\nuniversal nature of training dynamics and further discuss how it can be used to\nunderstand the mechanisms behind learning in neural networks. We identify two\nsuch dominant mechanisms present throughout machine learning training. The\nfirst, information compression, is seen through a reduction in the entropy of\nthe NTK spectrum during training, and occurs predominantly in small neural\nnetworks. The second, coined structure formation, is seen through an increasing\nentropy and thus, the creation of structure in the neural network\nrepresentations beyond the prior established by the network at initialization.\nDue to the ubiquity of the latter in deep neural network architectures and its\nflexibility in the creation of feature-rich representations, we argue that this\nform of evolution of the network's entropy be considered the onset of a deep\nlearning regime.",

Classical machine learning models struggle with\nchallenges such as high-dimensional data, class imbalances, poor feature\nrepresentations, and a lack of interpretability.

In this paper, we propose the Kolmogorov-Arnold Classical-Quantum\nDual-Channel Neural Network (KACQ-DCNN), a novel hybrid architecture that\nreplaces traditional multilayer perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KANs), enabling learnable univariate activation functions. Our KACQ-DCNN\n4-qubit, 1-layer model outperforms 37 benchmark models, including 16 classical\nand 12 quantum neural networks, achieving an accuracy of 92.03%, with\nmacro-average precision, recall, and F1 scores of 92.00%. It also achieved a\nROC-AUC of 94.77%, surpassing other models by significant margins, as validated\nby paired t-tests with a significance threshold of 0.0056 (after Bonferroni\ncorrection). Ablation studies highlight the synergistic effect of\nclassical-quantum integration, improving performance by about 2% over MLP\nvariants. Additionally, LIME and SHAP explainability techniques enhance feature\ninterpretability, while conformal prediction provides robust uncertainty\nquantification.

Traditional object detection methods often struggle to\nbalance high detection rates with low false alarm rates, especially when\ndealing with small objects. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that\ncombines a contrario paradigm with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to improve\nInfrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD). On the one hand, the integration of an\na contrario criterion into a YOLO detection head enhances feature map responses\nfor small and unexpected objects while effectively controlling false alarms. On\nthe other hand, we explore SSL techniques to overcome the challenges of limited\nannotated data, common in IRSTD tasks. Specifically, we benchmark several\nrepresentative SSL strategies for their effectiveness in improving small object\ndetection performance. Our findings show that instance discrimination methods\noutperform masked image modeling strategies when applied to YOLO-based small\nobject detection. Moreover, the combination of the a contrario and SSL\nparadigms leads to significant performance improvements, narrowing the gap with\nstate-of-the-art segmentation methods and even outperforming them in frugal\nsettings. This two-pronged approach offers a robust solution for improving\nIRSTD performance, particularly under challenging conditions.",

We use Torch, which couples stellar dynamics,\nmagnetohydrodynamics, star and binary formation, stellar evolution, and stellar\nfeedback through the AMUSE framework. We find that the binary fraction\ndecreases during cluster formation at all molecular cloud masses. The binaries'\norbital properties also change, with stronger and quicker changes in denser,\nmore massive clouds. Most of the changes we see can be attributed to the\ndisruption of binaries wider than 100 au, although the close binary fraction\nalso decreases in the densest cluster-forming region. The binary fraction for O\nstars remains above 90%, but exchanges and dynamical hardening are ubiquitous,\nindicating that O stars undergo frequent few-body interactions early during the\ncluster formation process. Changes to the populations of binaries are a\nby-product of hierarchical cluster assembly: most changes to the binary\npopulation take place when the star formation rate is high and there are\nfrequent mergers between sub-clusters in the cluster-forming region. A\nuniversal primordial binary distribution based on observed inner companions in\nthe Galactic field is consistent with the binary populations of young clusters\nwith resolved stellar populations, and the scatter between clusters of similar\nmasses could be explained by differences in their formation history.",

    "abstract": "Instance segmentation is a core computer vision task with great practical\nsignificance. Recent advances, driven by large-scale benchmark datasets, have\nyielded good general-purpose Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods.\nNatural Resource Monitoring (NRM) utilizes remote sensing imagery with\ngenerally known scale and containing multiple overlapping instances of the same\nclass, wherein the object contours are jagged and highly irregular. This is in\nstark contrast with the regular man-made objects found in classic benchmark\ndatasets. We address this problem and propose a novel instance segmentation\nmethod geared towards NRM imagery. We formulate the problem as Bayesian maximum\na posteriori inference which, in learning the individual object contours,\nincorporates shape, location, and position priors from state-of-the-art CNN\narchitectures, driving a simultaneous level-set evolution of multiple object\ncontours. We employ loose coupling between the CNNs that supply the priors and\nthe active contour process, allowing a drop-in replacement of new network\narchitectures. Moreover, we introduce a novel prior for contour shape, namely,\na class of Deep Shape Models based on architectures from Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs). These Deep Shape Models are in essence a non-linear\ngeneralization of the classic Eigenshape formulation. In experiments, we tackle\nthe challenging, real-world problem of segmenting individual dead tree crowns\nand delineating precise contours. We compare our method to two leading\ngeneral-purpose instance segmentation methods - Mask R-CNN and K-net - on color\ninfrared aerial imagery. Results show our approach to significantly outperform\nboth methods in terms of reconstruction quality of tree crown contours.\nFurthermore, use of the GAN-based deep shape model prior yields significant\nimprovement of all results over the vanilla Eigenshape prior.",

These regions are particularly prone to magnetic\nreconnection at the Sun. In recent simulations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs)\nwith the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model coupled to\nthe Energetic Particle Radiation Environment Module (EPREM) model, common\nsources of energetic particles were discovered over broad longitudinal\ndistributions in the background solar wind, far from the sites of particle\nacceleration driven by compressions and shocks in front of CMEs. Further\ninvestigation revealed these to be accelerated energetic particles from the\nQSLs and current sheets. The energy released from magnetic reconnection near\nthe QSL drives reconnection exhausts and field-aligned flows, which in turn\naccelerate energetic particles. The reconnection process also releases material\npreviously contained within closed magnetic field structures, which are often\nrich in heavy ions and $^3$He ions, as corroborated by recent PSP observations.\nTherefore, the seed populations produced by QSLs are expected to be rich in\n$^3$He and heavy ions. Thus, we present the first global model of energetic\nparticles accelerated from QSLs and above current sheets from the Sun. Our\nresults provide a plausible source for seed populations near the Sun, which\nlikely have $^3$He and heavy ion enhancements.

We study these questions\nusing real gravitational-wave observations from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\nCollaborations' third observing run.

Simulation serves as an inexpensive and potentially\nlimitless source of training data, but suffers from the semantics and physics\ndisparity between simulated and real-world environments. These discrepancies\ncan be minimized by training in digital twins, which serve as virtual replicas\nof a real scene but are expensive to generate and cannot produce cross-domain\ngeneralization. To address these limitations, we propose the concept of digital\ncousins, a virtual asset or scene that, unlike a digital twin, does not\nexplicitly model a real-world counterpart but still exhibits similar geometric\nand semantic affordances. As a result, digital cousins simultaneously reduce\nthe cost of generating an analogous virtual environment while also facilitating\nbetter robustness during sim-to-real domain transfer by providing a\ndistribution of similar training scenes.

The results reported here demonstrate good out-of-sample\nstatistical performance (F1-macro= 0.62) at medium to long investment horizons.\nIn particular, the buy signals generated from 10-K text are found most precise\nat 6 and 9 months in the future. As measured by the F1 score, the buy signal\nprovides between 4.8 and 9 percent improvement against a random stock selection\nmodel. In contrast, sell signals generated by the models do not perform well.\nThis may be attributed to the highly imbalanced out-of-sample data, or perhaps\ndue to management drafting annual reports with a bias toward positive language.\nCross-sectional analysis of performance by economic sector suggests that\nidiosyncratic reporting styles within industries are correlated with varying\ndegrees and time scales of price movement predictability.",

However, this relationship was already established in 2020 by Makri in\nthe context of the small matrix decomposition of the path integral (SMatPI) [J.\nChem. Theory and Comput. 16, 4038 (2020)]. The procedure that this article uses\nin its Supplementary Information (SI) to obtain the various matrices follows\nthe SMatPI decomposition steps for the alternative Trotter ordering. The\nabsence of endpoint effects in the kernel matrices of the discretized GQME\nexpression for the reduced density matrix (RDM) is the consequence of a crude\nGQME discretization and is not consistent with the SMatPI decomposition of an\nauxiliary matrix presented in the SI. This form is identical to the transfer\ntensor method (TTM) of Cerrillo and Cao [Phys. Rev.

Recently these models have been\ncombined to perform tasks on video, such as video summarization. Such video\nfoundation models perform pre-training by aligning outputs from each\nmodality-specific model into the same embedding space. Then the embeddings from\neach model are used within a language model, which is fine-tuned on a desired\ninstruction set. Aligning each modality during pre-training is computationally\nexpensive and prevents rapid testing of different base modality models. During\nfine-tuning, evaluation is carried out within in-domain videos where it is hard\nto understand the generalizability and data efficiency of these methods. To\nalleviate these issues we propose a plug-and-play video language model. It\ndirectly uses the texts generated from each input modality into the language\nmodel, avoiding pre-training alignment overhead. Instead of fine-tuning we\nleverage few-shot instruction adaptation strategies. We compare the performance\nversus the computational costs for our plug-and-play style method and baseline\ntuning methods. Finally, we explore the generalizability of each method during\ndomain shift and present insights on what data is useful when training data is\nlimited.

    "abstract": "In-hand manipulation of tools using dexterous hands in real-world is an\nunderexplored problem in the literature. In addition to more complex geometry\nand larger size of the tools compared to more commonly used objects like cubes\nor cylinders, task oriented in-hand tool manipulation involves many sub-tasks\nto be performed sequentially. This may involve reaching to the tool, picking it\nup, reorienting it in hand with or without regrasping to reach to a desired\nfinal grasp appropriate for the tool usage, and carrying the tool to the\ndesired pose. Research on long-horizon manipulation using dexterous hands is\nrather limited and the existing work focus on learning the individual sub-tasks\nusing a method like reinforcement learning (RL) and combine the policies for\ndifferent subtasks to perform a long horizon task. However, in general a single\nmethod may not be the best for all the sub-tasks, and this can be more\npronounced when dealing with multi-fingered hands manipulating objects with\ncomplex geometry like tools. In this paper, we investigate the use of a\nmixed-method approach to solve for the long-horizon task of tool usage and we\nuse imitation learning, reinforcement learning and model based control. We also\ndiscuss a new RL-based teacher-student framework that combines real world data\ninto offline training. We show that our proposed approach for each subtask\noutperforms the commonly adopted reinforcement learning approach across\ndifferent subtasks and in performing the long horizon task in simulation.\nFinally we show the successful transferability to real world.",

    "abstract": "The main purpose of percolation theory is to model phase transitions in a\nvariety of random systems, which is highly valuable in fields related to\nmaterials physics, biology, or otherwise unrelated areas like oil extraction or\neven quantum computing. Thus, one of the problems encountered is the\ncalculation of the threshold at which such transition occurs, known as\npercolation threshold. Since there are no known closed forms to determine the\nthreshold in an exact manner in systems with particular properties, it is\ndecided to rely on numerical methods as the Monte Carlo approach, which\nprovides a sufficiently accurate approximation to serve as a valid estimate in\nthe projects or research where it is involved. However, in order to achieve an\nexact characterization of the threshold in two-dimensional systems with site\npercolation, in this work it is performed an analysis of the complexity, both\ntemporal and spatial, of an algorithm that implements its computation from the\naforementioned numerical method. Specifically, the conduction of an accurate\nanalysis of the cost of such algorithm implies a deep enough knowledge about\ncertain metrics regarding its duration, or work completed per iteration, which\nalong with its formalization may contribute to the determination of the\nthreshold based on these metrics. Nevertheless, as a result, various bounds are\nachieved for the best, average and worst cases of the execution on systems\nspanning several dimensions, revealing that in 1 and 2 the complexity is\ndirectly conditioned by the duration, although from 3 onwards no proof for this\npoint has been found, notwithstanding the evidence suggesting its compliance.\nFurthermore, based on the average case, several methods are proposed that could\nbe applied to characterize the threshold, although they have not been\nthoroughly explored beyond what is necessary for the complexity analysis.",

Thermal feedback also affects the\nopacity-limited minimum mass and affects how protostellar outflows and binary\nfragmentation modify stellar masses. Considering the regions that collapse to\nform massive stars, we argue that thermal stabilization is likely to flatten\nthe high-mass slope of the initial mass function. Among regions that are\noptically thick to thermal radiation, we expect the stellar population to\nbecome increasingly top-heavy at higher column densities, although this effect\ncan be offset by lowering the metallicity.

The\ncritical initial step of identification of an appropriate set of state\nvariables remains challenging for two reasons. First, finding a compact set of\nmeaningfully predictive variables is mathematically difficult and\nunder-defined. A second reason is that variables found often lack physical\nsignificance, and are therefore difficult for human scientists to interpret. We\npropose a new general principle for distilling representations that are\nnaturally more aligned with human intuition, without relying on prior physical\nknowledge.

    "abstract": "The problem of a rigid disk rolling down a ramp is a classic problem given to\nstudents in introductory mechanics courses. In contrast, systematic studies on\nthe rolling behavior of an ellipse have only recently emerged. Unlike a rolling\ndisk, here the geometric center remains at a constant height from the floor,\nthe center of a rotating ellipse changes nonlinearly due to its eccentric\nshape. This eccentricity introduces new modes of motion beyond rolling,\nincluding rocking and hopping. Leveraging this multi-motion behavior, we design\nan ellipsoidal actuator which exhibits both rolling and hopping behaviors in\nresponse to changes in the applied angular velocity. Using a simple geometric\nframework, we successfully capture the motion of the actuator as a force-driven\nrigid ellipsoid on a non-slip flat surface, and identify the critical angular\nvelocity for the rolling-to-hopping transition. Furthermore, by adding\ndeformability to the actuator, we unlock new functionalities, enabling soft\nactuators that can climb slopes and work together to collectively ascend\nstairs.",

    "abstract": "We consider two fundamental communication tasks in arbitrary radio networks:\nbroadcasting (information from one source has to reach all nodes) and gossiping\n(every node has a message and all messages have to reach all nodes). Nodes are\nassigned labels that are (not necessarily different) binary strings. Each node\nknows its own label and can use it as a parameter in the same deterministic\nalgorithm. The length of a labeling scheme is the largest length of a label.\nThe goal is to find labeling schemes of asymptotically optimal length for the\nabove tasks, and to design fast deterministic distributed algorithms for each\nof them, using labels of optimal length.\n  Our main result concerns broadcasting.\n  We show the existence of a labeling scheme of constant length that supports\nbroadcasting in time $O(D+\\log^2 n)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the network\nand $n$ is the number of nodes. This broadcasting time is an improvement over\nthe best currently known $O(D\\log n + \\log^2 n)$ time of broadcasting with\nconstant-length labels, due to Ellen and Gilbert (SPAA 2020). It also matches\nthe optimal broadcasting time in radio networks of known topology. Hence, we\nshow that appropriately chosen node labels of constant length permit to\nachieve, in a distributed way, the optimal centralized broadcasting time. This\nis, perhaps, the most surprising finding of this paper. We are able to obtain\nour result thanks to a novel methodological tool of propagating information in\nradio networks, that we call a 2-height respecting tree.\n  Next, we apply our broadcasting algorithm to solve the gossiping problem.\n  We get a gossiping algorithm working in time $O(D + \\Delta\\log n + \\log^2\nn)$, using a labeling scheme of optimal length $O(\\log \\Delta)$, where $\\Delta$\nis the maximum degree. Our time is the same as the best known gossiping time in\nradio networks of known topology.",

We develop a methodology to constrain the global ionization\nfraction of the IGM $(Q_{\\rm HII})$ using low-resolution spectra, employing the\nrandom forest classification (RFC) method. We construct mock spectra using the\nsimulated galaxies and the IGM from the Cosmic Dawn II simulation and train RFC\nmodels to estimate $Q_{\\rm HII}$ at the redshift of the source and to detect\nthe presence of a damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorber (DLA). We find that individual\ngalaxy spectra with spectral bins between 1220 and 1270 {\\AA} and with\nsignal-to-noise ratios greater than 20 can place tight constraints on $Q_{\\rm\nHII}$, provided the UV continuum is accurately modeled. This method is\nparticularly effective for the early phase of reionization ($Q_{\\rm\nHII}<50\\%$), when the IGM opacity is high in the DW. As a demonstration, we\napply our model to existing NIRSpec PRISM/CLEAR spectra, placing upper bounds\nof $Q_{\\rm HII}=59.6\\%$, $5.6\\%$, and $18.5\\%$ at $z=7.7,~9.4,$ and $10.6$,\nrespectively, with $68\\%$ confidence, though several modeling uncertainties\nremain to be discussed.

    "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is a widely used technique in the\nbiomedical field for measuring the decay times of fluorescent molecules,\nproviding insights into metabolic states, protein interactions, and\nligand-receptor bindings. However, its broader application in fast biological\nprocesses, such as dynamic activity monitoring, and clinical use, such as in\nguided surgery, is limited by long data acquisition times and computationally\ndemanding data processing. While deep learning has reduced post-processing\ntimes, time-resolved data acquisition remains a bottleneck for real-time\napplications. To address this, we propose a method to achieve real-time FLI\nusing an FPGA-based hardware accelerator. Specifically, we implemented a\nGRU-based sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model on an FPGA board compatible with\ntime-resolved cameras. The GRU model balances accurate processing with the\nresource constraints of FPGAs, which have limited DSP units and BRAM. The\nlimited memory and computational resources on the FPGA require efficient\nscheduling of operations and memory allocation to deploy deep learning models\nfor low-latency applications. We address these challenges by using STOMP, a\nqueue-based discrete-event simulator that automates and optimizes task\nscheduling and memory management on hardware. By integrating a GRU-based\nSeq2Seq model and its compressed version, called Seq2SeqLite, generated through\nknowledge distillation, we were able to process multiple pixels in parallel,\nreducing latency compared to sequential processing. We explore various levels\nof parallelism to achieve an optimal balance between performance and resource\nutilization. Our results indicate that the proposed techniques achieved a 17.7x\nand 52.0x speedup over manual scheduling for the Seq2Seq model and the\nSeq2SeqLite model, respectively.",

This method\nensures that correlations among various halo properties, as well as their\ndependence on the local environment, are preserved. In this work, we trained\nHALOSCOPE with a high-resolution (HR) simulation and used it to better\ndetermine the properties (concentration, spin, and two shape parameters) of\nunresolved dark matter haloes in an eight times lower resolution simulation.\nHALOSCOPE is able to recover the multi-dimensional halo assembly bias, that is,\nthe correlations of different combinations of halo properties with the\nlarge-scale environment, measured in the HR simulation. This is achieved by\nincluding the linear halo-by-halo bias and tidal anisotropy in the set of input\ntraining parameters. HALOSCOPE, by design, also recovers the joint distribution\nof the halo properties. To study how resolution effects propagate into the\nclustering of model galaxies, we generated catalogues of central galaxies using\ntwo implementations of the assembly bias in a halo occupation distribution\nmodel.

    "abstract": "We illustrate the main points behind the computation of the gravitational\nwave spectrum originated from a phase in the early universe where the energy\ndensity is dominated by highly excited fundamental string degrees of freedom -\na Hagedorn phase. This phase is described using the Boltzmann equation approach\nto string thermodynamics, which we illustrate via a toy model which permits\nanalytic computations for the evolution of perturbations. This window into the\nout-of-equilibrium regime allows us to compute equilibration rates and conclude\nthat, in realistic scenarios, long, open strings dominate the ensemble, source\ngravitational waves and provide a succesful reheating. Furthermore, we compare\nthe results against the Standard Model prediction for a gravitational wave\nbackground of thermal origin and conclude that the string prediction is larger.\nThis is one of the few cases in which a signal of stringy origin dominates over\nthe field theory analogue.

We train \\textsc{Psi-GAN} as a generative adversarial network on $2\\,000$\nsimulation boxes from the Quijote simulation suite.

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to simultaneously enhance the effectiveness and\nefficiency of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods. To achieve this, we propose\nMoE++, a general and heterogeneous MoE framework that integrates both\nFeed-Forward Network~(FFN) and zero-computation experts. Specifically, we\nintroduce three types of zero-computation experts: the zero expert, copy\nexpert, and constant expert, which correspond to discard, skip, and replace\noperations, respectively. This design offers three key advantages: (i) Low\nComputing Overhead: Unlike the uniform mixing mechanism for all tokens within\nvanilla MoE, MoE++ allows each token to engage with a dynamic number of FFNs,\nbe adjusted by constant vectors, or even skip the MoE layer entirely. (ii) High\nPerformance: By enabling simple tokens to utilize fewer FFN experts, MoE++\nallows more experts to focus on challenging tokens, thereby unlocking greater\nperformance potential than vanilla MoE. (iii) Deployment Friendly: Given that\nzero-computation experts have negligible parameters, we can deploy all\nzero-computation experts on each GPU, eliminating the significant communication\noverhead and expert load imbalance associated with FFN experts distributed\nacross different GPUs. Moreover, we leverage gating residuals, enabling each\ntoken to consider the pathway taken in the previous layer when selecting the\nappropriate experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MoE++\nachieves better performance while delivering 1.1-2.1x expert forward throughput\ncompared to a vanilla MoE model of the same size, which lays a solid foundation\nfor developing advanced and efficient MoE-related models.",

To interpret the observed features in the RIXS spectra, we perform a\ntheoretical perturbative analysis to compute the energy dispersions which are\nthen utilized to determine the density of states (DOS) for both the\nsingle-particle and the two-particle excitation spectra. Our results show that\nthe single-particle continua of the direct RIXS spectrum align with the energy\nlevels observed in the DOS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations.\nFurthermore, the two-particle continua are revealed in the indirect RIXS\nprocess, where all possible single particle excitations combine to form the\nvarious two-particle excitations of the trimer spin chain. Based on our\ncalculations, we propose the RIXS mechanism of generating the fractionalized\n(spinon) and collective (doublon and quarton) excitations in the trimer spin\nchain at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge, including discussing the interplay\nof these excitations in the RIXS spectrum for various trimer coupling strength.\nThe computed energy range of the excitations suggest the possibility of\nexperimental detection at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge within the current\ncapabilities of RIXS instrumentation resolution.",

By construction, our sample will miss sources affected by severe\nnarrow-line reddening, and thus segregates sources dominated by small-scale\nnuclear obscuration from large-scale host-galaxy obscuration. This bias implies\nan even higher intrinsic obscured AGN fraction may be possible, although tests\nfor additional biases arising from our infrared selection find no strong\neffects on the measured column-density distribution. NuLANDS thus holds\npotential as an optimized sample for future follow-up with current and\nnext-generation instruments aiming to study the local AGN population in an\nisotropic manner.",

So far, the focus has almost\nexclusively been on charge transport, but a natural question is whether it is\npossible to obtain nonreciprocal spin transport without dissipation. Here, we\ndemonstrate that it is possible to generate electrically tunable nonreciprocal\nspin transport carried by a supercurrent using superconductor/ferromagnet\nmultilayers. The nonreciprocal spin supercurrent reaches an ideal efficiency of\n100%, meaning that the spin-polarization of the critical current is finite in\none flow direction whereas it vanishes in the other direction. We explain the\nunderlying physics generating this phenomenon. This result provides a way to\nintegrate nonreciprocal supercurrents with spin-polarization, offering new\nfunctionality in quantum technologies based on Josephson junctions.",

This is mainly due to their reliance on non-specific human-written\nreferences or noisy pre-training data. Still, finding an effective metric is\ncrucial not only for captions evaluation but also for the generation phase.\nMetrics can indeed play a key role in the fine-tuning stage of captioning\nmodels, ultimately enhancing the quality of the generated captions. In this\npaper, we propose PAC-S++, a learnable metric that leverages the CLIP model,\npre-trained on both web-collected and cleaned data and regularized through\nadditional pairs of generated visual and textual positive samples. Exploiting\nthis stronger and curated pre-training, we also apply PAC-S++ as a reward in\nthe Self-Critical Sequence Training (SCST) stage typically employed to\nfine-tune captioning models. Extensive experiments on different image and video\ndatasets highlight the effectiveness of PAC-S++ compared to popular metrics for\nthe task, including its sensitivity to object hallucinations.

We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified\napproach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations.\nWithin this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model\n(NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce\ngenerating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly\nin the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM,\nwe determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables.\nCrucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its\nsymmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First,\nthis leads to the \"information-charge separation\": charge cumulants get\ndecoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the\nvolume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$,\nthe interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge\ncumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction,\nthere are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions,\nfor which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase.

Our results\nshow that higher mass-loss rates result in earlier envelope stripping and\nshorter RSG lifetimes, particularly for the more luminous stars, leading to a\nsteeper luminosity function and predicting hotter final positions for the SN\nprogenitors. None of the considered mass-loss prescriptions is fully consistent\nwith all observational constraints, highlighting ongoing uncertainties in\nderiving and modeling RSGs mass loss. The mass-loss rates suggested by Kee et\nal. predict rapid envelope stripping, inconsistent with the observed population\nof luminous RSGs and SN progenitor detections, while the models implementing\nthe commonly used de Jager et al. and the recent Beasor et al. prescriptions\noverestimate the number of luminous RSGs. While the increased mass-loss rates\nfor luminous RSGs predicted by Yang et al. lead to better agreement with the\nobserved RSG luminosity function, naturally reproducing the updated\nHumphreys-Davidson limit, they also produce luminous yellow supergiant\nprogenitors not detected in nearby supernovae.

The\ngravitational field of these structures inherits the dark matter field's\ncoherent oscillations, leaving an imprint on gravitational (and\nelectromagnetic) waves sourced close to (or in) such overdensities.

We numerically demonstrate that these\nmodifications lead to a significant improvement in the fidelity of the magic\nstate. For instance, subjected to a uniform circuit-level noise of $10^{-3}$\n(excluding idling noise), our code switching protocol yields a magic state\nencoded in the distance-$3$ 2D color code with a logical infidelity of\n$4.6\\times 10^{-5}\\pm 1.6 \\times 10^{-5}$ (quantified by an error-corrected\nlogical state tomography) with an $84\\%$ of acceptance rate.

The retrieved abundances of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ and\nnon-detection of NH$_3$ and CO in K2-18 b are consistent with prior predictions\nof photochemical models for a Hycean world with a habitable ocean. However,\nrecent photochemical modeling raised the prospect that the observed abundances\nmay be explained by a mini-Neptune scenario instead. In this study, we explore\nthese scenarios using independent photochemical modeling with K2-18 b as a case\nstudy. We find the previous results to be sensitive to a range of model\nassumptions, such as the photochemical cross sections, incident stellar\nspectrum, surface pressure, UV albedo, and metallicity, significantly affecting\nthe resulting abundances. We explore a wide model space to investigate\nscenarios that are compatible with the retrieved molecular abundances for K2-18\nb. Our analysis shows that the previously favoured mini-Neptune scenario is not\ncompatible with most of the retrieved abundances, while the Hycean scenarios,\nboth inhabited and uninhabited, provide better agreement. An uninhabited Hycean\nscenario explains most of the abundance constraints, except CH$_4$ which is\ngenerally underabundant but dependent on the model assumptions. The inhabited\nHycean scenario is compatible with all the abundances if the observed CH$_4$ is\nassumed to be predominantly biogenic. Our results underscore the importance of\nsystematic photochemical modeling and accurate interpretation of chemical\nabundance constraints for candidate Hycean worlds.",

In this work, we use new\nsimulations to study the turbulent motions created by different types of AGN\nfeedback in a cool core cluster and predict the observable signatures with the\nlatest X-ray telescopes (e.g. XRISM). We run several hydrodynamic simulations\nwith ENZO, simulating the self-regulated cycles of AGN feedback, starting from\na static ICM in a cluster that represents the Perseus cluster. We study in\ndetail different feedback modes: from pure kinetic precessing jets up to almost\npure thermal feedback. Our analysis reveals that the gas velocity dispersion in\nthe center of the cluster correlates in time with the peaks of the AGN activity\nand that more than 50% of the time, different feedback modalities produce the\nvelocity dispersion observed in the Perseus cluster while leading to distinct\ngeometrical distributions and velocity dispersion profiles. Moreover, we do not\nfind a significant kinematic coupling between the hot and the cold phase\nkinematics. We find a correlation between the AGN activity and the steepening\nof the velocity function structure (VSF) and that the projected 2D VSF slopes\nare never trivially correlated with the 3D VSF ones.

In this paper we\npresent a new scheme for modelling anisotropic thermal conduction which we have\nimplemented in the moving mesh code AREPO. Our implementation uses a\nsemi-implicit time integration scheme which works accurately and efficiently\nwith individual timestepping, making the scheme highly suitable for use in\ncosmological simulations. We apply the scheme to a number of test-problems\nincluding the diffusion of a hot patch of gas in a circular magnetic field, the\nprogression of a point explosion in the presence of thermal conduction, and the\nevolution and saturation of buoyancy instabilities in anisotropically\nconducting plasmas. We use these idealised tests to demonstrate the accuracy\nand stability of the solver and highlight the ways in which anisotropic\nconduction can fundamentally change the behaviour of the system. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the solver's capability when applied to highly non-linear problems\nwith deep timestep hierarchies by performing high-resolution cosmological\nzoom-in simulations of a galaxy cluster with conduction. We show that\nanisotropic thermal conduction can have a significant impact on the temperature\ndistribution of the ICM and that whistler suppression may be relevant on\ncluster scales. The new scheme is, therefore, well suited for future work which\nwill explore the role of anisotropic thermal conduction in a range of\nastrophysical contexts including the ICM of clusters and the circumgalactic\nmedium of galaxies.",

We reveal how\nmonitored dynamics are situated within the framework of general\nfar-from-equilibrium, quantum condensed-matter physics. Measurement-induced\nheating effects scramble the distribution function in generic (interacting)\nmonitored fermion systems, which enables a simplified symmetry-based\ndescription of the dynamics. We demonstrate the equivalence of the Keldysh\ntechnique with the conventional Statistical-Mechanics Model for circuits,\nresulting from a doubled Hilbert-space (Choi-Jamio{\\l}kowski) mapping. We\nillustrate this using the monitored dynamics of interacting fermions with a\nconserved charge, deriving a unified effective field theory that captures all\nphases and phase transitions. The non-interacting counterpart in 1D space only\nhas an area-law phase, with no MIPT. This was explained via an effective\nnon-linear sigma model replica field theory possessing a very large symmetry.\nWe show that other phases and phase transitions emerge when the replica\nsymmetry is reduced by interactions. The reduced symmetry combines a replica\npermutation symmetry and charge-conservation within each replica. The former\nand its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT, which can be recognized via a\nseparatrix in the renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge\nconservation dictates the ``charge-sharpening\" transition between two kinds of\ndynamics, where the global charge information is either hidden or\nreconstructible from the measurements. The field theory explains why the\ncharge-sharpening transition should occur only in the volume-law phase.

    "abstract": "Drawing on insights from the Swampland program, we initiate a classification\nof infinite distance limits in the conformal manifolds of 4d SCFTs. Each limit\nis characterized by a Hagedorn-like behavior of the large $N$ density of\nstates, which we argue holographically correspond to different tensionless\nstring limits. We focus on 4d large $N$ SCFTs with simple gauge groups, which\nexhibit an overall free limit at infinite distance within the conformal\nmanifold. In this class of theories, only three types of weak-coupling limits\narise. They are distinguished by the exponential rate $\\alpha$ of the anomalous\ndimension of the higher-spin tower, which we find to be determined by the ratio\nof the central charges $a/c$. We compute the large $N$ partition function at\nthe free point for all these SCFTs, and derive a universal expression for the\nHagedorn temperature as a function of $\\alpha$ (or, equivalently, of $a/c$),\nregardless of the gauge group or matter content. This Hagedorn-like density of\nstates suggests that these weak-coupling limits correspond holographically to\nthe tensionless limits of three different strings: the critical Type IIB string\nand two non-critical strings that arise exclusively in non-Einstein\ngravitational theories. Our findings are consistent with the Emergent String\nConjecture when applied to theories with Einstein gravity at low energies. We\nalso use our results to present a new argument for the absence of scale\nseparation in the holographic AdS bulk dual of these 4d SCFTs. This argument is\nbased on the existence of a bona fide 't Hooft limit, or equivalently, on\nsatisfying the sharpened lower bound for the Distance Conjecture.",

The IMF's dependency on the physical\nconditions of the gas and its connection to the galaxy-wide IMF connects the\nmolecular clumps to the cosmological scale. The extraction of the IMF from\nobservational data requires a thorough understanding of stellar evolution, the\ntime-dependent stellar multiplicity, the stellar-dynamical evolution of dense\nstellar populations, and the structures, star formation histories, and chemical\nenrichment histories of galaxies. The IMF in galaxies, referred to as the\ngalaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF), and the IMF in individual star-forming regions (the\nstellar IMF) need not be the same, although the former must be related to the\nlatter. Observational surveys inform on whether star-forming regions provide\nevidence for the stellar IMF being a probability density distribution function.\nThey may also indicate star formation to optimally follow an IMF shaped by the\nphysical conditions of the star-forming gas. Both theoretical and observational\nevidence suggest a relationship between the initial mass function of brown\ndwarfs and that of stars. Late-type stars may arise from feedback-regulated\nfragmentation of molecular cloud filaments, which build up embedded clusters.\nIn contrast, early-type stars form under more violent accretion and\nfeedback-regulated conditions near the centers of these clusters. The\nintegration over all star-forming molecular cloud clumps and their stellar IMFs\nin a galaxy via the IGIMF theory yields its gwIMF which sensitively depends on\nthe physical properties of the molecular cloud clumps and the range of their\nmasses that depends on the SFR of the galaxy.",

We develop, validate and apply\na novel and efficient method, combining existing approaches to describe small-\nand large-angle scattering regimes within a hybrid scheme. Below a critical\nangle the effective description via a drag force combined with transverse\nmomentum diffusion is used, while above the angle dependence is sampled\nexplicitly. First, we verify the scheme using a test set-up with known\nanalytical solutions, and check that our results are insensitive to the choice\nof the critical angle within an expected range. Next, we demonstrate that our\nscheme speeds up the computations by multiple orders of magnitude for realistic\nlight mediator models.

Through comprehensive and controlled analyses\nunder realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is\ninevitable, common, and harmful.

Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior\nperformance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG\napproaches.

To this\nend, we introduce Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), an initialization scheme\nthat uses the directions capturing the most activation variance, provably\nmaximizing the expected gradient signal and accelerating fine-tuning. EVA\nperforms incremental SVD on minibatches of activation vectors and selects the\nright-singular vectors for initialization once they converged. Further, by\nselecting the directions that capture the most activation-variance for a given\nrank budget, EVA accommodates adaptive ranks that reduce the number of\ntrainable parameters, while maintaining or improving downstream performance. We\napply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks as language generation and\nunderstanding, image classification, and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits\nfaster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score\nacross a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable\nparameters through rank redistribution.",

    "abstract": "Syllables are compositional units of spoken language that efficiently\nstructure human speech perception and production. However, current neural\nspeech representations lack such structure, resulting in dense token sequences\nthat are costly to process. To bridge this gap, we propose a new model, Sylber,\nthat produces speech representations with clean and robust syllabic structure.\nSpecifically, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that\nbootstraps syllabic embeddings by distilling from its own initial unsupervised\nsyllabic segmentation. This results in a highly structured representation of\nspeech features, offering three key benefits: 1) a fast, linear-time syllable\nsegmentation algorithm, 2) efficient syllabic tokenization with an average of\n4.27 tokens per second, and 3) novel phonological units suited for efficient\nspoken language modeling. Our proposed segmentation method is highly robust and\ngeneralizes to out-of-domain data and unseen languages without any tuning. By\ntraining token-to-speech generative models, fully intelligible speech can be\nreconstructed from Sylber tokens with a significantly lower bitrate than\nbaseline SSL tokens. This suggests that our model effectively compresses speech\ninto a compact sequence of tokens with minimal information loss. Lastly, we\ndemonstrate that categorical perception-a linguistic phenomenon in speech\nperception-emerges naturally in Sylber, making the embedding space more\ncategorical and sparse than previous speech features and thus supporting the\nhigh efficiency of our tokenization. Together, we present a novel SSL approach\nfor representing speech as syllables, with significant potential for efficient\nspeech tokenization and spoken language modeling.",

Nevertheless, existing methods primarily focus on SMPL-based motion\ngeneration, which is limited by the scarcity of realistic large-scale\ninteraction data. This constraint affects their ability to create everyday HOI\nscenes. This paper addresses this challenge using a zero-shot approach with a\npre-trained diffusion model. Despite this potential, achieving our goals is\ndifficult due to the diffusion model's lack of understanding of ''where'' and\n''how'' objects interact with the human body. To tackle these issues, we\nintroduce AvatarGO, a novel framework designed to generate animatable 4D HOI\nscenes directly from textual inputs. Specifically, 1) for the ''where''\nchallenge, we propose LLM-guided contact retargeting, which employs Lang-SAM to\nidentify the contact body part from text prompts, ensuring precise\nrepresentation of human-object spatial relations. 2) For the ''how'' challenge,\nwe introduce correspondence-aware motion optimization that constructs motion\nfields for both human and object models using the linear blend skinning\nfunction from SMPL-X. Our framework not only generates coherent compositional\nmotions, but also exhibits greater robustness in handling penetration issues.\nExtensive experiments with existing methods validate AvatarGO's superior\ngeneration and animation capabilities on a variety of human-object pairs and\ndiverse poses.

    "abstract": "This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning,\naiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful\ncontent) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for\nunlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient\nascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse\nthe learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e.,\ndeviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and\npotential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been\nproposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art\nLLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another\ncritical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference\nmodel (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success,\nwhich can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven\nallocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty\nlevels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of\nunlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet\neffective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that\n`simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of\nsimple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights\ninto SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov\nchains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks\nlike TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks.

    "abstract": "Mental-health therapy involves a complex conversation flow in which patients\nand therapists continuously negotiate what should be talked about next. For\nexample, therapists might try to shift the conversation's direction to keep the\ntherapeutic process on track and avoid stagnation, or patients might push the\ndiscussion towards issues they want to focus on.\n  How do such patient and therapist redirections relate to the development and\nquality of their relationship? To answer this question, we introduce a\nprobabilistic measure of the extent to which a certain utterance immediately\nredirects the flow of the conversation, accounting for both the intention and\nthe actual realization of such a change. We apply this new measure to\ncharacterize the development of patient-therapist relationships over multiple\nsessions in a very large, widely-used online therapy platform. Our analysis\nreveals that (1) patient control of the conversation's direction generally\nincreases relative to that of the therapist as their relationship progresses;\nand (2) patients who have less control in the first few sessions are\nsignificantly more likely to eventually express dissatisfaction with their\ntherapist and terminate the relationship.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in recurrent architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have\nshowcased strong language capabilities. Unlike transformer-based models, these\narchitectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state,\nleading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause\ninformation interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in\nperformance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length.\nTo prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to \"forget\" earlier\ntokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to\neffectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We\ndemonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short\nfor the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn\nhow to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the\nmodel to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum\ncontext length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially\nwith the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond\nthe point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical\nlimitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for\nimproving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must\naccount for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting\nmechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks.",

However, scalable\nfabrication of such nanostructured scintillators has been a significant\nchallenge, impeding their widespread adoption.

This promotional benefit may motivate tricks,\nsuch as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even\nthough several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle\nstyle to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a \"null model\" that\nalways outputs a constant response (irrelevant to input instructions) can cheat\nautomatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an 86.5% LC win rate on\nAlpacaEval 2.0; an 83.0 score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a 9.55 score on MT-Bench.\nMoreover, the crafted cheating outputs are transferable because we assume that\nthe instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., 805 samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are\nprivate and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily\nproof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible\ncheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional\nimpact.

To explore the feasibility of training a\ntext-to-image generation model comparable to advanced models using publicly\navailable resources, we introduce EvolveDirector. This framework interacts with\nadvanced models through their public APIs to obtain text-image data pairs to\ntrain a base model. Our experiments with extensive data indicate that the model\ntrained on generated data of the advanced model can approximate its generation\ncapability. However, it requires large-scale samples of 10 million or more.\nThis incurs significant expenses in time, computational resources, and\nespecially the costs associated with calling fee-based APIs. To address this\nproblem, we leverage pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) to guide\nthe evolution of the base model. VLM continuously evaluates the base model\nduring training and dynamically updates and refines the training dataset by the\ndiscrimination, expansion, deletion, and mutation operations. Experimental\nresults show that this paradigm significantly reduces the required data volume.\nFurthermore, when approaching multiple advanced models, EvolveDirector can\nselect the best samples generated by them to learn powerful and balanced\nabilities.

Therefore, by\nconstruction they cannot capture complexity of the output of stochastic\nprocesses - like those in the real world. Motivated by this observation, we\ncombine probabilistic Turing machines with a prior over the inputs to the\nTuring machine to define a complete stochastic process of Turing machines. We\ncall this a stochastic process Turing machine. We use stochastic process Turing\nmachines to define a set of new generative complexity measures based on Turing\nmachines, which we call stochastic depth.

    "abstract": "As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and\nwill more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them\nbecomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing\ninspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute\nto this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a\ncontext characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically\nstudying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in\nsimulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve\na specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison).\nLeveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine\nconversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of\nnoteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in\ncarrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are\nat play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful\ninteractions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve\nimpacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with\nrespect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents'\npersonas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood\nof successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social\nbehaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific\npersonalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles.\nThese results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents\nas well as the debate on their societal impact.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of\npreviously learned knowledge when learning new classes. Various methods have\nbeen proposed to mitigate this issue. However, rehearsal-based learning, which\nretains samples from previous classes, typically achieves good performance but\ntends to memorize specific instances, struggling with Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization. This often leads to high forgetting rates and poor\ngeneralization. Surprisingly, the OOD generalization capabilities of these\nmethods have been largely unexplored. In this paper, we highlight this issue\nand propose a simple yet effective strategy inspired by contrastive learning\nand data-centric principles to address it. We introduce Adaptive Contrastive\nReplay (ACR), a method that employs dual optimization to simultaneously train\nboth the encoder and the classifier. ACR adaptively populates the replay buffer\nwith misclassified samples while ensuring a balanced representation of classes\nand tasks. By refining the decision boundary in this way, ACR achieves a\nbalance between stability and plasticity. Our method significantly outperforms\nprevious approaches in terms of OOD generalization, achieving an improvement of\n13.41\\% on Split CIFAR-100, 9.91\\% on Split Mini-ImageNet, and 5.98\\% on Split\nTiny-ImageNet.",

Biological adaptation mechanisms are dissipative, i.e. they\nrequire a supply of energy such as the coupling to the hydrolysis of ATP. Via\nevolution the underlying biochemical machinery of living organisms evolved into\nhighly optimized states. However, in the case of adaptation processes two\nquantities are optimized simultaneously, the adaptation speed or accuracy and\nthe thermodynamic cost. In such cases one typically faces a trade-off, where\nimproving one quantity implies worsening the other. The solution is no longer\nunique but rather a Pareto set -- the set of all physically attainable\nprotocols along which no quantity can be improved without worsening another.\nHere we investigate Pareto fronts in adaptation-dissipation trade-offs for a\ncellular thermostat and a minimal ATP-driven receptor-ligand reaction network.\nWe find convex sections of Pareto fronts to be interrupted by concave regions,\nimplying the coexistence of distinct optimization mechanisms. We discuss the\nimplications of such ``compromise-optimal'' solutions and argue that they may\nendow biological systems with a superior flexibility to evolve, resist, and\nadapt to different environments.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have greatly improved visual generation but are hindered by\nslow generation speed due to the computationally intensive nature of solving\ngenerative ODEs. Rectified flow, a widely recognized solution, improves\ngeneration speed by straightening the ODE path. Its key components include: 1)\nusing the diffusion form of flow-matching, 2) employing $\\boldsymbol\nv$-prediction, and 3) performing rectification (a.k.a. reflow). In this paper,\nwe argue that the success of rectification primarily lies in using a pretrained\ndiffusion model to obtain matched pairs of noise and samples, followed by\nretraining with these matched noise-sample pairs. Based on this, components 1)\nand 2) are unnecessary. Furthermore, we highlight that straightness is not an\nessential training target for rectification; rather, it is a specific case of\nflow-matching models. The more critical training target is to achieve a\nfirst-order approximate ODE path, which is inherently curved for models like\nDDPM and Sub-VP. Building on this insight, we propose Rectified Diffusion,\nwhich generalizes the design space and application scope of rectification to\nencompass the broader category of diffusion models, rather than being\nrestricted to flow-matching models. We validate our method on Stable Diffusion\nv1-5 and Stable Diffusion XL. Our method not only greatly simplifies the\ntraining procedure of rectified flow-based previous works (e.g., InstaFlow) but\nalso achieves superior performance with even lower training cost.

LLMs often struggle to filter out irrelevant documents\nwithin the context, and their performance is sensitive to the absolute position\nof supporting documents within that context. In this paper, we identify an\nadditional challenge: LLMs' performance is also sensitive to the order,\nrelative position, in which the supporting documents are presented. We refer to\nthis as the misordered context problem. To address this issue, based on the\ntheoretical approach, we propose a simple yet effective method called context\nrepetition (CoRe), which involves prompting the model by repeatedly presenting\nthe context. This ensures that certain contiguous reasoning segments within\nsupporting documents are presented in the optimal order, effectively guiding\nthe model's reasoning in the appropriate direction. Applying CoRe, we improve\nthe F1 score by up to 30%p on multi-hop QA tasks and increase accuracy by up to\n70%p on a synthetic task.

In doing so, we obtain a strong regularity type lemma for\nincomparability graphs with no large blowups of a clique, which is of\nindependent interest.\n  We also prove that any $r$-comparability graph with positive\n$K_{(2h-2)^{r}+1}$-density contains a blowup of $K_h$ of size $\\Omega(n)$,\nwhere the constant $(2h-2)^{r}+1$ is optimal. The $\\frac{n}{\\log n}$ size of\nthe blowups in all our results are optimal up to a constant factor.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the dynamics of the susceptible-infected-recovered\n(SIR) model on a network with community structure, namely the stochastic block\nmodel (SBM). As usual, the SIR model is a stochastic model for an epidemic\nwhere infected vertices infect susceptible neighbors at some rate $\\eta$ and\nrecover at rate $\\gamma$, and the SBM is a random graph model where vertices\nare partitioned into a finite number of communities. The connection probability\nbetween two vertices depends on their community affiliation, here scaled so\nthat the average degrees have a finite limit as the network grows. We prove\nlaws of large numbers (LLN) for the epidemic's trajectory to a system of\nordinary differential equations over any time horizon (finite or infinite),\nincluding in particular a LLN for the final size of the infection.\n  Our proofs rely on two main ingredients: (i) a new coupling of the SIR\nepidemic and the randomness of the SBM, revealing a vector-valued random\nvariable that drives the epidemic (related to what is usually called the\n``force of the infection'' via a linear transformation), and (ii) a novel\ntechnique for analyzing the limiting behavior of the infinite time horizon for\nthe infection, using the fact that once the infection passes the herd immunity\nthreshold it dies out quickly and has a negligible impact on the overall size\nof the infection.",

Different classification systems have existed since\nthe 19th century but the term is used nowadays mostly to refer to the\nMorgan-Keenan (MK) system, which was established in the 1940s and has been\ndeveloped since then.

To address this issue, we propose an approach to\nautomatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We\nevaluate our approach on four SE datasets and measure performance improvement\nfrom training NLUs on queries labeled by the generated LFs.

Additionally,\nthese frameworks lack interpretability and user engagement during the training\nprocess, primarily due to the absence of human-centered design. It leads to a\nlack of transparency in final decision-making and limited user control,\npotentially reducing trust and adoption of AutoML methods. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce UniAutoML, a human-centered AutoML framework that\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to unify AutoML for both discriminative\n(e.g., Transformers and CNNs for classification or regression tasks) and\ngenerative tasks (e.g., fine-tuning diffusion models or LLMs).

This design enhances transparency and user control throughout\nthe AutoML training process, allowing users to seamlessly break down or modify\nthe model being trained. To mitigate potential risks associated with LLM\ngenerated content, UniAutoML incorporates a safety guardline that filters\ninputs and censors outputs. We evaluated UniAutoML's performance and usability\nthrough experiments on eight diverse datasets and user studies involving 25\nparticipants, demonstrating that UniAutoML not only enhances performance but\nalso improves user control and trust.

We\npresent time-variable, frequency-dependent profiles of pulsating AGB stars'\natmospheres, illustrating observable features in resolved and unresolved\nobservations, including disc brightness temperature, photosphere radius, and\nresolved and unresolved spectral indices. Notably, temporal variations in disc\nbrightness temperature closely mirror the temperature variability of the\nstellar atmosphere.

Furthermore, our models indicate that enhanced gas temperatures after\nthe passage of a strong shock might be observable in the high-frequency ALMA\nbands as a decrease in the brightness temperature with increasing frequency.

It addresses key limitations by\ngenerating motion-informative text embeddings, significantly enhancing the\nrelevance and semantics of generated motion sequences. With LaMP, we advance\nthree key tasks: text-to-motion generation, motion-text retrieval, and motion\ncaptioning through aligned language-motion representation learning. For\ngeneration, we utilize LaMP to provide the text condition instead of CLIP, and\nan autoregressive masked prediction is designed to achieve mask modeling\nwithout rank collapse in transformers. For retrieval, motion features from\nLaMP's motion transformer interact with query tokens to retrieve text features\nfrom the text transformer, and vice versa. For captioning, we finetune a large\nlanguage model with the language-informative motion features to develop a\nstrong motion captioning model.

We introduce a high-dimensional generalization\nof 3-dimensional vanishing cycles for symplectic foliations, which we call\nLagrangian vanishing cycles, and prove that they prevent a symplectic foliation\nfrom being strong, just as vanishing cycles prevent tautness in dimension 3 due\nto the classical result of Novikov from 1964.

In codimension 1, this is achieved by a rather explicit\nmodification of the symplectic foliation, which allows us to open up closed\nleaves having non-trivial holonomy on both sides, and is thus of independent\ninterest.

The\n$d$-dimensional hypercube, $\\{0,1\\}^d$, with the nearest neighbor structure,\nhas been a particularly appealing choice for the base graph, owing in part to\nits many symmetries. Results go back to the work of Korshunov and Sapozhenko\nwho proved sharp results on the count of such sets as well as structure\ntheorems for random samples drawn uniformly. Of much interest is the behavior\nof such Gibbs measures in the presence of disorder. In this direction,\nKronenberg and Spinka [KS] initiated the study of independent sets in a random\nsubgraph of the hypercube obtained by considering an instance of bond\npercolation with probability $p$. Relying on tools from statistical mechanics\nthey obtained a detailed understanding of the moments of the partition\nfunction, say $\\mathcal{Z}$, of the hard-core model on such random graphs and\nconsequently deduced certain fluctuation information, as well as posed a series\nof interesting questions. In particular, they showed in the uniform case that\nthere is a natural phase transition at $p=2/3$ where $\\mathcal{Z}$ transitions\nfrom being concentrated for $p>2/3$ to not concentrated at $p=2/3$.\n  In this article, developing a probabilistic framework, as well as relying on\ncertain cluster expansion inputs from [KS], we present a detailed picture of\nboth the fluctuations of $\\mathcal{Z}$ as well as the geometry of a randomly\nsampled independent set.

    "abstract": "Scientific discovery plays a pivotal role in advancing human society, and\nrecent progress in large language models (LLMs) suggests their potential to\naccelerate this process. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can\nautonomously generate novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether LLMs can discover high-quality chemistry hypotheses given\nonly a research background-comprising a question and/or a survey-without\nrestriction on the domain of the question. We begin with the observation that\nhypothesis discovery is a seemingly intractable task. To address this, we\npropose a formal mathematical decomposition grounded in a fundamental\nassumption: that most chemistry hypotheses can be composed from a research\nbackground and a set of inspirations. This decomposition leads to three\npractical subtasks-retrieving inspirations, composing hypotheses with\ninspirations, and ranking hypotheses - which together constitute a sufficient\nset of subtasks for the overall scientific discovery task. We further develop\nan agentic LLM framework, MOOSE-Chem, that is a direct implementation of this\nmathematical decomposition. To evaluate this framework, we construct a\nbenchmark of 51 high-impact chemistry papers published and online after January\n2024, each manually annotated by PhD chemists with background, inspirations,\nand hypothesis. The framework is able to rediscover many hypotheses with high\nsimilarity to the groundtruth, successfully capturing the core\ninnovations-while ensuring no data contamination since it uses an LLM with\nknowledge cutoff date prior to 2024. Finally, based on LLM's surprisingly high\naccuracy on inspiration retrieval, a task with inherently out-of-distribution\nnature, we propose a bold assumption: that LLMs may already encode latent\nscientific knowledge associations not yet recognized by humans.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning is making a profound impact in the physical layer of wireless\ncommunications. Despite exhibiting outstanding empirical performance in tasks\nsuch as MIMO receive processing, the reasons behind the demonstrated superior\nperformance improvement remain largely unclear. In this work, we advance the\nfield of Explainable AI (xAI) in the physical layer of wireless communications\nutilizing signal processing principles. Specifically, we focus on the task of\nMIMO-OFDM receive processing (e.g., symbol detection) using reservoir computing\n(RC), a framework within recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which outperforms\nboth conventional and other learning-based MIMO detectors. Our analysis\nprovides a signal processing-based, first-principles understanding of the\ncorresponding operation of the RC. Building on this fundamental understanding,\nwe are able to systematically incorporate the domain knowledge of wireless\nsystems (e.g., channel statistics) into the design of the underlying RNN by\ndirectly configuring the untrained RNN weights for MIMO-OFDM symbol detection.\nThe introduced RNN weight configuration has been validated through extensive\nsimulations demonstrating significant performance improvements. This\nestablishes a foundation for explainable RC-based architectures in MIMO-OFDM\nreceive processing and provides a roadmap for incorporating domain knowledge\ninto the design of neural networks for NextG systems.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a model to learn a new task by\nobserving a few exemplars in its context. While prevalent in NLP, this\ncapability has recently also been observed in Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nsettings. Prior in-context RL methods, however, require entire episodes in the\nagent's context. Given that complex environments typically lead to long\nepisodes with sparse rewards, these methods are constrained to simple\nenvironments with short episodes. To address these challenges, we introduce\nRetrieval-Augmented Decision Transformer (RA-DT). RA-DT employs an external\nmemory mechanism to store past experiences from which it retrieves only\nsub-trajectories relevant for the current situation. The retrieval component in\nRA-DT does not require training and can be entirely domain-agnostic. We\nevaluate the capabilities of RA-DT on grid-world environments, robotics\nsimulations, and procedurally-generated video games. On grid-worlds, RA-DT\noutperforms baselines, while using only a fraction of their context length.\nFurthermore, we illuminate the limitations of current in-context RL methods on\ncomplex environments and discuss future directions. To facilitate future\nresearch, we release datasets for four of the considered environments.",

In this paper, we give the\nfollowing three strongly explicit constructions of unique-neighbor expanders\nwith better unique-neighbor expansion for polynomial-sized sets, while\nsufficient expansion for linear-sized sets is also preserved:\n  (1) Two-sided $(n^{1/3-\\epsilon},1-\\epsilon)$ lossless expanders for\narbitrary $\\epsilon>0$ and aspect ratio.\n  (2) Left-$(\\Omega(n),1-\\epsilon)$ lossless expanders with\nright-$(n^{1/3-\\epsilon},\\delta)$ expansion for some $\\delta>0$.\n  (3) Two-sided-$(\\Omega(n),\\delta)$ unique-neighbor expanders with\ntwo-sided-$(n^{\\Omega(1)},1/2-\\epsilon)$ expansion.\n  The second construction exhibits the first explicit family of one-sided\nlossless expanders with unique-neighbor expansion for polynomial-sized sets\nfrom the other side and constant aspect ratio. The third construction gives\ntwo-sided unique-neighbor expanders with additional $(1/2-\\epsilon)$\nunique-neighbor expansion for two-sided polynomial-sized sets, which approaches\nthe $1/2$ requirement in Lin and Hsieh (arXiv:2203.03581).\n  Our techniques involve tripartite product recently introduced by Hsieh et al\n(STOC 2024), combined with a generalized existence argument of biregular graph\nwith optimal two-sided unique-neighbor expansion for almost all degrees. We\nalso use a new reduction from large girth/bicycle-freeness to vertex expansion,\nwhich might be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Earth and other rocky bodies in the inner Solar System are significantly\ndepleted in carbon compared to the Sun and interstellar medium (ISM) dust.\nObservations indicate that over half of carbon in the ISM and comets is in\nrefractory forms, like amorphous hydrocarbons and complex organics, which can\nbe building blocks of rocky bodies. While amorphous hydrocarbons are destroyed\nby photolysis and oxidation, radial transport of solid particles can limit\ncarbon depletion, except when complex organics, which are less refractory, are\nthe main carbon source. We aim to identify conditions for severe carbon\ndepletion in the inner Solar System by introducing more realistic factors:\ndifferences in stickiness between icy and silicate particles, and\nhigh-temperature regions in the disk's upper optically-thin layer, which were\nnot considered in previous studies. We perform a 3D Monte Carlo simulation of\nradial drift and turbulent diffusion in a steady accretion disk, incorporating\nice evaporation/re-condensation, photolysis/oxidation of hydrocarbons in the\nupper layer, and pyrolysis of complex organics. Our results show that the\ncarbon fraction drops by two orders of magnitude inside the snow line under two\nconditions: i) silicate particles are much less sticky than icy particles,\nleading to a rapid decline in icy pebble flux while silicates accumulate inside\nthe snow line, and ii) high-temperature regions in the disk's upper layer stir\nsilicate particles into UV-exposed areas. These conditions reproduce carbon\ndepletion patterns consistent with observations and allow for diverse carbon\nfractions in rocky bodies. This diversity may explain the wide variation of\nmetals in white dwarf photospheres and suggest different surface environments\nfor rocky planets in habitable zones.",

    "abstract": "Recently, differentiable mask pruning methods optimize the continuous\nrelaxation architecture (soft network) as the proxy of the pruned discrete\nnetwork (hard network) for superior sub-architecture search. However, due to\nthe agnostic impact of the discretization process, the hard network struggles\nwith the equivalent representational capacity as the soft network, namely\ndiscretization gap, which severely spoils the pruning performance. In this\npaper, we first investigate the discretization gap and propose a novel\nstructural differentiable mask pruning framework named S2HPruner to bridge the\ndiscretization gap in a one-stage manner. In the training procedure, SH2Pruner\nforwards both the soft network and its corresponding hard network, then\ndistills the hard network under the supervision of the soft network. To\noptimize the mask and prevent performance degradation, we propose a decoupled\nbidirectional knowledge distillation. It blocks the weight updating from the\nhard to the soft network while maintaining the gradient corresponding to the\nmask. Compared with existing pruning arts, S2HPruner achieves surpassing\npruning performance without fine-tuning on comprehensive benchmarks, including\nCIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet with a variety of network architectures.\nBesides, investigation and analysis experiments explain the effectiveness of\nS2HPruner.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code-LLMs (CLLMs) have significantly\nimproved code generation, but, they frequently face difficulties when dealing\nwith challenging and complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\naddresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the\ninference time.

We present a novel framework that leverages a\nProgramming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code.\nThis approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most\nrelevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning\ntechnique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more\nhallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two\nretrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing\ncontext granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our\nmethod improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels by up to 34% on MBPP.

Photons are the clear\nchoice as quantum probes for remote sensing because they can travel to and\ninteract with a distant target. Existing schemes are mainly based on the\nquantum illumination framework, which requires a quantum memory to store a\nsingle photon of an initially entangled pair until its twin reflects off a\ntarget and returns for final correlation measurements. Existing demonstrations\nare limited to tabletop experiments, and expanding the sensing range faces\nvarious roadblocks, including long-time quantum storage and photon loss and\nnoise when transmitting quantum signals over long distances.

The combination of one key quantum phenomenon and two quantum\nresources, namely quantum induced coherence by path identity, quantum frequency\ncombs, and two-mode squeezed light, allows for quantum remote sensing without\nrequiring a quantum memory. The proposed scheme is akin to a quantum radar\nbased on entangled frequency comb pairs that uses path identity to\ndetect/range/sense a remote target of interest by measuring pulses of one comb\nin the pair that never flew to target, but that contains target information\n``teleported\" by quantum-induced coherence from the other comb in the pair that\ndid fly to target but is not detected.",

A refinement mapping specifies how each\nhigh-level action is implemented by a low-level ConGolog program and how each\nhigh-level fluent can be translated into a low-level formula. We define a\nnotion of sound abstraction between such action theories in terms of the\nexistence of a suitable bisimulation between their respective models. Sound\nabstractions have many useful properties that ensure that we can reason about\nthe agent's actions (e.g., executability, projection, and planning) at the\nabstract level, and refine and concretely execute them at the low level. We\nalso characterize the notion of complete abstraction where all actions\n(including exogenous ones) that the high level thinks can happen can in fact\noccur at the low level. To facilitate verifying that one has a sound/complete\nabstraction relative to a mapping, we provide a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions. Finally, we identify a set of basic action theory constraints that\nensure that for any low-level action sequence, there is a unique high-level\naction sequence that it refines. This allows us to track/monitor what the\nlow-level agent is doing and describe it in abstract terms (i.e., provide\nhigh-level explanations, for instance, to a client or manager).",

In these objects, the evaporation process halts, at the latest, once\napproximately half of the initial mass has been radiated away. As a result,\nlight primordial black holes (PBHs) with mass $m_{\\rm PBH} \\lesssim\n10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{g}$, which are traditionally assumed to have fully evaporated\nby the present time, may instead survive and constitute viable dark matter\ncandidates. Ongoing mergers of such PBHs would give rise to ``young'' black\nholes that resume their evaporation, emitting ultrahigh-energy particles\npotentially detectable by current experiments. The resulting emission spectrum\nwould be thermal across all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear\nand distinctive signature. We demonstrate that, if the memory burden effect\nactivates after PBHs have lost around half of their initial mass, current\nmeasurements of the neutrino flux at Earth place strong constraints on such\ndark matter candidates for $m_{\\rm PBH} \\lesssim 10^9\\,\\mathrm{g}$.

We introduce the ejection and dynamical\nparameters $\\xi$ and $\\beta$, which define if envelope ejection is\nenergetically or hydrodynamically favorable, respectively, during CE inspiral.\nWhen combined, these parameters offer a detailed narrative of how inspiral\nbegins, proceeds, and ends that is consistent with preliminary comparisons to\n3D hydrodynamical models. This physically-motivated framework impacts\npredictions for CE outcomes, especially for systems that have energy excess,\nand offers promise as a potential alternative for the treatment of CE in binary\npopulation synthesis.",

We trained three\nversions of the DDPM model: the 1-channel DDPM (using only column density), the\n2-channel DDPM (incorporating both column density and polarization angles), and\nthe 3-channel DDPM (which combines column density, polarization angles, and LOS\nnonthermal velocity dispersion). We assessed the models on both synthetic test\nsamples and new simulation data that were outside the training set's\ndistribution. The 3-channel DDPM consistently outperformed both the other DDPM\nvariants and the power-law fitting approach based on column density alone,\ndemonstrating its robustness in handling previously unseen data. Additionally,\nwe compared the performance of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) methods,\nboth classical and modified, to the DDPM predictions.

The network consisted of two identical sub-units coupled by a\npair of bonds with a length difference corresponding to a phase difference of\n$\\pi$ for the waves traveling through the bonds. In such a symmetry each\neigenvalue appears as a two-fold degenerate Kramers doublet. Distorting the\nsymmetry the degeneracy is lifted which may be interpreted in terms of the\nZeeman splitting of a spin 1/2 in an external magnetic field. In the present\nwork, a microwave analog of a spin resonance is realized. To this end, two\nmagnetic fields have to be emulated, a static and a radio-frequency one. The\nstatic one is realized by detuning the length difference from the $\\pi$\ncondition by means of phase shifters, the radio-frequency field by modulating\nthe length difference of another pair of bonds by means of diodes with\nfrequencies up to 125 MHz.

In stage 1, agents submit their private\ninformation to the manager, who then formulates market trading rules based on\nthe submitted information. In stage 2, agents are free to engage in\ntransactions within these rules, ultimately reaching an equilibrium. We\ngeneralize the concept of liquid welfare from classical budget-feasible\nauctions and use market liquid welfare as a measure to evaluate the performance\nof the designed mechanism. Moreover, an extra concept called profitability is\nintroduced to assess whether the market is money-making (profitable) or\nmoney-losing (unprofitable). Our goal is to design a truthful mechanism that\nachieves an (approximate) optimal welfare while minimizing unprofitability as\nmuch as possible. Two mechanisms for the problem are proposed. The first one\nguarantees truthfulness and profitability while approaching an approximation\nratio of 1/2 in large markets. The second one is also truthful and achieves 1/2\napproximation in general markets but incurs bounded unprofitability. Our aim is\nfor both mechanisms to provide valuable insights into the truthful market\ndesign problem.",

Modern retrieval systems face two key challenges: scalability\nand efficiency. State-of-the-art image retrieval systems train specific neural\nnetworks for each dataset, an approach that lacks scalability. Furthermore,\nsince retrieval speed is directly proportional to embedding size, existing\nsystems that use large embeddings lack efficiency. To tackle scalability,\nrecent works propose using off-the-shelf foundation models. However, these\nmodels, though applicable across datasets, fall short in achieving performance\ncomparable to that of dataset-specific models. Our key observation is that,\nwhile foundation models capture necessary subtleties for effective retrieval,\nthe underlying distribution of their embedding space can negatively impact\ncosine similarity searches. We introduce Autoencoders with Strong Variance\nConstraints (AE-SVC), which, when used for projection, significantly improves\nthe performance of foundation models. We provide an in-depth theoretical\nanalysis of AE-SVC. Addressing efficiency, we introduce Single-shot Similarity\nSpace Distillation ((SS)$_2$D), a novel approach to learn embeddings with\nadaptive sizes that offers a better trade-off between size and performance. We\nconducted extensive experiments on four retrieval datasets, including Stanford\nOnline Products (SoP) and Pittsburgh30k, using four different off-the-shelf\nfoundation models, including DinoV2 and CLIP.

    "abstract": "We present unexpected findings from a large-scale benchmark study evaluating\nConditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) estimation algorithms, i.e., CATE\nmodels. By running 16 modern CATE models on 12 datasets and 43,200 sampled\nvariants generated through diverse observational sampling strategies, we find\nthat: (a) 62\\% of CATE estimates have a higher Mean Squared Error (MSE) than a\ntrivial zero-effect predictor, rendering them ineffective; (b) in datasets with\nat least one useful CATE estimate, 80\\% still have higher MSE than a\nconstant-effect model; and (c) Orthogonality-based models outperform other\nmodels only 30\\% of the time, despite widespread optimism about their\nperformance. These findings highlight significant challenges in current CATE\nmodels and underscore the need for broader evaluation and methodological\nimprovements.\n  Our findings stem from a novel application of \\textit{observational\nsampling}, originally developed to evaluate Average Treatment Effect (ATE)\nestimates from observational methods with experiment data. To adapt\nobservational sampling for CATE evaluation, we introduce a statistical\nparameter, $Q$, equal to MSE minus a constant and preserves the ranking of\nmodels by their MSE. We then derive a family of sample statistics, collectively\ncalled $\\hat{Q}$, that can be computed from real-world data. When used in\nobservational sampling, $\\hat{Q}$ is an unbiased estimator of $Q$ and\nasymptotically selects the model with the smallest MSE. To ensure the benchmark\nreflects real-world heterogeneity, we handpick datasets where outcomes come\nfrom field rather than simulation. By integrating observational sampling, new\nstatistics, and real-world datasets, the benchmark provides new insights into\nCATE model performance and reveals gaps in capturing real-world heterogeneity,\nemphasizing the need for more robust benchmarks.",

Both\ntextual and image-based (memes) submissions were considered. The image data was\nprocessed with OCR to extract text from images for NLP analysis. Multiple\nregression models were built to investigate what makes submissions humorous.\nAdditionally, a random sample of 800 submissions was labeled by human\nannotators regarding their relation to theories of humor, suitability for the\nworkplace, the need for programming knowledge to understand the submission, and\nwhether images in image-based submissions added context to the submission.\nResults: Our results indicate that predicting the humor of software developers\nis difficult.

In this work, we introduce\nan F-NARX implementation based on principal component analysis and polynomial\nregression.

Accurate modelling of the evolution of the magnetic field in\nlow-ionization molecular cloud cores requires the inclusion of non-ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) processes, specifically Ohmic and ambipolar\ndiffusion and the Hall effect. These have a profound influence on the\nefficiency of magnetic removal of angular momentum from protostellar disks and\nsimulations that include them can avoid the `magnetic-braking catastrophe' in\nwhich disks are not able to form. However, the impact of the Hall effect, in\nparticular, is complex and remains poorly studied. In this work, we perform a\nlarge suite of simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars with\nseveral non-ideal MHD chemistry models and initial core geometries using the\nmoving-mesh code {\\small AREPO}. We find that the efficiency of angular\nmomentum removal is significantly reduced with respect to ideal MHD, in line\nwith previous results. The Hall effect has a varied influence on the evolution\nof the disk which depends on the initial orientation of the magnetic field.\nThis extends to the outflows seen in a subset of the models, where this effect\ncan act to enhance or suppress them and open up new outflow channels. We\nconclude, in agreement with a subset of the previous literature, that the Hall\neffect is the dominant non-ideal MHD process in some collapse scenarios and\nthus should be included in simulations of protostellar disk formation.",

From\nthese, one needs to learn both a mapping to causally-relevant latent variables,\nsuch as a high-level representation of the El Ni\\~no phenomenon and other\nprocesses, as well as the causal model over them. The challenge is that this\ntask, called causal representation learning, is highly underdetermined from\nobservational data alone, requiring other constraints during learning to\nresolve the indeterminacies. In this work, we consider a temporal model with a\nsparsity assumption, namely single-parent decoding: each observed low-level\nvariable is only affected by a single latent variable. Such an assumption is\nreasonable in many scientific applications that require finding groups of\nlow-level variables, such as extracting regions from geographically gridded\nmeasurement data in climate research or capturing brain regions from neural\nactivity data.

Within\npatents, the description constitutes more than 90% of the document on average.\nYet, its automatic generation remains understudied. When drafting patent\napplications, patent attorneys typically receive invention reports (IRs), which\nare usually confidential, hindering research on LLM-supported patent drafting.\nOften, prepublication research papers serve as IRs. We leverage this duality to\nbuild PAP2PAT, an open and realistic benchmark for patent drafting consisting\nof 1.8k patent-paper pairs describing the same inventions. To address the\ncomplex longdocument patent generation task, we propose chunk-based\noutline-guided generation using the research paper as invention specification.\nOur extensive evaluation using PAP2PAT and a human case study show that LLMs\ncan effectively leverage information from the paper, but still struggle to\nprovide the necessary level of detail. Fine-tuning leads to more patent-style\nlanguage, but also to more hallucination. We release our data and code\nhttps://github.com/boschresearch/Pap2Pat.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial genomes in the Pinaceae family are notable for their large size\nand structural complexity. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the\nmitochondrial genome of Cathaya argyrophylla, an endangered and endemic\nPinaceae species, uncovering a genome size of 18.99 Mb, meaning the largest\nmitochondrial genome reported to date. To investigate the mechanisms behind\nthis exceptional size, we conducted comparative analyses with other Pinaceae\nspecies possessing both large and small mitochondrial genomes, as well as with\nother gymnosperms. We focused on repeat sequences, transposable element\nactivity, RNA editing events, chloroplast-derived sequence transfers (mtpts),\nand sequence homology with nuclear genomes. Our findings indicate that while\nCathaya argyrophylla and other extremely large Pinaceae mitochondrial genomes\ncontain substantial amounts of repeat sequences and show increased activity of\nLINEs and LTR retrotransposons, these factors alone do not fully account for\nthe genome expansion. Notably, we observed a significant incorporation of\nchloroplast-derived sequences in Cathaya argyrophylla and other large\nmitochondrial genomes, suggesting that extensive plastid-to-mitochondrial DNA\ntransfer may play a crucial role in genome enlargement. Additionally, large\nmitochondrial genomes exhibited distinct patterns of RNA editing and limited\nsimilarity with nuclear genomes compared to smaller genomes. These results\nsuggest that the massive mitochondrial genomes in Pinaceae are likely the\nresult of multiple contributing factors, including repeat sequences, transposon\nactivity, and extensive plastid sequence incorporation. Our study enhances the\nunderstanding of mitochondrial genome evolution in plants and provides valuable\ngenetic information for the conservation and study of Cathaya argyrophylla.",

A setting that\ndominates the machine learning literature consists of learning a map from an\neasy-to-sample prior, such as the Gaussian distribution, to a target measure.\nUnder this model, samples from the prior are pushed forward to generate a new\nsample on the target measure, which is often difficult to sample from directly.\nOf particular interest is the problem of generating a new sample that is\nproximate to or otherwise conditioned on a given input sample. In this paper,\nwe propose a new model called mirror bridges to solve this problem of\nconditional resampling. Our key observation is that solving the Schr\\\"odinger\nbridge problem between a distribution and itself provides a natural way to\nproduce new samples from conditional distributions, giving in-distribution\nvariations of an input data point.

    "abstract": "The first detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the G-type\neclipsing binary KM UMa is presented, which indicates that the system is a\nshort-period detached eclipsing binary. The radial velocity curves were\ncalculated using the cross-correlation function method based on Large Sky Area\nMulti-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and our\nobservations, which determined the mass ratio as $q=0.45\\ (\\pm0.04)$. Based on\nthe light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, other survey\ndata, and our multiband observations, the positive and negative O'Connell\neffects have been detected evolving gradually and alternately over the last 20\nyr, which can be explained by the presence of spots on the primary component. A\nsuperflare event was detected in the SuperWASP data on 2007 February 28,\nfurther indicating that KM UMa is a very active system. We calculated its\nenergy to be $5\\times10^{34}$ erg by assuming it occurred on the primary star.\nUtilizing hundreds of medium-resolution spectra and one low-resolution\nspectrum, the equivalent width variations of the $H_{\\alpha}$ line were\ncalculated, indicating the presence of a 5.21 ($\\pm0.67$) yr magnetic activity\ncycle. The orbital period variations were analyzed using the O-C method,\ndetecting a long-term decrease superimposed with a periodic variation. The\namplitude of the cyclic variation is $0.01124\\ (\\pm0.00004)$ day, with a period\nof $33.66\\ (\\pm 0.0012)$ yr, which exceeds the 5.21 yr activity cycle,\nsuggesting that this is more likely attributable to the light travel time\neffect of a third body. Simultaneously, a visual companion has been detected\nbased on the Gaia astrometric data, indicating that KM UMa is actually in a\n2+1+1 hierarchical quadruple system.",

Given that graph neural networks sometimes tend to struggle with global,\nstructural properties, we augment the popular graph transformer with\ncross-attentive modulation tokens in order to improve global control over the\npredicted topology.

Several impressive LLM-based\ntoolkits recently are developed and evaluated on this dataset. However, a\nsystematic evaluation of the quality of SWE-bench remains missing. In this\npaper, we addressed this gap by presenting an empirical analysis of the\nSWE-bench dataset. We conducted a manual screening of instances where SWEAgent\n+ GPT-4 successfully resolved issues by comparing the model-generated patches\nwith the actual pull requests.

We refer to as solution leakage problem. 2) 31.08% of the passed\npatches are suspicious patches due to weak test cases, i.e., the tests were not\nadequate to verify the correctness of a patch. When we filtered out these\nproblematic issues, the resolution rate of SWE-Agent+GPT-4 dropped from 12.47%\nto 3.97%. We also observed that the same data quality issues also exist in the\ntwo variants of SWE-bench, i.e., SWE-bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified.

Current methods differentiate members and non-members by designing\nscoring functions, like Perplexity and Min-k%. However, the diversity and\ncomplexity of training data magnifies the difficulty of distinguishing, leading\nto suboptimal performance in detecting pretraining data. In this paper, we\nfirst explore the benefits of unseen data, which can be easily collected after\nthe release of the LLM. We find that the perplexities of LLMs shift differently\nfor members and non-members, after fine-tuning with a small amount of\npreviously unseen data. In light of this, we introduce a novel and effective\nmethod termed Fine-tuned Score Deviation(FSD), which improves the performance\nof current scoring functions for pretraining data detection. In particular, we\npropose to measure the deviation distance of current scores after fine-tuning\non a small amount of unseen data within the same domain. In effect, using a few\nunseen data can largely decrease the scores of all non-members, leading to a\nlarger deviation distance than members.

However, it faces significant\nchallenges in real-world scenarios, which encompass adverse weather variations,\nmotion blur, as well as scenes with poor lighting conditions at night. Our\nresearch reveals that we can divide monocular depth estimation into three\nsub-problems: depth structure consistency, local texture disambiguation, and\nsemantic-structural correlation. Our approach tackles the non-robustness of\nexisting self-supervised monocular depth estimation models to interference\ntextures by adopting a structure-centered perspective and utilizing the scene\nstructure characteristics demonstrated by semantics and illumination. We devise\na novel approach to reduce over-reliance on local textures, enhancing\nrobustness against missing or interfering patterns. Additionally, we\nincorporate a semantic expert model as the teacher and construct inter-model\nfeature dependencies via learnable isomorphic graphs to enable aggregation of\nsemantic structural knowledge. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nout-of-distribution monocular depth estimation performance across a range of\npublic adverse scenario datasets.

Providing evidence for this hypothesis would enable researchers\nto exploit universal properties, facilitating the generalization of mechanistic\ninterpretability techniques across models. Previous works studied if LLMs\nlearned the same features, which are internal representations that activate on\nspecific concepts. Since comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to\npolysemanticity, in which LLM neurons often correspond to multiple unrelated\nfeatures rather than to distinct concepts, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been\nemployed to disentangle LLM neurons into SAE features corresponding to distinct\nconcepts. In this paper, we introduce a new variation of the universality\nhypothesis called Analogous Feature Universality: we hypothesize that even if\nSAEs across different models learn different feature representations, the\nspaces spanned by SAE features are similar, such that one SAE space is similar\nto another SAE space under rotation-invariant transformations. Evidence for\nthis hypothesis would imply that interpretability techniques related to latent\nspaces, such as steering vectors, may be transferred across models via certain\ntransformations. To investigate this hypothesis, we first pair SAE features\nacross different models via activation correlation, and then measure spatial\nrelation similarities between paired features via representational similarity\nmeasures, which transform spaces into representations that reveal hidden\nrelational similarities. Our experiments demonstrate high similarities for SAE\nfeature spaces across various LLMs, providing evidence for feature space\nuniversality.",

Recently, test-time adaptation (TTA) has attracted\nattention due to its ability to adapt a pre-trained model to a target domain,\nwithout re-accessing the source domain. However, existing TTA algorithms are\nprimarily designed for attribute shifts in vision tasks, where samples are\nindependent. These methods perform poorly on graph data that experience\nstructure shifts, where node connectivity differs between source and target\ngraphs. We attribute this performance gap to the distinct impact of node\nattribute shifts versus graph structure shifts: the latter significantly\ndegrades the quality of node representations and blurs the boundaries between\ndifferent node categories. To address structure shifts in graphs, we propose\nMatcha, an innovative framework designed for effective and efficient adaptation\nto structure shifts by adjusting the htop-aggregation parameters in GNNs. To\nenhance the representation quality, we design a prediction-informed clustering\nloss to encourage the formation of distinct clusters for different node\ncategories. Additionally, Matcha seamlessly integrates with existing TTA\nalgorithms, allowing it to handle attribute shifts effectively while improving\noverall performance under combined structure and attribute shifts.

On top of it, we build the\nDirected Line Graph Network (DLGNet), the first spectral-based Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) expressly designed to operate on a hypergraph via its DLG\ntransformation. The foundation of DLGNet is a novel Hermitian matrix, the\nDirected Line Graph Laplacian, which compactly encodes the directionality of\nthe interactions taking place within the directed hyperedges of the hypergraph\nthanks to the DLG representation. The Directed Line Graph Laplacian enjoys many\ndesirable properties, including admitting an eigenvalue decomposition and being\npositive semidefinite, which make it well-suited for its adoption within a\nspectral-based GNN. Through extensive experiments on chemical reaction\ndatasets, we show that DGLNet significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches, achieving on a collection of real-world datasets an average\nrelative-percentage-difference improvement of 33.01%, with a maximum\nimprovement of 37.71%.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of a manipulator's workspace is fundamental for a variety of tasks\nincluding robot design, grasp planning and robot base placement. Consequently,\nworkspace representations are well studied in robotics. Two important\nrepresentations are reachability maps and inverse reachability maps. The former\npredicts whether a given end-effector pose is reachable from where the robot\ncurrently is, and the latter suggests suitable base positions for a desired\nend-effector pose. Typically, the reachability map is built by discretizing the\n6D space containing the robot's workspace and determining, for each cell,\nwhether it is reachable or not. The reachability map is subsequently inverted\nto build the inverse map. This is a cumbersome process which restricts the\napplications of such maps. In this work, we exploit commonalities of existing\nsix and seven axis robot arms to reduce the dimension of the discretization\nfrom 6D to 4D. We propose Reachability Map 4D (RM4D), a map that only requires\na single 4D data structure for both forward and inverse queries. This gives a\nmuch more compact map that can be constructed by an order of magnitude faster\nthan existing maps, with no inversion overheads and no loss in accuracy. Our\nexperiments showcase the usefulness of RM4D for grasp planning with a mobile\nmanipulator.",

Among various techniques to train variational circuits, the\nparameter shift rule enables the exact calculation of cost-function derivatives\nefficiently, facilitating gradient descent-based optimization.

A significant\nhurdle in using multi-line paragraph stimuli is the need to align eye gaze\nposition with the correct line.

Such manual correction is labor-intensive,\nsubjective, and limits the scalability of research efforts. As a result,\nautomated solutions are desirable, especially those that do not require\nextensive technical skills and still allow close control over the outcome. To\naddress this, we introduce GazeGenie: a comprehensive software solution\ndesigned specifically for researchers in eye-tracking studies on multi-line\nreading.

However, current methods for evaluating\npreference alignment often lack explainability, relying on coarse-grained\ncomparisons.

    "abstract": "The recent advancements in large-scale pre-training techniques have\nsignificantly enhanced the capabilities of vision foundation models, notably\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM), which can generate precise masks based on\npoint and box prompts. Recent studies extend SAM to Few-shot Semantic\nSegmentation (FSS), focusing on prompt generation for SAM-based automatic\nsemantic segmentation. However, these methods struggle with selecting suitable\nprompts, require specific hyperparameter settings for different scenarios, and\nexperience prolonged one-shot inference times due to the overuse of SAM,\nresulting in low efficiency and limited automation ability. To address these\nissues, we propose a simple yet effective approach based on graph analysis. In\nparticular, a Positive-Negative Alignment module dynamically selects the point\nprompts for generating masks, especially uncovering the potential of the\nbackground context as the negative reference. Another subsequent Point-Mask\nClustering module aligns the granularity of masks and selected points as a\ndirected graph, based on mask coverage over points. These points are then\naggregated by decomposing the weakly connected components of the directed graph\nin an efficient manner, constructing distinct natural clusters. Finally, the\npositive and overshooting gating, benefiting from graph-based granularity\nalignment, aggregate high-confident masks and filter out the false-positive\nmasks for final prediction, reducing the usage of additional hyperparameters\nand redundant mask generation. Extensive experimental analysis across standard\nFSS, One-shot Part Segmentation, and Cross Domain FSS datasets validate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, surpassing\nstate-of-the-art generalist models with a mIoU of 58.7% on COCO-20i and 35.2%\non LVIS-92i.

The key feature of ELMO is\nthe coupling of the self-attention mechanism with thoughtfully designed\nembedding modules for motion and point clouds, significantly elevating the\nmotion quality. To facilitate accurate motion capture, we develop a one-time\nskeleton calibration model capable of predicting user skeleton offsets from a\nsingle-frame point cloud.

    "abstract": "In traditional boosting algorithms, the focus on misclassified training\nsamples emphasizes their importance based on difficulty during the learning\nprocess. While using a standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a weak learner\nin an AdaBoost framework can enhance model performance by concentrating on\nerror samples, this approach introduces significant challenges. Specifically,\nSVMs, characterized by their stability and robustness, may require\ndestabilization to fit the boosting paradigm, which in turn can constrain\nperformance due to reliance on the weighted results from preceding iterations.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Support Vector Boosting Machine\n(SVBM), which integrates a novel subsampling process with SVM algorithms and\nresidual connection techniques. This method updates sample weights by\nconsidering both the current model's predictions and the outputs from prior\nrounds, allowing for effective sparsity control. The SVBM framework enhances\nthe ability to form complex decision boundaries, thereby improving\nclassification performance.

For example, we find lower income users are\nmore at risk, and find that as users' age increases, they are both more likely\nto be concerned about fingerprinting and at real risk of fingerprinting.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate an overlooked risk: user demographics, such as\ngender, age, income level and race, can be inferred from browser attributes\ncommonly used for fingerprinting, and we identify which browser attributes most\ncontribute to this risk. Our data collection process also conducted an\nexperiment to study what impacts users' likelihood to share browser data for\nopen research, in order to inform future data collection efforts, with\nresponses from 12,461 total participants.

    "abstract": "This article draws attention that the puzzle of the change of the angular\nmomentum without any force is a consequence of the contradiction of macroscopic\nquantum phenomena with the correspondence principle, which reveals a\nfundamental difference between microscopic quantum phenomena, described by the\nSchrodinger wave mechanics, and macroscopic quantum phenomena, described by the\ntheory of superconductivity and the theory of superfluidity. To explain why\nmacroscopic quantum phenomena are observed despite the correspondence\nprinciple, Lev Landau postulated in 1941 that microscopic particles in\nsuperfluid helium and superconductor cannot move separately. The angular\nmomentum can change without any force only due to quantization in both\nmicroscopic and macroscopic quantum phenomena. The Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple eliminates the contradiction with the conservation law in the first\ncase, since according to the correspondence principle, the change in angular\nmomentum cannot exceed the Planck constant. But this principle cannot eliminate\nthe contradiction with the conservation law the macroscopic change of angular\nmomentum due to quantization observed in superconductors contrary to the\ncorrespondence principle. Quantization can change not only the angular\nmomentum, but also the kinetic energy of a superconducting condensate on a\nmacroscopic amount. For this reason, the Meissner effect and other macroscopic\nquantum phenomena contradict the second law of thermodynamics. The reluctance\nof physicists to admit the violation of the second law of thermodynamics\nprovoked a false understanding of the phenomenon of superconductivity and\nobvious contradictions in books on superconductivity.",

In this paper, we propose a solution to\nthis problem by introducing a novel notion called Faithful Graph\nAttention-based Interpretation (FGAI). In particular, FGAI has four crucial\nproperties regarding stability and sensitivity to interpretation and final\noutput distribution. Built upon this notion, we propose an efficient\nmethodology for obtaining FGAI, which can be viewed as an ad hoc modification\nto the canonical Attention-based GNNs. To validate our proposed solution, we\nintroduce two novel metrics tailored for graph interpretation assessment.\nExperimental results demonstrate that FGAI exhibits superior stability and\npreserves the interpretability of attention under various forms of\nperturbations and randomness, which makes FGAI a more faithful and reliable\nexplanation tool.",

The results show that when the\ndegree of brane splitting is large, gravitational echoes of oscillation\nattenuation between sub-branes will appear in the thick brane. Furthermore,\ndifferent long-lived Kaluza-Klein modes interfere with each other, resulting in\na beating effect. Compared to a single brane model, the phenomenon of the split\ndouble brane is richer, and the lifetime of the massive Kaluza-Klein graviton\nof the double brane is longer. These phenomena may have potential\nphenomenological interest. We hope to detect these extra-dimensional signals in\nfuture gravitational wave detectors or accelerators.",

    "abstract": "Unintended electromagnetic emissions, called EM emanations, can be exploited\nto recover sensitive information, posing security risks. Metal shielding, used\nby defense organizations to prevent data leakage, is costly and impractical for\nwidespread use. This issue is particularly significant for IoT devices due to\ntheir sheer volume and varied deployment environments. Therefore, there is a\nresearch need for an automated detection method to monitor facilities and\naddress data leakage promptly. To resolve this challenge, in the preliminary\nversion of this work [1], a CNN-based detection method was proposed using HDMI\ncable emanations that provided ~95% accuracy up to 22.5 m but had limitations\ndue to training data. In this extended version, we augment the initial study by\ncollecting and characterizing emanation data from IoT devices, everyday\nelectronics, and cables. We propose a harmonic-based emanation detection method\nby developing a computational harmonic detection algorithm. The proposed method\naddresses the limitations of the CNN-based method and provides ~100% accuracy\nnot only for HDMI emanation (compared to ~95% in the earlier CNN method) but\nalso for all other tested devices and cables. Finally, it has also been tested\nin different environments to prove its efficacy in practical scenarios.",

We argue that one main\nbottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in\neffectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made\neasier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather\nthan relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We\nstudy this by introducing a straightforward regularization called\nREPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input\nhidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained\nfrom external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple\nstrategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and\ngeneration quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based\ntransformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT\ntraining by over 17.5$\\times$, matching the performance (without\nclassifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than\n400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the\nguidance interval.",

New 6G services will\nincrease the load and dynamism of the network. Network Function Virtualization\n(NFV) aids with this increased load and dynamism by eliminating hardware\ndependency. It aims to boost the flexibility and scalability of network\ndeployment services by separating network functions from their specific\nproprietary forms so that they can run as virtual network functions (VNFs) on\ncommodity hardware. It is essential to design an NFV orchestration and\nmanagement framework to support these services. However, deploying bulky\nmonolithic VNFs on the network is difficult, especially when underlying\nresources are scarce, resulting in ineffective resource management. To address\nthis, microservices-based NFV approaches are proposed. In this approach,\nmonolithic VNFs are decomposed into micro VNFs, increasing the likelihood of\ntheir successful placement and resulting in more efficient resource management.\nThis article discusses the proposed framework for resource allocation for\nmicroservices-based services to provide end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS)\nusing the Double Deep Q Learning (DDQL) approach. Furthermore, to enhance this\nresource allocation approach, we discussed and addressed two crucial\nsub-problems: the need for a dynamic priority technique and the presence of the\nlow-priority starvation problem. Using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\n(DDPG) model, an Adaptive Scheduling model is developed that effectively\nmitigates the starvation problem. Additionally, the impact of incorporating\ntraffic load considerations into deployment and scheduling is thoroughly\ninvestigated.",

One of the most informative bulk\nproperties is planet mass, which is particularly challenging to measure with\nmore than 70\\% of discovered planets with no measured value. We compare the\ncapabilities of five different machine learning algorithms that can utilize\nmultidimensional incomplete datasets to estimate missing properties for\nimputing planet mass. The results are compared when using a partial subset of\nthe archive with a complete set of six planet properties, and where all planet\ndiscoveries are leveraged in an incomplete set of six and eight planet\nproperties. We find that imputation results improve with more data even when\nthe additional data is incomplete, and allows a mass prediction for any planet\nregardless of which properties are known. Our favored algorithm is the newly\ndeveloped $k$NN$\\times$KDE, which can return a probability distribution for the\nimputed properties. The shape of this distribution can indicate the algorithm's\nlevel of confidence, and also inform on the underlying demographics of the\nexoplanet population. We demonstrate how the distributions can be interpreted\nwith a series of examples for planets where the discovery was made with either\nthe transit method, or radial velocity method.

The poor convergence then acts as\na source of adversarial vulnerability when the dataset is inseparable in the\non-manifold direction. We provide theoretical results for logistic regression\nand a 2-layer linear network on the considered data distribution.

We perform experiments and exhibit tremendous\nrobustness improvements in clean training through long training and the\nemployment of second-order methods, corroborating our framework.

    "abstract": "Refusal-Aware Instruction Tuning (RAIT) enables Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto refuse to answer unknown questions. By modifying responses of unknown\nquestions in the training data to refusal responses such as \"I don't know\",\nRAIT enhances the reliability of LLMs and reduces their hallucination.\nGenerally, RAIT modifies training samples based on the correctness of the\ninitial LLM's response. However, this crude approach can cause LLMs to\nexcessively refuse answering questions they could have correctly answered, the\nproblem we call over-refusal. In this paper, we explore two primary causes of\nover-refusal: Static conflict occurs when similar samples within the LLM's\nfeature space receive differing supervision signals (original vs. modified \"I\ndon't know\"). Dynamic conflict arises as the LLM's evolving knowledge during\nSFT enables it to answer previously unanswerable questions, but the\nnow-answerable training samples still retain the original \"I don't know\"\nsupervision signals from the initial LLM state, leading to inconsistencies.\nThese conflicts cause the trained LLM to misclassify known questions as\nunknown, resulting in over-refusal. To address this issue, we introduce\nCertainty Represented Knowledge Flow for Refusal-Aware Instructions Tuning\n(CRaFT). CRaFT centers on two main contributions: First, we additionally\nincorporate response certainty to selectively filter and modify data, reducing\nstatic conflicts. Second, we implement preliminary rehearsal training to\ncharacterize changes in the LLM's knowledge state, which helps mitigate dynamic\nconflicts during the fine-tuning process. We conducted extensive experiments on\nopen-ended question answering and multiple-choice question task. Experiment\nresults show that CRaFT can improve LLM's overall performance during the RAIT\nprocess. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/opendatalab/CRaFT .",

    "abstract": "Image-text representation learning forms a cornerstone in vision-language\nmodels, where pairs of images and textual descriptions are contrastively\naligned in a shared embedding space. Since visual and textual concepts are\nnaturally hierarchical, recent work has shown that hyperbolic space can serve\nas a high-potential manifold to learn vision-language representation with\nstrong downstream performance. In this work, for the first time we show how to\nfully leverage the innate hierarchical nature of hyperbolic embeddings by\nlooking beyond individual image-text pairs. We propose Compositional Entailment\nLearning for hyperbolic vision-language models. The idea is that an image is\nnot only described by a sentence but is itself a composition of multiple object\nboxes, each with their own textual description. Such information can be\nobtained freely by extracting nouns from sentences and using openly available\nlocalized grounding models. We show how to hierarchically organize images,\nimage boxes, and their textual descriptions through contrastive and\nentailment-based objectives. Empirical evaluation on a hyperbolic\nvision-language model trained with millions of image-text pairs shows that the\nproposed compositional learning approach outperforms conventional Euclidean\nCLIP learning, as well as recent hyperbolic alternatives, with better zero-shot\nand retrieval generalization and clearly stronger hierarchical performance.",

    "abstract": "Manipulation of large objects over long horizons (such as carts in a\nwarehouse) is an essential skill for deployable robotic systems. Large objects\nrequire mobile manipulation which involves simultaneous manipulation,\nnavigation, and movement with the object in tow. In many real-world situations,\nobject dynamics are incredibly complex, such as the interaction of an office\nchair (with a rotating base and five caster wheels) and the ground. We present\na hierarchical algorithm for long-horizon robot manipulation problems in which\nthe dynamics are partially unknown. We observe that diffusion-based behavior\ncloning is highly effective for short-horizon problems with unknown dynamics,\nso we decompose the problem into an abstract high-level, obstacle-aware\nmotion-planning problem that produces a waypoint sequence. We use a\nshort-horizon, relative-motion diffusion policy to achieve the waypoints in\nsequence. We train mobile manipulation policies on a Spot robot that has to\npush and pull an office chair. Our hierarchical manipulation policy performs\nconsistently better, especially when the horizon increases, compared to a\ndiffusion policy trained on long-horizon demonstrations or motion planning\nassuming a rigidly-attached object (success rate of 8 (versus 0 and 5\nrespectively) out of 10 runs). Importantly, our learned policy generalizes to\nnew layouts, grasps, chairs, and flooring that induces more friction, without\nany further training, showing promise for other complex mobile manipulation\nproblems.

    "abstract": "A cut in a digraph $D=(V,A)$ is a set of arcs $\\{uv \\in A: u\\in U, v\\notin\nU\\}$, for some $U\\subseteq V$. It is known that the arc set $A$ is covered by\n$k$ cuts if and only if it admits a $k$-coloring such that no two consecutive\narcs $uv, vw$ receive the same color. Alon, Bollob\\'as, Gy\\'arf\\'as, Lehel and\nScott (2007) observed that every acyclic digraph of maximum indegree at most\n$\\binom{k}{\\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor}-1$ is covered by $k$ cuts. We prove that this\ndegree condition is best possible (if an enormous outdegree is allowed).\nNotably, for $k\\geq 5$, powers of directed paths do not suffice as extremal\nexamples. Instead, we locate the maximum $d$ such that the $d$-th power of an\narbitrarily long directed path is covered by $k$ cuts between $(1-o(1))\n\\frac{1}{e} 2^k$ and $\\frac{1}{2}2^k-2$. Let $k\\geq 3$ and $D$ be an acyclic\ndigraph that is not covered by $k$ cuts. We prove that the decision problem\nwhether a digraph that admits a homomorphism to $D$ is covered by $k$ cuts is\nNP-complete. If $k=3$ and $D$ is the third power of the directed path on 12\nvertices, then even the restriction to planar digraphs of maximum indegree and\noutdegree $3$ holds.",

We theoretically prove not only that a\ntrivial classifier can have arbitrarily large ACR, but also that ACR is\nextremely sensitive to improvements on easy samples. In addition, the\ncomparison using ACR has a strong dependence on the certification budget.\nEmpirically, we confirm that existing training strategies, though improving\nACR, reduce the model's robustness on hard samples consistently. To strengthen\nour findings, we propose strategies, including explicitly discarding hard\nsamples, reweighing the dataset with approximate certified radius, and extreme\noptimization for easy samples, to replicate the progress in RS training and\neven achieve the state-of-the-art ACR on CIFAR-10, without training for\nrobustness on the full data distribution.

This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle. To overcome\nthese challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the\nsubstantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans. We propose a\nproximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels\nfor unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled\ndata.

Additionally, we employ a dual-branch\nstructure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance.\nExperimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings\n(i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 -\n50%).

Through computationally intensive algorithms,\nthese observed images are processed to reconstruct the 3-D structures. Many\npopular computational methods rely on estimating the unknown angles as part of\nthe reconstruction process, which becomes particularly challenging at low\nsignal-to-noise ratios.

However,\nthe method of moments typically entails computing high-order moments of the\nprojection images, incurring significant computational and memory costs.

To show the\noptimal rates, we first design estimation protocols to achieve them. The key\ningredient of these protocols is to introduce adaptive refinement mechanisms,\nwhich first generate rough estimate by partial information and then establish\nrefined estimate in subsequent steps guided by the rough estimate. The\nprotocols leverage successive refinement, sample compression, thresholding and\nrandom hashing methods to achieve the optimal rates in different parameter\nregimes.

In this\npaper, we first propose the domain adaptation problem in SGNs, and introduce a\nnovel framework named Degree-Consicious Spiking Graph for Cross-Domain\nAdaptation. DeSGraDA enhances generalization across domains with three key\ncomponents. First, we introduce the degree-conscious spiking representation\nmodule by adapting spike thresholds based on node degrees, enabling more\nexpressive and structure-aware signal encoding. Then, we perform temporal\ndistribution alignment by adversarially matching membrane potentials between\ndomains, ensuring effective performance under domain shift while preserving\nenergy efficiency. Additionally, we extract consistent predictions across two\nspaces to create reliable pseudo-labels, effectively leveraging unlabeled data\nto enhance graph classification performance. Furthermore, we establish the\nfirst generalization bound for SGDA, providing theoretical insights into its\nadaptation performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate\nthat DeSGraDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both\nclassification accuracy and energy efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Using the static, spherically symmetric metric for a black hole (BH) immersed\nin dark matter (DM) halo characterized by Hernquist, Burkert, and\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density distributions, we calculate the orbital\nperiods and precessions, along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and\neccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) surrounded by DM halos.\nFor the Hernquist model, we find that the gravitational force exerted by the\ncentral BH is decreased by DM halos, while DM halos put additional\ngravitational force on the SCO. The presence of both Burkert-type and NFW-type\nDM halos enhances the gravitational force acting on the SCO, resulting in a\ndecrease in the period $P$, with the decrease depending on $M/a_0^2$;\nadditionally, we find that the reduction in orbital precession due to DM halos\nis influenced by $M/a_0^2$. The presence of DM halos leads to a slower\nevolution of EMRIs within Hernquist-type halos, while it accelerates evolution\nfor EMRIs in Burkert-type and NFW-type halos; furthermore, it slows the\ndecrease of eccentricity across all three types of DM halos. By calculating the\nnumber of orbital cycles and the gravitational waveform mismatches among these\nthree types of DM halos, as well as between scenarios with and without DM\nhalos, we find that DM halos can be detected when $M/a_0>10^{-5}$,\n$M/a_0>10^{-3}$, and $M/a_0>10^{-3}$ for Hernquist-type, NFW-type, and\nBurkert-type DM halos, respectively.

At the same time, there has been progress in proving second-order\nconvergence of the non-private version of ``noisy SGD'', as well as progress in\ndesigning algorithms that are more complex than DP-SGD and do guarantee\nsecond-order convergence. We revisit DP-SGD and show that ``noise is all you\nneed'': the noise necessary for privacy already implies second-order\nconvergence under the standard smoothness assumptions, even for non-Lipschitz\nloss functions.

While the edges of elemental TMDC nanoparticles,\nsuch as MoS$_2$, can show significant catalytic activity, the basal plane of\nthe pristine materials are notoriously inert, which limits their normalized\nactivity. Here we show that high densities of catalytically active sites can be\nformed on the TMDC basal plane by alloying elements that prefer the 2H (1T)\nphase into a 1T (2H) structure. The global stability of the alloy, in\nparticular whether it crystallizes in the 2H or 1T phase, can be controlled by\nensuring a majority of elements preferring the target phase. We further show\nthat the mixing entropy plays a decisive role for stabilizing the alloy\nimplying that high-entropy alloying becomes essential.

We find that\nnongravitational accelerations on the order of $10^{-9}$ au/d$^2$ can lead to a\nchange in plane-of-sky positions of $\\sim10^3$ arcsec between apparitions.\nMoreover, we inject synthetic tracklets of hypothetical\nnongravitationally-accelerating NEOs into the Minor Planet Center orbit\nidentification algorithms.

We further show that if orbits can be determined\nfor both apparitions, the tracklets will be linked regardless of\nnongravitational accelerations, although they may be linked to multiple\nobjects. In order to aid in the identification and linkage of\nnongravitationally accelerating objects, we propose and test a new methodology\nto search for unlinked pairs. When applied to the current census of NEOs, we\nrecover the previously identified case but identify no new linkages. We\nconclude that current linking algorithms are generally robust to\nnongravitational accelerations, but objects with large nongravitational\naccelerations may potentially be missed.

    "abstract": "Sampling without replacement is a natural online rounding strategy for\nconverting fractional bipartite matching into an integral one. In Online\nBipartite Matching, we can use the Balance algorithm to fractionally match each\nonline vertex, and then sample an unmatched offline neighbor with probability\nproportional to the fractional matching. In Online Stochastic Matching, we can\ntake the solution to a linear program relaxation as a reference, and then match\neach online vertex to an unmatched offline neighbor with probability\nproportional to the fractional matching of the online vertex's type. On the one\nhand, we find empirical evidence that online matching algorithms based on\nsampling without replacement outperform existing algorithms. On the other hand,\nthe literature offers little theoretical understanding of the power of sampling\nwithout replacement in online matching problems.\n  This paper fills the gap in the literature by giving the first non-trivial\ncompetitive analyses of sampling without replacement for online matching\nproblems. In Online Stochastic Matching, we develop a potential function\nanalysis framework to show that sampling without replacement is at least\n$0.707$-competitive. The new analysis framework further allows us to\nderandomize the algorithm to obtain the first polynomial-time deterministic\nalgorithm that breaks the $1-\\frac{1}{e}$ barrier. In Online Bipartite\nMatching, we show that sampling without replacement provides provable online\ncorrelated selection guarantees when the selection probabilities correspond to\nthe fractional matching chosen by the Balance algorithm.

    "abstract": "Hydrogen is vital for sectors like chemicals and others, driven by the need\nto reduce carbon emissions. Proton Electrolyte Membrane Water Electrolysis\n(PEMWE) is a key technology for the production of green hydrogen under\nfluctuating conditions of renewable power sources. However, due to the scarcity\nof noble metal materials, the stability of the anode catalyst layer under\ndynamic operating conditions must be better understood. Model-aided\ninvestigation approaches are essential due to the back-box nature of the\nelectrochemical system and the high costs of experimental long-term testing. In\nthis work, a temporal multiscale method based on a Heterogeneous technique is\napplied to reduce the computational effort of simulating long-term degradation,\nfocused on catalyst dissolution. Such an approach characterizes the problem in\nfast locally periodic processes, influenced by the dynamic operation and slow\nprocesses attributed to the gradual degradation of the catalyst layer. A\nmechanistic model that includes the oxygen evolution reaction, catalyst\ndissolution and hydrogen permeation from the cathode to the anode side is\nhypothesized and implemented. The multiscale approach notably reduces\ncomputational effort of simulation from hours to mere minutes. This efficiency\ngain is ascribed to the limited evolution of Slow-Scale variables during each\nperiod of time of the Fast-Scale variables. Consequently, simulation of the\nfast processes is required only until local periodicity is achieved within each\nSlow-Scale time step. Thus, the developed temporal multiscale approach proves\nto be highly effective in accelerating parameter estimation and predictive\nsimulation steps, as could be verified through the results of this article. In\nthis way, the method can support systematic model development to describe\ndegradation in PEMWE under dynamic operating conditions.",

In the last decades,\npolicymakers increasingly use simulations and computational methods to guide\nsome of their decisions. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are one of such\nmethods, which combine social, economic, and environmental simulations to\nforecast potential policy effects. For example, the UN uses outputs of IAMs for\ntheir recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.\nTraditionally these have been solved using recursive equation solvers, but have\nseveral shortcomings, e.g. struggling at decision making under uncertainty.\nRecent preliminary work using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to replace the\ntraditional solvers shows promising results in decision making in uncertain and\nnoisy scenarios. We extend on this work by introducing multiple interacting RL\nagents as a preliminary analysis on modelling the complex interplay of\nsocio-interactions between various stakeholders or nations that drives much of\nthe current climate crisis. Our findings show that cooperative agents in this\nframework can consistently chart pathways towards more desirable futures in\nterms of reduced carbon emissions and improved economy. However, upon\nintroducing competition between agents, for instance by using opposing reward\nfunctions, desirable climate futures are rarely reached.

Both sensing and\ncommunication benefit from the presence of an RIS, which makes the channels\nricher and stronger. Diverging from prior research, we comprehensively examine\nthree target echo paths: the direct (static) channel path, the path via the\nRIS, and a combination of these, each characterized by distinct radar cross\nsections (RCSs). We take both the line-of-sight (LOS) and the non-line-of-sight\n(NLOS) paths into account under a clutter for which the distribution is not\nknown, but the low-rank subspace it resides. We derive the generalized\nlikelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector and introduce a novel approach for\njointly optimizing the configuration of RIS phase-shifts and precoding. Our\nsimulation results underscore the paramount importance of this combined design\nin terms of enhancing detection probability.

The interest in this system has\nbeen renewed following the publication of r-band light curves spanning 14.5\nyears and the determination of the time delays between the four brightest\nquasar images.\n  Aims. We constrained the quasar accretion disk size and the fraction of the\nlens mass in stars using the signature of microlensing in the quasar image\nlight curves.\n  Methods. We built the six possible histograms of microlensing magnitude\ndifferences between the four quasar images and compared them with simulated\nmodel histograms, using a $\\chi^2$ test to infer the model parameters.\n  Results. We infer a quasar disk half-light radius of $R_{1/2}=(0.70\\pm0.04)\\,\nR_E=(6.4\\pm0.4) \\sqrt{M/0.3M_{\\odot}}$ light-days at 2407\\r{A} in the rest\nframe and stellar mass fractions at the quasar image positions of\n$\\alpha_A>0.059$, $\\alpha_B=0.056^{+0.021}_{-0.027}$,\n$\\alpha_C=0.030^{+0.031}_{-0.021}$, and $\\alpha_D=0.072^{+0.034}_{-0.016}$.\n  Conclusions. The inferred disk size is broadly compatible with most previous\nestimates, and the stellar mass fractions are within the expected ranges for\ngalaxy clusters. In the region where image C lies, the stellar mass fraction is\ncompatible with a stellar contribution from the brightest cluster galaxy,\ngalaxy cluster members, and intracluster light, but the values at images B, D,\nand especially A are slightly larger, possibly suggesting the presence of extra\nstellar components.",

These instabilities originate from the central baryonic feedback\nand have many prospects regarding the evolution of disc galaxies. They can\ntrigger the gravitational collapse inside the dense molecular clouds that lead\nto the formation of stars under suitable astrophysical circumstances. In the\npresent work, the role of parameters like the molecular cloud's magnetic field,\nrotation, etc., has been investigated behind this explosion-triggered star\nformation process with the help of Jeans instability analysis. From this study,\nour essential observation is that the formation of star clusters is favoured by\na strong magnetic field ($\\sim 10 \\; \\mu$G), and the effect is enhanced at a\nmore considerable distance from the centre. Again, this instability also\ncontributes to the formation of stellar bars. This dense rotating component may\ndrive out the chaotic stellar orbits from the disc through its two ends like a\npropeller. This process has been modelled in the thesis work from the viewpoint\nof chaotic scattering in open Hamiltonian systems. This analysis concludes that\nthis bar-driven chaotic motion (or simply escaping motion) may lead to the\nforming of spiral arms or inner disc rings, depending on the bar strength. Our\nstudy also found that, compared to NFW dark haloes, the oblate dark haloes\noffer a more cohesive evolutionary framework for generating bar-driven escape\nstructures in giant spiral and dwarf galaxies. Moreover, the formation of\nspiral arms via bar-driven escaping motion is only encouraged in galaxies with\nNFW dark haloes if they have highly energetic centres, like active galaxies.",

    "abstract": "Concealed object detection (COD) in cluttered scenes is significant for\nvarious image processing applications. However, due to that concealed objects\nare always similar to their background, it is extremely hard to distinguish\nthem. Here, the major obstacle is the tiny feature differences between the\ninside and outside object boundary region, which makes it trouble for existing\nCOD methods to achieve accurate results. In this paper, considering that the\nsurrounding environment information can be well utilized to identify the\nconcealed objects, and thus, we propose a novel deep Surrounding-Aware Network,\nnamely SurANet, for COD tasks, which introduces surrounding information into\nfeature extraction and loss function to improve the discrimination. First, we\nenhance the semantics of feature maps using differential fusion of surrounding\nfeatures to highlight concealed objects. Next, a Surrounding-Aware Contrastive\nLoss is applied to identify the concealed object via learning surrounding\nfeature maps contrastively. Then, SurANet can be trained end-to-end with high\nefficiency via our proposed Spatial-Compressed Correlation Transmission\nstrategy after our investigation of feature dynamics, and extensive experiments\nimprove that such features can be well reserved respectively. Finally,\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed SurANet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art COD methods on multiple real datasets.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have enabled a wide range of works\nexploiting their ability to generate high-volume, high-quality data for use in\nvarious downstream tasks. One subclass of such models, dubbed Layout-to-Image\nSynthesis (LIS), learns to generate images conditioned on a spatial layout\n(bounding boxes, masks, poses, etc.) and has shown a promising ability to\ngenerate realistic images, albeit with limited layout-adherence. Moreover, the\nquestion of how to effectively transfer those models for scalable augmentation\nof few-shot detection data remains unanswered. Thus, we propose a collaborative\nframework employing a Large Language Model (LLM) and an LIS model for enhancing\nfew-shot detection beyond state-of-the-art generative augmentation approaches.\nWe leverage LLM's reasoning ability to extrapolate the spatial prior of the\nannotation space by generating new bounding boxes given only a few example\nannotations. Additionally, we introduce our novel layout-aware CLIP score for\nsample ranking, enabling tight coupling between generated layouts and images.\nSignificant improvements on COCO few-shot benchmarks are observed.

    "abstract": "An occurrence of a repeated substring $u$ in a string $S$ is called a net\noccurrence if extending the occurrence to the left or to the right decreases\nthe number of occurrences to 1. The net frequency (NF) of a repeated substring\n$u$ in a string $S$ is the number of net occurrences of $u$ in $S$. Very\nrecently, Guo et al. [SPIRE 2024] proposed an online $O(n \\log \\sigma)$-time\nalgorithm that maintains a data structure of $O(n)$ space which answers\nSingle-NF queries in $O(m\\log \\sigma + \\sigma^2)$ time and reports all answers\nof the All-NF problem in $O(n\\sigma^2)$ time. Here, $n$ is the length of the\ninput string $S$, $m$ is the query pattern length, and $\\sigma$ is the alphabet\nsize. The $\\sigma^2$ term is a major drawback of their method since computing\nstring net frequencies is originally motivated for Chinese language processing\nwhere $\\sigma$ can be thousands large. This paper presents an improved online\n$O(n \\log \\sigma)$-time algorithm, which answers Single-NF queries in $O(m \\log\n\\sigma)$ time and reports all answers to the All-NF problem in output-optimal\n$O(|\\mathsf{NF}^+(S)|)$ time, where $\\mathsf{NF}^+(S)$ is the set of substrings\nof $S$ paired with their positive NF values.

The interlayer coupling\nbetween s-wave and d-wave superconductors can induce an effective $d+is$\nsuperconducting state, spontaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry.

Recent\nobservational studies using stacked survey data and deep exposures of galaxy\ncluster outskirts have detected soft X-ray excesses associated with optically\nidentified filaments. However, the physical characteristics of WHIM in\nfilaments remain largely undetermined due to a lack of direct spectral\ndiagnostics of individual targets, which are limited by the spectral resolution\nof current instruments in the soft X-ray band. We aim to select appropriate\ntargets for WHIM characterization through pointing observations with the future\nHot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) mission, which is designed with eV-level\nenergy resolution in the 0.1-2.0 keV band and a one-square-degree field of\nview, thus complementing other planned microcalorimetry missions such as\nAthena. We built a sample of 1577 inter-cluster filaments based on the eRASS1\nsupercluster catalog and estimated their soft X-ray emission. Their modeled\nemission and geometrical properties were used to select candidate targets for\nHUBS observations. Four inter-cluster filaments were selected as the most\nappropriate candidates. By simulating and analyzing their mock observations, we\ndemonstrated that with 200 ks HUBS exposure for each candidate, the gas\nproperties of individual filaments can be accurately determined, with the\ntemperature constrained to $\\pm0.01$ keV, metallicity constrained to\n$\\leq\\pm0.03$ solar, and density constrained to $<\\pm10\\%$. Elemental\nabundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe can be measured separately, providing\nunprecedented insights into the chemical history of the filament gas.

One major\ncause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of an instruction hierarchy. Modern\nLLM architectures treat all inputs equally, failing to distinguish between and\nprioritize various types of instructions, such as system messages, user\nprompts, and data. As a result, lower-priority user prompts may override more\ncritical system instructions, including safety protocols. Existing approaches\nto achieving instruction hierarchy, such as delimiters and instruction-based\ntraining, do not address this issue at the architectural level. We introduce\nthe Instructional Segment Embedding (ISE) technique, inspired by BERT, to\nmodern large language models, which embeds instruction priority information\ndirectly into the model. This approach enables models to explicitly\ndifferentiate and prioritize various instruction types, significantly improving\nsafety against malicious prompts that attempt to override priority rules. Our\nexperiments on the Structured Query and Instruction Hierarchy benchmarks\ndemonstrate an average robust accuracy increase of up to 15.75% and 18.68%,\nrespectively.

Specifically, we consider training a policy in a\nreduced order system and deploying it in the full state system. The motivation\nfor this training strategy is that running simulations in the full-state system\nmay take excessive time if the dynamics are complex. While transfer learning\nalleviates the computational issue, the transfer guarantees depend on the\ndiscrepancy between the two systems. In this work, we consider a class of\ncascade dynamical systems, where the dynamics of a subset of the state-space\ninfluence the rest of the states but not vice-versa. The reinforcement learning\npolicy learns in a model that ignores the dynamics of these states and treats\nthem as commanded inputs. In the full-state system, these dynamics are handled\nusing a classic controller (e.g., a PID). These systems have vast applications\nin the control literature and their structure allows us to provide transfer\nguarantees that depend on the stability of the inner loop controller. Numerical\nexperiments on a quadrotor support the theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "In clinical procedures, precise localization of the target area is an\nessential step for clinical diagnosis and screening. For many diagnostic\napplications, lung segmentation of chest X-ray images is an essential first\nstep that significantly reduces the image size to speed up the subsequent\nanalysis. One of the primary difficulties with this task is segmenting the lung\nregions covered by dense abnormalities also known as opacities due to diseases\nlike pneumonia and tuberculosis. SAM has astonishing generalization\ncapabilities for category agnostic segmentation. In this study we propose an\nalgorithm to improve zero shot performance of SAM on lung region segmentation\ntask by automatic prompt selection. Two separate UNet models were trained, one\nfor predicting lung segments and another for heart segment. Though these\npredictions lack fine details around the edges, they provide positive and\nnegative points as prompt for SAM. Using proposed prompting method zero shot\nperformance of SAM is evaluated on two benchmark datasets. ViT-l version of the\nmodel achieved slightly better performance compared to other two versions, ViTh\nand ViTb. It yields an average Dice score of 95.5 percent and 94.9 percent on\nhold out data for two datasets respectively. Though, for most of the images,\nSAM did outstanding segmentation, its prediction was way off for some of the\nimages. After careful inspection it is found that all of these images either\nhad extreme abnormality or distorted shape. Unlike most of the research\nperformed so far on lung segmentation from CXR images using SAM, this study\nproposes a fully automated prompt selection process only from the input image.\nOur finding indicates that using pretrained models for prompt selection can\nutilize SAM impressive generalization capability to its full extent.",

Since the models also involve integrals over age, both in the birth\nprocess and in the interaction among species, they are in fact integro-partial\ndifferential equations (IPDEs) with positive states. To regulate the population\ndensities to desired profiles, harvesting is used as input. But\nnon-discriminating harvesting, where wanting to repress one species will\ninevitably repress the other species as well, the positivity restriction on the\ninput (no insertion of population), and the multiplicative nature of\nharvesting, makes control challenging even for ODE versions of such dynamics,\nlet alone for their IPDE versions on an infinite-dimensional nonnegative state\nspace.\n  We introduce a design for a benchmark version of such a problem: a\ntwo-population predator-prey setup. The model is equivalent to two coupled\nordinary differential equations (ODEs), actuated by harvesting which must not\ndrop below zero, and strongly disturbed by two autonomous but exponentially\nstable integral delay equations (IDEs). We develop two control designs. With a\nmodified Volterra-like control Lyapunov function, we design a simple feedback\nwhich employs possibly negative harvesting for global stabilization of the ODE\nmodel, while guaranteeing regional regulation with positive harvesting. With a\nmore sophisticated, restrained controller we achieve regulation for the ODE\nmodel globally, with positive harvesting. For the full IPDE model, with the IDE\ndynamics acting as large disturbances, for both the simple and saturated\nfeedback laws we provide explicit estimates of the regions of attraction. The\npaper charts a new pathway for control designs for infinite-dimensional\nmulti-species dynamics and for nonlinear positive systems with positive\ncontrols.",

While heuristic instantiations of\nmulti-neuron relaxations have been proposed to circumvent this barrier in\npractice, their theoretical properties remain largely unknown. In this work, we\nconduct the first rigorous study of the expressiveness of multi-neuron\nrelaxations.

We also show that without\nthese augmentations, the completeness guarantee can no longer be obtained, and\nthe relaxation error of every multi-neuron relaxation can be unbounded.

We evaluate shap-select on the Kaggle credit card\nfraud dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to established methods\nsuch as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), HISEL (a mutual information-based\nfeature selection method), Boruta and a simpler Shapley value-based method. Our\nfindings show that shap-select combines interpretability, computational\nefficiency, and performance, offering a robust solution for feature selection.",

    "abstract": "Over-parameterized models are typically vulnerable to membership inference\nattacks, which aim to determine whether a specific sample is included in the\ntraining of a given model. Previous Weight regularizations (e.g., L1\nregularization) typically impose uniform penalties on all parameters, leading\nto a suboptimal tradeoff between model utility and privacy. In this work, we\nfirst show that only a small fraction of parameters substantially impact the\nprivacy risk. In light of this, we propose Privacy-aware Sparsity Tuning\n(PAST), a simple fix to the L1 Regularization, by employing adaptive penalties\nto different parameters. Our key idea behind PAST is to promote sparsity in\nparameters that significantly contribute to privacy leakage. In particular, we\nconstruct the adaptive weight for each parameter based on its privacy\nsensitivity, i.e., the gradient of the loss gap with respect to the parameter.\nUsing PAST, the network shrinks the loss gap between members and non-members,\nleading to strong resistance to privacy attacks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of PAST, achieving a state-of-the-art balance in\nthe privacy-utility trade-off.",

This paper proposes a\nSegmentation-oriented Evaluation Approach (SEA) to assess VIF methods by\nincorporating the semantic segmentation task and leveraging segmentation labels\navailable in latest VIF datasets. Specifically, SEA utilizes universal\nsegmentation models, capable of handling diverse images and classes, to predict\nsegmentation outputs from fused images and compare these outputs with\nsegmentation labels. Our evaluation of recent VIF methods using SEA reveals\nthat their performance is comparable or even inferior to using visible images\nonly, despite nearly half of the infrared images demonstrating better\nperformance than visible images. Further analysis indicates that the two\nmetrics most correlated to our SEA are the gradient-based fusion metric\n$Q_{\\text{ABF}}$ and the visual information fidelity metric $Q_{\\text{VIFF}}$\nin conventional VIF evaluation metrics, which can serve as proxies when\nsegmentation labels are unavailable.

Given a text $T$ of length $n$, a pattern $P$ of length $m$, and a\nthreshold $k$, the task is to identify the fragments of $T$ that are at\ndistance at most $k$ to $P$. We consider the two most common distances: Hamming\ndistance (the number of character substitutions) in Pattern Matching with\nMismatches and edit distance (the minimum number of character insertions,\ndeletions, and substitutions) in Pattern Matching with Edits. We revisit the\ncomplexity of these two problems in the quantum setting.\n  Our recent work [STOC'24] shows that $\\hat{O}(\\sqrt{nk})$ quantum queries are\nsufficient to solve (the decision version of) Pattern Matching with Edits.\nHowever, the quantum time complexity of the underlying solution does not\nprovide any improvement over classical computation.

Our solutions can also report the starting positions\nof approximate occurrences of $P$ in $T$ (represented as collections of\narithmetic progressions); in this case, the unconditional lower bound and the\ncomplexities of our algorithms increase by a $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n/m})$ factor.",

Yet,\ndifficulties in adapting Mamba from language to vision tasks arise due to the\ndistinct characteristics of visual data, such as the spatial locality and\nadjacency within images and large variations in information granularity across\nvisual tokens. Existing vision Mamba approaches either flatten tokens into\nsequences in a raster scan fashion, which breaks the local adjacency of images,\nor manually partition tokens into windows, which limits their long-range\nmodeling and generalization capabilities. To address these limitations, we\npresent a new vision Mamba model, coined QuadMamba, that effectively captures\nlocal dependencies of varying granularities via quadtree-based image partition\nand scan. Concretely, our lightweight quadtree-based scan module learns to\npreserve the 2D locality of spatial regions within learned window quadrants.\nThe module estimates the locality score of each token from their features,\nbefore adaptively partitioning tokens into window quadrants. An omnidirectional\nwindow shifting scheme is also introduced to capture more intact and\ninformative features across different local regions. To make the discretized\nquadtree partition end-to-end trainable, we further devise a sequence masking\nstrategy based on Gumbel-Softmax and its straight-through gradient estimator.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that QuadMamba achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in various vision tasks, including image classification, object\ndetection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "It is shown that in curved spacetime none of the known definitions of\nfour-momentum correspond to the definition, in which all the system particles\nand fields, including fields outside matter, make an explicit contribution to\nthe four-momentum. This drawback can be eliminated under the assumption that\nthe primary representation of four-momentum is the sum of two nonlocal\nfour-vectors of the integral type with covariant indices. The first of these\nfour-vectors is the generalized four-momentum, found with the help of\nLagrangian density. The second four-vector is the four-momentum of fields\nthemselves, and its time component is related to the energy given by tensor\ninvariants. The standard approach makes it possible to find the four-momentum\nin covariant form only for a free point particle. In contrast, the obtained\nformulas for calculating the four-momentum components are applied to a\nstationary and moving relativistic uniform system, consisting of many\nparticles. In this case, the main fields of the system under consideration are\ntaken into account, including the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, the\nacceleration field and the pressure field. The formalism used includes the\nprinciple of least action, charged and neutral four-currents, corresponding\nfour-potentials and field tensors, which ensures unification and the\npossibility of combining fields into a single interaction. The calculation of\nthe integral vector components shows that the so-called integral vector is not\nequal to four-momentum and is not a four-vector at all, although it is\nconserved in a closed system. Thus, the four-momentum cannot be found with the\nhelp of an integral vector and components of the system stress-energy tensor,\nin contrast to how it is assumed in the general theory of relativity.",

    "abstract": "European energy markets are decentralized and entail balance responsibility\nof each market player. This stresses the importance of imbalance management of\nrenewable energy sources (RES), as the imbalance payments can strongly reduce\ntheir profitability. According to the EU Electricity Balancing Guideline, each\nEuropean transmission system operator should use the single imbalance pricing\nmethod which treats both deviation directions the same, no matter if a\ndeviation helps the system or pushes it away from the balance. This paper aims\nto investigate the behavior of a hybrid facility consisting of an\nuncontrollable RES, a battery and an electrolyzer under such market setting.\nThe formulated mathematical model of the hybrid facility seeks to maximize\nprofit in the day-ahead energy market, while minimizing the imbalance costs.\nUncertainty of the RES output is captured using stochastic scenarios, while the\ndirection of the power system deviation, relevant for the imbalance pricing, is\nmodeled using a newly proposed robust approach. Results of the case study\nindicate that the single imbalance pricing scheme might bring flexible assets\nto temptation of intentional deviations should they anticipate favorable\nimbalance prices.",

We then derive a model\ndescribing this deformation. It assumes a flat freezing front, a change in\nvolume at the front resulting from the Stefan condition, and a remaining volume\nto be frozen identical in shape to the initial one.

    "abstract": "This paper analyses the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(RIS)-assisted device-to-device (D2D) communication systems, focusing on\naddressing co-channel interference, a prevalent issue due to the frequency\nreuse of sidelink in the underlay in-band D2D communications. In contrast to\nprevious studies that either neglect interference or consider it only at the\nuser, our research investigates a performance analysis in terms of outage\nprobability (OP) for RIS-assisted D2D communication systems considering the\npresence of interference at both the user and the RIS. More specifically, we\nintroduce a novel integral-form expression for an exact analysis of OP.\nAdditionally, we present a new accurate approximation expression for OP, using\nthe gamma distributions to approximate the fading of both desired and\ninterference links, thereby yielding a closed-form expression. Nevertheless,\nboth derived expressions, i.e., the exact integral-form and the approximate\nclosed-form, contain special functions, such as Meijer's G-function and the\nparabolic cylinder function, which complicate real-time OP analysis. To\ncircumvent this, we employ a deep neural network (DNN) for real-time OP\nprediction, trained with data generated by the exact expression. Moreover, we\npresent a tight upper bound that quantifies the impact of interference on\nachievable diversity order and coding gain. We validate the derived expressions\nthrough Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis reveals that while interference\ndoes not affect the system's diversity order, it significantly degrades the\nperformance by reducing the coding gain. The results further demonstrate that\nincreasing the number of RIS's reflecting elements is an effective strategy to\nmitigate the adverse effects of the interference on the system performance.",

The challenge is to seamlessly integrate devices with\nvarying computational resources in a dynamic environment to form a cohesive\nsystem that can fulfill the needs of all participants. Existing work on\nadaptive systems typically focuses on optimizing individual variables or\nlow-level Service Level Objectives (SLOs), such as constraining the usage of\nspecific resources. While low-level control mechanisms permit fine-grained\ncontrol over a system, they introduce considerable complexity, particularly in\ndynamic environments. To this end, we propose drawing from Active Inference\n(AIF), a neuroscientific framework for designing adaptive agents. Specifically,\nwe introduce a conceptual agent for heterogeneous pervasive systems that\npermits setting global systems constraints as high-level SLOs. Instead of\nmanually setting low-level SLOs, the system finds an equilibrium that can adapt\nto environmental changes. We demonstrate the viability of our AIF agents with\nan extensive experiment design, using heterogeneous and lifelong federated\nlearning as an application scenario. We conduct our experiments on a physical\ntestbed of devices with different resource types and vendor specifications. The\nresults provide convincing evidence that an AIF agent can adapt a system to\nenvironmental changes.

In this paper, we report for the first time a\nmorphology-aware diffusion model, MDiff-FMT, based on denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic model (DDPM) to achieve high-fidelity morphological\nreconstruction for FMT. First, we use the noise addition of DDPM to simulate\nthe process of the gradual degradation of morphological features, and achieve\nfine-grained reconstruction of morphological features through a stepwise\nprobabilistic sampling mechanism, avoiding problems such as loss of structure\ndetails that may occur in end-to-end deep learning methods.

While generally effective, these\nmethods often rely on a fixed graph coarsening routine, leading to overly\nhomogeneous cluster representations and loss of node-level information. In this\npaper, we envision the graph as a network of interconnected node sets without\ncompressing each cluster into a single embedding. To enable effective\ninformation transfer among these node sets, we propose the Node-to-Cluster\nAttention (N2C-Attn) mechanism.

We then devise an efficient form\nfor N2C-Attn using the cluster-wise message-passing framework, achieving linear\ntime complexity. We further analyze how N2C-Attn combines bi-level feature maps\nof queries and keys, demonstrating its capability to merge dual-granularity\ninformation.

In\nparticular, it is unclear whether PKS 0903-57 is a BL Lac or a Flat Spectrum\nRadio Quasar (FSRQ), while its redshift estimation relies on a possibly\nmisassociated low signal-to-noise spectrum. Aim: We aim to reliably measure the\nredshift of the blazar and to determine its spectral type and luminosity in the\noptical range. Methods: We performed spectroscopy of the optical counterpart of\nthe blazar using the South African Large Telescope (SALT) and the Very Large\nTelescope (VLT) and monitored it photometrically with the Rapid Eye Mount (REM)\ntelescope. Results: We firmly measured the redshift of the blazar as z= 0.2621\n+/- 0.0006 thanks to the detection of five narrow optical lines. The detection\nof a symmetric broad Halpha line with Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 4020\n+/- 30 km/s together with a jet-dominated continuum leads us to classify it as\na FSRQ. Finally, we detected with high significance a redshift offset (about\n1500 km/s) between the broad line and the host. This is the first time that\nsuch an offset is unequivocally detected in a VHE blazar, possibly pointing to\na very peculiar accretion configuration, a merging system, or a recoiling Black\nHole.",

Yet, the transductive setting\ndoes not allow for reasoning over unseen entities, relations, let alone\nnumerical or non-numerical literals. Although increasing efforts are put into\nexploring inductive scenarios, inference over unseen entities, relations, and\nliterals has yet to come. This limitation prohibits the existing methods from\nhandling real-world dynamic knowledge graphs involving heterogeneous\ninformation about the world. Here, we propose a remedy to this limitation. We\npropose the attentive byte-pair encoding layer (BytE) to construct a triple\nembedding from a sequence of byte-pair encoded subword units of entities and\nrelations. Compared to the conventional setting, BytE leads to massive feature\nreuse via weight tying, since it forces a knowledge graph embedding model to\nlearn embeddings for subword units instead of entities and relations directly.\nConsequently, the size of the embedding matrices are not anymore bound to the\nunique number of entities and relations of a knowledge graph. Experimental\nresults show that BytE improves the link prediction performance of 4 knowledge\ngraph embedding models on datasets where the syntactic representations of\ntriples are semantically meaningful. However, benefits of training a knowledge\ngraph embedding model with BytE dissipate on knowledge graphs where entities\nand relations are represented with plain numbers or URIs.

Yet, many features associated with the weights in the\nhuman brain connectome are not fully understood, particularly their multiscale\norganization. In this paper, we elucidate the architecture of weights,\nincluding weak ties, in multiscale hierarchical human brain connectomes\nreconstructed from empirical data. Our findings reveal multiscale\nself-similarity in the weighted statistical properties, including the ordering\nof weak ties, that remain consistent across the analyzed length scales of every\nindividual and the group representatives. This phenomenon is effectively\ncaptured by a renormalization of the weighted structure applied to hyperbolic\nembeddings of the connectomes, based on a unique weighted geometric model that\nintegrates links of all weights across all length scales. This eliminates the\nneed for separate generative weighted connectivity rules for each scale or to\nreplicate weak and strong ties at specific scales in brain connectomes. The\nobserved symmetry represents a distinct signature of criticality in the\nweighted connectivity of human brain connectomes, aligning with the fractality\nobserved in their topology, and raises important questions for future research,\nlike the existence of a resolution threshold where the observed symmetry\nbreaks, or whether it is preserved in cases of neurodegenerative disease or\npsychiatric disorder.",

Such samples are\nvital to understand the physics of SNeII, but also to serve as calibrators for\ndistinct - and often lower-quality - samples. We present uBgVri optical and YJH\nnear-infrared (NIR) photometry for 94 low-redshift SNeII observed by the\nCarnegie Supernova Project (CSP). A total of 9817 optical and 1872 NIR\nphotometric data points are released, leading to a sample of high-quality SNII\nlight curves during the first ~150 days post explosion on a well-calibrated\nphotometric system. The sample is presented and its properties are analysed and\ndiscussed through comparison to literature events. We also focus on individual\nSNeII as examples of classically defined subtypes and outlier objects. Making a\ncut in the plateau decline rate of our sample (s2), a new subsample of\nfast-declining SNeII is presented. The sample has a median redshift of 0.015,\nwith the nearest event at 0.001 and the most distant at 0.07. At optical\nwavelengths (V), the sample has a median cadence of 4.7 days over the course of\na median coverage of 80 days. In the NIR (J), the median cadence is 7.2 days\nover the course of 59 days. The fast-declining subsample is more luminous than\nthe full sample and shows shorter plateau phases. Of the non-standard SNeII\nhighlighted, SN2009A particularly stands out with a steeply declining then\nrising light curve, together with what appears to be two superimposed P-Cygni\nprofiles of H-alpha in its spectra.

Prior\nresearch indicates that LLMs pre-trained with programming language data exhibit\nhigh mathematical and reasoning abilities; however, this causal relationship\nhas not been rigorously tested. Our research aims to verify which programming\nlanguages and features during pre-training affect logical inference\nperformance. Specifically, we pre-trained decoder-based language models from\nscratch using datasets from ten programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java)\nand three natural language datasets (Wikipedia, Fineweb, C4) under identical\nconditions. Thereafter, we evaluated the trained models in a few-shot\nin-context learning setting on logical reasoning tasks: FLD and bAbi, which do\nnot require commonsense or world knowledge. The results demonstrate that nearly\nall models trained with programming languages consistently outperform those\ntrained with natural languages, indicating that programming languages contain\nfactors that elicit logic inference performance. In addition, we found that\nmodels trained with programming languages exhibit a better ability to follow\ninstructions compared to those trained with natural languages. Further analysis\nreveals that the depth of Abstract Syntax Trees representing parsed results of\nprograms also affects logical reasoning performance. These findings will offer\ninsights into the essential elements of pre-training for acquiring the\nfoundational abilities of LLMs.",

A significant challenge in training LLMs for these formal\nlanguages is the lack of parallel datasets that align natural language with\nformal language proofs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a\nnovel framework for translating the Mathlib4 corpus (a unified library of\nmathematics in formal language Lean 4) into natural language. Building upon\nthis, we employ a dual augmentation strategy that combines tactic-based and\ninformal-based approaches, leveraging the Lean-jixia system, a Lean 4 analyzer.\nWe present the results of this pipeline on Mathlib4 as Herald (Hierarchy and\nRetrieval-based Translated Lean Dataset). We also propose the Herald\nTranslator, which is fine-tuned on Herald.

To address these challenges, we introduce SPLAT, a benchmark\nleveraging Situation Puzzles to evaluate and elicit LAteral Thinking of LLMs.\nThis benchmark, containing 975 graded situation puzzles across three difficulty\nlevels, employs a new multi-turn player-judge framework instead of the\ntraditional model-based evaluation, which often necessitates a stronger\nevaluation model. This framework simulates an interactive game where the model\n(player) asks the evaluation model (judge) questions about an incomplete story\nto infer the full scenario.

Furthermore, applying\ndata and reasoning processes from our benchmark to other lateral\nthinking-related benchmarks, e.g., RiddleSense and BrainTeaser, leads to\nperformance enhancements.

A promising\nfamily of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably\nthe family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown\npromise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the\nquantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models.

First, to address the issue that existing PCQA databases have a\nsmall scale and limited distortion levels, we establish the WPC5.0 database\nwhich is the first one dedicated to Octree-RAHT encoding mode with a scale of\n400 distorted point clouds (PCs) including 4 geometric multiplied by 5 attitude\ndistortion levels.

We first introduce two critical\nmetrics, named the quantization ratio ($Q_r$) and quantization block size\n($Q_b$). The former measures the number of parameters quantized to\nlow-precision arithmetic normalized by the total parameter count, whereas the\nlatter defines the number of values within a block that share a scaling factor,\nakin to the block size concept introduced in the FP4 format in NVIDIA's\nBlackwell architecture. Through extensive and carefully controlled experiments\nacross different models and quantization methods, we propose a unified scaling\nlaw on post-training quantization (PTQ) that can predict loss degeneration for\nvarying $Q_r$ and $Q_b$. For $Q_r$, our scaling law implies that parameter\nscaling and ratio scaling have a multiplicative relationship. Consequently,\nlarger models are more amenable to a higher quantization ratio $Q_r$, thus\nsupporting an increase in the adoption of mixed quantization for inference.\nRegarding $Q_b$, our findings indicate that a small block size, similar to that\nused in Blackwell, is not essential for large models.

The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion\nfeature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet\nuniversal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are\ncontent differences between features and the input image, such as the exact\nshape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent\ncharacteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this\nphenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that\nits negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually\nperceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall\nquality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the\ninformation drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy\ninput, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation\ntechniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a\npractical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of\na technique and provide an implementation of our methodology.

This raises a crucial question: Is it\npossible to guarantee strict constraint satisfaction in generated outputs while\npreserving the distribution of the original model as much as possible? We first\ndefine the ideal distribution - the one closest to the original model, which\nalso always satisfies the expressed constraint - as the ultimate goal of\nguaranteed generation. We then state a fundamental limitation, namely that it\nis impossible to reach that goal through autoregressive training alone. This\nmotivates the necessity of combining training-time and inference-time methods\nto enforce such guarantees. Based on this insight, we propose GUARD, a simple\nyet effective approach that combines an autoregressive proposal distribution\nwith rejection sampling. Through GUARD's theoretical properties, we show how\ncontrolling the KL divergence between a specific proposal and the target ideal\ndistribution simultaneously optimizes inference speed and distributional\ncloseness. To validate these theoretical concepts, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on two text generation settings with hard-to-satisfy constraints: a\nlexical constraint scenario and a sentiment reversal scenario. These\nexperiments show that GUARD achieves perfect constraint satisfaction while\nalmost preserving the ideal distribution with highly improved inference\nefficiency.

Consequently,\nensuring reliable offloading without QoS violations is challenging in\ndistributed and unreliable edge environments. However, current edge offloading\nsolutions are either centralized or do not adequately address challenges in\ndistributed environments. We propose FRESCO, a fast and reliable edge\noffloading framework that utilizes a blockchain-based reputation system, which\nenhances the reliability of offloading in the distributed edge. The distributed\nreputation system tracks the historical performance of edge servers, while\nblockchain through a consensus mechanism ensures that sensitive reputation\ninformation is secured against tampering. However, blockchain consensus\ntypically has high latency, and therefore we employ a Hybrid Smart Contract\n(HSC) that automatically computes and stores reputation securely on-chain\n(i.e., on the blockchain) while allowing fast offloading decisions off-chain\n(i.e., outside of blockchain). The offloading decision engine uses a reputation\nscore to derive fast offloading decisions, which are based on Satisfiability\nModulo Theory (SMT). The SMT models edge resource constraints, and QoS\ndeadlines, and can formally guarantee a feasible solution that is valuable for\nlatency-sensitive applications that require high reliability. With a\ncombination of on-chain HSC reputation state management and an off-chain SMT\ndecision engine, FRESCO offloads tasks to reliable servers without being\nhindered by blockchain consensus. We evaluate FRESCO against real availability\ntraces and simulated applications. FRESCO reduces response time by up to 7.86\ntimes and saves energy by up to 5.4% compared to all baselines while minimizing\nQoS violations to 0.4% and achieving an average decision time of 5.05\nmilliseconds.",

One way to deal with this issue is to\nschedule the function invocations in an energy-efficient way. However,\nefficient scheduling of applications in a multi-tenant environment, like FaaS\nsystems, poses significant challenges. The trade-off between the server's\nenergy usage and the hosted functions' performance requirements needs to be\ntaken into consideration. In this work, we propose an Energy Efficient\nScheduler for orchestrating the execution of serverless functions so that it\nminimizes energy consumption while it satisfies the applications' performance\ndemands. Our approach considers real-time performance measurements and\nhistorical data and applies a novel DVFS technique to minimize energy\nconsumption. Our detailed experimental evaluation using realistic workloads on\nour local cluster illustrates the working and benefits of our approach.",

The method utilizes an extremely lightweight (44 g) Compton camera\nMiniPIX TPX3. The compact size of the detector allows for deployment onboard\nsafe and agile small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed\nradiation mapping approach fuses measurements from multiple distributed Compton\ncamera sensors to accurately estimate the positions of multiple radioactive\nsources in real time. Unlike commonly used intensity-based detectors, the\nCompton camera reconstructs the set of possible directions towards a radiation\nsource from just a single ionizing particle. Therefore, the proposed approach\ncan localize radiation sources without having to estimate the gradient of a\nradiation field or contour lines, which require longer measurements. The\ninstant estimation is able to fully exploit the potential of highly mobile\nMAVs. The radiation mapping method is combined with an active search strategy,\nwhich coordinates the future actions of the MAVs in order to improve the\nquality of the estimate of the sources' positions, as well as to explore the\narea of interest faster. The proposed solution is evaluated in simulation and\nreal world experiments with multiple Cesium-137 radiation sources.",

This paper mainly focuses on\nthe discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method to solve index-2 IAEs. First, the\nconvergence theory of perturbed DG methods for first-kind VIEs is established,\nand then used to derive the optimal convergence properties of DG methods for\nindex-2 IAEs. It is shown that an $(m-1)$-th degree DG approximation exhibits\nglobal convergence of order~$m$ when~$m$ is odd, and of order~$m-1$ when~$m$ is\neven, for the first component~$x_1$ of the exact solution, corresponding to the\nsecond-kind VIE, whereas the convergence order is reduced by two for the second\ncomponent~$x_2$ of the exact solution, corresponding to the first-kind VIE.\nEach component also exhibits local superconvergence of one order higher\nwhen~$m$ is even. When~$m$ is odd, superconvergence occurs only if $x_1$\nsatisfies $x_1^{(m)}(0)=0$. Moreover, with this condition, we can extend the\nlocal superconvergence result for~$x_2$ to global superconvergence when~$m$ is\nodd. Note that in the DG method for an index-1 IAE, generally, the global\nsuperconvergence of the exact solution component corresponding to the\nsecond-kind VIE can only be obtained by iteration.

We\npropose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video\ndescriptions, which are optimized using DPO. To further improve training, we\nintroduce a novel multi-round DPO (mrDPO) approach, which involves periodically\nupdating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initializing the LoRA module\nas a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and\nincorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilize the\nprocess. To address potential catastrophic forgetting of non-captioning\nabilities due to mrDPO, we propose rebirth tuning, which finetunes the pre-DPO\nLLM by using the captions generated by the mrDPO-trained model as supervised\nlabels. Experiments show that mrDPO significantly enhances video-SALMONN 2's\ncaptioning accuracy, reducing global and local error rates by 40\\% and 20\\%,\nrespectively, while decreasing the repetition rate by 35\\%.

By applying the rigid shift approximation, we extend the calculations\nfrom zero- to finite-bias in a simple and computationally efficient manner,\nobtaining the bias-dependent electronic structure and current-versus-voltage\ncharacteristic curve in both the parallel and antiparallel configurations. In\nparticular, we find that dynamical electron correlation manifests as a\nreduction in the spin splitting of the Fe $3d_{z^2}$ state compared to DFT\npredictions and introduces a finite relaxation time. The impact of these\neffects on the transport properties, however, varies significantly between\nmagnetic configurations. In the parallel configuration, the characteristic\ncurves obtained with DFT and DMFT are similar, as the transport is mostly due\nto the coherent transmission of spin-up electrons through the MgO barrier.\nConversely, in the antiparallel configuration, correlation effects become more\nsignificant, with DMFT predicting a sharp current increase due to bias-driven\ninelastic electron-electron scattering. As a consequence, DMFT gives a lower\nbias threshold for the suppression of the tunneling magnetoresistance ratio\ncompared to DFT, matching experimental data more closely.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the characterization of equivariant linear layers for\nrepresentations of permutations and related groups. Unlike traditional\napproaches, which address these problems using parameter-sharing, we consider\nan alternative methodology based on irreducible representations and Schur's\nlemma. Using this methodology, we obtain an alternative derivation for existing\nmodels like DeepSets, 2-IGN graph equivariant networks, and Deep Weight Space\n(DWS) networks. The derivation for DWS networks is significantly simpler than\nthat of previous results.\n  Next, we extend our approach to unaligned symmetric sets, where equivariance\nto the wreath product of groups is required. Previous works have addressed this\nproblem in a rather restrictive setting, in which almost all wreath equivariant\nlayers are Siamese. In contrast, we give a full characterization of layers in\nthis case and show that there is a vast number of additional non-Siamese layers\nin some settings. We also show empirically that these additional non-Siamese\nlayers can improve performance in tasks like graph anomaly detection, weight\nspace alignment, and learning Wasserstein distances.

Typically, the model parameters are fully shared\nacross multiple timesteps to enhance training efficiency.

Understanding the key mechanisms that govern the formation,\npersistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions in social\ncommunities is a problem of paramount importance for a broad range of\nreal-world applications, spanning from preparedness for future emergencies to\npromotion of sustainable practices.

The first goal of this\nchapter is to introduce some of the main mathematical approaches for modeling\nsocial norms and conventions, including population models and agent-based\nmodels relying on the theories of dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, and\ngame theory. The second goal of the chapter is to illustrate how quantitative\nobservations and empirical data can be incorporated into these mathematical\nmodels in a systematic manner, establishing a data-based approach to\nmathematical modeling of formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms\nand conventions.

In this contribution, we\naddress the question of the suitability of UAV-based monitoring for SHM, in\nparticular focusing on the geometric deformation under load. Such an advanced\ntechnology is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to decrease the\ncost and risk of tedious traditional inspection methods. To this end, we\nperformed extensive tests employing a research reinforced concrete bridge that\ncan be exposed to a predefined load via ground anchors. Very high-resolution\nimage blocks have been captured before, during, and after the application of\ncontrolled loads. From those images, the motion of distinct points on the\nbridge has been monitored, and in addition, dense image point clouds were\ncomputed to evaluate the performance of surface-based data acquisition.\nMoreover, a geodetic control network in stable regions is used as control\ninformation for bundle adjustment. We applied different sensing technologies in\norder to be able to judge the image-based deformation results: displacement\ntransducers, tachymetry, and laser profiling. As a platform for the\nphotogrammetric measurements, a multi-rotor UAV DJI Matrice 600 Pro was\nemployed, equipped with two RTK-GNSS receivers. The mounted camera was a\nPhaseOne iXM-100 (100MP) with an 80 mm lens. With a flying height of 30 m above\nthe terrain, this resulted in a GSD of 1.3 mm while a forward and sideward\noverlap of 80% was maintained. The comparison with reference data (displacement\ntransducers) reveals a difference of less than 1 mm.

    "abstract": "A novel class of advanced algorithms, termed Goal-Conditioned Weighted\nSupervised Learning (GCWSL), has recently emerged to tackle the challenges\nposed by sparse rewards in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). GCWSL\nconsistently delivers strong performance across a diverse set of goal-reaching\ntasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and stability. However, GCWSL\nmethods lack a crucial capability known as trajectory stitching, which is\nessential for learning optimal policies when faced with unseen skills during\ntesting. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when the replay buffer\nis predominantly filled with sub-optimal trajectories. In contrast, traditional\nTD-based RL methods, such as Q-learning, which utilize Dynamic Programming, do\nnot face this issue but often experience instability due to the inherent\ndifficulties in value function approximation. In this paper, we propose\nQ-learning Weighted Supervised Learning (Q-WSL), a novel framework designed to\novercome the limitations of GCWSL by incorporating the strengths of Dynamic\nProgramming found in Q-learning. Q-WSL leverages Dynamic Programming results to\noutput the optimal action of (state, goal) pairs across different trajectories\nwithin the replay buffer. This approach synergizes the strengths of both\nQ-learning and GCWSL, effectively mitigating their respective weaknesses and\nenhancing overall performance. Empirical evaluations on challenging\ngoal-reaching tasks demonstrate that Q-WSL surpasses other goal-conditioned\napproaches in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Additionally,\nQ-WSL exhibits notable robustness in environments characterized by binary\nreward structures and environmental stochasticity.",

Replaying samples from earlier tasks has proven to be an\neffective method to mitigate the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge.\nHowever, the current research on the training efficiency of rehearsal-based\nmethods is insufficient, which limits the practical application of CL systems\nin resource-limited scenarios. The human visual system (HVS) exhibits varying\nsensitivities to different frequency components, enabling the efficient\nelimination of visually redundant information. Inspired by HVS, we propose a\nnovel framework called Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain (CLFD). To\nour knowledge, this is the first study to utilize frequency domain features to\nenhance the performance and efficiency of CL training on edge devices. For the\ninput features of the feature extractor, CLFD employs wavelet transform to map\nthe original input image into the frequency domain, thereby effectively\nreducing the size of input feature maps. Regarding the output features of the\nfeature extractor, CLFD selectively utilizes output features for distinct\nclasses for classification, thereby balancing the reusability and interference\nof output features based on the frequency domain similarity of the classes\nacross various tasks. Optimizing only the input and output features of the\nfeature extractor allows for seamless integration of CLFD with various\nrehearsal-based methods. Extensive experiments conducted in both cloud and edge\nenvironments demonstrate that CLFD consistently improves the performance of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both precision and training efficiency.\nSpecifically, CLFD can increase the accuracy of the SOTA CL method by up to\n6.83% and reduce the training time by 2.6$\\times$.",

Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically\ninvolve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although\nthese methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning\nerrors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel\npreference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which\ninjects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or\ncomputation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE\nuses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting\ndesigned subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their\ncorresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions\nobtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO\ntraining. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines\nthe training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference\nannotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with\npreference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0%\non GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples.

The point of view of the\ncourse is to provide an overview of the main results and questions in the\nsubject, with emphasis on the interaction with topology, geometry, specially\nsymplectic geometry and contact aspects of the theory.

During inflation, the PV term reduces the sound\nhorizon for right-handed circularly polarized GWs, and amplifies their power\nspectra relative to left-handed GWs. At CMB scales, these chiral GWs induce BB\nas well as non-vanishing EB and TB correlations in CMB, which are potentially\ndetectable by LiteBIRD. During reheating, subhorizon modes undergo tachyonic\ninstability, leading to fully circularly polarized GWs with enhanced\namplitudes, detectable through the resonant cavity experiment. The absence of\nbackreaction effect of enhanced chiral GWs imposes constraints on the energy\nscale of the PV term, the inflationary potential, and the reheating history.\nOur findings highlight the potential of multi-frequency GW experiments to offer\na unique probe of the parity violation and early Universe.",

    "abstract": "This article surveys and develops the use of simultaneous uniformization for\nthe study of chord-arc curves in the BMO Teichm\\\"uller space. The method of\nsimultaneous uniformization provides a unified complex-analytic framework in\nwhich chord-arc curves are parametrized by their BMO embeddings and the\nlogarithm of derivatives of these embeddings form a biholomorphic image in the\nBanach space of BMO functions. We review this correspondence and its\nconsequences, such as the relation to reparametrizations by strongly\nquasisymmetric homeomorphisms, in a rather self-contained manner in order to\nhighlight the coherence of the approach.\n  The main new contribution of this exposition concerns the Cauchy transform of\nBMO functions on a chord-arc curve. We show that the Cauchy transform is\nexpressed through the derivative of the biholomorphic map arising from\nsimultaneous uniformization, and consequently depends holomorphically on the\nvariation of the chord-arc curve. This result connects classical singular\nintegral operators with the complex structure of Teichm\\\"uller spaces and\nillustrates the effectiveness of the method.

Secondly, we establish a\n\"no-Mpemba theorem,\" a rigorous sufficient condition for the absence of MPEs,\nthereby identifying specific classes of systems devoid of these effects. Our\nfindings are exemplified using ferromagnetic Ising models and one-dimensional\nmultiparticle systems, demonstrating the practical applicability of our\ntheoretical advancements.",

    "abstract": "Traditional information theory provides a valuable foundation for\nReinforcement Learning, particularly through representation learning and\nentropy maximization for agent exploration. However, existing methods primarily\nconcentrate on modeling the uncertainty associated with RL's random variables,\nneglecting the inherent structure within the state and action spaces. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Structural Information principles-based Effective\nExploration framework, namely SI2E. Structural mutual information between two\nvariables is defined to address the single-variable limitation in structural\ninformation, and an innovative embedding principle is presented to capture\ndynamics-relevant state-action representations. The SI2E analyzes value\ndifferences in the agent's policy between state-action pairs and minimizes\nstructural entropy to derive the hierarchical state-action structure, referred\nto as the encoding tree. Under this tree structure, value-conditional\nstructural entropy is defined and maximized to design an intrinsic reward\nmechanism that avoids redundant transitions and promotes enhanced coverage in\nthe state-action space. Theoretical connections are established between SI2E\nand classical information-theoretic methodologies, highlighting our framework's\nrationality and advantage. Comprehensive evaluations in the MiniGrid,\nMetaWorld, and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks demonstrate that SI2E\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art exploration baselines regarding\nfinal performance and sample efficiency, with maximum improvements of 37.63%\nand 60.25%, respectively.",

Despite these advancements, achieving accurate matching in TVR remains\nchallenging due to inherent disparities between video and textual modalities\nand irregularities in data representation. In this paper, we propose\nText-Video-ProxyNet (TV-ProxyNet), a novel framework designed to decompose the\nconventional 1-to-N relationship of TVR into N distinct 1-to-1 relationships.\nBy replacing a single text query with a series of text proxies, TV-ProxyNet not\nonly broadens the query scope but also achieves a more precise expansion. Each\ntext proxy is crafted through a refined iterative process, controlled by\nmechanisms we term as the director and dash, which regulate the proxy's\ndirection and distance relative to the original text query. This setup not only\nfacilitates more precise semantic alignment but also effectively manages the\ndisparities and noise inherent in multimodal data. Our experiments on three\nrepresentative video-text retrieval benchmarks, MSRVTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet\nCaptions, demonstrate the effectiveness of TV-ProxyNet. The results show an\nimprovement of 2.0% to 3.3% in R@1 over the baseline.

Conventional schemes of entanglement distillation\naim to alleviate this problem by performing collective operations on multiple\ncopies of these decohered states and sacrificing some of them to recover Bell\npairs.

In qualitative analysis, Melnikov method is applied to analyze the\ninstability behavior of the perturbed heteroclinic orbit of the system, thus\nthe critical condition for the system to enter Smale horseshoe chaos, i.e., the\nMelnikov criterion, is obtained. The validity of the criterion is verified\nnumerically. In experimental studies, the existence of chaotic responses and\nthe route to chaos for granules-beam coupled vibrations is revealed. The\nexperimental results suggest that the system response first experiences\nsymmetry-breaking then undergoes a complete period-doubling cascade, and\nfinally enters single-scroll chaos. In addition, although the Additional\nDynamic Load (ADL) generated by granular media is highly complicated, a general\nand simple evolution pattern of the chaos threshold is found by parametric\nexperiments, which is also supported by the Melnikov criterion. In short, the\nchaotic dynamics of granules-beam coupled vibration is revealed, which is a\ncontribution to the engineering vibration aspect. On the theoretical side, an\nimpressive result lies in that for the first time, the Melnikov criterion of\nsuch fractional-order...",

From signal and image processing to inverse problems\nin data science, this question has been at the center of many applications.\nLately, with the success of models and methods relying on deep neural networks,\nthere has been a multiplication of different algorithms and recovery results.\nComparing the performance of recovery algorithms becomes a complex task without\na unifying framework. In this article, as a first step for the study of general\nalgorithms for low-dimensional recovery, we study a class of generalized\nprojected gradient descent algorithms that can recover a given low-dimensional\nmodel with linear rates. The obtained rates decouple the impact of the quality\nof the measurements with respect to the model from the geometry of the\nproperties of the chosen generalized projection: we can directly measure\nperformance through a restricted Lipschitz constant of the projection with\nrespect to the low dimensional model. By optimizing this constant, we define an\noptimal generalized projected gradient descent. Our general approach provides\nan optimality result in the case of sparse recovery. Moreover, our framework\nallows for a common interpretation of linear rates of recovery in the context\nof both sparse models and models induced by some ``plug-and-play'' imaging\nmethods that rely on deep neural networks.

    "abstract": "Speech is usually used for constructing an automatic Alzheimer's dementia\n(AD) detection system, as the acoustic and linguistic abilities show a decline\nin people living with AD at the early stages. However, speech includes not only\nAD-related local and global information but also other information unrelated to\ncognitive status, such as age and gender. In this paper, we propose a\nspeech-based system named Swin-BERT for automatic dementia detection. For the\nacoustic part, the shifted windows multi-head attention that proposed to\nextract local and global information from images, is used for designing our\nacoustic-based system. To decouple the effect of age and gender on acoustic\nfeature extraction, they are used as an extra input of the designed acoustic\nsystem. For the linguistic part, the rhythm-related information, which varies\nsignificantly between people living with and without AD, is removed while\ntranscribing the audio recordings into transcripts. To compensate for the\nremoved rhythm-related information, the character-level transcripts are\nproposed to be used as the extra input of a word-level BERT-style system.\nFinally, the Swin-BERT combines the acoustic features learned from our proposed\nacoustic-based system with our linguistic-based system. The experiments are\nbased on the two datasets provided by the international dementia detection\nchallenges: the ADReSS and ADReSSo. The results show that both the proposed\nacoustic and linguistic systems can be better or comparable with previous\nresearch on the two datasets.

While La4Ni3O10 exhibits nearly 100%\nsuperconductivity with Tc~30 K under high pressure, magnetic susceptibility\nstudies on La3Ni2O7-${\\delta}$, however, reveal a more complex picture,\nindicating either filamentary superconductivity or that approximately 50% of\ncrystal phase becomes superconducting in polycrystalline samples. In this\nstudy, we employed scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy to\nvisualize nanoscale structural phase separation in La3Ni2O7-${\\delta}$,\nidentifying enhanced optical conductivity with stripes approximately 183 nm\nwide. These stripes run diagonally with respect to the Ni-O-Ni bond directions\nin the a-b plane, ruling out the possibility that they arise from impurity\nphases, like the '1313', '214' or '4310' structures. The dark regions and\nbright stripes exhibit optical conductivities ~ 22% and 29% of gold's,\nrespectively. Additionally, we find that the bright stripes constitute about\n38% of the total field of view, while the remainder consists of dark regions\nand the transitional region between dark regions and bright stripes. Our\nresults suggest that optical conductivity stripes originate from nanoscale\nstructural phase separation. In contrast, La4Ni3O10 exhibits uniform and higher\noptical conductivity with no observable evidence of phase separation. Thus, our\nstudy represents a pioneering effort to directly image nanoscale phase\nseparation in Lan+1NinO3n+1 nickelates. This observation could provide crucial\ninsights into the factors that limit the superconducting volume fraction of\nLa3Ni2O7-${\\delta}$, highlighting SNOM as a powerful probe for exploring\nnanoscale low-energy physics in correlated quantum materials.",

    "abstract": "Recent approaches attempt to adapt powerful interactive segmentation models,\nsuch as SAM, to interactive matting and fine-tune the models based on synthetic\nmatting datasets. However, models trained on synthetic data fail to generalize\nto complex and occlusion scenes. We address this challenge by proposing a new\nmatting dataset based on the COCO dataset, namely COCO-Matting. Specifically,\nthe construction of our COCO-Matting includes accessory fusion and\nmask-to-matte, which selects real-world complex images from COCO and converts\nsemantic segmentation masks to matting labels. The built COCO-Matting comprises\nan extensive collection of 38,251 human instance-level alpha mattes in complex\nnatural scenarios. Furthermore, existing SAM-based matting methods extract\nintermediate features and masks from a frozen SAM and only train a lightweight\nmatting decoder by end-to-end matting losses, which do not fully exploit the\npotential of the pre-trained SAM. Thus, we propose SEMat which revamps the\nnetwork architecture and training objectives. For network architecture, the\nproposed feature-aligned transformer learns to extract fine-grained edge and\ntransparency features. The proposed matte-aligned decoder aims to segment\nmatting-specific objects and convert coarse masks into high-precision mattes.\nFor training objectives, the proposed regularization and trimap loss aim to\nretain the prior from the pre-trained model and push the matting logits\nextracted from the mask decoder to contain trimap-based semantic information.\nExtensive experiments across seven diverse datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our method, proving its efficacy in interactive natural image\nmatting.

Chatbot developers may\nexploit such information to infer personal information and link users across\ngroups, potentially leading to data breaches, pervasive tracking, or targeted\nadvertising. Our analysis of conversation datasets shows that (1) chatbots\noften access far more messages than needed, and (2) when a user joins a new\ngroup with chatbots, there is a 3.6% chance that at least one of the chatbots\ncan recognize and associate the user with their previous interactions in other\ngroups.

This\npaper introduces SnoopGuard, a secure group messaging protocol that ensures\nuser privacy against chatbots while maintaining strong end-to-end security. Our\nprotocol offers (1) selective message access, preventing chatbots from\naccessing unrelated messages, and (2) sender anonymity, hiding user identities\nfrom chatbots. SnoopGuard achieves $O(\\log n + m)$ message-sending complexity\nfor a group of $n$ users and $m$ chatbots, compared to $O(\\log(n + m))$ in SoA\nprotocols, with acceptable overhead for enhanced privacy.

Our method\nspecializes in using a deep learning-based probabilistic model to estimate the\nShannon's entropy of the point cloud information, i.e., geometric attributes of\nthe 3D floating points. Once the entropy of the point cloud dataset is\nestimated with a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE), we use the\nlearned CVAE model to compress the geometric attributes of the point clouds\nwith the bits-back coding technique. The novelty of our method with bits-back\ncoding specializes in utilizing the learned latent variable model of the CVAE\nto compress the point cloud data. By using bits-back coding, we can capture the\npotential correlation between the data points, such as similar spatial features\nlike shapes and scattering regions, into the lower-dimensional latent space to\nfurther reduce the compression ratio. The main insight of our method is that we\ncan achieve a competitive compression ratio as conventional deep learning-based\napproaches, while significantly reducing the overhead cost of storage and/or\ncommunicating the compression codec, making our approach more applicable in\npractical scenarios. Throughout comprehensive evaluations, we found that the\ncost for the overhead is significantly small, compared to the reduction of the\ncompression ratio when compressing large point cloud datasets. Experiment\nresults show that our proposed approach can achieve a compression ratio of 1.56\nbit-per-point on average, which is significantly lower than the baseline\napproach such as Google's Draco with a compression ratio of 1.83 bit-per-point.",

    "abstract": "The inversion of diffusion model sampling, which aims to find the\ncorresponding initial noise of a sample, plays a critical role in various\ntasks. Recently, several heuristic exact inversion samplers have been proposed\nto address the inexact inversion issue in a training-free manner. However, the\ntheoretical properties of these heuristic samplers remain unknown and they\noften exhibit mediocre sampling quality. In this paper, we introduce a generic\nformulation, \\emph{Bidirectional Explicit Linear Multi-step} (BELM) samplers,\nof the exact inversion samplers, which includes all previously proposed\nheuristic exact inversion samplers as special cases. The BELM formulation is\nderived from the variable-stepsize-variable-formula linear multi-step method\nvia integrating a bidirectional explicit constraint. We highlight this\nbidirectional explicit constraint is the key of mathematically exact inversion.\nWe systematically investigate the Local Truncation Error (LTE) within the BELM\nframework and show that the existing heuristic designs of exact inversion\nsamplers yield sub-optimal LTE. Consequently, we propose the Optimal BELM\n(O-BELM) sampler through the LTE minimization approach. We conduct additional\nanalysis to substantiate the theoretical stability and global convergence\nproperty of the proposed optimal sampler. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nour O-BELM sampler establishes the exact inversion property while achieving\nhigh-quality sampling. Additional experiments in image editing and image\ninterpolation highlight the extensive potential of applying O-BELM in varying\napplications.",

In this paper, we analyze a\nbenchmark Markovian model of an inventory-constrained platform, where arriving\ncustomers book listings that are limited in supply. We focus on the commonly\nused frequentist hypothesis testing approach for making launch decisions based\non data from customer-randomized experiments, and we study the impact of\ninterference on (1) false positive probability and (2) statistical power.\n  We obtain three main findings. First, we show that for *sign-consistent*\ntreatments -- i.e., those where the treatment changes booking probabilities in\nthe same direction relative to control for all states of inventory availability\n-- the false positive probability of a test statistic using the standard\ndifference-in-means estimator with a corresponding na\\\"ive variance estimator\nis correctly controlled.

We derive an analytical\nexpression for the instability thresholds of low-frequency QBs, which converges\nto the known results of monoatomic chains as the bandgap approaches zero. The\nexpression reveals an inverse square relationship between instability\nthresholds and system size, as well as a quadratic dependence on the mass\ndifference, both of which have been corroborated through extensive numerical\nsimulations. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a bandgap can\nmarkedly enhance QB stability, providing a novel theoretical foundation and\npractical framework for controlling energy transport between modes in complex\nlattice systems.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents need to explore their environment to learn\noptimal behaviors and achieve maximum rewards. However, exploration can be\nrisky when training RL directly on real systems, while simulation-based\ntraining introduces the tricky issue of the sim-to-real gap. Recent approaches\nhave leveraged safety filters, such as control barrier functions (CBFs), to\npenalize unsafe actions during RL training. However, the strong safety\nguarantees of CBFs rely on a precise dynamic model. In practice, uncertainties\nalways exist, including internal disturbances from the errors of dynamics and\nexternal disturbances such as wind. In this work, we propose a new safe RL\nframework based on disturbance rejection-guarded learning, which allows for an\nalmost model-free RL with an assumed but not necessarily precise nominal\ndynamic model. We demonstrate our results on the Safety-gym benchmark for Point\nand Car robots on all tasks where we can outperform state-of-the-art approaches\nthat use only residual model learning or a disturbance observer (DOB).

During the instrument calibration, having open loop\nfast tools with a large capture range are necessary to quickly assess the\nsystem misalignment and to drive it towards a state allowing to close the AO\nloop. During operation, complex systems are prone to misalignments (mechanical\nflexions, rotation of optical elements, etc.) that potentially degrade the AO\nperformances, creating a need for a monitoring tool to tackle their driftage.\nIn this work, we first present an improved perturbative method to quickly\nassess large lateral errors in open loop. It uses the spatial correlation of\nthe measured interaction matrix of a limited number of 2D spatial modes with a\nsynthetic model. Then, we introduce a novel solution to finely measure and\ncorrect these lateral errors via the closed loop telemetry. Non-perturbative,\nthis method consequently does not impact the science output of the instrument.\nIt is based on the temporal correlation of 2D spatial frequencies in the\ndeformable mirror commands. It is model-free (no need of an interaction matrix\nmodel) and sparse in the Fourier space, making it fast and easily scalable to\ncomplex systems such as future extremely large telescopes. Finally, we present\nsome results obtained on the development bench of the GRAVITY+ extreme AO\nsystem (Cartesian grid, 1432 actuators). In addition, we show with on-sky\nresults gathered with CHARA and GRAVITY/CIAO that the method is adaptable to\nnon-conventional AO geometries (hexagonal grids, 60 actuators).",

    "abstract": "Deploying large and complex deep neural networks on resource-constrained edge\ndevices poses significant challenges due to their computational demands and the\ncomplexities of non-convex optimization. Traditional compression methods such\nas distillation and pruning often retain non-convexity that complicates\nfine-tuning in real-time on such devices. Moreover, these methods often\nnecessitate extensive end-to-end network fine-tuning after compression to\npreserve model performance, which is not only time-consuming but also requires\nfully annotated datasets, thus potentially negating the benefits of efficient\nnetwork compression. In this paper, we introduce a novel distillation technique\nthat efficiently compresses the model via convex optimization -- eliminating\nintermediate non-convex activation functions and using only intermediate\nactivations from the original model. Our approach enables distillation in a\nlabel-free data setting and achieves performance comparable to the original\nmodel without requiring any post-compression fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for image classification models on multiple\nstandard datasets, and further show that in the data limited regime, our method\ncan outperform standard non-convex distillation approaches. Our method promises\nsignificant advantages for deploying high-efficiency, low-footprint models on\nedge devices, making it a practical choice for real-world applications. We show\nthat convex neural networks, when provided with rich feature representations\nfrom a large pre-trained non-convex model, can achieve performance comparable\nto their non-convex counterparts, opening up avenues for future research at the\nintersection of convex optimization and deep learning.",

To the best of\nour knowledge, most of the earlier computations in this context have been done\nin the linear order in curvature, which may not be very suitable for the Ricci\nflat spacetimes. One of our objectives is to see whether the higher order terms\ncan bring in qualitatively new physical effects, and thereby attempting to fill\nin this gap in the literature. We use Bunch and Parker's local momentum space\nrepresentation of the Schwinger-DeWitt expansion of the Feynman propagator.\nSuch expansion, being based upon the local Lorentz symmetry of spacetime,\nessentially probes the leading curvature correction to short scale, ultraviolet\nquantum processes. We compute the renormalised, background spacetime curvature\n(up to quadratic order) and temperature dependent one loop effective potential\nfor $\\phi^4$ plus $\\phi^3$ self interaction. In particular for the de Sitter\nspacetime, we have shown for the $\\phi^4$-theory that we can have SSB even with\na positive rest mass squared and positive non-minimal coupling, at zero\ntemperature. This cannot be achieved by the linear curvature term alone and the\nresult remains valid for a very large range of renormalisation scale. Such SSB\nwill generate a field mass that depends upon the spacetime curvature as well as\nthe non-minimal coupling. For a phase transition, we have computed the leading\ncurvature correction to the critical temperature. At finite temperature,\nsymmetry restoration is demonstrated. We also extend some of the above results\nto two loop level. The symmetry breaking in de Sitter at two loop remains\npresent. We have further motivated the necessity of treating this problem\nnon-perturbatively in some instances.",

Most KD methods aim to\ntransfer dark knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model to a lightweight\nstudent model based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss. However, the\nstudent performance improvements achieved through KD exhibit diminishing\nmarginal returns, where a stronger teacher model does not necessarily lead to a\nproportionally stronger student model. To address this issue, we empirically\nfind that the KL-based KD method may implicitly change the inter-class\nrelationships learned by the student model, resulting in a more complex and\nambiguous decision boundary, which in turn reduces the model's accuracy and\ngeneralization ability. Therefore, this study argues that the student model\nshould learn not only the probability values from the teacher's output but also\nthe relative ranking of classes, and proposes a novel Correlation Matching\nKnowledge Distillation (CMKD) method that combines the Pearson and Spearman\ncorrelation coefficients-based KD loss to achieve more efficient and robust\ndistillation from a stronger teacher model. Moreover, considering that samples\nvary in difficulty, CMKD dynamically adjusts the weights of the Pearson-based\nloss and Spearman-based loss.

    "abstract": "Large-scale multimodal models have shown excellent performance over a series\nof tasks powered by the large corpus of paired multimodal training data.\nGenerally, they are always assumed to receive modality-complete inputs.\nHowever, this simple assumption may not always hold in the real world due to\nprivacy constraints or collection difficulty, where models pretrained on\nmodality-complete data easily demonstrate degraded performance on\nmissing-modality cases. To handle this issue, we refer to prompt learning to\nadapt large pretrained multimodal models to handle missing-modality scenarios\nby regarding different missing cases as different types of input. Instead of\nonly prepending independent prompts to the intermediate layers, we present to\nleverage the correlations between prompts and input features and excavate the\nrelationships between different layers of prompts to carefully design the\ninstructions. We also incorporate the complementary semantics of different\nmodalities to guide the prompting design for each modality. Extensive\nexperiments on three commonly-used datasets consistently demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method compared to the previous approaches upon different\nmissing scenarios. Plentiful ablations are further given to show the\ngeneralizability and reliability of our method upon different modality-missing\nratios and types.",

These benchmarks introduce new challenges to core\ncapabilities such as perception, reasoning, and planning. However, existing\nmultimodal benchmarks fall short in providing a focused evaluation of\nmulti-step planning based on spatial relationships in images. To bridge this\ngap, we present ING-VP, the first INteractive Game-based Vision Planning\nbenchmark, specifically designed to evaluate the spatial imagination and\nmulti-step reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ING-VP features 6 distinct games,\nencompassing 300 levels, each with 6 unique configurations. A single model\nengages in over 60,000 rounds of interaction. The benchmark framework allows\nfor multiple comparison settings, including image-text vs. text-only inputs,\nsingle-step vs. multi-step reasoning, and with-history vs. without-history\nconditions, offering valuable insights into the model's capabilities. We\nevaluated numerous state-of-the-art MLLMs, with the highest-performing model,\nClaude-3.5 Sonnet, achieving an average accuracy of only 3.37%, far below the\nanticipated standard. This work aims to provide a specialized evaluation\nframework to drive advancements in MLLMs' capacity for complex spatial\nreasoning and planning.

One key reason is\ndataflow in executing a DNN layer, including on-chip data partitioning,\ncomputation parallelism, and scheduling policy, which have large impacts on\nlatency and energy consumption. Unlike prior works that required considerable\nefforts from HW engineers to design suitable dataflows for different DNNs, this\nwork proposes an efficient data-centric approach, named Dataflow Code\nPropagation (DCP), to automatically find the optimal dataflow for DNN layers in\nseconds without human effort. It has several attractive benefits that prior\narts do not have. (i) We translate the HW dataflow configuration into a code\nrepresentation in a unified dataflow coding space, which can be optimized by\nbackpropagating gradients given a DNN layer or network. (ii) DCP learns a\nneural predictor to efficiently update the dataflow codes towards the desired\ngradient directions to minimize various optimization objectives e.g., latency\nand energy. (iii) It can be easily generalized to unseen HW configurations in a\nzero-shot or few-shot learning manner. For example, without using additional\ntraining data, DCP surpasses the GAMMA method that performs a full search using\nthousands of samples. Extensive experiments on several representative models\nsuch as MobileNet, ResNet, and ViT show that DCP outperforms its counterparts\nin various settings.",

IntrinsicVoice aims to facilitate the\ntransfer of textual capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to the speech modality by\nmitigating the modality gap between text and speech. Our novelty architecture,\nGroupFormer, can reduce speech sequences to lengths comparable to text\nsequences while generating high-quality audio, significantly reducing the\nlength difference between speech and text, speeding up inference, and\nalleviating long-text modeling issues. Additionally, we construct a multi-turn\nspeech-to-speech dialogue dataset named \\method-500k which includes nearly 500k\nturns of speech-to-speech dialogues, and a cross-modality training strategy to\nenhance the semantic alignment between speech and text. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that IntrinsicVoice can generate high-quality speech response with\nlatency lower than 100ms in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.

Most detectors for identifying model-generated text are limited by\ntheir reliance on variance in perplexity and burstiness, and they require\nsubstantial computational resources. In this paper, we proposed a watermarking\nmethod embedding a specific watermark into the text during its generation by\nLLMs, based on a pre-defined signal pattern. This technique not only ensures\nthe watermark's invisibility to humans but also maintains the quality and\ngrammatical integrity of model-generated text. We utilize LLMs and Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) for token probability computation and detection of the signal\nwatermark. The unique application of signal processing principles within the\nrealm of text generation by LLMs allows for subtle yet effective embedding of\nwatermarks, which do not compromise the quality or coherence of the generated\ntext. Our method has been empirically validated across multiple LLMs,\nconsistently maintaining high detection accuracy, even with variations in\ntemperature settings during text generation. In the experiment of\ndistinguishing between human-written and watermarked text, our method achieved\nan AUROC score of 0.97, significantly outperforming existing methods like\nGPTZero, which scored 0.64.

By integrating an electropolymerized molecularly\nimprinted polymer specific to cortisol (cort-eMIP) on a\nporous-laser-engraved-graphene (PLEG) working electrode, the saliva-floss\nplatform shows a detection range of 0.10-10000 pg mL-1 (R2 = 0.9916) with a\ndetection limit of 0.023 pg mL-1 for cortisol (in buffer medium). The\nsaliva-sensing dental floss provides results within 5 minutes. The thread-based\nmicrofluidic design minimizes interference and ensures consistent repeatability\nwhen testing artificial and actual human saliva samples, yielding 98.64 to\n102.4 percent recoveries with a relative standard deviation of 5.01%,\ndemonstrating high accuracy and precision. Validated using human saliva samples\nin a stress study, it showed a high correlation (r= 0.9910) with conventional\nELISA assays. Combined with a wireless readout, this saliva floss offers a\nconvenient way to monitor daily stress levels and can be extended to detect\nother critical salivary biomarkers.",

Although several settings are proposed to study the C-GCD task, they\nhave limitations that do not reflect real-world scenarios. We thus study a more\npractical C-GCD setting, which includes more new classes to be discovered over\na longer period, without storing samples of past classes. In C-GCD, the model\nis initially trained on labeled data of known classes, followed by multiple\nincremental stages where the model is fed with unlabeled data containing both\nold and new classes. The core challenge involves two conflicting objectives:\ndiscover new classes and prevent forgetting old ones. We delve into the\nconflicts and identify that models are susceptible to prediction bias and\nhardness bias. To address these issues, we introduce a debiased learning\nframework, namely Happy, characterized by Hardness-aware prototype sampling and\nsoft entropy regularization. For the prediction bias, we first introduce\nclustering-guided initialization to provide robust features. In addition, we\npropose soft entropy regularization to assign appropriate probabilities to new\nclasses, which can significantly enhance the clustering performance of new\nclasses. For the harness bias, we present the hardness-aware prototype\nsampling, which can effectively reduce the forgetting issue for previously seen\nclasses, especially for difficult classes. Experimental results demonstrate our\nmethod proficiently manages the conflicts of C-GCD and achieves remarkable\nperformance across various datasets, e.g., 7.5% overall gains on ImageNet-100.\nOur code is publicly available at https://github.com/mashijie1028/Happy-CGCD.",

In this paper, we introduce the\nnotion of a multivariate quasi-stationary subdivision scheme and fully\ncharacterize its convergence and smoothness. We will also discuss the general\nprocedure of designing interpolatory masks with short support that yields\nsmooth quasi-stationary subdivision schemes. Specifically, using the dyadic\ndilation of both triangular and quadrilateral meshes, for each smoothness\nexponent $m=1,2$, we obtain examples of $C^m$-convergent quasi-stationary\n$2I_2$-subdivision schemes with bivariate symmetric masks having at most\n$m$-ring stencils.

This is critical because CAVs\nnot only interact with their environment but are also integral parts of it.\nInsufficient exploration can result in policies that carry latent risks,\nhighlighting the need for methods that explore the environment both extensively\nand efficiently. This work introduces OPTIMA, a novel distributed reinforcement\nlearning framework for cooperative autonomous vehicle tasks. OPTIMA alternates\nbetween thorough data sampling from environmental interactions and multi-agent\nreinforcement learning algorithms to optimize CAV cooperation, emphasizing both\nsafety and efficiency. Our goal is to improve the generality and performance of\nCAVs in highly complex and crowded scenarios. Furthermore, the industrial-scale\ndistributed training system easily adapts to different algorithms, reward\nfunctions, and strategies.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL), integrating group fairness mechanisms, allows\nmultiple clients to collaboratively train a global model that makes unbiased\ndecisions for different populations grouped by sensitive attributes (e.g.,\ngender and race). Due to its distributed nature, previous studies have\ndemonstrated that FL systems are vulnerable to model poisoning attacks.\nHowever, these studies primarily focus on perturbing accuracy, leaving a\ncritical question unexplored: Can an attacker bypass the group fairness\nmechanisms in FL and manipulate the global model to be biased? The motivations\nfor such an attack vary; an attacker might seek higher accuracy, yet fairness\nconsiderations typically limit the accuracy of the global model or aim to cause\nethical disruption. To address this question, we design a novel form of attack\nin FL, termed Profit-driven Fairness Attack (PFATTACK), which aims not to\ndegrade global model accuracy but to bypass fairness mechanisms. Our\nfundamental insight is that group fairness seeks to weaken the dependence of\noutputs on input attributes related to sensitive information. In the proposed\nPFATTACK, an attacker can recover this dependence through local fine-tuning\nacross various sensitive groups, thereby creating a biased yet\naccuracy-preserving malicious model and injecting it into FL through model\nreplacement. Compared to attacks targeting accuracy, PFATTACK is more stealthy.\nThe malicious model in PFATTACK exhibits subtle parameter variations relative\nto the original global model, making it robust against detection and filtering\nby Byzantine-resilient aggregations. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets are conducted for four fair FL frameworks and three\nByzantine-resilient aggregations against model poisoning, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and stealth of PFATTACK in bypassing group fairness mechanisms in\nFL.",

In this paper, we propose a parametric CSI feedback technique for\nmmWave massive MIMO systems. Key idea of the proposed technique is to compress\nthe mmWave MIMO channel matrix into a few geometric channel parameters (e.g.,\nangles, delays, and path gains). Due to the limited scattering of mmWave\nsignal, the number of channel parameters is much smaller than the number of\nantennas, thereby reducing the CSI feedback overhead significantly. Moreover,\nby exploiting the deep learning (DL) technique for the channel parameter\nextraction and the MIMO channel reconstruction, we can effectively suppress the\nchannel quantization error. From the numerical results, we demonstrate that the\nproposed technique outperforms the conventional CSI feedback techniques in\nterms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER).",

    "abstract": "In the times we live in today, humanity faces unprecedented environmental\nchallenges. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new doors\nin our collective efforts to address our planet's pressing problems; however,\nmany have doubts on the actual extent of impact that AI have on the\nenvironment. In particular, AI also assisting dirty production is a drawback\nthat is largely absent from the literature. To investigate the impact of AI on\nthe environment, we establish mathematical models to model the economy and the\nproduction process of goods based on outdated and advanced technologies. The\nsecondary results are stated in the form of lemmas, the main results are stated\nin the form of theorems. From the theorems we conclude that AI may not on its\nown prevent an environmental disaster, a reason of which is its concurrent\ncontribution to dirty production. With temporary government intervention,\nhowever, AI is able to avert an environmental disaster.",

It was introduced by Moore [arXiv: 9903046] as a quantum counterpart of\n$\\mathrm{AC}^0$, along with the conjecture that $\\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits can\nnot compute PARITY. In this work we make progress on this longstanding\nconjecture: we show that any depth-$d$ $\\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit requires\n$n^{1+3^{-d}}$ ancillae to compute a function with approximate degree\n$\\Theta(n)$, which includes PARITY, MAJORITY and $\\mathrm{MOD}_k$. We further\nestablish superlinear lower bounds on quantum state synthesis and quantum\nchannel synthesis. This is the first superlinear lower bound on the\nsuper-linear sized $\\mathrm{QAC}^0$. Regarding PARITY, we show that any further\nimprovement on the size of ancillae to $n^{1+\\exp(-o(d))}$ would imply that\nPARITY $\\not\\in$ QAC0. These lower bounds are derived by giving low-degree\napproximations to $\\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits. We show that a depth-$d$\n$\\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit with $a$ ancillae, when applied to low-degree\noperators, has a degree $(n+a)^{1-3^{-d}}$ polynomial approximation in the\nspectral norm. This implies that the class $\\mathrm{QLC}^0$, corresponding to\nlinear size $\\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits, has approximate degree $o(n)$. This is a\nquantum generalization of the result that $\\mathrm{LC}^0$ circuits have\napproximate degree $o(n)$ by Bun, Robin, and Thaler [SODA 2019].

In our\nprevious work, we obtained an asymptotically tight upper bound via its\nconnection to the joints problem, a problem in incidence geometry.

The key idea is to\nencode the graph-theoretic problem with new kinds of joints that we call\nhypergraph joints. Our main theorem is a generalization of the joints theorem\nthat upper bounds the number of hypergraph joints, which the partial shadow\nphenomenon immediately follows from.

To address this question and these\nchallenges, we first analyze user access patterns at Meta and find that most\nuser model inferences occur within a short timeframe.

In this paper, we study the circuits\nimplemented by Gemma 2B for solving the subject-verb agreement task across two\ndifferent languages, English and Spanish. We discover that both circuits are\nhighly consistent, being mainly driven by a particular attention head writing a\n`subject number' signal to the last residual stream, which is read by a small\nset of neurons in the final MLPs. Notably, this subject number signal is\nrepresented as a direction in the residual stream space, and is\nlanguage-independent. We demonstrate that this direction has a causal effect on\nthe model predictions, effectively flipping the Spanish predicted verb number\nby intervening with the direction found in English.

    "abstract": "The challenge of automatically synthesizing high-quality vector fonts,\nparticularly for writing systems (e.g., Chinese) consisting of huge amounts of\ncomplex glyphs, remains unsolved. Existing font synthesis techniques fall into\ntwo categories: 1) methods that directly generate vector glyphs, and 2) methods\nthat initially synthesize glyph images and then vectorize them. However, the\nfirst category often fails to construct complete and correct shapes for complex\nglyphs, while the latter struggles to efficiently synthesize high-resolution\n(i.e., 1024 $\\times$ 1024 or higher) glyph images while preserving local\ndetails. In this paper, we introduce HFH-Font, a few-shot font synthesis method\ncapable of efficiently generating high-resolution glyph images that can be\nconverted into high-quality vector glyphs. More specifically, our method\nemploys a diffusion model-based generative framework with component-aware\nconditioning to learn different levels of style information adaptable to\nvarying input reference sizes. We also design a distillation module based on\nScore Distillation Sampling for 1-step fast inference, and a style-guided\nsuper-resolution module to refine and upscale low-resolution synthesis results.\nExtensive experiments, including a user study with professional font designers,\nhave been conducted to demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nexisting font synthesis approaches. Experimental results show that our method\nproduces high-fidelity, high-resolution raster images which can be vectorized\ninto high-quality vector fonts. Using our method, for the first time,\nlarge-scale Chinese vector fonts of a quality comparable to those manually\ncreated by professional font designers can be automatically generated.",

    "abstract": "A natural variant of the classical online $k$-server problem is the Weighted\n$k$-server problem, where the cost of moving a server is its weight times the\ndistance through which it moves. Despite its apparent simplicity, the weighted\n$k$-server problem is extremely poorly understood. Specifically, even on\nuniform metric spaces, finding the optimum competitive ratio of randomized\nalgorithms remains an open problem -- the best upper bound known is\n$2^{2^{k+O(1)}}$ due to a deterministic algorithm (Bansal et al., 2018), and\nthe best lower bound known is $\\Omega(2^k)$ (Ayyadevara and Chiplunkar, 2021).\n  With the aim of closing this exponential gap between the upper and lower\nbounds, we propose a decomposition approach for designing a randomized\nalgorithm for weighted $k$-server on uniform metrics. Our first contribution\nincludes two relaxed versions of the problem and a technique to obtain an\nalgorithm for weighted $k$-server from algorithms for the two relaxed versions.\nSpecifically, we prove that if there exists an $\\alpha_1$-competitive algorithm\nfor one version (which we call Weighted $k$-Server - Service Pattern\nConstruction (W$k$S-SPC) and there exists an $\\alpha_2$-competitive algorithm\nfor the other version (which we call Weighted $k$-server - Revealed Service\nPattern (W$k$S-RSP)), then there exists an $(\\alpha_1\\alpha_2)$-competitive\nalgorithm for weighted $k$-server on uniform metric spaces. Our second\ncontribution is a $2^{O(k^2)}$-competitive randomized algorithm for W$k$S-RSP.\nAs a consequence, the task of designing a $2^{poly(k)}$-competitive randomized\nalgorithm for weighted $k$-server on uniform metrics reduces to designing a\n$2^{poly(k)}$-competitive randomized algorithm for W$k$S-SPC. Finally, we also\nprove that the $\\Omega(2^k)$ lower bound for weighted $k$-server, in fact,\nholds for W$k$S-RSP.",

Specifically, we first\ndesign a two-level alignment strategy to pre-condense the original graph into a\nsmall yet utility-preserving dataset. Upon receiving an unlearning request, we\nfine-tune the pre-condensed data with a low-rank plugin, to directly align its\ndistribution with the remaining graph, thus efficiently revoking the\ninformation of deleted data without accessing them. A novel similarity\ndistribution matching approach and a discrimination regularizer are proposed to\neffectively transfer condensed data and preserve its utility in GNN training,\nrespectively.

LF images inherently possess rich spatial and angular information.\nNonetheless, there is a scarcity of DA methodologies explicitly tailored for LF\nimages, and existing works tend to concentrate solely on either the spatial or\nangular domain. This paper proposes a novel spatial and angular DA strategy\nnamed MaskBlur for LF image SR by concurrently addressing spatial and angular\naspects. MaskBlur consists of spatial blur and angular dropout two components.\nSpatial blur is governed by a spatial mask, which controls where pixels are\nblurred, i.e., pasting pixels between the low-resolution and high-resolution\ndomains. The angular mask is responsible for angular dropout, i.e., selecting\nwhich views to perform the spatial blur operation. By doing so, MaskBlur\nenables the model to treat pixels differently in the spatial and angular\ndomains when super-resolving LF images rather than blindly treating all pixels\nequally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of MaskBlur in\nsignificantly enhancing the performance of existing SR methods. We further\nextend MaskBlur to other LF image tasks such as denoising, deblurring,\nlow-light enhancement, and real-world SR.

Due to the complex dynamics governing the location of\nGECP pivots, analysis of GECP growth for particular input matrices often\nestimates the actual growth rather than computes the growth exactly. We present\na class of dense random butterfly matrices on which we can present the exact\nGECP growth. We extend previous results that established exact growth\ncomputations for butterfly matrices when using GEPP and GE with rook pivoting\n(GERP) to now also include GECP for particular input matrices. Moreover, we\npresent a new method to construct random Hadamard matrices using butterfly\nmatrices.",

In safe\nRL research, while expected cumulative safety constraints (ECSCs) are typically\nthe first choices, chance constraints are often more pragmatic for\nincorporating safety under uncertainties. This paper proposes a\n\\textit{flipping-based policy} for Chance-Constrained Markov Decision Processes\n(CCMDPs). The flipping-based policy selects the next action by tossing a\npotentially distorted coin between two action candidates. The probability of\nthe flip and the two action candidates vary depending on the state. We\nestablish a Bellman equation for CCMDPs and further prove the existence of a\nflipping-based policy within the optimal solution sets. Since solving the\nproblem with joint chance constraints is challenging in practice, we then prove\nthat joint chance constraints can be approximated into Expected Cumulative\nSafety Constraints (ECSCs) and that there exists a flipping-based policy in the\noptimal solution sets for constrained MDPs with ECSCs. As a specific instance\nof practical implementations, we present a framework for adapting constrained\npolicy optimization to train a flipping-based policy.

However, these approaches often require task-specific\ndemonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the\ndevelopment of generalizable and robust policies for unseen real-world\nsettings. Recent advances in the use of foundation models for robotics (e.g.,\nLLMs, VLMs) have shown great potential in enabling systems to understand the\nsemantics in the world from large-scale internet data. However, it remains an\nopen challenge to use this knowledge to enable robotic systems to understand\nthe underlying dynamics of the world, to generalize policies across different\ntasks, and to adapt policies to new environments. To alleviate these\nlimitations, we propose an agentic framework for robot self-guidance and\nself-improvement, which consists of a set of role-specialized conversational\nagents, such as a high-level advisor, a grounding agent, a monitoring agent,\nand a robotic agent.

    "abstract": "A unified theoretical framework is suggested to examine the energy\ndissipation properties at all stages of additive implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta\n(IERK) methods up to fourth-order accuracy for gradient flow problems. We\nconstruct some parameterized IERK methods by applying the so-called first same\nas last method, that is, the diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta method with the\nexplicit first stage and stiffly-accurate assumption for the linear stiff term,\nand applying the explicit Runge-Kutta method for the nonlinear term. The main\npart of the novel framework is to construct the differential forms and the\nassociated differentiation matrices of IERK methods by using the difference\ncoefficients of method and the so-called discrete orthogonal convolution\nkernels. As the main result, we prove that an IERK method can preserve the\noriginal energy dissipation law unconditionally if the associated\ndifferentiation matrix is positive semi-definite. The recent indicator, namely\naverage energy dissipation rate, is also adopted for these multi-stage methods\nto evaluate the overall energy dissipation rate of an IERK method such that one\ncan choose proper parameters in some parameterized IERK methods. It is found\nthat the selection of method parameters in the IERK methods is at least as\nimportant as the selection of different IERK methods. Extensive numerical\nexperiments are also included to support our theory.",

    "abstract": "The research builds and evaluates the adversarial potential to introduce\ncopied code or hallucinated AI recommendations for malicious code in popular\ncode repositories. While foundational large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI,\nGoogle, and Anthropic guard against both harmful behaviors and toxic strings,\nprevious work on math solutions that embed harmful prompts demonstrate that the\nguardrails may differ between expert contexts. These loopholes would appear in\nmixture of expert's models when the context of the question changes and may\noffer fewer malicious training examples to filter toxic comments or recommended\noffensive actions. The present work demonstrates that foundational models may\nrefuse to propose destructive actions correctly when prompted overtly but may\nunfortunately drop their guard when presented with a sudden change of context,\nlike solving a computer programming challenge. We show empirical examples with\ntrojan-hosting repositories like GitHub, NPM, NuGet, and popular content\ndelivery networks (CDN) like jsDelivr which amplify the attack surface. In the\nLLM's directives to be helpful, example recommendations propose application\nprogramming interface (API) endpoints which a determined domain-squatter could\nacquire and setup attack mobile infrastructure that triggers from the naively\ncopied code. We compare this attack to previous work on context-shifting and\ncontrast the attack surface as a novel version of \"living off the land\" attacks\nin the malware literature. In the latter case, foundational language models can\nhijack otherwise innocent user prompts to recommend actions that violate their\nowners' safety policies when posed directly without the accompanying coding\nsupport request.",

Despite this, most evaluations focus solely on synthetic\ndata. To address this, we introduce RealInstruct, the first benchmark designed\nto evaluate LLMs' ability to follow real-world multi-constrained instructions\nby leveraging queries real users asked AI assistants. We also investigate\nmodel-based evaluation as a cost-effective alternative to human annotation for\nthis task.

DeCRIM works by decomposing the original instruction into a\nlist of constraints and using a Critic model to decide when and where the LLM's\nresponse needs refinement. Our results show that DeCRIM improves Mistral's\nperformance by 7.3% on RealInstruct and 8.0% on IFEval even with weak feedback.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that with strong feedback, open-source LLMs with\nDeCRIM can outperform GPT-4 on both benchmarks.",

VITask employs three key strategies: exemplar prompting (EP), response\ndistribution alignment (RDA), and contrastive response tuning (CRT) to improve\nthe task-specific performance of VLMs by adjusting their response\ndistributions. EP allows TSM features to guide VLMs, while RDA enables VLMs to\nadapt without TSMs during inference by learning from exemplar-prompted models.\nCRT further optimizes the ranking of correct image-response pairs, thereby\nreducing the risk of generating undesired responses. Experiments on 12 medical\ndiagnosis datasets across 9 imaging modalities show that VITask outperforms\nboth vanilla instruction-tuned VLMs and TSMs, showcasing its ability to\nintegrate complementary features from both models effectively.

    "abstract": "Recent work suggests that many luminous blue variables (LBVs) and B[e]\nsupergiants (sgB[e]) are isolated, implying that they may be products of\nmassive binaries, kicked by partner supernovae (SNe). However, the evidence is\nsomewhat complex and controversial. To test this scenario, we measure the\nproper-motion velocities for these objects in the LMC and SMC, using Gaia Data\nRelease 3. Our LMC results show that the kinematics, luminosities, and IR\nproperties point to LBVs and sgB[e] stars being distinct classes. We find that\nClass 1 LBVs, which have dusty nebulae, and sgB[e] stars both show velocity\ndistributions comparable to that of SMC field OBe stars, which are known to\nhave experienced SN kicks. The sgB[e] stars are faster, plausibly due to their\nlower average masses. However, Class 2 LBVs, which are luminous objects without\ndusty nebulae, show no signs of acceleration, therefore suggesting that they\nare single stars, pre-SN binaries, or perhaps binary mergers. The candidate LBV\nClass 3 stars, which are dominated by hot dust, are all confirmed sgB[e] stars;\ntheir luminosities and velocities show that they simply represent the most\nluminous and massive of the sgB[e] class. There are very few SMC objects, but\nthe sgB[e] stars are faster than their LMC counterparts, which may be\nconsistent with expectations that lower-metallicity binaries are tighter,\ncausing faster ejections. We also examine the distinct class of dust-free,\nweak-lined sgB[e] stars, finding that the SMC objects have the fastest\nvelocities of the entire sample.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning language models (LMs) with the Adam optimizer often demands\nexcessive memory, limiting accessibility. The \"in-place\" version of Stochastic\nGradient Descent (IP-SGD) and Memory-Efficient Zeroth-order Optimizer (MeZO)\nhave been proposed to address this. However, IP-SGD still requires substantial\nmemory, and MeZO suffers from slow convergence and degraded final performance\ndue to its zeroth-order nature. This paper introduces Addax, a novel method\nthat improves both memory efficiency and performance of IP-SGD by integrating\nit with MeZO. Specifically, Addax computes zeroth- or first-order gradients of\ndata points in the minibatch based on their memory consumption, combining these\ngradient estimates to update directions. By computing zeroth-order gradients\nfor data points that require more memory and first-order gradients for others,\nAddax overcomes the slow convergence of MeZO and the excessive memory\nrequirement of IP-SGD. Additionally, the zeroth-order gradient acts as a\nregularizer for the first-order gradient, further enhancing the model's final\nperformance. Theoretically, we establish the convergence of Addax under mild\nassumptions, demonstrating faster convergence and less restrictive\nhyper-parameter choices than MeZO. Our experiments with diverse LMs and tasks\nshow that Addax consistently outperforms MeZO regarding accuracy and\nconvergence speed while having a comparable memory footprint. When fine-tuning\nOPT-13B with one A100 GPU, on average, Addax outperforms MeZO in accuracy/F1\nscore by 14% and runs 15x faster while using memory similar to MeZO. In our\nexperiments on the larger OPT-30B model, on average, Addax outperforms MeZO in\nterms of accuracy/F1 score by >16 and runs 30x faster on a single H100 GPU.\nMoreover, Addax surpasses the performance of standard fine-tuning approaches,\nsuch as IP-SGD and Adam, in most tasks with significantly less memory\nrequirement.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that numerically approximating calculus of variations\nproblems possessing a Lavrentiev Gap Phenomenon (LGP) is challenging, and the\nstandard numerical methodologies such as finite element, finite difference and\ndiscontinuous Galerkin methods fail to give convergent methods because they\ncannot overcome the gap. This paper is a continuation of previous work by\nSchnake and Feng, where a promising enhanced finite element method was proposed\nto overcome the LGP in the classical Mani\\`a's problem. The goal of this paper\nis to provide a complete $\\Gamma$-convergence proof for this enhanced finite\nelement method, hence, establishing a theoretical foundation for the method.\nThe cruxes of the convergence analysis are taking advantage of the regularity\nof the minimizer and viewing the minimization problem as posed over the\nfractional Sobolev space $W^{1 + s, p}$ (for $s > 0$) rather than the original\nadmissible space.",

    "abstract": "The key challenge in advancing multivalent-ion batteries lies in finding\nsuitable intercalation hosts. Open-tunnel oxides, featuring one-dimensional\nchannels or nanopores, show promise for enabling effective ion transport.\nHowever, the vast range of compositional possibilities renders traditional\nexperimental and quantum-based methods impractical for large-scale studies.\nThis work presents a generative AI framework that uses the Crystal Diffusion\nVariational Autoencoder (CDVAE) and a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to\nexpedite the discovery of stable open-tunneled oxide materials for\nmultivalent-ion batteries.\n  By combining machine learning with data mining techniques, five promising\ntransition metal oxide (TMO) structures are generated. These structures, known\nfor forming open-tunnel oxide frameworks, are structurally validated through\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT). The results show that the generated structures\nhave lower formation energies compared to similar compositions in the Materials\nProject (MP) database, indicating improved thermodynamic stability.\n  Additionally, the graph-based M3GNet model is employed to relax further\ngenerated structures, providing a more computationally efficient alternative to\nDFT. Machine learning-based predictions of formation energy, band gap, and\nenergy above the hull refine the selection process, leading to the\nidentification of materials with significant potential for real-world battery\napplications. This research demonstrates the power of generative AI in rapidly\nexploring the vast chemical space of TMOs, offering a new approach to\ndiscovering stable open-tunnel oxides for multivalent-ion batteries. The\nresults highlight the potential of this approach to contribute to more\nsustainable energy storage technologies, addressing the growing concerns\nsurrounding the scarcity of lithium.",

    "abstract": "Disasters can result in the deaths of many, making quick response times\nvital. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as valuable in the field. LLMs\ncan be used to process vast amounts of textual information quickly providing\nsituational context during a disaster. However, the question remains whether\nLLMs should be used for advice and decision making in a disaster. To evaluate\nthe capabilities of LLMs in disaster response knowledge, we introduce a\nbenchmark: DisasterQA created from six online sources. The benchmark covers a\nwide range of disaster response topics. We evaluated five LLMs each with four\ndifferent prompting methods on our benchmark, measuring both accuracy and\nconfidence levels through Logprobs. The results indicate that LLMs require\nimprovement on disaster response knowledge. We hope that this benchmark pushes\nforth further development of LLMs in disaster response, ultimately enabling\nthese models to work alongside. emergency managers in disasters.",

A semiconducting gate can be beneficial for certain fabrication\nprocesses, in low light conditions, and for specific gating properties. We\ndetermine the effectiveness and limitations of a semiconducting gate in\ngraphene and bilayer graphene devices. Using the semiconducting transition\nmetal dichalcogenides molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), molybdenum diselenide\n(MoSe2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), and tungsten diselenide (WSe2), we show that\ntwo-dimensional semiconductors can be used to suitably gate the graphene\ndevices under appropriate operating conditions. For single-gated devices,\nsemiconducting gates are comparable to metallic gates below liquid helium\ntemperatures but include resistivity features resulting from gate voltage\nclamping of the semiconductor. In dual-gated devices, we pin down the parameter\nrange of effective operation and find that the semiconducting depletion regime\nresults in clamping and hysteresis from defect-state charge trapping.",

    "abstract": "Accurate uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) is\nessential for providing credible confidence estimates over their outputs.\nHowever, fine-tuned LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in uncertain predictions,\nwhich stems from their limited ability to generalize with sparse data. Existing\nparameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) uncertainty quantification methods for\nLLMs focus on post fine-tuning stage, and thus fail to address the core issue:\nlimited specialization of PEFT adapters to accurately capture task-specific\ninput-output relationships. To address these limitations, we propose\nFunctional-Level Uncertainty Quantification for Calibrated Fine-Tuning (UQ4CT),\nwhich captures and calibrates uncertainty over the space of functions that map\ninput prompts to outputs. We implement UQ4CT during the fine-tuning stage via a\nmixture-of-experts framework that hierarchically decomposes the functional\nspace. Empirically, UQ4CT achieves over $25\\%$ reduction in Expected\nCalibration Error (ECE) while preserving high accuracy across five benchmarks.\nEven under distribution shift, UQ4CT maintains superior ECE performance with\nhigh accuracy, showcasing improved generalizability.",
