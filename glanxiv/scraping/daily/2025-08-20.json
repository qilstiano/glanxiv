    "abstract": "Purpose: Bilateral Orthogonality Generative Acquisitions (BOGA) method, which\nwas initially implemented for T_2^* contrast via gradient echo acquisitions, is\nadapted for TSE imaging at 7T using parallel transmission (pTx) system for\nobtaining homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images. Theory and\nMethods: Multiple TSE images with complimentary RF modes and scan parameters\nare acquired as input images for the BOGA method where RF modes have\ncomplimentary transmit and receive field inhomogeneity patterns and scan\nparameters have varying echo and repetition times. With the application of the\nBOGA method using different subsets of the data acquisitions for each contrast,\nhomogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density contrast in the final images obtained.\nFurthermore, to demonstrate the effect of the TSE factor, two TSE factors are\nused individually. Normalized intensity profiles and signal to noise ratio maps\nare utilized for the comparison of the CP mode images and the TSE factors\nrespectively.\n  Results: Homogeneous T_1, T_2 and proton density weighted images are obtained\nwith the TSE implementation of the BOGA method without the transmit and receive\nfield inhomogeneity effects. Furthermore, mixed contrast effects of the TSE\nacquisition are simultaneously resolved independently of the TSE factor.\n  Conclusion: TSE application of BOGA method results in homogeneous T_1, T_2\nand proton density contrasts at 7T, as the inhomogeneity effects are removed\nfrom the final contrast without any prior data acquisitions.",

    "abstract": "Symmetric polynomial quadrature rules for triangles are commonly used to\nefficiently integrate two-dimensional domains in finite-element-type problems.\nWhile the development of such rules focuses on the maximum degree a given\nnumber of points can exactly integrate, smooth integrands are generally not\npolynomials of finite degree. Therefore, for such integrands, one needs to\nbalance integration accuracy and computational cost. A natural approach to this\nbalance is to choose the number of points such that the convergence rate with\nrespect to the mesh size $h$ matches that of the other properties of the\nscheme, such as the planar or curved triangles that approximate the geometry or\nthe basis functions that approximate the solution.\n  In general, it is expected that a quadrature rule capable of integrating\npolynomials up to degree $d$ yields an integration error that is\n$\\mathcal{O}(h^p)$, where $p=d+1$. However, as we describe in this paper, for\nsymmetric triangle quadrature rules, when $d$ is even, $p=d+2$; therefore, for\na $p^\\text{th}$-order-accurate quadrature rule, fewer quadrature points are\nnecessary, reducing the time required for matrix assembly in\nfinite-element-type problems. This reduction in cost is modest for local\ndifferential operators that yield sparse matrices but appreciable for global\nintegral operators that yield dense matrices.\n  In this paper, we briefly summarize the details of symmetric triangle\nquadrature rules, discuss error implications for quadrature rules for one\ndimension and triangles, and we provide numerical examples that support our\nobservation that polynomials that exactly integrate even maximum degrees\nconverge faster than the conventional expectation for sequences of regular\nmeshes.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment\n(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder\ntheir generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and\nQuality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a\nhierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and\ncontrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine\nreferences or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality\nscores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking\nloss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across\ndistortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces\nconsistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A\ntraining-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,\nfurther enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic\ndistortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as\ndemonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,\nhaze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we\nintroduce \\textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of\nonly 3.5 ms per image.

In the first half of the paper, we review the\nbasic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,\nshowing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce\na standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas\nand Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and\ntheir proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms\nfor MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain\ncategory forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject\nclassifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we\nmove on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state\nrepresentation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special\ntypes of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,\nextending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL.

To address this challenge, we focus\non the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be\ncapable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access\nto the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method\nthat can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial\ncomponent required for efficient unlearning.

To formalize this setting,\nwe introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the\nagent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In\nthis context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a\ndata-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural\nlanguage during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over\nnatural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different\ncomplex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over\ncandidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and\nuncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate\nGOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated\nhousehold robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles.

With the aim of\nquantifying the HXR share of the total radiative budget, we obtained a NuSTAR\nobservation, quasi-simultaneous with Swift and Einstein Probe observations, of\nthe young M1Ve star AU Mic, detecting two flares. We build an empirical soft\nX-ray (SXR; 0.3-3 keV)-HXR scaling relation and, on that basis, quantify the\nHXR share of the total radiative budget, defined as the sum of extreme\nultraviolet (EUV; 0.01-0.3 keV), SXR, and HXR, and assess its effect on\natmospheric escape. We find that the HXR fraction is 1.7% in quiescence and\nrises to 3.3% at flare peaks; even adopting the EUV + SXR (collectively\nreferred to as XUV) escape efficiency as an upper bound, HXR-powered mass loss\namounts to only a few percent of the XUV-driven rate. High-energy spectral\ntails are detected in quiescence and in Flare 2. Both nonthermal and high\ntemperature thermal models provide acceptable fits to the data; however, the\npresence of two localized Neupert effect episodes in Flare 2, combined with the\nimplausibly large energy budget required for a 290 MK plasma, strongly favors a\nnonthermal interpretation. Consistent with this picture, spectral-timing\nanalysis shows that the 6-20 keV share of the emission actually declines during\nflares, while heating is dominated by 3-6 keV photons-implying rapid\nthermalization of accelerated electrons and a predominantly thermal energy\nrelease. Overall, the flares are thermally dominated, nonthermal electrons can\npower chromospheric heating episodically, but HXR-induced escape appears to be\nmarginal for the long-term atmospheric evolution of AU Mic's planets.",

    "abstract": "Melting is conventionally understood as a bulk first-order phase transition,\nwhere nucleation of the liquid phase is followed by rapid growth until the\nsolid disappears. However, in thin crystalline films containing local\nheterogeneities, this process can be dramatically altered by interfacial\nforces. Here, we report experimental evidence of suspended melting in\nmolecularly thin films of long-chain alkanes containing trapped liquid\ndroplets. As temperature increases, these droplets expand and flatten, yet\nremain pinned within the surrounding solid layers, preventing full melting. The\nobserved sensitivity of apparent contact angle to small temperature changes is\nexplained by a theoretical model balancing bulk melting enthalpy and\ninterfacial energies. This work highlights how melting in thin films can be\nfrustrated and spatially arrested by local wetting constraints, revealing a\nrich interplay between phase transition dynamics, confinement, and interfacial\ntopology. Beyond alkanes, these results suggest a generic mechanism by which\nmelting, wetting, and film morphology conspire to locally suspend phase\ntransitions.",

While prior work suggests that SAEs\npromote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their\nbase models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs\nagainst base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained\nconcept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures\nhow distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using\nGemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs\nreduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability.

To assess practical utility, we evaluate\nconcept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and\npartial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more\nprecise concept-level control when using partial suppression.

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of QUIC as a transport protocol has transformed content\ndelivery by reducing latency, enhancing congestion control (CC), and enabling\nmore efficient multiplexing. With the advent of 5G networks, which support\nultra-low latency and high bandwidth, streaming high-resolution video at 4K and\nbeyond has become increasingly viable. However, optimizing Quality of\nExperience (QoE) in mobile networks remains challenging due to the complex\ninteractions among Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) schemes at the application layer, CC\nalgorithms at the transport layer, and Radio Link Control (RLC) queuing at the\nlink layer in the 5G network. While prior studies have largely examined these\ncomponents in isolation, this work presents a comprehensive analysis of the\nimpact of modern active queue management (AQM) strategies, such as RED and L4S,\non video streaming over diverse QUIC implementations--focusing particularly on\ntheir interaction with the RLC buffer in 5G environments and the interplay\nbetween CC algorithms and ABR schemes. Our findings demonstrate that the\neffectiveness of AQM strategies in improving video streaming QoE is\nintrinsically linked to their dynamic interaction with QUIC implementations, CC\nalgorithms and ABR schemes-highlighting that isolated optimizations are\ninsufficient.

Our analysis\nreveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse\nin the output feature space.

The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination\nregarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for\nthe target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and\ninterpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence\n(prediction $\\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as\nequalized odds; prediction $\\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on\ntarget attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned\non the prediction $\\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)\nand biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both\nindependence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive\naccuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,\nthereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among\nthese fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,\n$\\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,\nwith linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for\n$\\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,\nwhich serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance.

We tested this hypothesis in a systematic\ncollection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive\narchitectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and\nstructure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks.

They are central to galactic chemical evolution and serve as\nstandardizable candles in cosmology, yet their progenitors remain uncertain. In\nthis work, we present a grid of five models detailing the evolution and\nnucleosynthesis of slowly merging carbon-oxygen white dwarfs approaching the\nChandrasekhar mass. These models test a variety of physics input settings,\nincluding accretion rates, nuclear reaction rates, convection parameters, and\nthe composition of the accreted material. During the merger process, as the\nmass of the primary white dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, carbon\nburning is initiated first on the surface before eventually igniting\nexplosively at the center. As a consequence, the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction\nactivates in the outer layers of all models. The neutrons released in this way\nproduce a weak s-process-like abundance distribution peaking at Kr, which is\noverproduced by more than a factor of 1000 compared to solar. The trans-Fe\nelements-enriched outer layer mass varies from 0.04 Msun to 0.11 Msun,\ndepending on the accretion rate. Our explosion simulation of these progenitor\nmodels ejects significant amount of first-peak elements (e.g., Kr, Sr) as well\nas of some long-lived radioactive species, such as 60Fe. In a previous\ntheoretical study, we found that a similar nucleosynthesis process during the\nprogenitor phase may also occur on the surface of near-Chandrasekhar white\ndwarfs formed through the accretion of H-rich material via the\nsingle-degenerate scenario. Therefore, these results suggest trans-Fe\nenrichment might be a hallmark of near-Chandrasekhar SNIa ejecta, regardless of\nthe specific progenitor channel, and could provide a new spectral signature\ndistinguishing them from sub-Chandrasekhar explosions.",

We find that differences in vaccination rates explain only part of the\nobserved disparities in outcomes. While no model scenario is able to fully\ncapture the heterogeneous temporal dynamics, our results suggest that\ndifferences between ethnicities in the per-infection risk of clinical severe\ndisease is an important factor. Our work is an important step towards models\nthat are better able to predict inequitable impacts of future pandemic and\nemerging disease threats, and investigate the ability of interventions to\nmitigate these.",

Joint modeling of the TrES-1 b data favors an apsidal\nprecession model, but the rapid precession rate of $4^\\circ$ yr$^{-1}$ cannot\nbe explained without invoking an undetected close-in planetary companion, which\nremains unseen in the data.

Therefore, recent efforts\nhave been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide\nrange of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we\nintroduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art\noptimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size\nhyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto\nand Xiao, 2024].

While the Seebeck\ncoefficient captures transport properties through the energy dependence of the\nelectronic transmission, the DEP is directly connected to the system's\nelectronic entropy, offering a direct thermodynamic alternative for estimating\n$S$. We evaluate these transport-thermodynamic properties considering diverse\nribbon widths, defining metallic and semiconducting regimes.

In this paper we unify and extend these theories by defining and\nstudying the quasi-projective and quasi-injective dimension of a module with\nrespect to a semidualizing module. We establish several results generalizing\nclassic formulae such as the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula, Bass' formula,\nIschebeck's formula, Auslander's depth formula and Jorgensen's dependency\nformula.

This compilation includes 1,633 coadded images spanning\n966 epochs with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) greater than 4, representing the\nlargest consistently analyzed infrared comet dataset obtained from a single\ninstrument. Dynamical classification identifies 234 long-period (LPCs) and 250\nshort-period comets (SPCs), spanning heliocentric distances of 0.996--10.804\nau. LPCs are statistically brighter than SPCs in the W1 (3.4 um) and W2 (4.6\num) bands at comparable heliocentric distances. Cometary activity peaks near\nperihelion, with SPCs exhibiting a pronounced post-perihelion asymmetry.\nMulti-epoch photometry reveals that SPCs show steeper brightening and fading\nslopes than LPCs. The observing geometry of WISE/NEOWISE -- constrained to a\nfixed ~90-deg solar elongation from low-Earth orbit -- introduces systematic\nbiases in the sampling of orientation angles for extended features.\nCollectively, the results reveal a continuous evolutionary gradient across\ncomet populations, likely driven by accumulated solar heating and surface\nprocessing. This study establishes a foundation for subsequent COSINE analyses,\nwhich will separate nucleus and coma contributions and model dust dynamics to\nfurther probe cometary activity and evolution.",

    "abstract": "On social platforms like Twitter, strategic targeted attacks are becoming\nincreasingly common, especially against vulnerable groups such as female\njournalists. Two key challenges in identifying strategic online behavior are\nthe complex structure of online conversations and the hidden nature of\npotential strategies that drive user behavior. To address these, we develop a\nnew tree structured Transformer model that categorizes replies based on their\nhierarchical conversation structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour proposed classification model can effectively detect different user groups,\nnamely attackers, supporters, and bystanders, and their latent strategies. To\ndemonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply this classifier to real time\nTwitter data and conduct a series of quantitative analyses on the interactions\nbetween journalists with different groups of users. Our classification approach\nallows us to not only explore strategic behaviors of attackers but also those\nof supporters and bystanders who engage in online interactions. When examining\nthe impact of online attacks, we find a strong correlation between the presence\nof attackers' interactions and chilling effects, where journalists tend to slow\ntheir subsequent posting behavior. This paper provides a deeper understanding\nof how different user groups engage in online discussions and highlights the\ndetrimental effects of attacker presence on journalists, other users, and\nconversational outcomes. Our findings underscore the need for social platforms\nto develop tools that address coordinated toxicity. By detecting patterns of\ncoordinated attacks early, platforms could limit the visibility of toxic\ncontent to prevent escalation. Additionally, providing journalists and users\nwith tools for real time reporting could empower them to manage hostile\ninteractions more effectively.",

We present a constrained decoding\nalgorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a\ncontext-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression\nthat satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of\nthe next token sequence that can continue to a correct program.

We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of\nLua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs\nconforming to any prescribed scripting API.

Colliding-wind binaries (CWBs) are strong X-ray and radio synchrotron\nemitters and have been proposed as potential accelerators of such particles. We\nperform high-resolution three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations\ncoupled with test-particle integration to investigate how local plasma\nconditions affect particle acceleration in CWBs. We find that the maximum\nparticle energies and the hardness of the energy distributions depend on the\nshock magnetization and cooling efficiency. For moderate magnetization ($\\gt$1\nG), CWBs can accelerate hadronic particles up to hundreds of TeV or even PeV\nenergies, with more than 1\\% of particles reaching the very-high-energy range.\nBy correlating the local acceleration rate with plasma quantities -\n\\textit{magnetic field strength, current density, vorticity, and velocity\ndivergence} - we show that turbulence and magnetic field complexity dominate\nthe acceleration, while classical diffusive shock acceleration plays a limited\nrole. These results suggest that turbulent, magnetically driven processes are\nkey to producing relativistic particles in CWBs, with implications for future\nhigh sensitivity $\\gamma$-ray observations (e.g. LACT and CTAO).",

    "abstract": "Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), which enable real-time sensing\nand monitoring of underground resources by underground devices (UDs), hold\ngreat promise for delivering substantial social and economic benefits across\nvarious verticals.

To complement this, we conceptualize in this study a novel\nspace-air-ground-underground integrated network (SAGUIN) architecture that\nseamlessly incorporates satellite systems, aerial platforms, terrestrial\nnetworks, and underground communications. On this basis, we integrate LoRaWAN\nand wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies into SAGUIN to enable\nsustainable subterranean mMTC. We begin by reviewing the relevant technical\nbackground and presenting the architecture and implementation challenges of\nSAGUIN. Then, we employ simulations to model a remote underground pipeline\nmonitoring scenario to evaluate the feasibility and performance of SAGUIN based\non LoRaWAN and WET technologies, focusing on the effects of parameters such as\nunderground conditions, time allocation, LoRaWAN spread factor (SF)\nconfigurations, reporting periods, and harvested energy levels.

However, a comprehensive assessment of\nthe reliability & completeness of these detections is lacking. Aims: This work\naims to summarise the expected properties of tidal tails based on N-body\nsimulations, review the reliability of tidal tail detections in the literature,\nand grade them according to a set of diagnostic tests. Methods: We used a grid\nof 68-20000 Msun simulated clusters & analysed the formation & evolution of the\ntails. We compiled 122 catalogues (58 unique clusters) from literature, within\n500 pc of the Sun. We employed tests based on photometric, morphological &\ndynamical signatures, & comparisons with simulations, to grade their tails.\nResults: Based on the simulations, we analysed the complex morphology of the\ntails & their properties (e.g., size, span, stellar types, number density, &\nmass function) at various cluster masses & ages. During the first 200 Myr of\nevolution, the tails typically form a characteristic S shape, with an amplitude\nthat scales with cluster mass. The tail span increases at a rate of 4 times the\ninitial velocity dispersion, & the near-tail is predominantly populated by\nrecent escapees. Conclusions: In the 122 published tail catalogues, we found\nthat 15 gold & 55 silver catalogues passed the majority of the tests. The\nremaining 51 were graded as bronze; care should be taken before using these for\nfurther analysis. The age, metallicity, binary fraction, & mass function of\nstars in the tails were generally consistent with those of their parent\nclusters. The gold/silver catalogues (69 catalogues of 40 clusters) represent\nreliable samples for detailed analyses of tails. Future data will be essential\nfor further validation & for leveraging tidal tails as tracers of cluster\ndissolution & the Galactic potential.",

    "abstract": "We present a calibratable, jet-free framework that enhances the search\nsignificance of the flagship LHC channel $HH \\to 4b$ by more than a factor of\nfive compared to existing approaches. The method employs a mass-decorrelated\ndiscriminant to identify $h_1 h_2 \\to 4b$ with variable $h_{1,2}$ masses and a\nsimultaneous estimator of $(m_{h_1}, m_{h_2})$, both derived from multiclass\nclassification on all-particle inputs. The $HH$ signal response can be\ncalibrated using $ZZ \\to 4b$. Using a highly realistic simulation framework\nvalidated through multiple tests, we demonstrate the method's robustness and\nidentify two prerequisites essential for achieving this level of sensitivity.\nResults indicate that with LHC Run 2 and 3 data, observation-level sensitivity\nto $HH$ appears within reach, enabling constraints on $\\kappa_\\lambda$\ncomparable to HL-LHC projections and offering an accelerated path to precision\nmeasurements of the Higgs trilinear coupling.",

    "abstract": "Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a\nwell-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled\nsuch that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation\nand movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental\ninteractions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing\nwork does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where\nagent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering\nand fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.\n  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to\ncontrol agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we\nobserve that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.\nAdditionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an\ninformation-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework\nproduces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours\narising naturally from any environmental setting.",

This study investigates the accessibility barriers\nblind users face when performing key tasks, such as page creation, menu\nediting, and image publishing, using CMS platforms. A two-fold evaluation was\nconducted using automated tools and manual usability testing with three blind\nand one sighted participant, complemented by expert analysis based on the\nBarrier Walkthrough method. Results showed that block-based interfaces were\nparticularly challenging, often marked as accessible by automated tools but\nresulting in critical usability issues during manual evaluation. The use of a\ntext-based editor, the integration of AI-generated image descriptions, and\ntraining aligned with screen reader workflows, significantly improved usability\nand autonomy. These findings underscore the limitations of automated\nassessments and highlight the importance of user-centered design practices.\nEnhancing CMS accessibility requires consistent navigation structures, reduced\nreliance on visual interaction patterns, and the integration of AI tools that\nsupport blind content authors throughout the content creation process.",

This framework provides\na significant improvement over previous static calculations with homogeneous\nfields and moves toward the long-term goal of full $3+1$D magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations. We explore the effects of impact parameter, electrical\nconductivity, and invariant mass on the dilepton spectra and anisotropic even\nflow coefficients. It is found that transverse momentum spectra increase with\nimpact parameter, dominated by annihilation processes, while decay\ncontributions remain sub-leading. Strikingly, the elliptic flow $v_2$ from\ndecay channels is nonzero even in nearly central collisions, exhibiting a\ncharacteristic shape--positive at low $p_T$ and negative at high $p_T$--that is\nlargely independent of impact parameter and conductivity. In contrast, $v_2$\nfrom annihilation processes is smaller in magnitude but dominates the total\nflow in magnitude due to its larger yield. Higher harmonics, such as $v_4$, are\nan order of magnitude smaller as compared to $v_2$ along with distinctive\nzero-crossing patterns. Conductivity enhances both spectra and flow but leaves\nno unambiguous signature for its extraction. Varying the invariant mass reveals\nthe strongest enhancements at low mass, with harmonic coefficients suppressed\nat higher masses. Overall, our results suggest that central and semi-central\ncollisions can carry imprints of the background magnetic field, and that\ncharacteristic correlations in even flow harmonics may provide a robust probe\nof electromagnetic effects in HICs.",

    "abstract": "Accurate characterization of in-utero brain development is essential for\nunderstanding typical and atypical neurodevelopment. Building upon previous\nefforts to construct spatiotemporal fetal brain MRI atlases, we present the\nCRL-2025 fetal brain atlas, which is a spatiotemporal (4D) atlas of the\ndeveloping fetal brain between 21 and 37 gestational weeks. This atlas is\nconstructed from carefully processed MRI scans of 160 fetuses with\ntypically-developing brains using a diffeomorphic deformable registration\nframework integrated with kernel regression on age. CRL-2025 uniquely includes\ndetailed tissue segmentations, transient white matter compartments, and\nparcellation into 126 anatomical regions. This atlas offers significantly\nenhanced anatomical details over the CRL-2017 atlas, and is released along with\nthe CRL diffusion MRI atlas with its newly created tissue segmentation and\nlabels as well as deep learning-based multiclass segmentation models for\nfine-grained fetal brain MRI segmentation. The CRL-2025 atlas and its\nassociated tools provide a robust and scalable platform for fetal brain MRI\nsegmentation, groupwise analysis, and early neurodevelopmental research, and\nthese materials are publicly released to support the broader research\ncommunity.",

    "abstract": "With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational\ncosts of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique\nhas recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively\nreduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing\nmethods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate\nfeature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.\nTo overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches\nfeature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to\ntrain directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be\nstraightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely\noverlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations\nto feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these\noverlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method\nwill be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first\nto comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.\nTo improve training accuracy, we propose \\textit{similarity-aware channel\naugmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a\nminimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate\nlossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \\textit{progressive\ncompression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are\nfrozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves\nsignificant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with\na minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\nfreezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their\napplication for efficient DNN training.",

To\naddress this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative\nrefinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as\na mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a\nmulti-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply\nreversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a\ndiffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network\nintegrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction\n(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core\nobject regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this\nprinciple to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;\nand a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a\nfinal refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion\nmodel that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,\nharnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration\nwithout the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique\nsynergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for\nthe diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward\nambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that\nremain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a\nbroader bi-level optimization framework.",

On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,\nTAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%\nagainst ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than\nexisting diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust\naccuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism\nis least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.",

    "abstract": "Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of\nconfidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,\nwhere models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily\noverfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty\nestimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is\nimpractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates\nthat cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across\nruns - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce\nTwin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training\nprocedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two\nidentical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and\na periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their\ndivergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use\nthis estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing\nregularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and\ncomplex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration\nand generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference for causal estimands has been growing in popularity,\nhowever many misconceptions and implementation errors arise from conflating\nsample and population-level estimands. We have anecdotally witnessed these at\nconference talks, in the course of peer review service, and even in published\nand arXiv-ed papers. Our goal here is to elucidate the crucial differences\nbetween sample and population-level quantities when it comes to identification,\nmodeling, Bayesian computation, and interpretation. For example, common\nsample-level estimands require cross-world assumptions for identification,\nwhereas common population-level estimands do not. Similarly, the former\nrequires explicit imputation of counterfactuals from their joint posterior,\nwhereas the latter typically only requires a posterior distribution over\nparameters. We start by defining some examples of both types of estimands, then\ndiscuss the full joint posterior over all unknowns (both missing\ncounterfactuals and population distribution parameters). We continue to outline\nhow inference for different estimands are derived from different marginals of\nthis joint posterior. Because the differences are conceptually subtle but can\nbe practically substantial, we provide an illustration of using synthetic data\nin Stan. We also provide a detailed appendix with derivations and computational\ntips along with a discussion of common implementation errors.

While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability\nrequired for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we\nintroduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module\ndesigned to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.\nThe Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly\nguides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without\nrequiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in\ndemonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a\npowerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously\nproviding clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the\nchallenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of\na Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.\nCrucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that\nThe Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a\nvaluable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making\nprocess.",

Developing offshore wind as a reliable domestic energy source\nrequires a multiregional analysis of economic and environmental effects of\nconstructing projects along lakefronts and coastal regions. Although no\ncommercial offshore wind farms currently operate in the United States, seven\nstates have announced capacity commitments exceeding 28 gigawatts by 2035.

The five projects analyzed require 16.3 billion\ndollars in capital investment and generate 27.6 billion dollars in direct and\nindirect economic impacts across the country. Emissions results show that\nstates active in energy generation are most affected, but impacts can be\nreduced by decarbonizing the grid.

The model is\nvalidated through its application to the 533-bus distribution test system and a\n3499-bus realistic test feeder for a set of representative loading scenarios.\nIn the 533-bus system, an 85% reduction was achieved with a maximum voltage\nerror below 0.0025 p.u., while in the 3499-bus feeder, over 94% reduction was\nobtained with maximum voltage errors below 0.002 p.u. Additionally, we show\nthat the radialization step accelerates the runtime of optimal voltage control\nproblems when applied to Kron-reduced networks.",

Here, extensive\nmagnetometry measurements were performed on two independently grown thin film\nheterostructures of RuO$_{2}$ interfaced with either NiFe or Fe acting as the\nferromagnetic layer. Below about 15 K, both samples exhibit exchange bias\nfields when cooled to approximately 2 K in a $+$1 T field, and a spin\ntransitional feature is observed around 31 K. Magneto-Raman measurements on\nRuO$_{2}$ thin films only reveal a magnon mode when there is a NiFe layer,\nsuggesting that RuO$_{2}$ does not intrinsically possess long range magnetic\nordering.. When in contact with a ferromagnet, RuO$_2$ displays effects that\ncould be ascribed to antiferromagnetism.

    "abstract": "Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has become a widely adopted model for securing\nenterprise environments, promoting continuous verification and minimal trust\nacross systems. However, its application in mobile contexts remains limited,\ndespite mobile applications now accounting for most global digital interactions\nand being increasingly targeted by sophisticated threats. Existing Zero Trust\nframeworks developed by organisations such as the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure\nSecurity Agency (CISA) primarily focus on enterprise-managed infrastructure,\nassuming organisational control over devices, networks, and identities. This\npaper addresses a critical gap by proposing an extended Zero Trust model\ndesigned for mobile applications operating in untrusted, user-controlled\nenvironments. Using a design science methodology, the study introduced a\nsix-pillar framework that supports runtime enforcement of trust through\ncontrols including device integrity, user identity validation, data protection,\nsecure application programming interface (API) usage, behavioural monitoring,\nand live application protection. Each pillar was mapped to relevant regulatory\nand security standards to support compliance. A phased implementation roadmap\nand maturity assessment model were also developed to guide adoption across\nvarying organisational contexts. The proposed model offers a practical and\nstandards-aligned approach to securing mobile applications beyond\npre-deployment controls, aligning real-time enforcement with Zero Trust\nprinciples. This contribution expands the operational boundaries of ZTA and\nprovides organisations with a deployable path to reduce fraud, enhance\ncompliance, and address emerging mobile security challenges.

The out-of-plane\nmagnetization in the sandwich structure turned out to be significantly larger\nthan that in the heterostructure, indicating that the interlayer magnetic\ninteraction between two MBST layers is ferromagnetic. Furthermore, the Curie\ntemperature increased with decreasing the in-plane Mn-Mn distance in the MBST\nlayer, which suggests the enhancement of the intralayer ferromagnetic\ninteraction within each MBST layer. Meanwhile, in the sandwich structures with\nvarious spacer thicknesses, the Curie temperature with the spacer layer was\nhigher than that with no spacer layer. In addition, the curve shape of\nanomalous Hall effects for the sandwich structure was almost unchanged by\ncarrier-density modulation, which implies that the ferromagnetism in this\nsystem is carrier-independent. Based on the above results, magnetic behaviors\nin our systems cannot be explained only by the direct exchange nor\nsuperexchange interactions reported previously for MBST systems, and are\ninstead proposed to arise from topology-related mechanisms such as the van\nVleck and Bloembergen-Rowland mechanisms. This work provides a new perspective\non magnetic mechanisms in MBST systems, which helps us to realize\nnext-generation spintronic and electronic devices by flexibly controlling\nmagnetism in intrinsic magnetic topological insulators.",

Although rank-based measures are known to be well suited for discrete\nand heavy-tailed data, previous works in the field focused mostly on the\ncontinuous and light-tailed case. We close this gap by imposing mild\nassumptions and allowing for general types of distributions. Interestingly, our\nanalysis reveals that a non-trivial adjustment of classical Kendall's $\\tau$ is\nneeded to obtain a pivotal limiting distribution in the presence of tied data.\nThe proof for Spearman's $\\rho$ is facilitated by a result regarding the\nlimiting eigenvalue distribution of a general class of random matrices with\nrows on the Euclidean unit sphere, which is of independent interest.

The reaction of disinfectants with such compounds\ngenerates byproducts that could be dangerous for human health.

The present effort, starting from the relevant\nscientific literature, proposes a novel framework which is based on analysing\nthe disinfectant consumption using a second order kinetic model. The novel\nframework allows analysing the two endogenous mechanisms of compounds\nreactions: the first mechanism refers to compounds detached by the momentum of\nwater flow and reacting into the bulk while transported by flow, the second one\nrefers to local reaction at wall. The use of a chemically based second order\nkinetic model, furthermore, allows for emphasizing the role of stoichiometry\nand reaction rate constants of reactants and byproducts as relevant parameters\nto be evaluated at laboratory scale for the specific water system. Thus, the\nproposed framework can effectively support water quality management using\nmonitoring data together with hydraulic modelling.

    "abstract": "The exploration of tomography of bosonic Gaussian states is presumably as old\nas quantum optics, but only recently, their precise and rigorous study have\nbeen moving into the focus of attention, motivated by technological\ndevelopments. In this work, we present an efficient and experimentally feasible\nGaussian state tomography algorithm with provable recovery trace-distance\nguarantees, whose sample complexity depends only on the number of modes, and -\nremarkably - is independent of the state's photon number or energy, up to\ndoubly logarithmic factors. Our algorithm yields a doubly-exponential\nimprovement over existing methods, and it employs operations that are readily\naccessible in experimental settings: the preparation of an auxiliary squeezed\nvacuum, passive Gaussian unitaries, and homodyne detection. At its core lies an\nadaptive strategy that systematically reduces the total squeezing of the\nsystem, enabling efficient tomography. Quite surprisingly, this proves that\nestimating a Gaussian state in trace distance is generally more efficient than\ndirectly estimating its covariance matrix. Our algorithm is particularly\nwell-suited for applications in quantum metrology and sensing, where highly\nsqueezed - and hence high-energy - states are commonly employed. As a further\ncontribution, we establish improved sample complexity bounds for standard\nheterodyne tomography, equipping this widely used protocol with rigorous\ntrace-norm guarantees.",

Recent theoretical studies\nhave explored the link between LRDs and the formation of heavy BH seeds in the\nearly Universe, such as direct-collapse BHs (DCBHs).

The birth of DCBHs is associated\nwith a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense\nluminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation\nof the first PopIII stars in these very haloes.

We discuss a natural\nrealization of such physics in quantum Hall bilayers, where a finite density of\nexcitons with fractional statistics is argued to give rise to `anyonic exciton\nsuperfluidity,' the charge-neutral analog of anyon superconductivity. In a\nbalanced bilayer of two Laughlin $\\nu = 1/3$ states, the minimal interlayer\nexciton carries anyonic exchange statistics. A finite density of these excitons\nis argued to yield an exciton superfluid stitched to a specific bulk\ntopological order and edge spectrum.

Our best-fitting model indicates a gas\nmass of $4.93_{-0.72}^{+0.32}\\times10^9\\,{M_{\\odot}}$ for Gaia-Enceladus,\nplacing it at the higher end of previously suggested mass ranges. The model\nscenario suggests a short star formation timescale, substantial outflows, and a\nrapid build-up of metals mainly driven by core-collapse supernovae, with a\nlesser contribution from Type~Ia supernovae. Comparison with observational data\nin other chemical planes (e.g., $\\mathrm{[Mg/Mn]\\times[Al/Fe]}$) supports this\nscenario, emphasizing a distinct evolution path relative to the Milky Way.\nAdditionally, our results provide indirect evidence that star formation in\nGaia-Enceladus likely ceased within the first 4 Gyr, consistent with earlier\ninferences of an early merger event. These findings highlight the power of\nchemical evolution modeling in reconstructing the origin and mass of ancient\naccreted systems. Overall, we show that Gaia-Enceladus, through a rapid star\nformation and strong outflows, contributed a significant fraction of the\nmetal-poor stellar halo of the Milky Way.",

However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,\nwhich limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint\nstructures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive\nLearning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose\nrepresentations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same\nsequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture\ndiverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable\nfeatures. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons\nwith varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.\nExperiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR\nconsistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive\nlearning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,\nsetting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.",

Reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Q-learning, have been\nintroduced for decentralized routing by allowing nodes to make decisions based\non local observations. However, Q-learning suffers from scalability issues and\npoor generalization due to the difficulty in managing the Q-table in large or\ndynamic network topologies, especially in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with\ndiverse channel characteristics. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel deep\nQ-network (DQN)-based routing framework for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless\nnetworks to maximize the end-to-end rate of the route by improving scalability\nand adaptability, where each node uses a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate\nthe Q-values and jointly select the next-hop relay and a communication\ntechnology for transmission. To achieve better performance with the DNN,\nselecting which nodes to exchange information is critical, as it not only\ndefines the state and action spaces but also determines the input to the DNN.\nTo this end, we propose neighbor node selection strategies based on channel\ngain and rate between nodes rather than a simple distance-based approach for an\nimproved set of states and actions for DQN-based routing. During training, the\nmodel experiences diverse network topologies to ensure generalization and\nrobustness, and simulation results show that the proposed neighbor node\nselection outperforms simple distance-based selection. Further, we observe that\nthe DQN-based approach outperforms various benchmark schemes and performs\ncomparably to the optimal approach.",

    "abstract": "We derive a generalized version of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the\nentanglement entropy in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant field theories. We\nuse a recent framework which expresses the measurable quantities of a quantum\ntheory as a weighted sum over paths in the theory's phase space. If this\nframework is applied to a field theory on a spacetime foliated by a\nhypersurface $\\Sigma,$ the choice of a codimension-2 surface $B$ without\nboundary contained in $\\Sigma$ specifies a submanifold in the phase space. For\ndiffeomorphism invariant field theories, a functional integral expression for\ntheir density matrices was recently given and then used to derive bounds on\nphase space volumes in the considered submanifold associated to $B.$ These\nbounds formalize the gravitational entropy bound. Here, we present an\nimplication of this derivation in that we show the obtained functional integral\nexpression for density matrices to be naturally suited for the replica trick.\nCorrespondingly, we prove a functional integral expression for the associated\nentanglement entropies and derive a practical prescription for their evaluation\nto leading order and beyond. An important novelty of our approach is the\ncontact to phase space. This allows us both to obtain a prescription for\nentanglement entropies in arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant field theories not\nnecessarily possessing a holographic dual as well as to use entanglement\nentropies to study their phase space structure. In the case of the\nbulk-boundary correspondence, our prescription consistently reproduces and\nhence provides a natural and independent proof of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as\nwell as its various generalizations. These include the covariant holographic\nentanglement entropy proposal, Dong's proposal for higher-derivative gravity as\nwell as the quantum extremal surface prescription.",

This can be used in\nquantum networks to perform applications such as blind quantum computing or\nlong-distance quantum key distribution (QKD) with quantum repeaters. Devices to\nperform RSP, referred to as a client, ideally have low hardware requirements,\nsuch as only sending photonic qubits. A weak coherent pulse source offers a\npractical alternative to true single-photon sources and is already widely used\nin QKD. Here, we introduce two new protocols to the previously known protocol\nfor RSP with a weak-coherent-pulse-based device. The known technique uses a\ndouble-click (DC) protocol, where a photon from both the server and the client\nneeds to reach an intermediate Bell state measurement. Here, we add to that a\nsingle-click (SC) RSP protocol, which requires only one photon to reach the\nBell state measurement, allowing for better performance in certain regimes. In\naddition, we introduce a double-single-click (DSC) protocol, where the SC\nprotocol is repeated twice, and a CNOT gate is applied between the resulting\nqubits. DSC mitigates the need for phase stabilization in certain regimes,\nlowering technical complexity while still improving performance compared to DC\nin some regimes. We compare these protocols in terms of fidelity and rate,\nfinding that SC consistently achieves higher rates than DC and, interestingly,\ndoes not suffer from an inherently lower fidelity than the DC, as is the case\nfor entanglement generation. Although SC provides stronger performance, DSC can\nstill show performance improvements over DC, and it may have reduced technical\ncomplexity compared to SC. Lastly, we show how these protocols can be used in\nlong-distance QKD using quantum repeaters.",

In this work, we\npropose a conceptually simple but powerful method to directly confirm or reject\nthe eccentric hypothesis, without needing to compare the hypothesis with the\nplethora of other possible hypotheses. The key idea is that while spurious\nnon-zero values of eccentricity, at some reference frequency, could be acquired\nwhen a non-eccentric CBC with additional physical/beyond-GR effects is\nrecovered with an eccentric CBC waveform model, the {\\it evolution} of\neccentricity with frequency will in general not be mimicked.

The method\ncompares the eccentricity recovered at some low frequency value (e.g, $10$ Hz),\nevolved to higher frequencies assuming GR, with eccentricities recovered at\nthose same higher frequencies. Discrepancy between the two eccentricities at\nany reference frequency would violate EECT and indicate the presence of a\nmimicker.

When transiting in front of their host star, these tails can not only\nproduce larger depths in the transit light curves, but also introduce\nsignificant asymmetries between ingress and egress. Using the publicly\navailable software Harmonica, we present a method to model the light curves of\ntransiting planets surrounded by extended envelopes of escaping gas, and\nsubsequently infer the shape and size of the latter. We apply this method to\nthe JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of HAT-P-18b, which show pronounced helium\ntail features in its spectroscopic light curve of the metastable helium triplet\nat 10830 \\r{A}. Our model reveals that, in order to fit the observed light\ncurve of HAT-P-18b, the planet must possess a trailing helium tail of\n$15.79^{+1.14}_{-1.05}$ planetary radii. We carry out injection-recovery tests\nto validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

In this\npaper, we present the discovery of another polymorph of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$\nobtained by high-temperature solution growth, that presents different physical\nproperties than the arc-melted polycrystalline sample. Despite the similarities\nin crystal structure and chemical composition, the Eu valence transition is\nalmost fully suppressed in the solution-grown crystals, allowing the moments\nassociated with the Eu$^{2+}$ state to order antiferromagnetically at around\n14~K. A detailed analysis of the crystal structure using single crystal X-ray\ndiffraction reveals that, although the solution grown crystals are built from\nthe same constituent layers as the arc-melted samples, these layers present a\ndifferent stacking. The effect of different thermal treatments is also studied.\nDifferent anneal procedures did not result in significant changes of the\nintrinsic properties, and only by arc-melting and quenching the crystals we\nwere able to convert them into the previously reported polymorph.",

    "abstract": "Physical processes evolving in both time and space are often modeled using\nPartial Differential Equations (PDEs). Recently, it has been shown how\nstability analysis and control of coupled PDEs in a single spatial variable can\nbe more conveniently performed using an equivalent Partial Integral Equation\n(PIE) representation. The construction of this PIE representation is based on\nan analytic expression for the inverse of the spatial differential operator,\n$\\partial_s^{d}$, on the domain defined by boundary conditions. In this paper,\nwe show how this univariate representation may be extended inductively to\nmultiple spatial variables by representing the domain as the intersection of\nlifted univariate domains. Specifically, we show that if each univariate domain\nis well-posed, then there exists a readily verified consistency condition which\nis necessary and sufficient for existence of an inverse to the multivariate\nspatial differential operator,\n$D^\\alpha=\\partial_{s_1}^{\\alpha_1}\\cdots\\partial_{s_N}^{\\alpha_N}$, on the PDE\ndomain. Furthermore, we show that this inverse is an element of a $*$-algebra\nof Partial Integral (PI) operators defined by polynomial semi-separable\nkernels. Based on this operator algebra, we show that the evolution of any\nsuitably well-posed linear multivariate PDE may be described by a PIE,\nparameterized by elements of the PI algebra. A convex computational test for\nPDE stability is then proposed using a positive matrix parameterization of\npositive PI operators, and software (PIETOOLS) is provided which automates the\nprocess of representation and stability analysis of such PDEs. This software is\nused to analyze stability of 2D heat, wave, and plate equations, obtaining\naccurate bounds on the rate of decay.",

In this framework, the formalism of Dirac-von Neumann can be used.\nThis discreteness hypothesis implies that given two different points in space,\nthere is no continuous curve (a world line) joining them. Consequently, this\nhypothesis is not compatible with the theory of relativity. We propose\n$\\mathbb{R}\\times(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathcal{X})^{3}$ as a model of a space-time.\nFor simplicity, we work out our models using\n$\\mathbb{R}\\times(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathcal{X})$ as the configuration space.\nQuantum mechanics (QM), in the sense of Dirac-von Neumann, on the Hilbert space\n$L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathcal{X})$ is a non-local theory: the Hamiltonians\nare non-local operators, and thus, spooky action at a distance is allowed.

This version of QM can be specialized to\nstandard QM by using Hamiltonians acting on wavefunctions supported on the\nregion $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$. We apply the developed formalism to the\nmeasurement problem. We propose a new mechanism for the collapse of the\nwavefunction.

    "abstract": "Photoexcitation of single-layered La$_{0.5}$Mn$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ has played a\nkey role in understanding orbital ordering and non-thermal states in the\nmanganites. However, while orbital ordering in La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$\nbreaks the in-plane C$_4$ symmetry, many layered manganites show much more\ncomplex phase diagrams in which orbital ordering emerges from an already\nsymmetry-broken high-temperature phase and also exhibit additional\nlow-temperature phases. In this work, we examine the role of these phases in\nrelation to orbital ordering in the single-layered manganite\nPr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ with a combination of optical reflection anisotropy\nand ultrafast broadband pump-probe spectroscopy. We find that the reflection\nanisotropy, measured in equilibrium, is strongly sensitive to charge and\norbital-ordering transition only. However, the ultrafast response, measuring\nthe non-equilibrium state is sensitive to all phases. In particular, we deduce\nthat coherent phonons modulate unoccupied electronic states that are sensitive\nto the different phases of the material. This gives rise to a non-linear\nscaling of the phonon signal with pump fluence at specific probe wavelengths.",

    "abstract": "Background and context: Debugging is a common and often frustrating challenge\nfor beginner programmers. Understanding students' debugging processes can help\nus identify the difficulties and misunderstandings they possess. However, we\ncurrently have limited knowledge of how secondary students debug in a\ntext-based language, a medium through which millions of students will learn to\nprogram in the future. Objectives: In this paper, we investigate the debugging\nbehaviour of K-12 students learning a text-based programming language, as part\nof an effort to shape how to effectively teach debugging to these students.\nMethod: We collected log data from 73 students attempting a set of debugging\nexercises using an online code editor. We inductively analysed these logs using\nqualitative content analysis, generating a categorisation of the debugging\nbehaviours observed. Findings: A range of behaviours were exhibited by\nstudents, skewed towards being ineffective. Most students were able to\npartially locate errors but often struggled to resolve them, sometimes\nintroducing additional errors in the process. We argue that students struggling\nto debug possess fragile knowledge, a lens through which we view the results.\nImplications: This paper highlights some of the difficulties K-12 learners have\nwhen debugging in a text-based programming language. We argue, like much\nrelated work, that effective debugging strategies should be explicitly taught,\nwhile ineffective strategies should be discouraged.",

This paper proposes the Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction\nFramework (MOHAF), a distributed resource allocation mechanism that jointly\noptimizes cost, Quality of Service (QoS), energy efficiency, and fairness.\nMOHAF integrates hierarchical clustering to reduce computational complexity\nwith a greedy, submodular optimization strategy that guarantees a (1-1/e)\napproximation ratio. A dynamic pricing mechanism adapts in real time to\nresource utilization, enhancing market stability and allocation quality.\nExtensive experiments on the Google Cluster Data trace, comprising 3,553\nrequests and 888 resources, demonstrate MOHAF's superior allocation efficiency\n(0.263) compared to Greedy (0.185), First-Price (0.138), and Random (0.101)\nauctions, while achieving perfect fairness (Jain's index = 1.000). Ablation\nstudies reveal the critical influence of cost and QoS components in sustaining\nbalanced multi-objective outcomes.

    "abstract": "A growing body of empirical work suggests that the widespread adoption of\ngenerative AI produces a significant homogenizing effect on information,\ncreativity, and cultural production. I first develop a novel theoretical\nframework to explain this phenomenon. I argue that a dynamic of AI-derivative\nepistemology, in which individuals increasingly defer to AI outputs, allows a\ncentralized AI Prism to function, a technical mechanism whose architecture is\ndesigned to reduce variance and converge on the statistical mean. This provides\na causal explanation for the generative monocultures observed in recent\nstudies. However, I contend this represents only the first stage of a more\ncomplex and dialectical process. This paper's central and paradoxical thesis is\nthat the very homogenization that flattens knowledge within specialized domains\nsimultaneously renders that knowledge into consistent modules that can be\nrecombined across them, a process foundational to innovation and creativity.\nHowever, this recombinant potential is not automatic, but rather conditional.\nThis paper argues that these opposing forces, homogenizing defaults versus\nrecombinant possibilities, are governed by the nature of human engagement with\nthe technology. The ultimate effect of generative AI is conditional on whether\nindividuals act as passive consumers deferring to the AI's statistical outputs,\nor as active curators who critically interrogate, re-contextualize, and\nrecombine them. The paper concludes by outlining the cognitive and\ninstitutional scaffolds required to resolve this tension, arguing they are the\ndecisive variable that determine whether generative AI becomes an instrument of\ninnovation or homogenization.",

    "abstract": "The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid\ntransformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool\ntowards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This\nshift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of\nproactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual\nframework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI\ninteraction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nconceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as\na tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of\nescalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an\nAdaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a\nCo-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural\ntheories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this\nframework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and\nresponsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a\ncritical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,\nexamining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared\nintentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while\nAI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed\nas a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant\nimplications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda\nfor AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning\nenvironments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.",

Design: Calibration offsets were simulated from a\nGaussian distribution. Two prediction models - a Bayesian regression model and\na nearest neighbor model - were trained on CLS-derived parameters and data from\nthe Oldenburg Hearing Health Repository (OHHR). CLS was chosen because it\nprovides level-independent measures (e.g., dynamic range) that remain robust\ndespite calibration errors.

    "abstract": "Community detection in directed networks is a central task in network\nanalysis. Unlike undirected networks, directed networks encode inherently\nasymmetric relationships, giving rise to sender and receiver roles that may\neach follow distinct community organizations with possibly different numbers of\ncommunities. Estimating these two community counts simultaneously is therefore\nconsiderably more challenging than in the undirected setting, yet it is\nessential for faithful model specification and reliable downstream inference.\nThis work addresses this challenge within the stochastic co-block model (ScBM),\na powerful statistical framework for capturing asymmetric relational structures\ninherent in directed networks. We propose a novel goodness-of-fit test based on\nthe deviation of the largest singular value of a normalized residual matrix\nfrom the constant value 2. We show that the upper bound of this test statistic\nconverges to zero under the null hypothesis, while this statistic goes to\ninfinity if the true model has finer communities than hypothesized. Leveraging\nthis tail bounds behavior, we develop an efficient sequential testing algorithm\nthat lexicographically explores candidate community number pairs. To enhance\nrobustness in practical settings, we further introduce a ratio-based variant\nthat detects the transition point in the test statistic sequence. We rigorously\nshow both algorithms' consistency in recovering the true sender and receiver\ncommunity counts under ScBM. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and\nrobustness of our methods in estimating community numbers across diverse ScBM\nsettings. %To our knowledge, this work presents the first theoretically\nguaranteed approach for jointly estimating the numbers of sender and receiver\ncommunities within the ScBM framework, providing a critical tool for reliable\ndirected network analysis.",

To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects.

Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects.

This capability stems from repurposing\npretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness.

On Abdomen MR-CT, it\nattained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th\npercentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard\ndeviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it\nimproves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked\ngain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a\ncompact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general\nsolution for clinical registration without additional training.",

    "abstract": "Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which\nmotivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the\nperformance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the\nlack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and\nii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To\naddress the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis\nfor contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can\ngeneralize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive\nlearning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph\naugmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the\nnode degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,\nnamed Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),\nthat integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to\nimprove the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.\nThe results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the\nother state-of-the-art link prediction models.",

    "abstract": "Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the\nprobability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this\npaper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,\nwhich modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained\nvector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined\nproblem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that\nSGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide\nbounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an\napproximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.\nThe key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose\nthe sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we\nsystematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for\nasymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with\noptimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the\nvector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,\nphysics-informed generative tasks, and imaging inverse problems demonstrate the\neffectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.",

The fractional\ncorrelation functions are the moments of the imaginary multiplicative chaos, a\nrandom generalized function that we construct with respect to the\ninfinite-volume massless sine-Gordon measure. The renormalized determinants are\nthe tau functions of Sato--Miwa--Jimbo as identified by Palmer.\n  The construction and a priori control of the imaginary multiplicative chaos\ncombines methods from stochastic analysis (of singular SPDE flavor) for\nshort-scale regularity with qualitative input from integrability for\nlarge-scale control. The exact identification of the correlation functions with\nthe renormalized determinants relies on finite-volume approximation, regularity\nestimates for the mass perturbation, and analytic continuation in the coupling\nconstant.\n  The combination of existing results for tau functions with our identification\nimplies various predictions for the sine-Gordon model such as that the\nfractional two-point functions are expressed as Fredholm determinants and\nsatisfy certain PDEs as predicted by Bernard--LeClair. Using asymptotics of\nFredholm determinants of Basor--Tracy and mixing of the massless sine-Gordon\nmodel at the free fermion point, which we prove, we further derive the exact\nformula for the one-point function predicted by Lukyanov--Zamolodchikov (at the\nfree fermion point).",

    "abstract": "Quasi-uniformity is a fundamental geometric property of point sets, crucial\nfor applications such as kernel interpolation, Gaussian process regression, and\nspace-filling experimental designs. While quasi-Monte Carlo methods are widely\nrecognized for their low-discrepancy characteristics, understanding their\nquasi-uniformity remains important for practical applications. For the\ntwo-dimensional Sobol' sequence, Sobol' and Shukhman (2007) conjectured that\nthe separation radius of the first $N$ points achieves the optimal rate\n$N^{-1/2}$, which would imply quasi-uniformity. This conjecture was disproved\nby Goda (2024), who computed exact values of the $\\ell^2$-separation radius for\na sparse subsequence $N = 2^{2^v-1}$. However, the general behavior of the\nSobol' sequence for arbitrary $N$ remained unclear. In this paper, we derive\nexact expressions for the $\\ell^\\infty$-separation radius of the first $N =\n2^m$ points of the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence for all $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nAs an immediate consequence, we show that the separation radius of Sobol'\npoints is $O(N^{-3/4})$, which is strictly worse than the optimal rate\n$N^{-1/2}$, revealing that the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence has a suboptimal\nmesh ratio that grows at least as $N^{1/4}$.",

    "abstract": "Using Monte Carlo techniques, we calculate the bremsstrahlung spectrum that\nprotons and electrons in the solar wind would produce when encountering dark\nmatter (DM) particles within the solar system. We consider two types of\ninteractions for the DM: one where a spin-1/2 neutral DM particle interacts\nwith matter through the exchange of a lighter neutral scalar DM particle and\none where a scalar neutral DM particle interacts directly with the matter\nparticle. We consider three wavelengths: 21 cm, 3 mm, and 12 microns. In order\nto estimate the significance of the signal, we compare our results to\nexperimental results from ARCADE2 and PLANCK, and consider the sensitivities of\nthree telescopes: VLA, ALMA and KECK. We find that in order to produce an\nobservable signal in the first scenario, the neutral fermion must have a mass\ncomparable to the solar wind particle while the exchanged particle must have a\nmass typically $few\\times 10^5$ smaller. The scalar direct interaction however\nappears beyond reach for any reasonable coupling.",

    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement manifests as a distinctive correlation between particles\nthat transcends classical boundaries when their quantum states cannot be\ndescribed independently.

In the case of entanglement, this is known\nas entanglement sudden death (ESD). Decoherence mechanisms are examined,\nfocusing on how various environmental factors, such as thermal,\nelectromagnetic, and collisional decoherence, influence the integrity of\nentangled states. The role of quantum noise, such as amplitude damping, phase\ndamping, and depolarizing, is also analyzed. By integrating theoretical\ninsights with experimental findings, this study highlights the delicate balance\nbetween maintaining entanglement and mitigating decoherence.

In the\nfirst step, to capture complex multi-currency and currency-interest rate\nrelationships, we formulate FXRP as an edge-level regression problem on a\ndiscrete-time spatiotemporal graph. This graph consists of currencies as nodes\nand exchanges as edges, with interest rates and foreign exchange rates serving\nas node and edge features, respectively. We then introduce a graph-learning\nmethod that leverages the spatiotemporal graph to address the FXRP problem. In\nthe second step, we present a stochastic optimization problem to exploit FXSAs\nwhile accounting for the observation-execution time lag. To address this\nproblem, we propose a graph-learning method that enforces constraints through\nprojection and ReLU, maximizes risk-adjusted return by leveraging a graph with\nexchanges as nodes and influence relationships as edges, and utilizes the\npredictions from the FXRP method for the constraint parameters and node\nfeatures. Moreover, we prove that our FXSA method satisfies empirical arbitrage\nconstraints. The experimental results demonstrate that our FXRP method yields\nstatistically significant improvements in mean squared error, and that the FXSA\nmethod achieves a 61.89% higher information ratio and a 45.51% higher Sortino\nratio than a benchmark.

Existing approaches suffer from two key\nlimitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and\ndata-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while\nlarge language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural\nlanguage interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical\nreasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose\nTransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal\nmodeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our\napproach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex\ndependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph\nattention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured\nembeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via\nreinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input\ncharacteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework\noperates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,\ndynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and\nprojecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to\ngenerate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three\ntasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised\nand zero-shot settings.

    "abstract": "Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in\nreal time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It\nbecomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate\nlimitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are\ncharacterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,\nthat can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB\ncameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the\nchallenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we\npropose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object\npose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the\ncore advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an\nevent-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement\nan object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF\nvelocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the\nmethod can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm\nis tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating\nits effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient simulation of non-adiabatic dynamics is highly\ndesirable for understanding charge and energy transfer in complex systems. A\nkey criterion for obtaining an accurate method is conservation of the Quantum\nBoltzmann Distribution (QBD). For a single surface, Matsubara dynamics is known\nto conserve the QBD, as a consequence of truncating the dynamics in the higher\nnormal modes of the imaginary-time path integral. Recently, a Non-Adiabatic\nMatsubara (NA-Mats) dynamics has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 154,\n124124) which truncates in the normal modes of the nuclear variables but not in\nthe electronic variables, which are described with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss\n(MMST) representation. Surprisingly, this NA-Mats method does not appear to\nconserve the QBD for a general system. This poses the question of the effect of\ntruncating the higher normal modes of the electronic variables in the MMST\nrepresentation. In this article, we present what we believe is the first study\nof electronic normal modes of the MMST representation. We find that observables\nare not usually a function of a finite number of normal modes and that the\nhigher normal modes are not constrained by the distribution, unlike in\nconventional nuclear normal modes. While for an ensemble of trajectories,\ntruncation in MMST normal modes appears to numerically conserve the QBD, this\nis not the case for a single trajectory. When considering a correlation\nfunction, all MMST normal modes are required to obtain reasonable dynamics.\nOverall, this suggests that MMST variables are not optimal for obtaining an\naccurate, QBD conserving nonadiabatic dynamics method.",

Additionally, server-side\nfiltering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that\nreduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes\nthe need for server-side filtering.

We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,\nincluding strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,\nwithout requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge\ndistillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID\nscenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions.

    "abstract": "Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated\ntechnology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and\nenhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly\nspecialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers\nto buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to\ndevelop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform\nmultiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry\nexperts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these\ncollaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to\nensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand\nwhat the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a\nsafety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.\nFor safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors\nnearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human\ncomes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an\ninstrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact\nbetween objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce\na method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an\nLED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we\ndesign a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the\nhuman to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure\nsafe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's\nactions which we validate through a user study.",

    "abstract": "Statistical arbitrages (StatArbs) driven by machine learning has garnered\nconsiderable attention in both academia and industry. Nevertheless,\ndeep-learning (DL) approaches to directly exploit StatArbs in options markets\nremain largely unexplored. Moreover, prior graph learning (GL) -- a\nmethodological basis of this paper -- studies overlooked that features are\ntabular in many cases and that tree-based methods outperform DL on numerous\ntabular datasets. To bridge these gaps, we propose a two-stage GL approach for\ndirect identification and exploitation of StatArbs in options markets. In the\nfirst stage, we define a novel prediction target isolating pure arbitrages via\nsynthetic bonds. To predict the target, we develop RNConv, a GL architecture\nincorporating a tree structure. In the second stage, we propose SLSA -- a class\nof positions comprising pure arbitrage opportunities. It is provably of minimal\nrisk and neutral to all Black-Scholes risk factors under the arbitrage-free\nassumption. We also present the SLSA projection converting predictions into\nSLSA positions. Our experiments on KOSPI 200 index options show that RNConv\nstatistically significantly outperforms GL baselines, and that SLSA\nconsistently yields positive returns, achieving an average P&L-contract\ninformation ratio of 0.1627. Our approach offers a novel perspective on the\nprediction target and strategy for exploiting StatArbs in options markets\nthrough the lens of DL, in conjunction with a pioneering tree-based GL.",

While deep learning-based\naccelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from\nundersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with\ninfinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical\ntasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as\nacceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are\neither unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical\nendpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition\nframework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a\nprobabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then\npropagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of\ninterest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use\nconformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated\nconfidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively\nsamples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence\ninterval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a\nuser-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and\ncardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach\nreduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal\nstatistical guarantees on the precision of the final image.

A secular, linear, factor of ~2.5 increase is\nfound in the strength of the [O III] lines relative to H-beta over an 130 year\nperiod in the young, well-known, low excitation planetary nebula IC 418. The\nincrease is caused by the rising temperature of the central star. We use\nphoto-ionization models to derive a model dependent heating rate for the\ncentral star in the range 15-42 K\\/yr. These derived heating rates are very\nsensitive to the stellar mass, and yield a central-star mass of 0.560-0.583\nsolar masses.

We here propose a\nmeasurement-based protocol that leverages the resonant Jaynes-Cummings\ninteraction of the bosonic mode with an ancillary two-level atom and sequential\nprojective measurements on the atom. Using the generalized parity measurement\nconstructed by several rounds of free-evolution and measurement with proper\nintervals, we can efficiently filter out the unwanted population and push the\ntarget mode conditionally toward the desired Fock state. In ideal situation, a\nFock state $|n_t\\approx2000\\rangle$ can be prepared with a fidelity over $98\\%$\nusing only $8$ rounds of measurements. With qubit dissipation and dephasing and\ncavity decay in the current circuit QED platforms, a Fock state\n$|n_t\\approx100\\rangle$ can be prepared with a fidelity about $80\\%$ by $6$\nmeasurements. It is found that the number of the measurement rounds for\npreparing a large Fock state $|n_t\\rangle$ scales roughly as\n$\\log_2\\sqrt{n_t}$, similar to the number of ancillary qubits required in the\nstate preparation via the quantum phase estimation algorithm yet costs much\nless gate operations. Our protocol can also be used to prepare a large Dicke\nstate $|J<1000,0\\rangle$ of a spin ensemble with a sufficiently high fidelity\nby less than $3$ measurements, which is qualified for the quantum Fisher\ninformation approaching the Heisenberg scaling in sensing the rotation phase\nalong the $x$ axis.",

In the $\\Lambda$CDM model, analyses performed with various\ncosmological datasets indicate that the growth index has to be larger than its\ntheoretically predicted value. Cosmological models based on $f(R)$ gravity\ntheories have scale-dependent growth indices, whose values are even more at\nodds with the growth rate data.

However, real-world applications often involve\nmultiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints\nmay emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a\npre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but\nalso to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we\npropose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion\nLanguage Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:\nmolecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a\npre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure\nControl Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two\ndistinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM\nto inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively\nanchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further\nintroducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated\nmolecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.\nExperimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and\nadaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement\nin molecular generation for drug discovery applications.",

These systems excel at producing fluent, coherent\ncontent, but often lack support for high-quality teaching. The reason is\ntwofold: first, commercial LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini which are among the\nmost widely accessible to teachers, do not come preloaded with the depth of\npedagogical theory needed to design truly effective activities; second,\nalthough sophisticated prompt engineering can bridge this gap, most teachers\nlack the time or expertise and find it difficult to encode such pedagogical\nnuance into their requests. This study shifts pedagogical expertise from the\nuser's prompt to the LLM's internal architecture. We embed the well-established\nKnowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework into a Multi-Agent System (MAS)\nto act as a sophisticated instructional designer. We tested three systems for\ngenerating secondary Math and Science learning activities: a Single-Agent\nbaseline simulating typical teacher prompts; a role-based MAS where agents work\nsequentially; and a collaborative MAS-CMD where agents co-construct activities\nthrough conquer and merge discussion. The generated materials were evaluated by\n20 practicing teachers and a complementary LLM-as-a-judge system using the\nQuality Matters (QM) K-12 standards. While the rubric scores showed only small,\noften statistically insignificant differences between the systems, the\nqualitative feedback from educators painted a clear and compelling picture.\nTeachers strongly preferred the activities from the collaborative MAS-CMD,\ndescribing them as significantly more creative, contextually relevant, and\nclassroom-ready.

Exploiting the\ninterplay between momentum translation and spin rotation, we uncover a distinct\nlinear transport response governed by a generalized quantum geometric tensor,\nthe Zeeman quantum geometric tensor (ZQGT). We show that the ZQGT drives a\nlinear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in the three prototypical\ntwo-dimensional unconventional magnets: a time-reversal-broken $d_{x^2 - y^2}$\naltermagnet, a time-reversal-symmetric $p$-wave magnet, and a mixed $d$-wave\naltermagnet. Depending on symmetry, these magnets exhibit longitudinal,\ntransverse, or combined conduction and displacement IGMCs in the presence of\nspin-orbit coupling. Notably, this response persists even when conventional\nBerry curvature contributions vanish, offering a unique probe of hidden\nspin-split band structures of unconventional magnets. In particular, for mixed\n$d$-wave altermagnets, symmetric Berry curvature and antisymmetric quantum\nmetric respectively generate longitudinal conduction IGMC and transverse\ndisplacement IGMC- responses absent in conventional quantum geometry. The\npredicted signatures, relevant to compounds such as RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe,\nprovide experimentally accessible diagnostics for distinguishing unconventional\nmagnetic phases.

    "abstract": "Modern grids have adopted advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to\nfacilitate bidirectional communication between smart meters and control\ncenters. This enables smart meters to report consumption values at predefined\nintervals to utility providers for purposes including demand balancing, load\nforecasting, dynamic billing, and operational efficiency. Compared to\ntraditional power grids, smart grids offer advantages such as enhanced\nreliability, improved energy efficiency, and increased security. However,\nutility providers can compromise user privacy by analyzing fine-grained\nreadings and extracting individuals' daily activities from this time-series\ndata. To address this concern, we propose a collusion-resistant,\nprivacy-preserving aggregation protocol for smart metering in operational\nservices. Our protocol ensures privacy by leveraging techniques such as\npartially additive homomorphic encryption, aggregation, data perturbation, and\ndata minimization. The scheme aggregates perturbed readings using the additive\nhomomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem to provide results for\nmultiple operational purposes. We evaluate the protocol in terms of both\nperformance and privacy. Computational, memory, and communication overhead were\nexamined. The total execution time with 1024-bit key size is about 2.21\nseconds. We also evaluated privacy through the normalized conditional entropy\n(NCE) metric. Higher NCE values, closer to 1, indicate stronger privacy. By\nincreasing noise scale, the NCE value rises, showing perturbed values retain\nminimal information about the original, thereby reducing risks. Overall,\nevaluation demonstrates the protocol's efficiency while employing various\nprivacy-preserving techniques.",

We present a controlled evaluation\nframework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates\nsynthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a\ntypologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control\nover semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and\nmixed-language (code-switched) conditions.

The blast wave imposes a sharp velocity\ndiscontinuity, followed by a decaying flow field and a vortex-dominated\ninteraction that drives droplet disintegration.\n  Laser-induced heating promotes evaporation, increasing nanoparticle\nconcentration, viscosity, and agglomeration within the droplet. Progressive\nevaporation leads to interfacial nanoparticle accumulation, initiating a\nsol-gel transition when the local volume fraction exceeds the gelation\nthreshold, and ultimately forming a solid outer shell as the maximum packing\nlimit is approached.\n  Shock interactions are systematically examined across three evaporation\nstages: (i) steady liquid phase, (ii) gel-shell phase, and (iii) solid-shell\nphase. Each regime exhibits distinct atomisation responses due to the evolving\ninterfacial morphology. In the gel-shell regime, deformation is resisted by the\nviscous shell, producing a bag-on-sheet mode, followed by puncture, jetting,\nand eventual shell delamination. In the solid-shell regime, interactions\nintensify, resulting in brittle fragmentation and catastrophic fracture.\n  The findings reveal how evaporation-driven interfacial transitions\nfundamentally alter breakup mechanisms under transient shock loading.

To address this\nissue, in this paper, we propose a simple wave-level data augmentation method,\n\\textit{PadAug}, which aims to enhance the system's robustness to silence\nsegments. The core idea of \\textit{PadAug} is to concatenate silence segments\nwith speech segments at the waveform level for model training.

We are posting\nthis technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our\nplans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor,\nhoping this will support this growing community. In this work, we review\ncurrent methods for loading nanodiamonds into a Paul trap, and their\ncapabilities and limitations regarding our application. We also present our\nexperiments on loading and launching nanodiamonds using a vibrating\npiezoelectric element and by electrical forces. Finally, we present our design\nof a novel nanodiamond loading method for ultra-high-vacuum experiments. As the\nproduction of highly accurate, high-purity nanodiamonds with a single NV\nrequired for interferometric measurements is expected to be expensive, we put\nemphasis on achieving high loading efficiency, while loading the charged ND\ninto a Paul trap in ultra-high vacuum.",

    "abstract": "Processes involving severe plastic deformations (SPD) and phase\ntransformations and chemical reactions (PTs/CRs) under high pressures are\nwidespread for obtaining new nanostructured phases and their processing,\nmechanochemical synthesis, military applications, and nature. SPD strongly\nreduce the pressure required for PTs/CRs (by one-two orders of magnitude) and\nPT hysteresis; lead to hidden metastable phases, which cannot be obtained\notherwise, and substitute reversible PTs/CRs with irreversible ones. This\nreview is devoted to breakthroughs in understanding multifaceted interactions\nbetween high-pressure PTs/CRs, SPD, and microstructure evolution from the\nviewpoint of advanced mechanics and thermodynamics of materials under stress\nand plastic strain tensors. A novel concept of plastic strain-induced PTs/CRs\nunder high pressure is explored using four-scale theory and simulations (from\natomistic to nano- and scale-free phase-field approaches to macroscale) coupled\nto in situ experiments in traditional and rotational diamond anvil cells, and\ntheir integration. Its development revealed various phenomena and\nmisinterpretations, resolved numerous puzzles, found the first general rules in\nthese fields, and suggested ways for economic defect-induced synthesis of\nhigh-pressure phases and nanostructures. Coupled\nanalytical/computational/experimental approaches are developed for complete\ncharacterization of occurring processes and finding all heterogeneous scalar\nand tensorial fields. Applications include high-pressure torsion, surface\ntreatment, high-pressure tribology, PTs/CRs in shear bands leading to severe\ntransformation/reaction-induced plasticity and self-blown-up processes,\nmechanisms of deep-focus earthquakes, the appearance of microdiamonds in\nlow-pressure-temperature Earth crust, and the mechanochemical origin of life\nbeyond Earth. Unresolved problems and future directions are outlined.",

Its very active surface has hot spots produced by volcanic\neruptions popping up at seemingly random locations and times. Characterizing\nthe complex surface of Io requires the highest angular resolution available.\nThis work presents the analysis of Aperture Masking Interferometric\nobservations (at 4.3 um) of Io taken with the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless\nSpectrograph instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. These are the first\nspace-based infrared interferometric observations of a Solar System body ever\ntaken. For complex extended objects like Io, the traditional visibility\nextraction algorithms from interferograms suffer from limitations. Here, new\ndeconvolution methods based on Neural Networks allowed us to obtain reliable\nimages from which a detailed analysis of the volcanically active surface of\nthis moon was performed. Our study characterizes the loci and brightness of\nseveral unresolved volcanoes on the surface of Io, as well as the extended\nemission observed. We identified the brightest eruption (I_4.3um = 33 +/- 4.3\nGW/um), referred to as V1, within an area to the North-East of Seth Patera\n(129.4 +/- 0.8 deg. W. Longitude, 1.5 +/- 0.7 deg. S. Latitude). Its projected\nspeed (V_T = 86 +/- 34 m/s) is consistent with the rotational speed of Io.\nAdditionally, six fainter volcanoes were identified and characterized.\nComplementary ground-based images, taken with the Keck II telescope, allowed us\nto benchmark the deconvolved Aperture Masking Interferometric images, showing\nconsistency. Finally, we highlight the importance of characterizing Io's\nsurface with long-term monitoring at high-angular resolution.",

    "abstract": "Photon-Counting Computed Tomography (PCCT) is a novel imaging modality that\nsimultaneously acquires volumetric data at multiple X-ray energy levels,\ngenerating separate volumes that capture energy-dependent attenuation\nproperties. Attenuation refers to the reduction in X-ray intensity as it passes\nthrough different tissues or materials. This spectral information enhances\ntissue and material differentiation, enabling more accurate diagnosis and\nanalysis. However, the resulting multivolume datasets are often complex and\nredundant, making visualization and interpretation challenging. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a method for fusing spectral PCCT data into a\nsingle representative volume that enables direct volume rendering and\nsegmentation by leveraging both shared and complementary information across\ndifferent channels. Our approach starts by computing 2D histograms between\npairs of volumes to identify those that exhibit prominent structural features.\nThese histograms reveal relationships and variations that may be difficult to\ndiscern from individual volumes alone. Next, we construct an extremum graph\nfrom the 2D histogram of two minimally correlated yet complementary\nvolumes-selected to capture both shared and distinct features-thereby\nmaximizing the information content. The graph captures the topological\ndistribution of histogram extrema. By extracting prominent structure within\nthis graph and projecting each grid point in histogram space onto it, we reduce\nthe dimensionality to one, producing a unified volume. This representative\nvolume retains key structural and material characteristics from the original\nspectral data while significantly reducing the analysis scope from multiple\nvolumes to one. The result is a topology-aware, information-rich fusion of\nmulti-energy CT datasets that facilitates more effective visualization and\nsegmentation.",

To address these limitations, we introduce\nGSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in\nunder-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models\ninto 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene\ndetails. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our\ncustomized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to\nadapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact\ntypes from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair\nfor unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation\nstrategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.\nExperiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer\nachieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific\nfine-tuning on captured data.

Radio detection threshold, influenced by natural and\nanthropogenic radio background, can be reduced through various techniques. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an\neffective way to lower the threshold. We developed two CNNs: a classifier to\ndistinguish radio signal waveforms from background noise and a denoiser to\nclean contaminated radio signals. Following the training and testing phases, we\napplied the networks to air-shower data triggered by scintillation detectors of\nthe prototype station for the enhancement of IceTop, IceCube's surface array at\nthe South Pole. Over a four-month period, we identified 554 cosmic-ray events\nin coincidence with IceTop, approximately five times more compared to a\nreference method based on a cut on the signal-to-noise ratio. Comparisons with\nIceTop measurements of the same air showers confirmed that the CNNs reliably\nidentified cosmic-ray radio pulses and outperformed the reference method.\nAdditionally, we find that CNNs reduce the false-positive rate of air-shower\ncandidates and effectively denoise radio waveforms, thereby improving the\naccuracy of the power and arrival time reconstruction of radio pulses.",

In this paper, we consider CPS with a\ndiscrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven\napproach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon\nof n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct\n(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic\nand probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an\nadditional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process\nfollows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a\nguided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach\nwith a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.",

First, a compact neural network predicts enhanced acoustic features\nfrom noisy speech: spectral envelope, fundamental frequency (F0), and\nperiodicity.

The system is trained end-to-end with STFT and adversarial\nlosses, enabling direct optimization at the feature and waveform levels.\nExperimental results show that our method improves intelligibility and quality\nby 4% (STOI) and 19% (DNSMOS) over strong baselines without significantly\nincreasing computation, making it well-suited for real-time applications.",

    "abstract": "Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using\ndata-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data\nusually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most\ninstitutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other\nhand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific\ndata, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is\ntransferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly\nvaluable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the\ndevelopment of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new\nmodel-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and\npreservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a\nshared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by\ntheir distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation\nstrategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating\nknowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.\nBy unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit\nteachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.\nOur model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently\nsupports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nVFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision\ntasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance\nsegmentation.",

These sensory-rich modalities are beyond\nthe scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present\nShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data\nscarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text\nand 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and\nphysiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to\nachieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect\nrecent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for\nMedicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that\nShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger\nproprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among\nexisting multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities\nlike sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal\nperception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly\navailable. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.",

To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based\nevaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static\nevaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that\nautomatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.\nThrough extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models\nsuch as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit\nsignificant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a\nsignificant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input\ntokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it\nintroduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity\nwith the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents\nlike Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.\nBeyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI\nsupport, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new\nagents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP\necosystem.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of smart grids and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has\nrevolutionized energy management. Unlike traditional power grids, smart grids\nbenefit from two-way communication through AMI, which surpasses earlier\nautomated meter reading (AMR). AMI enables diverse demand- and supply-side\nutilities such as accurate billing, outage detection, real-time grid control,\nload forecasting, and value-added services. Smart meters play a key role by\ndelivering consumption values at predefined intervals to the utility provider\n(UP). However, such reports may raise privacy concerns, as adversaries can\ninfer lifestyle patterns, political orientations, and the types of electrical\ndevices in a household, or even sell the data to third parties (TP) such as\ninsurers. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, privacy-preserving smart\nmetering protocol for incentive-based value-added services. The scheme employs\nlocal differential privacy, hash chains, blind digital signatures, pseudonyms,\ntemporal aggregation, and anonymous overlay networks to report coarse-grained\nvalues with adjustable granularity to the UP. This protects consumers' privacy\nwhile preserving data utility. The scheme prevents identity disclosure while\nenabling automatic token redemption. From a performance perspective, our\nresults show that with a 1024-bit RSA key, a 7-day duration, and four reports\nper day, our protocol runs in approximately 0.51s and consumes about 4.5 MB of\nmemory. From a privacy perspective, the protocol resists semi-trusted and\nuntrusted adversaries.",

In this work, we theoretically and\nnumerically demonstrate and experimentally validate the existence of\ntopologically protected phonon-polaritonic BICs in periodic arrays of\ncylindrical nanoresonators composed of isotopically enriched hexagonal boron\nnitride (h11BN), which have the availability of two restrahlen bands (lower\n(type-I) and upper (type II)), operating in the lower Reststrahlen band (RB-1).\nOwing to the uniaxial anisotropy of hBN and the rotational symmetry of the\nstructure, these systems support topologically symmetry-protected BICs at the\n{\\Gamma}-point, where radiative losses are fully suppressed. The total quality\nfactor is ultimately bounded by the intrinsic phonon damping of h11BN, enabling\nhigh-Q polaritonic modes with minimal radiation leakage. When cylindrical\nsymmetry is broken via angular tilting of incident light away from the normal\nincidence, these BICs transition into quasi-BICs (q-BICs) with strong field\nconfinement and tunable radiation leakage. This topological protection enables\nrobust control over mode lifetimes and confinement, paving the way toward\nscalable polaritonic platforms for mid-infrared optoelectronics, sensing, and\nquantum nanophotonics.",

ML models have\ndemonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with\nthe tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in\ncomputer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly\nthose trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These\nlatent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability\nof the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses\ncould be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic\nframework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial\nperturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based\nattack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data\nin both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm\nthat tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the\nneed for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners\nregarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments\nby transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to\nnon-gradient-based models also verify our findings.

We describe the\nkey components of protocol specification and its emulation and demonstrate the\napproach using electronic medical record data to evaluate how hypothetical\ninterventions on pulse oximeter racial bias affect disparities in treatment\nreceipt in clinical care. We also extend semiparametric G-computation for\ntime-to-event outcomes in continuous time to accommodate continuous, stochastic\ninterventions, allowing counterfactual estimation of disparities in\ntime-to-treatment. More broadly, the framework accommodates a wide range of\nintervention and outcome types. The TS+TT framework offers a versatile and\npolicy-relevant tool for generating ethically aligned causal evidence to help\neliminate disparities and avoid unintentionally exacerbating disparities.",

The major challenges lie in: i) how to formulate optimization\nproblems to obtain an optimal distribution of stochastic input, under unknown\nprediction accuracy of the adversary; and ii) how to achieve the trade-off\nbetween the unpredictability and control performance.

State-of-the-art deblurring methods for\nextreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches\nlike Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose\nestimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods\nrelying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to\nunreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly\nfrom extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep\nlearning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and\ngenerates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which\nenables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a\nprobability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and\n(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for\nstable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,\ninaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,\nwe propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:\n(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that\nare then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and\noverall reconstruction.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a distributed diagnosis scheme to detect and estimate\nactuator and power line faults in DC microgrids subject to unknown power loads\nand stochastic noise. To address actuator faults, we design a fault estimation\nfilter whose parameters are determined through a tractable optimization problem\nto achieve fault estimation, decoupling from power line faults, and robustness\nagainst noise. In contrast, the estimation of power line faults poses greater\nchallenges due to the inherent coupling between fault currents and unknown\npower loads, which becomes ill-posed when the underlying system is\ninsufficiently excited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nto address this critical yet underexplored issue. Our solution introduces a\nnovel differentiate-before-estimate strategy. A set of diagnostic rules based\non the temporal characteristics of a constructed residual is developed to\ndistinguish load changes from line faults. Once a power line fault is detected,\na regularized least-squares method is activated to estimate the fault currents,\nfor which we further derive an upper bound on the estimation error. Finally,\ncomprehensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethods.",

Two-qubit gates may be realised in these codes using only\nnearest-neighbour interactions, either by lattice surgery or by braiding\ndefects around each other. The effect of lattice surgery operations may be\nsimply described using the ZX-calculus: a graphical language that has proven\neffective for program design and optimisation. In this work, we formalise a\nsimilar description via the ZX-calculus of defect braiding, as it is\nconventionally described. We define a graphical calculus KNOT, denoting the\nlogical effects (in the absence of byproduct operations) of defect braiding in\nsurface codes: we show how these effects may be described via a fragment of\nZX-calculus which we call the (0, pi)-fragment. We then use a doubling\nconstruction to define a subtheory of KNOT, more specialised to standard\nencoding techniques in the defect braiding literature. Within this subtheory,\nwe encompass standard braiding techniques by families of ribbon-like and\ntangle-like diagrams, each with semantics distinct from KNOT, in terms of the\n(0, pi)-fragment of ZX diagrams (again in the absence of byproducts).

    "abstract": "In the one-way model of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC),\ncomputation proceeds via single-qubit measurements on a resource state. Flow\nconditions ensure that the overall computation is deterministic in a suitable\nsense, and are required for efficient translation into quantum circuits.\nProcedures that rewrite MBQC patterns -- e.g. for optimisation, or adapting to\nhardware constraints -- thus need to preserve the existence of flow. Most\nprevious work has focused on rewrites that reduce the number of qubits in the\ncomputation, or that introduce new Pauli-measured qubits. Here, we consider the\ninsertion of planar-measured qubits into MBQC patterns, i.e. arbitrary\nmeasurements in a plane of the Bloch sphere spanned by a pair of Pauli\noperators; such measurements are necessary for universal MBQC. We extend the\ndefinition of causal flow, previously restricted to XY -measurements only, to\nalso permit YZ-measurements and derive the conditions under which a\nYZ-insertion preserves causal flow. Then we derive conditions for YZ-insertion\ninto patterns with gflow or Pauli flow, in which case the argument\nstraightforwardly extends to XZ-insertions as well. We also show that the\n'vertex splitting' or 'neighbour unfusion' rule previously used in the\nliterature can be derived from YZ-insertion and pivoting. This work contributes\nto understanding the broad properties of flow-preserving rewriting in MBQC and\nin the ZX-calculus more broadly, and it will enable more efficient\noptimisation, obfuscation, or routing.",

    "abstract": "The quantitative description of lubricant flow in nanoscale channels is\ncomplicated by various finite-size effects that are not taken into account in\nconventional thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) models. One of these\neffects is wall slip, a phenomenon that has been extensively studied both\ntheoretically and experimentally. The relationship between wall slip and\nthermal effects is intricate, and some authors debate whether the friction\nreduction observed in their experiments in the TEHL regime can be explained by\neither slip or viscosity reduction in heated lubricants. To disentangle these\nmechanisms, a comprehensive molecular dynamics study of the relationship\nbetween temperature and slip in the shear flow of a 4 cSt polyalphaolefin\n(PAO4) base oil in a nanoscale diamond-like carbon (DLC) channel is performed\nhere. An Eyring law describes the relationship between slip velocity and shear\nstress at the solid-liquid interface for a given temperature and pressure. The\nsame simulation campaign provides a pressure-dependent law for the interface\nthermal resistance (ITR) between DLC and PAO4. These constitutive laws are\nemployed in a continuum model for lubricated parallel channels. By taking heat\nconduction into account and combining the slip and ITR laws with a temperature-\nand pressure-dependent Eyring viscosity law, questions about the competition of\nslip and thermal thinning of the lubricant can be answered. For DLC film\nthicknesses compatible with tribological experiments and applications, this\nmodel shows that slip is only relevant for very thin lubricant films that are\ntypical of boundary lubrication, suggesting the dominance of thermal thinning\nin the TEHL regime.",

To address this, we\nintroduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot\nframework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense\nemploys a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps\n(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point\nPrompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive\nthresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances\nsegmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM\nquality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that\nincorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered\nscenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages\nfeature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM\ncombining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance\nseparation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask\nRejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using\noutlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce\nPerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense\nimages. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nPerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.",

We focus on situations when transport\ndominates, leading to significant variations in particle velocity. Nonetheless,\nthese velocity changes remain finite due to the presence of KAM tori bounding\nphase space. We analyze the conditions under which transport can be modeled as\na diffusion process and evaluate the relevance of the so-called quasilinear\nvalue of the diffusion coefficient. We distinguish between traditional\nquasilinear diffusion, when wave-particle interaction is perturbative, and the\nso-called chaotic regime of diffusion, when the particle motion looks erratic.\nIn the perturbative regime, we demonstrate both numerically and theoretically\nthat diffusion occurs only when wave-particle interaction is local in phase\nvelocity; that is, when wave contributions from phase velocities far from the\nparticles instantaneous velocities are negligible. Conversely, numerical\nresults indicate that chaotic diffusion can occur even when wave-particle\ninteraction is not local. Furthermore, in regimes when quasilinear diffusion is\napplicable, we introduce a simple analytical expression for the time evolution\nof the velocity distribution function, that accounts for phase space\nboundaries.",

Urban\nflooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,\nthreatening public safety and mobility.

The Australia\nTelescope Compact Array automatically triggered a 9-hour observation of GRB\n231117A at 5.5 and 9 GHz following its detection by the Neil Gehrels Swift\nObservatory just 1.3 hours post-burst. Splitting this observation into 1-hour\ntime bins, the early radio afterglow exhibited flaring, scintillating and\nplateau phases. The scintillation allowed us to place the earliest upper limit\n($<10$ hours) on the size of a GRB blast wave to date, constraining it to\n$<1\\times10^{16}$ cm. Multi-wavelength modeling of the full afterglow required\na period of significant energy injection between $\\sim 0.02$ and $1$ day. The\nenergy injection was modeled as a violent collision of two shells: a reverse\nshock passing through the injection shell explains the early radio plateau,\nwhile an X-ray flare is consistent with a shock passing through the leading\nimpulsive shell. Beyond 1 day, the blast wave evolves as a classic decelerating\nforward shock with an electron distribution index of $p=1.66\\pm0.01$. Our model\nalso indicates a jet-break at $\\sim2$ days, and a half-opening angle of\n$\\theta_j=16\\mathring{.}6 \\pm 1\\mathring{.}1$.

The minimum Lorentz factors this\nmodel requires are consistent with constraints from the early radio\nmeasurements of $\\Gamma>35$ to $\\Gamma>5$ between $\\sim0.1$ and $1$ day.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for constructing $C^r$ basis\nfunctions for polynomial spline spaces of degree $d$ over arbitrary planar\npolygonal partitions, overturning the belief that basis functions cannot be\nconstructed on dimensionally unstable meshes. We provide a comprehensive\ncomparison of basis construction methods, classifying them as explicit,\nsemi-explicit, and implicit. Our method, a semi-explicit construction using\nExtended Edge Elimination conditions, uniquely resolves all theoretical\nchallenges in spline spaces by ensuring a complete basis. For the first time,\nwe construct basis functions for the spline space over the Morgan-Scott\npartition, previously unachieved, and elucidate dimensional instability through\nthis construction.",

    "abstract": "Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial\nintelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive\nexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark\ndatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset\nselection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale\nvision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data\npoints and outperforms strong baselines.",

Thus,\nrecommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into\naccount user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of\nsuch complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a\nnew paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search\nscenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,\nan end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as\nthere are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make\nfull use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance\nmultiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and\nstores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we\npropose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different\nperspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic\ninformation for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder\nleverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)\nneighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for\ngeneration. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and\npropose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the\nabove design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In\nfact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves\n400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in\nterms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.",

We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,\nby starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the\nLLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust\nare either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.\nThese findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their\nopinion may be deceiving.

This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping\nthe SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using\nPoincar\\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.\n  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived\na clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\\'e\nembeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were\nthen incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a\nTransformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute\ndifference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.\n  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\\'e embeddings resulted in modest\nand consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline\nmodels using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,\nparticularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\\'e embedding, showed enhanced\ncalibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across\nconfigurations.\n  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and\nintegrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung\ncancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical\nterminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method\nfor combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical\nknowledge.",

Most bars form rapidly in\ndynamically cold discs shortly after the central stellar mass exceeds that of\ndark matter. In these cases, bar formation is consistent with secular\ninstabilities driven by the disc's self-gravity, which organises stellar orbits\ninto a coherent bar structure. However, around 25 per cent of barred galaxies\nare dark matter dominated at the time of bar formation, $t_{bar}$, and remain\nso thereafter. We trace the origin of these bars to tidal perturbations induced\nby passing satellites or mergers using a new metric, $S_{bar}$, quantifying the\ntidal field acting on the galaxy. At the time of bar formation, we find a\nnegative correlation between $S_{bar}$ and the central stellar-to-dark matter\nmass fraction, indicating that more dark matter-dominated discs require\nstronger tides to trigger bar formation. These tidally induced bars are more\nlikely to be transient than those that form secularly, although bar properties\nare otherwise similar. However, the host galaxies differ: secular bars arise in\nrelatively compact discs, while tidal bars appear in extended discs whose\nproperties resemble those of unbarred galaxies. Tidal perturbations can\ntherefore induce bars in galaxies otherwise stable to secular formation,\nhighlighting the dual role of the internal galactic structure and the external\nenvironment in bar formation.",

In particular, quantum gate-based echo state networks have proven\neffective for learning when the evolution of the reservoir circuit is\nnon-unital. Nonetheless, a method for ensuring a tunable and stable non-unital\nevolution of the circuit was still lacking. We propose an algorithm for\ninducing damping by applying a controlled rotation to each qubit in the\nreservoir. It enables tunable, circuit-level amplitude amplification of the\nzero state, maintaining the system away from the maximally mixed state and\npreventing information loss caused by repeated mid-circuit measurements. The\nalgorithm is inherently stable over time as it can, in principle, process\narbitrarily long input sequences, well beyond the coherence time of individual\nqubits, by inducing an arbitrary damping on each qubit. Moreover, we show that\nquantum correlations between qubits provide an improvement in terms of memory\nretention, underscoring the potential utility of employing a quantum system as\na computational reservoir. We demonstrate, through typical benchmarks for\nreservoir computing, that such an algorithm enables robust and scalable quantum\nrandom computing on fault-tolerant quantum hardware.",

    "abstract": "Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that\navoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving\nefficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental\nbenefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing\nCDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as\ntrajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where\nexplainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study\naddresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)\nframework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley\nAdditive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive\ndataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related\nfeatures, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent\nSurveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then\napplied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by\nimportance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,\nwere then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the\nextraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification\naccuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for\noperational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the\narrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in\ndirectional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO\nperformance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway\nfor operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to\nenable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying\noperational conditions.",

While computational\nalgorithms and wavefront shaping can, in principle, reverse this mixing by\nexploiting the near-linear nature of light propagation, in practice the\ninversion process is highly susceptible to limitations such as the finite\nnumber of controllable modes, noise, losses, and inaccuracies in the forward\nmodel. Consequently, these approaches are only effective under tightly\ncontrolled conditions, limiting their impact on real-world imaging. Here, we\npresent a quantum entanglement-based approach that transmits images through\ncomplex media without inverting the scattering process. This method exploits a\nfundamental property of quantum entanglement: the preservation of photon\ncorrelations across multiple measurement bases. By tailoring the optical\ndisorder induced by a scattering layer to access one such basis,\nentanglement-encoded images of arbitrary objects hidden behind the medium can\nbe reconstructed via coincidence detection at the output. In contrast,\nclassical imaging under identical conditions fails, producing only speckle\npatterns with no object information.

Classical metric-based models of\nsimilarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a\nproperty that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been\ndetected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has\nreceived scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the\nchoice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for\nIIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the\nframework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our\nmain technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its\nmere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to\nelicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the\nsame item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both\ndatasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.\nFurther, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that\nthe population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are\ndriven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.\nThese results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account\nfor such context effects.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of\nlighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing\nsubtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models\n(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,\nthe spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional\nmodeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence\nthrough temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose\nthe Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the\nlatest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce\nSpatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points\ninto semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby\nenabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally\ndistant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion\ndetails, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates\nspatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction\nwithin the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances\nfine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and\nexpanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,\nand Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.",

There's yet another daunting problem generic to any\ninflationary model, and not particular to the Power Law Inflation, is the issue\nof classicalization of the primordial quantum perturbation. This issue is often\ntreated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked\nto tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any\nobservational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the\ncollapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the\ncollapse models do modify the Schr\\\"{o}dinger evolution of the quantum system\nand the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints. We show that collapsed\nmodified Power Law Inflation can indeed circumvent the issue with observations\nand can be made compatible with all the current data coming from {\\it Planck},\n{\\it ACT}, DESI and BAO while resolving the classicalization issue associated\nwith the quantum primordial fluctuations.

To\naddress these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor\narrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature\nrepresentations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase\nUncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke\ndetection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via\noptical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is\nperformed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set\nfractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The\nresulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a\nGaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke\nregions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows\nTransformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head\nand trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes\nsmoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to\nestimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

At a Reynolds\nnumber of 8600 and a Womersley number of 10, optimal waveforms reduce total\nenergy consumption by 22 % and drag by 37 %. These reductions are rooted in the\nsuppression of turbulence prior to the acceleration phase, the resulting delay\nin turbulence onset, and the radial localization of turbulent kinetic energy\nand production toward the pipe centre. Our results pinpoint that the\npredominant, steady operation mode of pumping fluids through pipes is far from\noptimal.",

    "abstract": "Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent\nadvances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture\nusers' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing\nmethods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user\nrepresentations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and\nuser-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in\ndownstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and\noverlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an\nAll-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.\nIt first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available\nrepresentations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the\nCRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into\ntransferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability\nvia multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level\ntransfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and\nStandalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully\ndeployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of\nbillions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters\nwith billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand\nfeatures. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+\nsuccessful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including\nprimary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an\noverall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated\nannual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.",

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest\ndue to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed\nones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other\nlanguage-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have\na Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the\narchitecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and\nmostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search\nspace effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an\nunorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we\npropose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive\nMutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse\narchitectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to\nsearch on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on\nthe basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that\ndynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using\nQ-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search\nspace. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective\nexploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id\n(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing\narchitectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method\nachieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.",

First, we encode poses\nusing bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to\nimprove the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we\nintroduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic\nsimilarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,\naiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey\nrelevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss\nalone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT\nbaseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves\na 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error.

Short-term power\nmarkets, such as the European continuous intraday market, play a critical role\nin mitigating these imbalances by enabling traders to adjust forecasts close to\nreal time. Due to the high volatility of the continuous intraday market,\ntraders increasingly rely on electricity price forecasting to guide trading\ndecisions and mitigate price risk. However most electricity price forecasting\napproaches in the literature simplify the forecasting task. They focus on\nsingle benchmark prices, neglecting intra-product price dynamics and price\nsignals from the limit order book. They also underuse high-frequency and\ncross-product price data.\n  In turn, we propose a novel directional electricity price forecasting method\nfor hourly products in the European continuous intraday market. Our method\nincorporates short-term features from both hourly and quarter-hourly products\nand is evaluated using German European Power Exchange data from 2024-2025. The\nresults indicate that features derived from the limit order book are the most\ninfluential exogenous variables. In addition, features from neighboring\nproducts; especially those with delivery start times that overlap with the\ntrading period of the target product; improve forecast accuracy.

To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft\nConsistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that\nenforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level\nsentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the\nfirst to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency\ngranularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that\nsignificantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public\ndataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%\nacross diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere\nmeaning-altering mistakes.

For the\nillustration, the 2023 editions of the most famous long races for females are\nconsidered: 34th Giro d'Italia Donne, 2nd Tour de France Femmes, 9th Vuelta\nFemenina.\n  Several classical ranking indicators are recalled and adapted to the study\ncases. The most usual indicator, $T_L$, is based on the riders arriving time\nfor the various stages, i.e., according to Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI)\nstandard rules. One also uses another indicator, $A_L$, which requires that the\nriders finish the race, whence each stage, in order to define the race best\nteam.\n  Another contribution of the paper derives from specific developments of these\nindicators, thereby leading to new measures: the ''leadership gap\" based on\n$A_L-T_L$, and the ''competition temperature\", based on entropy.

Although these new measurements\ncorrespond to different boson propagators and colliding energies, they are\nfound to have a similar impact to the light quark parton distributions with the\nmomentum fraction $x$ around 0.1. It manifests that the deviations are\nconsistent with each other and favor a larger valence $d_v/u_v$ ratio than the\nmodern PDF predictions. Further study indicates that such tension arises\ndominantly from the deep inelastic scattering measurements of NMC and the fixed\ntarget experiments of NuSea, both of which play pivotal roles in detecting the\nrelative $u$ and $d$ type quark contributions for modern PDFs.

    "abstract": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems has\nenabled zero-shot, personality-based personalization through prompt-based\ninteractions, offering a new paradigm for user-centric recommendations.\nHowever, incorporating user personality traits via the OCEAN model highlights a\ncritical tension between achieving psychological alignment and ensuring\ndemographic fairness. To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified\nevaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between\npersonalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using\nneutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we\nbenchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens\n10M) and music (Last.fm 360K) datasets. Our results reveal that\npersonality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual\ntraits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups.\nSpecifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher\nsensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less\npersonalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the\ndevelopment of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and\npsychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive,\nuser-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts.",

Our\nLeuvenshtein achieves up to $278\\times$ faster performance compared to the best\navailable TFHE implementation and up to $39\\times$ faster than an optimised\nimplementation of the Wagner-Fisher algorithm.

This study\ninvestigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed\nsolution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the\nperformance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a\nstructured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct\ncategories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths\n(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative\nactions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''\nexamples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each\ndecision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and\noverall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are\nsuccessful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in\nscenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs\nof epistemic actions.

It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt\namplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under\nperiodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the\nM\\\"obius phase.

With the\ngoal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a\ncomprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,\nincluding the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the\nevaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)\ntraditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and\nregion-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,\ndecision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep\nlearning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss\ndeep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object\ndetection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five\nAPBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing\ndata, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task\nlearning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among\ndifferent algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review\nproposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and\npotential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help\nresearchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and\ntendency.",

Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen\ndata, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing\nlow-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where\nintra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data\nvariability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit\neach document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the\nredundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs\nof a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce\nan extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment\nprocess and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in\ndocuments with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan\nmilitary archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.",

    "abstract": "New JWST observations have revealed the presence of a significant number of\nhigh-redshift barred galaxies. The origin of these bars remains unclear, and\ntheir properties appear difficult to reconcile with the results of cosmological\nsimulations of galaxy formation. I present an example of a tidally induced\nbar-like galaxy formed at z = 2.9 in the TNG100 suite of the IllustrisTNG\nsimulations. The galaxy was identified among the sample of bar-like galaxies\nstudied before and has the earliest bar formation time among the tidally\ninduced subsample of those objects. Its disk transformed into a bar as a result\nof a close interaction with a massive progenitor of a brightest cluster galaxy\n(BCG). It remained on a tight orbit around the host and survived until the\npresent, losing most of its initial mass and becoming red but preserving its\nprolate shape. Even before the interaction, at z = 3.5, the galaxy experienced\na few mergers, which elongated its shape. This temporary distortion also made\nit look like a bar with spiral extensions of up to 6 kpc. The long-lived bar\nformed later was about 3 kpc long and grew over the next few gigayears. This\nexample demonstrates that high-z bars should not be sought among the\nprogenitors of present-day simulated barred galaxies but rather among the\ntidally interacting early population of galaxies in forming groups and\nclusters. Some of these galaxies may have survived as ellipticals, and some may\nhave merged with their BCGs.",

On the other hand, black holes\nin Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity consistently exhibit non-zero static TLNs,\nwith their magnitude depending on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant.\nExceptions occur only in certain special cases associated with axial\nperturbations.

    "abstract": "In this paper we investigate analytically the formation of finite time\nsingularities in the three dimensional incompressible Euler equations under the\nmodel of Gibbon, Fokas, and Doering for vorticity stretching within a bounded\ncylindrical domain and under axisymmetric conditions. We derive explicit\nLagrangian solutions for the vorticity, its stretching rate, fluid pathlines,\nand velocity components by exploiting constants of motion associated with the\nfield dependent infinitesimal symmetries of the system. The central finding is\nthat the existence and nature of a finite time singularity are determined\nexclusively by the local geometric structure of the initial vortex stretching\nrate near its global minimum. Whether a singularity forms depends on how flat\nthis profile is at the minimum. Flatter profiles delay the blowup and\nsufficient flatness can suppress it entirely. For power law behavior near the\nminimum, critical thresholds for the exponent are identified which separate\nregular solutions from those that develop a finite time singularity. These\nthresholds differ depending on whether the singularity occurs at the centre of\nthe cylinder or on a ring away from the centre, with minima at the centre\nrequiring higher flatness to avoid blowup. This work provides a rigorous\nanalytical framework that elucidates how the local geometric structure of the\ninitial conditions governs the potential for singularity formation in 3D fluid\nflows, offering fundamental insights into the interplay between symmetry,\ninitial data, and the development of extreme events in idealised turbulence.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference\nscheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task\nservice process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM\nprocesses input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,\nit is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power\nconsumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key\nchallenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known\nupon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and\nprocessing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms\nthat leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the\nprediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each\nrequest.\n  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\max}$, which\nschedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to\nprevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as\nprediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to\npotential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted\nlower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during\ninferencing. We prove that $\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ achieves a log-scale\ncompetitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,\nhighlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.\nMoreover, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the\nprediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output\nlength are typically more challenging to predict accurately.",

However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift\narises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied\nwell. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients\nat each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that\ndeviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift\nsince the optimization objective shifts with every round.\n  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client\ndrift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on\ncross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases.

In this work, we propose\nWISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain\nvision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by\nselectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first\ncomputes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific\ntextual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves\nfine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a\nsmall subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly\neliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding\nhigh-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual\nembeddings to reinforce diagnostic context.

A promising quantum error-correcting code for\nlarge-scale quantum computing is the surface code. For this code,\nFault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery,\ni.e. merging and splitting of encoded qubit patches on a 2D grid. Lattice\nsurgery operations result in space-time patterns of activity that are defined\nin this work as access traces. This work demonstrates that the access traces\nreveal when, where, and how logical qubits interact. Leveraging this\nformulation, this work further introduces TraceQ, a trace-based reconstruction\nframework that is able to reconstruct the quantum circuit dataflow just by\nobserving the patch activity at each trace entry. The framework is supported by\nheuristics for handling inherent ambiguity in the traces, and demonstrates its\neffectiveness on a range of synthetic fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks. The\naccess traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling\nanalysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they\nrun on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such\ntraces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the\ncircuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even\nwhole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be\nused to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high\naccuracy. Only a single trace per program execution is needed and the\nprocessing can be done fully offline.

The magnetic field strength measurement via the Zeeman\neffect of OH maser emission is well established, but that of the methanol maser\nemission is still under debate because of its complex hyperfine structure. We\naim to identify the dominating hyperfine transition of the Class II methanol\nmaser emission by comparing the magnetic field strength measured with the\nexcited OH maser emission and the Zeeman splitting of the methanol maser\nemission. We used quasi-simultaneous EVN observations of the two maser\nemissions at 6.035 GHz ex-OH and 6.668 GHz methanol toward two well-known\nhigh-mass young stellar objects: ON 1 and W75N. The observations were performed\nin full polarimetric mode and in phase-referencing mode to couple the maser\nfeatures of the two maser emissions in each source. We detected linearly and\ncircularly polarized emission in both maser transitions and HMYSOs.\nSpecifically, we measured the magnetic field strength in twelve and five ex-OH\nmaser features toward ON1 and W75N, respectively, and the Zeeman splitting of\nthe methanol maser spectra in one and three maser features toward ON 1 and\nW75N, respectively. We determined that the two maser emissions likely probe the\nsame magnetic field but at different densities. Indeed, a direct comparison of\nthe magnetic field strength and the Zeeman splitting as measured with the ex-OH\nand methanol maser spots, respectively, provided values of the Zeeman splitting\ncoefficient for the 6.7 GHz maser that do not match any of the table values\npresent in the literature. We are not able to uniquely identify the dominating\nhyperfine transition; however, through density considerations, we can narrow\nthe choice down to three hyperfine transitions: 3->4, 6->7A, and 7->8.",

However, current approaches largely rely on predefined\nthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose\ndiverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then\nspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,\nComplex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat\nintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to\nidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are\ndesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and\ncreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple\nreinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe\ncollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our\nScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different\nsimulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios\nimproves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through\nreal-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated\nscenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a\ncritical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.",

This enables a deeper,\ncontext-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive\nGated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the\noriginal linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,\nensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from\noverwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via\nLoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly\nreduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for\nresource-limited scenarios.

For each configuration, distinct\nkinematic assumptions are introduced. The constitutive theory is derived based\non thermomechanical principles, where the free energies capture recoverable\nelastic responses and dissipation potentials govern irreversible mechanisms.\nThe evolution equations for the internal variables arise from the principle of\nmaximum dissipation. A key insight is the structural distinction in the\nconstitutive laws resulted from the two rheological architectures. In\nparticular, the Kelvin-Voigt model leads to evolution equations with\nnon-equilibrium processes coupled, which pose computational challenges for the\nconstitutive integration. To address this, we exploit the\nSherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula and extend it to tensorial equations to\ndesign an efficient strategy during constitutive integration. With that\nstrategy, the integration can be performed based on an explicit update formula,\nand the algorithmic complexity scales linearly with the number of\nnon-equilibrium processes. This framework offers both modeling flexibility and\ncomputational feasibility for simulating materials with multiple\nnon-equilibrium processes and complex rheological architectures under finite\nstrain.",

Existing lifelong behavior modeling\nmethods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and\ncandidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to\nutilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items.

Understanding\nthese defects under operating conditions is key since their electronic levels\nexhibit large thermal fluctuations that challenge the validity of static 0 K\nmodels. However, quantitative modelling of defect processes requires hybrid\ndensity functional theory with spin-orbit coupling, which is too expensive for\ndirect molecular dynamic simulations. To address this, we train a multi-task\nmachine learning force field to study VCl in orthorhombic CsPbCl3 at 300 K.\nWhile we observe strong oscillations in the optical transition level arising\nfrom the soft potential energy surface, neither the non-radiative capture\nbarriers nor the thermodynamic charge transition levels are affected. Our\nresults reveal that VCl is not responsible for the non-radiative losses\npreviously assumed. Instead, its impact on performance arises from other\nmechanisms, such as limiting the open-circuit voltage and promoting ionic\nmigration. Our findings demonstrate that, despite strong dynamical effects in\nhalide perovskites, the conventional static formalism of defect theory remains\nvalid for predicting thermodynamic behavior, providing a sound basis for the\ndesign of high-performance energy materials.",

Statistical and data-driven\napproaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their\nadaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive\nannotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.\nRecent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide\npromising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This\npaper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel\nframework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of\nfoundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD\naddresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data\nsparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the\nanomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is\nspecifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process\nknowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user\ninputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain\nexperts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science\nexpertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across\nthree distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation\nstudy to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.\nFurthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly\ndetection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,\nparticularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely\nthrough semantic instructions.",

The method first employs an improved Transformer\nmodule to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using\na self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual\nsemantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to\nextract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and\nparallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to\ndynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,\nenhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input\nmodeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,\ncovering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task\nscheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's\ntemporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate\nperformance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity\nanalysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,\nand noise levels.

This paper formulates a physics-based description of both\neffects by combining DNP transport with residence-time theory. Then, treating\nthe core and ex-core regions as two mixing volumes in series, closed-form\nexpressions for (i) the static reactivity loss due to precursor drift and (ii)\nthe zero-power transfer function that governs linearised dynamics are derived.\nWhen the gamma residence-time distributions are used, the new framework is\nshown to reduce to the plug-flow and Continuous-Stirred-Tank-Reactor limits as\nspecial cases, while generalising to intermediate mixing regimes via a single\nparameter: the degree of mixing. Performed parameter studies show that DNP\nrecirculation has the highest impact when core and ex-core residence times are\ncomparable and the product of the DNP decay constant and the in-core residence\ntime is small. Benchmarks against the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment are able\nto reproduce the measured static loss ($k_0 \\approx 0.32$ \\$) and its frequency\nresponse, with $\\approx$20% of the steady-state DNP worth arising from\nrecirculation.

However, the exact\ncomputation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,\nseverely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The\nchallenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as\nin Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather\nthan point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling\nhigher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class\nof GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and\ninteractions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global\nexplanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise\nexplanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components\nand compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,\ncapturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global\nexplanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and\ncompute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the\nmodel's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)\nM\\\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive\nalgorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean\nand variance of Shapley values.

Heterogeneity in factor allocation generates\ndifferential profit rates across sectors, prompting firms to move between them\nunder myopic profit-seeking behaviour, subject to quadratic reallocation costs.\nThe aggregate dynamics of the economy can be formalised as a gradient flow in a\nWasserstein space, starting from a partial differential equation that describes\nthe reallocation of firms across sectors. Two key emergent properties arise:\n(i) decentralised and uncoordinated decisions can be reinterpreted as the\nsolution to a sequence of global optimisation problems, involving a function of\naggregate consumption, which increases monotonically along the dynamic path;\n(ii) the long-run competitive equilibrium is efficient, as the distribution of\nfirms maximises aggregate consumption and profit rates are equalised across\nsectors. We extend the baseline model to incorporate non-symmetric preferences,\nintrasectoral externalities, a fixed cost of reallocation, and labour\nimmobility. These extensions reveal conditions under which the efficiency and\nuniqueness of the long-run equilibrium may fail, but also highlight the\nsurprising result that the decentralised equilibrium can remain efficient even\nin the presence of externalities. Finally, using a large sample of EU firms\nfrom the period 2018-2023, we empirically document convergence in sectoral\nprofit rates, but not in labour productivity, pointing to a certain degree of\nlabour immobility.

    "abstract": "The questions of the rarity of the 4.8 GHz formaldehyde masers and the\nnon-detection of 14.5 GHz formaldehyde masers are addressed from a theoretical\npoint of view. The pumping free-free radiation fields were obtained using the\nphoto-ionization code Cloudy to simulate hyper-compact HII regions.\nImplementation of these free-free radiation fields in solving the rate\nequations shows that the free-free radiation fields of some hyper-compact HII\nregions are ineffective to invert the 4.8 GHz transition. Investigation of the\nvariation of the inversion of the 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz transitions with radial\ndistance revealed that there are regions where only the 4.8 GHz transition is\ninverted. It is also shown that the projection of the masing region toward the\nedge of a hyper-compact may explain the non-detection of 14.5 GHz masers. The\nattenuation of the 4.8 GHz and 14.5 GHz masers in the molecular envelope is\ninvestigated. It is found that attenuation can be significant. Comparison of\nthe velocities of the 4.8 GHz masers with the centre velocities of associated\n4.8 GHz absorption features shows that the maser emission lies at the edge of\nthe absorption features. This suggests that the masers may be associated with\nkinematic structures such as rotating toroids.",

    "abstract": "Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and\narticulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or\ndisproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument\nrefers to understanding the underlying \"reasons\" which make up the proof or\ndisproof of the premise - as a function of the \"logical atoms\" in the argument.\nWhile it has been shown that transformers can \"chain\" rules to derive simple\narguments, the challenge of articulating the \"reasons\" remains. Not only do\ncurrent approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,\nthey are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to\ntheoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules\ncannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest\naddressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation\n(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the\nargument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural\nlanguage argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules\nincorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and\neasy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that\ndepend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including\narbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive\ndiscussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and\nextract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular\nreasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation\nand extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.",

    "abstract": "To mitigate global climate change, distributed energy resources (DERs), such\nas distributed generators, flexible loads, and energy storage systems (ESSs),\nhave witnessed rapid growth in power distribution systems. When properly\nmanaged, these DERs can provide significant flexibility to power systems,\nenhancing both reliability and economic efficiency. Due to their relatively\nsmall scale, DERs are typically managed by the distribution system operator\n(DSO), who interacts with the transmission system operator (TSO) on their\nbehalf. Specifically, the DSO aggregates the power flexibility of the DERs\nunder its control, representing it as a feasible variation range of aggregate\nactive power at the substation level. This flexibility range is submitted to\nthe TSO, who determines a setpoint within that range. The DSO then\ndisaggregates the setpoint to dispatch DERs. This paper focuses on the DSO's\npower flexibility aggregation problem. First, we propose a novel multistage\nrobust optimization model with decision-dependent uncertainty for power\nflexibility aggregation. Distinct from the traditional two-stage models, our\nmultistage framework captures the sequential decision-making of the TSO and DSO\nand is more general (e.g., can accommodate non-ideal ESSs). Then, we develop\nmultiple solution methods, including exact, inner, and outer approximation\napproaches under different assumptions, and compare their performance in terms\nof applicability, optimality, and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we\ndesign greedy algorithms for DSO's real-time disaggregation. We prove that the\nrectangular method yields greater total aggregate flexibility compared to the\nexisting approach. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\naggregation and disaggregation methods, validating their practical\napplicability.",

Beyond conventional scalar quality scores,\nFGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences.\nBased on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA\nmetrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA\nevaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these\nfindings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for\nimage restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and\nfine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate\nthat FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and\nmodel weights have been released in https://pxf0429.github.io/FGResQ/",

In particular, we compare results from\nthe central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with\nthose from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent\nobservations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the\ndifferent lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight\nvariations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax.\" This effect\nallows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the\nEarth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets\ndown to Earth-mass. We begin the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images\nthrough June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a\nthousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study\nthe Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations,\nsupporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB.\nDuring the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of\nOpportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave\nevents, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.",

Through large-scale human evaluation (more\nthan 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE\ndemonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in\nsynthetic images with more than 93\\% accuracy in natural images.

LanSE reveals nuanced model differences\ninvisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical\nplausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with\nhuman judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,\nLanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model\nselection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement.

The depth of preparation circuit for\nthe most general state has been optimized to approximately optimal, but the\nlog-depth appears only when the number of ancillary qubits reaches exponential.\nActually, few log-depth preparation algorithms assisted by polynomial ancillary\nqubits have been come up with even for a certain kind of non-uniform state. We\nfocus on the Hamming-Weight-preserving states, defined as\n$|\\psi_{\\text{H}}\\rangle = \\sum_{\\text{HW}(x)=k} \\alpha_x |x\\rangle$, which\nhave leveraged their strength in quantum machine learning. Especially when\n$k=2$, such Hamming-Weight-preserving states correspond to simple undirected\ngraphs and will be called graph-structured states. Firstly, for the $n$-qubit\ngeneral graph-structured states with $m$ edges, we propose an algorithm to\nbuild the preparation circuit of $O(\\log n)$-depth with $O(m)$ ancillary\nqubits. Specifically for the $n$-qubit tree-structured and grid-structured\nstates, the number of ancillary qubits in the corresponding preparation\ncircuits can be optimized to zero.

Negative sampling, which selects informative\nnegative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this\nprocess.

In\nthis paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that\nexplicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative\nsampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference\nscores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly\ninformative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a\ndiverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity\nfrom the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator\ncombines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more\neffective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative\nand diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve\ntheir generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Pulsating detached eclipsing binary systems are crucial for studying the\ninternal structure of oscillating stars. These systems are advantageous because\nbinary effects on pulsations are minimal, allowing for more accurate\ndeterminations of fundamental stellar parameters such as mass and radius. They\nserve as unique laboratories for detailed investigations of pulsating stars. In\nthis study, we focused on four detached eclipsing binaries exhibiting $\\delta$\nScuti-type oscillations: HD 117476, 205 Dra, HY Vir, and V1031 Ori. Our\npreliminary investigation showed that all binary components of these targets\nlie within the $\\delta$ Scuti instability strip. Therefore, we aimed to\ndetermine which components are pulsating and which are not, and to explore the\ndifferences between them. To achieve this, we analyzed TESS photometric data\nand high-resolution spectra of the targets. Radial velocity variations were\nmeasured, and atmospheric parameters for each component were derived using\nspectral disentangling or synthetic composite spectra. We also modeled the\nbinary light and radial velocity curves to determine the fundamental physical\nparameters of the components. Furthermore, we examined pulsation properties\nusing three different approaches to identify the pulsating components. The\nevolutionary status of the targets was also assessed. Our analysis revealed\nthat, in each system, only one component exhibits $\\delta$ Scuti-type\npulsations, while the others are non-pulsating. Interestingly, we found that\nthe key difference between pulsating and non-pulsating components within the\nsame binary is metallicity: the metal-rich components were found to be\nnon-pulsators, supporting theoretical studies on the effect of metallicity on\n$\\delta$ Scuti-type pulsations.",

The proposed method is based on the\naccurate reconstruction of the response function using a surrogate model. The\nresulting model is convoluted with the (normalized) expected/measured neutron\nspectrum to obtain an effective measure of the bubble detector's response,\nherein referred to as effective $c$ or $c_\\text{eff}$. This effective value for\nthe response is energy-independent after the convolution. In this way, our\napproach includes the spectral distribution of neutrons arriving at the\ndetector to determine the integral neutron flux. Analyzing our experimental\nresults obtained at the DRACO PW laser and comparing the results to previously\nused methods to obtain neutron fluxes from bubble detectors returns a reduction\nin neutron flux of up to \\SI{31}{\\%}.

To employ multi-waveguide PASS in multi-user\ncommunications, three practical transmission structures are proposed, namely\nwaveguide multiplexing (WM), waveguide division (WD), and waveguide switching\n(WS). Based on the proposed structures, the joint baseband signal processing\nand pinching beamforming design is studied for a general multi-group multicast\ncommunication system, with the unicast communication encompassed as a special\ncase. A max-min fairness problem is formulated for each proposed transmission\nstructure, subject to the maximum transmit power constraint. For WM, to solve\nthe highly-coupled and non-convex MMF problem with complex exponential and\nfractional expressions, a penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is\ninvoked for obtaining locally optimal solutions. Specifically, the augmented\nLagrangian relaxation is first applied to alleviate the stringent coupling\nconstraints, which is followed by the block decomposition over the resulting\naugmented Lagrangian function. Then, the proposed PDD-based algorithm is\nextended to solve the MMF problem for both WD and WS. Furthermore, a\nlow-complexity algorithm is proposed for the unicast case employing the WS\nstructure, by simultaneously aligning the signal phases and minimizing the\nlarge-scale path loss at each user. Finally, numerical results reveal that: 1)\nthe MMF performance is significantly improved by employing the PASS compared to\nconventional fixed-position antenna systems; 2) WS and WM are suitable for\nunicast and multicast communications, respectively; 3) the performance gap\nbetween WD and WM can be significantly alleviated when the users are\ngeographically isolated.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain networks offer decentralization, transparency, and immutability\nfor managing critical data but encounter scalability problems as the number of\nnetwork members and transaction issuers grows. Sharding is considered a\npromising solution to enhance blockchain scalability. However, most existing\nblockchain sharding techniques prioritize performance at the cost of\navailability (e.g., a failure in a few servers holding a shard leads to data\nunavailability). In this paper, we propose PyloChain, a hierarchical sharded\nblockchain that balances availability and performance. PyloChain consists of\nmultiple lower-level local chains and one higher-level main chain. Each local\nchain speculatively executes local transactions to achieve high parallelism\nacross multiple local chains. The main chain leverages a directed-acyclic-graph\n(DAG)-based mempool to guarantee local block availability and to enable\nefficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus to execute global (or\ncross-shard) transactions within a collocated sharding. PyloChain speculatively\nexecutes local transactions across multiple local chains to achieve high\nparallelism. In order to reduce the number of aborted local transactions,\nPyloChain applies a simple scheduling technique to handle global transactions\nin the main chain. PyloChain provides a fine-grained auditing mechanism to\nmitigate faulty higher-level members by externalizing main chain operations to\nlower-level local members. We implemented and evaluated PyloChain,\ndemonstrating its performance scalability with 1.49x higher throughput and\n2.63x faster latency compared to the state-of-the-art balanced hierarchical\nsharded blockchain.",

Utilizing the seamless observations of the\ninner corona ($\\le$ 3 R$_\\odot$), we have revealed the early evolution of the\ncavity and core of a CME starting at $\\sim$18:20 UT on 2014 October 14. The CME\noriginates from a hot channel (HC), which appears as the bright core and\ncompresses the cavity in WL images. Specifically, most of the dark cavity in WL\nis filled by bright loop-like structures in 174 \\AA. The differential emission\nmeasure (DEM) analysis indicates that the electron temperature decreases from\nthe core ($\\sim$13.4 MK) to the cavity ($\\sim$1.35 MK), and the CME cavity is\nsignificantly cooler than that enshrouding a prominence ($\\ge$ 2 MK). The\neffective temperature of the cavity increases over time in general, probably\ndue to the compression by the HC expansion. The evolution of the CME bright\ncore includes slow-rise, fast-rise (up to $\\sim$330 km s$^{-1}$), and\nresidual-acceleration phases. The cavity exhibits an evolution similar to the\ncore but lags by $\\sim$4 minutes, with a lower speed peaking at $\\sim$220 km\ns$^{-1}$. Moreover, the 2D radial speed distribution exhibits the highest\nspeeds at the core apex. The kinematical results further confirm the\ncompression of the cavity. The present event supports the new explanation of\nthe CME structures, i.e., the magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is proxied by the\nHC, is only responsible for the core, while the cavity is likely a low-density\nregion between the CME front and the MFR.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a\nlong-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity\nfrom scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting\ngeneral features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio\ncontains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically\nstruggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face\nwhen trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking\nhead image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that\nconstructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial\nMotion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute\ndeformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and\npersonalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss\nfunction during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,\nwe integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating\nblurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization\nwith limited training data.

DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable\ndomain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the\ndata's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving\ngeneralizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,\nthe framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that\nexplicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)\nstates between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and\ncross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45\nin Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the\nNoXi-J test set.

    "abstract": "Optical conductivity in molecular semiconductors is suppressed in the\nterahertz region, featuring the displaced Drude peak that reflects carriers'\ntransient localization (TL) by slow intermolecular vibrations. Meanwhile,\nrecent computations in minimal models evidence optical-conductivity\nenhancements below the characteristic vibrational frequency, which cannot be\ncaptured by the TL phenomenology. These models assume undamped vibrations,\nwhereas atomistic simulations show that the vibrations most strongly modulating\ncarrier's hopping amplitude are damped. Here, we use the dissipaton equations\nof motion (DEOM) method to compute finite-temperature real-time current\nautocorrelation function in a one-dimensional model with Brownian-oscillator\nspectral density of nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction. We exploit the\ndissipaton algebra to handle the phonon-assisted current, reduce the method's\ncomputational requirements by working in momentum space, and confirm that\nnumerically stable transport dynamics are virtually independent of a specific\nDEOM closing scheme. With increasing damping, we find that DEOM\noptical-conductivity profiles become increasingly qualitatively similar to TL\npredictions. For parameters representative of room-temperature hole transport\nin single-crystal rubrene, we conclude that the TL phenomenology is established\nalready in the underdamped-oscillator regime. Reasonable variations in the\ndamping constant weakly affect the carrier mobility, which remains within\nexperimental bounds. Overall, our results strongly suggest that\noptical-conductivity enhancements at very low frequencies are artifacts of\nundamped vibrations, and rationalize the success of the TL phenomenology in\ndescribing experimental data.",

    "abstract": "Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.\nHowever, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial\ncontrol remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of\nlayout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful\nreconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified\nregions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately\nimproved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to\nsimultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity\npreservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a\nunified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to\nseamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through\nexplicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables\nbidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual\ndescriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive\ntwo-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable\nsub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial\naccuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the\nfrontier of controllable image synthesis.

We have found that the Fe L2,3-edge XAS\nspectra do not exhibit clear multiplet structures, indicating strong\nhybridization between the Fe 3d and S 3p orbitals, leading to delocalized\nrather than localized electronic states. The Fe 3d and Cr 3d spin moments are\nantiferromagnetically coupled, consistent with the Goodenough-Kanamori rule.\nThe orbital magnetic moments of Fe and Cr are determined to be -0.23 and -0.017\n{\\mu}B/ion, respectively. The large orbital magnetic moment of Fe is due to the\nd6 configuration under the relatively weak tetrahedra crystal field at the Fe\nsite, and the delocalized Fe electrons maintain the orbital degree of freedom\nin spite of their itinerant nature. To understand phenomena such as the\ngigantic Kerr rotation, it is essential to consider not only the orbital\ndegrees of freedom but also the role of spin-orbit coupling, which induces a\nfinite orbital magnetic moment through t2 and e level hybridization under the\ntetrahedral crystal field. This finite orbital moment serves as a direct\nindicator of spin-orbit interaction strength and links element-specific orbital\nmagnetism to the large Kerr rotation. On the other hand, the octahedral\ncrystal-field splitting of the Cr 3d level is large enough to result in the\nquenching of the orbital moment of the Cr ion in FeCr2S4.",

Traditional memory-based strategies\nthat focus on recent interactions have yielded valuable insights into the\nevolution of cooperative behavior. However, as memory length increases, the\ncomplexity of analysis grows exponentially, since these strategies need to map\nevery possible action sequence of a given length to subsequent responses. Due\nto their inherent reliance on exhaustive mapping and a lack of explicit\ninformation processing, it remains unclear how individuals can handle extensive\ninteraction histories to make decisions under cognitive constraints. To fill\nthis gap, we introduce coordinated reciprocity strategies ($CORE$), which\nincrementally evaluate the entire game history by tallying instances of\nconsistent actions between individuals without storing round-to-round details.\nOnce this consistency index surpasses a threshold, $CORE$ prescribes\ncooperation. Through equilibrium analysis, we derive an analytical condition\nunder which $CORE$ constitutes an equilibrium. Moreover, our numerical results\nshow that $CORE$ effectively promotes cooperation between variants of itself,\nand it outperforms a range of existing strategies including memory-$1$,\nmemory-$2$, and those from a documented strategy library in evolutionary\ndynamics. Our work thus underscores the pivotal role of cumulative action\nconsistency in enhancing cooperation, developing robust strategies, and\noffering cognitively low-burden information processing mechanisms in repeated\nsocial dilemmas.",

Although various demoir\\'eing models have\nbeen proposed to remove such moir\\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer\nfrom several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a\nframe, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)\nchannel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across\nframes.

Specifically, to\naddress underlying underfitting problems, the high-dimensional mapping for\nonline identification is axially ``sliced\" into multiple low-dimensional\nsubmappings (slices). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is\ndecomposed into a set of simple low-dimensional subtasks addressed by shallow\nneural networks and adaptive laws.

We synthesized\nPDFHE on noble metal surfaces and characterized its structure and electronic\nstates using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Rather than\nadopting a planar, high-symmetry conformation, PDFHE relaxes into non-planar\nisomers stabilized by a Jahn-Teller-like mechanism that relieves an electronic\ninstability relative to the gapped planar structure. Density functional theory\ncalculations corroborate these findings, revealing that distortion lowers the\ntotal polymer energy and enlarges the bandgap, providing a microscopic\nexplanation for the SSB. Our results show that even in mechanically robust\nextended {\\pi}-systems, subtle electron-lattice coupling can spontaneously\ndrive significant structural rearrangements.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly\nmirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and\nhuman actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant\nchallenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty\nin supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination\nand unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes\nthe \"Network Behavior Lifecycle\" model, which divides network behavior into 6\nstages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans\nand agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces\nthe \"Agent for Agent (A4A)\" paradigm and the \"Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity\n(HABD)\" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and\nagent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,\nintention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.\nThe effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red\nteam penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future\nresearch directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral\ndisparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to\nprovide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and\ntrustworthy human-agent collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Debugging hardware designs requires significant manual effort during hardware\ndevelopment. After engineers identify a bug-triggering test case in\nsimulation-based hardware verification, they usually spend considerable time\nanalyzing the execution trace to localize the bug. Although numerous automated\nhardware debugging techniques exist, they are not applicable to large designs\nand deep bugs. A primary reason for their limitations is that these techniques\nonly utilize the information of a single bug-triggering test case for bug\nlocalization, which prevents them from effectively analyzing intricate hardware\nsystems and figure out the root cause of bugs. To solve this problem, in this\npaper, we transform the hardware bug localization problem into a test\ngeneration problem, aiming to find a set of effective witness test cases beyond\nthe initial bug-triggering test case to enhance hardware bug localization.\nWitness test cases refer to the cases that do not trigger the bug in the faulty\ndesign. By analyzing the execution differences between passing and failing test\ncases with spectrum-based method, we can eliminate innocent design statements\nand localize the buggy ones. To further refine the suspicious area, we define\nthe criteria for effective witness test cases and use a mutation-based strategy\nto generate such test cases. Based on this approach, we propose an automated\nhardware bug localization framework named Wit-HW. We evaluate Wit-HW on 41 bugs\nfrom various hardware designs. The experimental results show that Wit-HW\neffectively localize 49%, 73%, 88% bugs within Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 ranks,\nsignificantly outperforming state-of-the-art bug localization techniques.\nAdditionally, we evaluate Wit-HW on 13 real-world bugs collected from\nopen-source hardware projects, showcasing the robust performance of our method.",

To address these challenges, we propose\nSelf-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models\n(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by\nclassifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature\nextractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer.

The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an\nexternal knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the\nself-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process\non the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts\ncontaining disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in\ngenerating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average\ndetection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three\ndifferent LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.",

In addition, we demonstrate\nthat the performance of the probe in the entire extended phase is significantly\noutperforming the performance in the localized regime.

Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is\nreliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model\nis presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,\nperformance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm\n(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although\nthis phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been\nsystematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to\nconfirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under\nIPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a\nphenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent\nability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which\nremains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we\npropose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main\nmodules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship\ndiscrimination and cognitive editing.

    "abstract": "Excessive and spurious alert generation by cloud security solutions is a root\ncause of analyst fatigue and operational inefficiencies. In this study, the\nlong-standing issue of false positives from publicly accessible alerts in\nAmazon S3, as generated by a licensed cloud-native security solution, is\nexamined. In a simulated production test environment, which consisted of over\n1,000 Amazon S3 buckets with diverse access configurations, it was discovered\nthat over 80\\% of the alerts generated by default rules were classified as\nfalse positives, thus demonstrating the severity of the detection issue. This\nseverely impacted detection accuracy and generated a heavier workload for\nanalysts due to redundant manual triage efforts. For addressing this problem,\ncustom detection logic was created as an exercise of the native rule\ncustomization capabilities of the solution. A unified titled ``S3 Public Access\nValidation and Data Exposure'' was created in an effort to consolidate\ndifferent forms of alerts into one, context-aware logic that systematically\nscans ACL configurations, bucket policies, indicators of public exposure, and\nthe presence of sensitive data, and then marks only those S3 buckets that\nindeed denote security risk and are publicly exposed on the internet with no\nauthentication. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in false\npositives, more precise alert fidelity, and significant time saving for\nsecurity analysts, thus demonstrating an actionable and reproducible solution\nto enhance the accuracy of security alerting in compliance-focused cloud\nenvironments.",

The standard way that PBT users\ngenerate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs\nthrough random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users\nmust tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual\nrandom choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose\nindividual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so\ntoday this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be\npractically achieved.\n  In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of\ngenerators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an\nobjective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights\nthat optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that\nallow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity\nand validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel\ndiscrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports\ndifferentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for\ngenerators. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective at\noptimizing generator distributions according to the specified objective\nfunctions.

    "abstract": "Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured\nrepresentations that capture events, characters, and their relations across\nmultiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often\nsuffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are\nlabeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the\neffectiveness of reasoning and generalization.\n  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical\nnarrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of\nnarrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically\nrelated actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based\nclustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic\ncategories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.\n  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109\ndataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.\nPreliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action\nretrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic\nnormalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic\ntransparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward\nscalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative\nunderstanding.",

While large language models (LLMs) have shown great\npromise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation\nclassification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related\nentity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine\nwhether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence\nstructures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such\nhallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the\nintegrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware\nsEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the\nrelation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,\nDEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for\neach pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence\ninto a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise\nwhile preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local\npredictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,\ncorrecting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a\ncausality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling\nspurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning\nwith human feedback.

    "abstract": "The Steepest Entropy Ascent (SEA) ansatz, recently recognized as the fourth\nlaw of thermodynamics, governs the irreversible evolution of a system from a\nnon-equilibrium state toward a unique maximum-entropy equilibrium. SEA builds\nupon the second law to unify mechanics and thermodynamics. Due to its nonlinear\nnature, exact solutions to the SEA equation of motion are scarce. To address\nthis, the Fixed Lagrange Multiplier (FLM) method is developed as an approximate\nanalytical tool, applicable to both two-level and higher-dimensional quantum\nsystems. Using quantum walks, a universal computation model, the study applies\nFLM to analyze and solve the SEA dynamics for single-component $N-$level\nsystems. The approximate FLM solutions show strong agreement with full\nnumerical simulations, particularly in regions of maximum entropy production\nconsistent with SEA predictions. To extend SEA analysis to composite systems,\nespecially two-qubit systems, the work provides a general framework for\n$N-$level Bloch vector parametrization. It includes analytical roots for $N=3$\nand a complete parametrization for $N=4$, along with a method for analytically\ncomputing operator traces in this representation. Finally, the study examines\nthe no-signaling condition in nonlinear quantum theories. While nonlinearity\noften implies faster-than-light signaling, the SEA framework inherently\nrespects no-signaling. The equation of motion for both separable and entangled\n(e.g., Bell-diagonal) composites confirms that SEA maintains locality and\nprovides a robust foundation for modeling decoherence in both open and closed\nquantum systems.

Recent large language model\n(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on\none-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic\nadaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the\nprocesses of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)\nfor dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)\na mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks\nspecified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an\nonline subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and\nexplainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an\noptimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via\nsearch-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop\nverification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both\nsubtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected\nonline. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning\ncapabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,\nsimultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and\nexplainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances,\nwith 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks\ncompleted on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during\nadaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.\nProject page at https://tcxm.github.io/DEXTER-LLM/",

The main\nobjective in this area is to determine or establish bounds for the minimum\nredundancy of $(n,q,N;\\mathcal{B})$-reconstruction codes, denoted by\n$\\rho(n,q,N;\\mathcal{B})$. In this paper, we investigate reconstruction codes\nwhere the error ball is either the \\emph{$t$-deletion ball}\n$\\mathcal{D}_t(\\cdot)$ or the \\emph{$t$-insertion ball} $\\mathcal{I}_t(\\cdot)$.\nFirstly, we establish a fundamental connection between reconstruction codes for\ndeletions and insertions. For any positive integers $n,t,q,N$, any\n$(n,q,N;\\mathcal{I}_t)$-reconstruction code is also an\n$(n,q,N;\\mathcal{D}_t)$-reconstruction code. This leads to the inequality\n$\\rho(n,q,N;\\mathcal{D}_t)\\leq \\rho(n,q,N;\\mathcal{I}_t)$. Then, we identify a\nsignificant distinction between reconstruction codes for deletions and\ninsertions when $N=O(n^{t-1})$ and $t\\geq 2$.

MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture\nabout the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,\nwhich facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine\neffective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite\nMarkov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic\nprogramming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with\nrespect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on\nmisspecification and quantization errors.

Despite\nthe importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive\nstudies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension\ndifficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of\nChinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel\nbenchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading\ncomprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade\nteachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers\nnationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot\nlearning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of\nrandom guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance\nimproves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy\nof their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging\nabilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in\ntheir current training for educationally aligned judgment.

    "abstract": "Computing-In-Memory (CIM) offers a potential solution to the memory wall\nissue and can achieve high energy efficiency by minimizing data movement,\nmaking it a promising architecture for edge AI devices. Lightweight models like\nMobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature\nextraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often\nface challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including\nunderutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in\nparticular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and\nenergy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that\nsignificantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving\nmemory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is\ngrounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper.\nWhen applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer\ntraffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and\nlatency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline\n(conventional weight-stationary dataflow).",

The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by\ntheir computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing\nstrategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods\nhave been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation\nbetween skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot\nprocess large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy\npoints, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on\nregistration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread\napplicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based\ncoarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated\ncorrespondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud\ntransformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network\nand a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second\nstages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point\nmovement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood\nprecision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric\nstructures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous\nglobal features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated\nrecurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose\nan auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical\norgans.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered\ndatasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization\nresults.

Given a patient's CT scan and structured\nmetadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the\nagent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search\nacross nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient\npopulation from a multi-institutional database.

Our images\nreveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact,\ncrescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at\n30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the\nVLT/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial\nwidth comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately\nefficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface,\nbased on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately\nflared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T\nTauri disks.

    "abstract": "Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for\ngenerating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces\nchallenges in \\emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to\nscale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically\noperate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in\nmemory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility\nfor large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,\nwith limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the\ntraining data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To\naddress these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion\n(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.\nThis space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,\nsignificantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large\ngraphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing\nfundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves\nsignificant memory improvements (up to 6$\\times$) while maintaining comparable\nor even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to\nunseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable\nand effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in\ngenerative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by\ndecomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.",

Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are\ngoverned by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a\nsystem of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are\ngoverned by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing\nconvergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present\nthe first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the\nconvergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph\ngeneration paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)\ngraph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation\nof both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique\nfactors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph\nstructure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer\ntheoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling\nsteps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to\nimprove convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a\ncontrolled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align\nwith our theoretical predictions.

Interestingly, two reside in close-pair environments, while two\nothers form a close pair themselves.

After identifying two Ni I\n(279.95 and 280.59 nm), one Mn II (280.62 nm), and one Fe I (280.53 nm) lines,\nhere we apply the Weak Field Approximation (WFA) to the spectropolarimetric\nobservations of active region plages by CLASP2 and CLASP2.1.

    "abstract": "In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union\n(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets\nduring training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the\ngradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's\nbounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the\nlearning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's\nand predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship\nat the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger\nobjects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,\nwe present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:\n(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse\nreal-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class\nrelational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.\nWe highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing\nIoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the\nstandard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%\nin mAP$^{\\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without\nany additional hyperparameter tuning.

Recent\nadvances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more\nflexible alternative.

    "abstract": "Many scientific and engineering problems are modelled by simulating scalar\nfields defined either on space-filling meshes (Eulerian) or as particles\n(Lagrangian). For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as\ncontour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out\nsmall-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,\nsimplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than\npersistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting\nregular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data\nonto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a\nhigh sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for\nprocessing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to\nparcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using\nDelaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of\nrelying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done\nfor cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.\n10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555. We implement\nthis in Viskores (formerly called VTK-m) as prefix-sum style hypersweeps for\nparallel efficiency and show how it can be generalized to compute any\nintegrable property. Finally, our results reveal that contour trees computed\ndirectly on the parcels are orders of magnitude faster than computing them on a\nresampled grid, while also arguably offering better quality segmentation,\navoiding interpolation artifacts.",

Existing theoretical studies on the\nlearning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning\nalgorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude\nconnection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum\ndegree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk\n(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the\ngeneralization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional\nsettings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine\nhow graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several\nkey contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure\nand learning in GNNs.

With this established framework, we further\nexplore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the\nperformance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we\nextend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing\nnon-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights\ninto the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning\nalgorithms.

We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of\nCLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this \"superposition\"\ndirectly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently\naffects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this\nstudy will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of\ncompositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found\nhttps://github.com/Mystic-Slice/Do-VLMs-Have-Bad-Eyes.",

One of the most\ninteresting open questions is to find a coarse analogue of Menger's theorem,\nwhich characterizes when there are $k$ vertex-disjoint paths between two given\nsets $S,T$ of vertices of a graph. We showed in an earlier paper that the most\nnatural such analogue is false, but a weaker statement remained as a popular\nopen question. Here we show that the weaker statement is also false.\n  More exactly, suppose that $S,T$ are sets of vertices of a graph $G$, and\nthere do not exist $k$ paths between $S,T$, pairwise at distance at least $c$.\nTo make an analogue of Menger's theorem, one would like to prove that there\nmust be a small set $X\\subseteq V(G)$ such that every $S-T$ path of $G$ passes\nclose to a member of $X$: but how small and how close? In view of Menger's\ntheorem, one would hope for $|X|<k$ and 'close' some function of $k,c$ (and\nindeed, this was conjectured by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu, and\nindependently, by Albrechtsen, Huynh, Jacobs, Knappe and Wollan); but we showed\nthat this is false, even if $c=3$ and $k=3$.\n  Here we upgrade the counterexample: we show that, even if $c=k=3$, no pair of\nconstants (for 'small' and 'close') work. For all $\\ell, m$, there is a graph\n$G$ and $S,T\\subseteq V(G)$, such that there do not exist three $S-T$ paths\npairwise with distance at least three, and yet there is no $X$ with $|X|\\le m$\nsuch that every $S-T$ path passes within distance at most $\\ell$ of $X$.",

In contrast to\ntheir vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant\ncomputational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and\nprocessing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce\nthese demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the\nessential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's\npredictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation\napproaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level\noptimization.

In this work, we develop a first-principles model that quantifies the\ninteraction of oxygen with voids and fission gas bubbles in UN, leading to a\nreduction in surface energy that can promote swelling. The analysis reveals\nthat segregation of substitutional oxygen at surface nitrogen sites is the\nprimary driver of surface energy reduction, $|\\Delta \\sigma|$, while oxygen in\nsurface hollow sites plays a minor and sometimes counteracting role. $|\\Delta\n\\sigma|$ is most pronounced for small cavities ($R_v$ = 1--10 nm) at\nintermediate temperatures that coincide with the onset of breakaway swelling in\nUN. Larger voids require higher temperatures for oxygen adsorption to\nsignificantly lower their surface energy. The temperature dependence of\n$|\\Delta \\sigma|$ exhibits three regimes: negligible reduction at low\ntemperatures due to sluggish oxygen diffusion, a maximum at intermediate\ntemperatures where oxygen incorporation is optimal, and a decline at high\ntemperatures due to enhanced bulk solubility. A parametric analysis reveals\nthat $|\\Delta \\sigma|$ depends strongly on both oxygen concentration and cavity\nsize, but is largely insensitive to porosity.

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis-irradiance (PI) curves are foundational for quantifying\nprimary production, parameterizing ecosystem and biogeochemical models, and\ninterpreting physiological acclimation to light. Despite their broad use,\nresearchers lack a unified, reproducible toolkit to fit, compare, and diagnose\nthe many PI formulations that have accumulated over the last century. We\nintroduce piCurve, an R package that standardizes the modeling of PI\nrelationships, with a library of widely used light-limited, light-saturated,\nand photoinhibited formulations and a consistent statistical framework for\nestimation and comparison. With the total of 24 PI models, piCurve supports\nmean squared error (MSE) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), provides\nuncertainty quantification via information matrix (Hessian), and includes\nautomated, data-informed initialization to improve convergence. Utilities\nclassify PI data into light-limited, light-saturated, and photoinhibited\nregions, while plotting and 'tidy' helpers streamline workflow and reporting.\nTogether, these features enable reproducible analyses and fair model\ncomparisons, including for curves exhibiting a plateau followed by\nphotoinhibition.",

    "abstract": "Categorical models of the exponential modality of linear logic will often,\nbut not always, support an operation of differentiation. When they do, we speak\nof a monoidal differential modality; when they do not, we have merely a\nmonoidal coalgebra modality. More generally, there are notions of differential\nmodality and coalgebra modality which stand in the same relation, but which\nmove outside the realm of linear logic; they model important structures such as\nsmooth differentiation on Euclidean space.\n  In this paper, we show that, in a suitably well-behaved k-linear symmetric\nmonoidal category, each (monoidal) coalgebra modality can be freely completed\nto a (monoidal) differential modality. In particular, we prove the existence of\nan initial monoidal differential modality, which, even in simple examples such\nas the category of sets and relations, yields new models of differential linear\nlogic.\n  Key to our proofs is the concept of an algebraically-free commutative monoid\nin a symmetric monoidal category. A commutative monoid $M$ is said to be\nalgebraically-free on an object $X$ if actions by the monoid $M$ correspond to\nself-commuting actions by the mere object $X$. Along the way, we study the\ntheory of algebraically-free commutative monoids and self-commuting actions,\nand their interplay with differential modality structure.",

    "abstract": "Modern graphs are both large and dynamic, presenting significant challenges\nfor fundamental queries, such as the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP)\nproblem. Naively recomputing the SSSP tree after each topology change is\nprohibitively expensive, causing on-demand computation to suffer from high\nlatency. Existing dynamic SSSP algorithms often cannot simultaneously handle\nboth edge additions and deletions, operate in distributed memory, and provide\nlow-latency query results. To address these challenges, this paper presents\nSSSP-Del, a new vertex-centric, asynchronous, and fully distributed algorithm\nfor dynamic SSSP. Operating in a shared-nothing architecture, our algorithm\nprocesses streams of both edge insertions and deletions. We conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation on large real-world and synthetic graphs with millions\nof vertices, and provide a thorough analysis by evaluating result latency,\nsolution stability, and throughput.",

    "abstract": "Large Artificial Intelligence (AI) training workloads spanning several tens\nof thousands of GPUs present unique power management challenges. These arise\ndue to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the\nsynchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a\ncomputation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a\ncommunication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because\ncompute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large\npower swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with\nthe increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from\nthe frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical\nfrequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid\ninfrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we\nneed to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the\nchallenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the\nstack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the\npros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged\napproach to solving the challenge. The proposed solutions are rigorously tested\nusing a combination of real hardware and Microsoft's in-house cloud power\nsimulator, providing critical insights into the efficacy of these interventions\nunder real-world conditions.",

    "abstract": "Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by\nconsolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the\nsurvey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.\nHowever, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining\ncoherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive\ncitation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an\nautomatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,\nadaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs\nsurvey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and\nthen dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that\nstores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across\nsubsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers\nfine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I\nleverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.\nExperiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I\nconsistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and\ncitation coverage.",
