    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly\nadvanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).\nHowever, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of\nthe base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's\nimmense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the\ncapability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To\naddress this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization\napproach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to\nachieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base\nmodels. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance\nSampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and\nExploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value,\nunexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive\nexperiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our\napproach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1)\nstate-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior\nperformance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and\nsignificant gains across diverse model families, with average relative\nimprovements up to 69.2\\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates\nthat RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.",

    "abstract": "Time-periodic dynamical systems occur commonly both in nature and as\nengineered systems. Large-scale linear time-periodic dynamical systems, for\nexample, may arise through linearization of a nonlinear system about a given\nperiodic solution (possibly as a consequence of a baseline periodic forcing)\nwith subsequent spatial discretization. The potential need to simulate\nresponses to a wide variety of input profiles (viewed as perturbations off a\nbaseline periodic forcing) creates a potent incentive for effective model\nreduction strategies applicable to linear time-periodic (LTP) systems.\nClassical approaches that take into account the underlying time-periodic system\nstructure often utilize the Floquet transform; however, computation of the\nFloquet transform is typically intractable for large order systems. In this\npaper, we develop the notion of a partial Floquet transformation connected to\nselected invariant subspaces of a time-varying differential operator associated\nwith the LTP system. We modify and repurpose the Dominant Pole Algorithm of\nRommes to identify effective invariant subspaces useful for model reduction. We\ndiscuss the construction of associated partial Floquet transformations and\ntime-varying reduction bases with which to produce effective reduced-order LTP\nmodels and illustrate the process on a simple time-periodic system.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of digital shopping channels has prompted many traditional\nretailers to invest in e-commerce websites and mobile apps. While prior\nliterature shows that multichannel customers tend to be more valuable, it\noverlooks how the reason for adopting a new channel may shape post-adoption\nbehavior. Using transaction-level data from a major Brazilian pet supplies\nretailer, we examine how adoption of online shopping - by previously\noffline-only customers - affects post-adoption spend, profitability, and\nchannel usage. We study four distinct adoption pathways: organic adoption,\nadoption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Friday promotions, and a newly\nlaunched loyalty program. We find that although all adopter groups increase\ntheir spending relative to offline-only customers, post-adoption behavior\ndiffers based on the reason for adoption. COVID-19 adopters behave similarly to\norganic adopters in terms of spending, but show greater offline stickiness\nconsistent with consumer inertia and habit theory, yielding higher profits due\nto higher offline margins. In contrast, promotion-driven adopters spend less\npost-adoption due to forward buying and exhibit lower profitability. Our\nfindings caution against treating all multichannel customers as equal and\nhighlight the importance of incorporating behavioral theories into forecasting\nand targeting strategies. Firms should account for adoption motives when\nevaluating channel and promotional investments.",

Although reinforcement\nlearning (RL) offers a solution to optimize longer-term goals, such as\nin-session engagement, applying it at web scale is challenging due to the\nextremely large action space and engineering complexity. In this paper, we\nintroduce RecoMind, a simulator-based RL framework designed for the effective\noptimization of session-based goals at web-scale. RecoMind leverages existing\nrecommendation models to establish a simulation environment and to bootstrap\nthe RL policy to optimize immediate user interactions from the outset. This\nmethod integrates well with existing industry pipelines, simplifying the\ntraining and deployment of RL policies. Additionally, RecoMind introduces a\ncustom exploration strategy to efficiently explore web-scale action spaces with\nhundreds of millions of items. We evaluated RecoMind through extensive offline\nsimulations and online A/B testing on a video streaming platform. Both methods\nshowed that the RL policy trained using RecoMind significantly outperforms\ntraditional supervised learning recommendation approaches in in-session user\nsatisfaction. In online A/B tests, the RL policy increased videos watched for\nmore than 10 seconds by 15.81\\% and improved session depth by 4.71\\% for\nsessions with at least 10 interactions.

While a given race or season can tell you how well a car and driver\nperformed jointly, isolating the individual impact of the driver and\nconstructor remains challenging. This paper extends a Regularized Adjusted Plus\nMinus (RAPM) methodology (Sill 2010), commonly used in basketball and hockey,\nto parse out individual driver and constructor impact. It employs a\ntime-decayed ridge regression with LOESS (Jacoby 2000) smoothing to predict\nrace results for the Hybrid Engine Era (2014 - 2024). By measuring the\nconstructor and driver coefficients over time, we measure the relative\nindividual impact of driver and constructor throughout the period. Results show\nthat constructors explain 64.0% of the variance in race outcomes in the Hybrid\nEngine Era. Additionally, constructors have increased importance in benchmarked\nrank-agnostic cohorts (e.g., Top 10 points finishers) and decreased importance\nin qualifying. By decomposing performance into individual driver and\nconstructor metrics, we create a robust framework for inter-constructor driver\ncomparisons that the Formula 1 points system obfuscates.

It has a generalisation in which the flat metric is replaced by an\narbitrary second metric and so can be formulated on any curved world-sheet.\nWhen the two metrics are equal, the theory reduces to a $\\beta \\gamma$ system,\ngiving a non-unitary $c=2$ conformal field theory. We argue that the relation\nbetween this and the theory of two chiral bosonic scalars of the same chirality\ncan be viewed as a \\lq bosonisation'. We show that the standard vertex\noperators for the chiral scalars are vertex operators and line operators in the\nSen formulation and derive the formulation in the Sen theory of correlation\nfunctions in the chiral scalar theory. The flat space Sen theory can be coupled\nto two different world-sheet metrics in such a way that one scalar couples to\none metric and the other to the other metric, so obtaining the general\nformulation with two metrics.\n  In $d=4k+2$ dimensions, the bi-metric action for a $2k$-form gauge field with\nself-dual field strength reduces, when the two metrics are equal, to a\nconformal field theory with a $BF$-type action, except that $B$ is a self-dual\n$d/2$-form and $F$ is a $d/2$-form field strength, $F=dP$. The self-duality of\n$B$ means that this is not a topological theory but instead represents two\nself-dual gauge fields.

These evolution\nequations are written in the large-$N_c\\&N_f$ limit and are double-logarithmic,\nresumming powers of $\\alpha_s\\ln^2(1/x)$. Here $N_c$ and $N_f$ are the numbers\nof quark colors and flavors, while $\\alpha_s$ is the strong coupling constant\nand $x$ is the Bjorken-$x$ variable. Using our solution, we obtain analytic\nexpressions for the flavor singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) and for the $g_1$ structure function as double-inverse Laplace\ntransforms.

In this\npaper, we propose an audio prototypical network for controllable music\nrecommendation. This network expresses user preferences in terms of prototypes\nrepresentative of semantically meaningful features pertaining to musical\nqualities. We show that the model obtains competitive recommendation\nperformance compared to popular baseline models while also providing\ninterpretable and controllable user profiles.",

One is the existence of an aperiodic monotile in a\nspace of sufficiently large dimension. The other is the undecidability of\ntranslational tiling of periodic subsets of space with a single tile, provided\nthat the dimension of the space is part of the input. These two results support\nthe following conjecture: there is a fixed dimension $n$ such that\ntranslational tiling with a single tile is undecidable. One strategy towards\nsolving this conjecture is to prove the undecidability of translational tiling\nof a fixed dimension space with a set of $k$ tiles, for a positive integer $k$\nas small as possible.

    "abstract": "Animals employ different strategies for relating sensory input to behavioral\noutput to navigate sensory environments, but what strategy to use, when to\nswitch and why remain unclear. In C. elegans, navigation is composed of\n'steering' and 'turns', corresponding to small heading changes and large\nreorientation events, respectively. It is unclear whether transitions between\nthese elements are driven solely by sensory input or are influenced by internal\nstates that persist over time. It also remains unknown how worms accomplish\nseemingly surprising feats of navigation--for example, worms appear to exit\nturns correctly oriented toward a goal, despite their presumed lack of spatial\nawareness during the turn. Here, we resolve these questions using detailed\nmeasurements of sensory-guided navigation and a novel statistical model of\nstate-dependent navigation. We show that the worm's navigation is well\ndescribed by a sensory-driven state-switching model with two distinct states,\neach persisting over many seconds and producing different mixtures of\nsensorimotor relations. One state is enriched for steering, while the other is\nenriched for turning. This hierarchical, temporal organization of strategies\nchallenges the previous assumption that strategies are static over time and\ndriven solely by immediate sensory input. Sensory input causally drives\ntransitions between these persistent internal states, and creates the\nappearance of 'directed turns.' Genetic perturbations and a data-constrained\nreinforcement learning model demonstrate that state-switching enhances\ngradient-climbing performance. By combining measurement, perturbation, and\nmodeling, we show that state-switching plays a functionally beneficial role in\norganizing behavior over time--a principle likely to generalize across species\nand contexts.",

Drawing primarily on examples from Integrated Information Theory\n(IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT), I show how these simplified systems\ncould make abstract concepts more tangible, enabling researchers to probe the\ncoherence, consistency, and implications of competing frameworks. In addition\nto supporting theory development, toy models can also address specific features\nof experience, as exemplified by the account of spatial extendedness and\ntemporal flow provided by integrated information theory (IIT) and recent\ntheory-independent structural approaches.

By tracing their origins to underlying single and\nbinary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages\nleading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known\ncommon envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an\nobserved split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two\nsub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B\nmass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common\nenvelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to\ngravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through\nboth sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\\simeq$ 30%\nH-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\\alpha_{\\rm\nCE}\\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find\nthat galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low\nvelocity kicks ($\\lesssim 50 \\, \\rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies.\nFurthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped\nprogenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\\sim$ 0.2$M_{\\odot}$.

While EMA reduces stochasticity, thereby smoothing\ntraining, the introduction of bias from old iterates often creates a lag in\noptimization relative to vanilla training. In this work, we propose the\nBias-Corrected Exponential Moving Average (BEMA), a simple and practical\naugmentation of EMA that retains variance-reduction benefits while eliminating\nbias. BEMA is motivated by a simple theoretical model wherein we demonstrate\nprovable acceleration of BEMA over both a standard EMA and vanilla training.\nThrough an extensive suite of experiments on Language Models, we show that BEMA\nleads to significantly improved convergence rates and final performance over\nboth EMA and vanilla training in a variety of standard LM benchmarks, making\nBEMA a practical and theoretically motivated intervention for more stable and\nefficient fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational\nwaves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting\neccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate\neccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian\ninferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass\ngravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four\nobserving runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using\nthe new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the\nexisting model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity\nconstraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in\nboth models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and\nparallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible\neccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20\nHz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for\nSEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides\nmoderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of\n$\\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on\neccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources\nare consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \\leq 0.011$\nto $e \\leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in\nGW190814.",

This paper presents findings from a\nmixed-methods study examining how developers perceive AI's influence across the\ndimensions of the SPACE framework: Satisfaction, Performance, Activity,\nCollaboration and Efficiency. Drawing on survey responses from over 500\ndevelopers and qualitative insights from interviews and observational studies,\nwe find that AI is broadly adopted and widely seen as enhancing productivity,\nparticularly for routine tasks. However, the benefits vary, depending on task\ncomplexity, individual usage patterns, and team-level adoption. Developers\nreport increased efficiency and satisfaction, with less evidence of impact on\ncollaboration. Organizational support and peer learning play key roles in\nmaximizing AI's value. These findings suggest that AI is augmenting developers\nrather than replacing them, and that effective integration depends as much on\nteam culture and support structures as on the tools themselves.

In this paper, we aim to determine the reliability of a\n1D radiative-convective photochemical-equilibrium (1D-RCPE) retrieval method in\ninferring atmospheric properties of WASP-107b. Our grid of radiative-convective\nbalanced pressure-temperature profiles and 1D photochemical equilibrated models\ncovers a range of metallicities (Z), carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O), intrinsic\ntemperatures (T$_{int}$), and eddy diffusion coefficients (K$_{zz}$). We obtain\ngood fits with our 1D-RCPE retrievals based on a few molecular features of\nH$_2$O, CO$_2$, SO$_2$, and CH$_4$, but find no substantial contribution of\nNH$_3$. We find that the degeneracy between metallicity, cloud pressure, and a\nmodel offset is broken by the presence of strong SO$_2$ features, confirming\nthat SO$_2$ is a robust metallicity indicator. We systematically retrieve\nsub-solar C/O based on the relative amplitude of a strong CO$_2$ feature with\nrespect to the broad band of H$_2$O, which is sensitive to a\nwavelength-dependent scattering slope. We find that high-altitude clouds\nobscure the CH$_4$-rich layers, preventing the retrievals from constraining\nT$_{int}$, but that higher values of K$_{zz}$ can transport material above the\ncloud deck, allowing a fit of the CH$_4$ feature. However, T$_{int}$ and\nK$_{zz}$ can vary substantially between retrievals depending on the adopted\ncloud parametrization. We conclude that the 1D-RCPE retrieval method can\nprovide useful insights if the underlying grid of forward models is well\nunderstood. We find that WASP-107b's atmosphere is enriched in metals (3 to 5\ntimes solar) and carbon-deprived (C/O <= 0.20).

The vast majority of friction compensation schemes\nreported in the literature rely on the availability of velocity measurements,\nan information that is hard to obtain. A second limitation of the existing\nprocedures is that they rely on mathematical models of friction that contain\nseveral unknown parameters, some of them entering nonlinearly in the dynamic\nequations.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating a mixture of power series distributions\nwith infinite support, to which belong very well-known models such as Poisson,\nGeometric, Logarithmic or Negative Binomial probability mass functions. We\nconsider the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) and show that,\nunder very mild assumptions, it converges to the true mixture distribution\n$\\pi_0$ at a rate no slower than $(\\log n)^{3/2} n^{-1/2}$ in the Hellinger\ndistance. Recent work on minimax lower bounds suggests that the logarithmic\nfactor in the obtained Hellinger rate of convergence can not be improved, at\nleast for mixtures of Poisson distributions. Furthermore, we construct\nnonparametric estimators that are based on the NPMLE and show that they\nconverge to $\\pi_0$ at the parametric rate $n^{-1/2}$ in the $\\ell_p$-norm ($p\n\\in [1, \\infty]$ or $p \\in [2, \\infty])$: The weighted least squares and hybrid\nestimators. Simulations and a real data application are considered to assess\nthe performance of all estimators we study in this paper and illustrate the\npractical aspect of the theory. The simulations results show that the NPMLE has\nthe best performance in the Hellinger, $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ distances in all\nscenarios. Finally, to construct confidence intervals of the true mixture\nprobability mass function, both the nonparametric and parametric bootstrap\nprocedures are considered. Their performances are compared with respect to the\ncoverage and length of the resulting intervals.",

Existing\ninterpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often\nrequire or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant\nlimitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like\nbackdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution.\n  In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and\ncontrolling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations,\nthereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the\nunknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the\nweight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to\nnewly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations\nalong these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during\nfine-tuning with high precision.\n  For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger\nis present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate\nbelow 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on\nerased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to\nrecover \"unlearned\" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows\npotential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial\ninstruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover\nmodel-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney\nprompt generation.\n  Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/fjzzq2002/WeightWatch.",

Using a principled, partially\naxiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective\nfunction that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of\nhuman power. It takes into account humans' bounded rationality and social\nnorms, and, crucially, considers a wide variety of possible human goals.\n  We derive algorithms for computing that metric by backward induction or\napproximating it via a form of multi-agent reinforcement learning from a given\nworld model. We exemplify the consequences of (softly) maximizing this metric\nin a variety of paradigmatic situations and describe what instrumental\nsub-goals it will likely imply. Our cautious assessment is that softly\nmaximizing suitable aggregate metrics of human power might constitute a\nbeneficial objective for agentic AI systems that is safer than direct\nutility-based objectives.",

    "abstract": "Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented\nin various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),\nwithin a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a\ngoal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.\nThey localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance\nfrom it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when\nencountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced\nrobustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration\nstrategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL\nagent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.\nUnlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,\nenabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on\neffective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through\nextensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,\nparticularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.",

By turning this abstract\n'fold-back' depth into a single ordinal number, OFI forges a direct link\nbetween areas that are usually studied in isolation: the closure stages of\nfixed-point logics, the time-to-win values of infinite parity games, and the\nordinal progressions that calibrate the strength of formal theories. We prove\nthat OFI refines all classical game-theoretic and logical metrics while\nremaining algorithmically enumerable, supply a polynomial-time approximation\nscheme on finite arenas, and show how the index coincides exactly with the\nlength of the shortest winning strategy in the associated evaluation game.\nAlongside the theory we outline five open problems from the completeness of the\ncomputable-ordinal spectrum to the possibility of 'compressing' deep\nself-reference that chart a research programme at the intersection of\ncomputer-aided logic, algorithmic game theory and ordinal analysis. OFI thus\ninvites game theorists and logicians alike to view infinite play, transfinite\ninduction and reflective reasoning through a single, intuitive lens, opening\ncommon ground for techniques.",

    "abstract": "A population of individuals with the same genes can present heterogeneous\ntraits (phenotypes). The prevalence of this heterogeneity can be explained as a\nbet-hedging strategy that improves the population proliferation rate (fitness)\nin fluctuating environments. The phenotype distribution is influenced by\nfactors such as competition between phenotypes, the duration of environmental\nstates, and the rate of phenotype-switching. We illustrate these effects in a\nsystem where both the environment and the phenotype can adopt two states. This\nsystem includes scenarios such as symmetric bet-hedging and\ndormant-proliferating phenotypes. We examine how environmental and phenotypic\nstates share mutual information, measured in bits, and explore the relationship\nbetween this information and population fitness. We propose that when fitness\nis measured relative to the case where phenotype and environment are\nindependent, information and fitness can be treated as equivalent measures. We\ninvestigate strategies that individuals can use to improve this information,\nsuch as adjusting the rates of proliferation and phenotype-switching relative\nto the environmental fluctuation rate. Through these strategies, with fixed\nmarginal distributions, an increase in information implies an increase in\npopulation fitness. We also identify limits to the maximum achievable fitness\nand information and discuss the value of the information in terms of this new\nnormalized fitness. Our framework offers new insights into how organisms adapt\nto fluctuating environmental conditions.",

IRR remains a cornerstone of many machine\nlearning pipelines for educational data. Take, for example, the classification\nof tutors' moves in dialogues or labeling open responses in machine-graded\nassessments. This position paper argues that overreliance on human IRR as a\ngatekeeper for annotation quality hampers progress in classifying data in ways\nthat are valid and predictive in relation to improving learning. To address\nthis issue, we highlight five examples of complementary evaluation methods,\nsuch as multi-label annotation schemes, expert-based approaches, and\nclose-the-loop validity. We argue that these approaches are in a better\nposition to produce training data and subsequent models that produce improved\nstudent learning and more actionable insights than IRR approaches alone. We\nalso emphasize the importance of external validity, for example, by\nestablishing a procedure of validating tutor moves and demonstrating that it\nworks across many categories of tutor actions (e.g., providing hints).

Using classical prompt metrics (duration, minimum variability\ntimescale (MVT), lag, and spectral hardness) and modern classification\ntechniques (machine-learning (ML) based t-SNE, support vector machine,\nenergy-hardness-duration, and $\\epsilon \\equiv E_{\\gamma,\\mathrm{iso},52} /\nE_{p,z,2}^{5/3}$), we find GRB 240825A exhibits hybrid characteristics. The\nshort MVT (13.830 $\\pm$ 1.574 ms), rest-frame duration, and ML-based\nclassification indicate a merger-like or ambiguous nature, while its energetics\nand position on the Amati relation favor a collapsar origin. We conducted deep\noptical and NIR photometric and spectroscopic late-time search for an\nassociated supernova (SN)/kilonova (KN) and the host galaxy using 10.4 m GTC\nand 8.4 m binocular LBT telescopes. No bright SN (like SN 1998bw) is detected\ndown to stringent limits (e.g., $m_r > 26.1$ mag at 17.59 days), despite a\nredshift of $z$ = 0.659 measured from GTC spectroscopy. Host galaxy SED\nmodeling with Prospector indicates a massive, dusty, and star-forming\ngalaxy-typical of collapsar GRB hosts, though with low sSFR and large offset.\nWe compare these findings with hybrid events like GRB 211211A, GRB 230307A, GRB\n200826A, including SNe-GRBs, and conclude that GRB 240825A likely originated\nfrom a massive star collapse, with the associated supernova obscured by a dusty\nhost environment or low luminosity SN with absolute magnitude M$_{V}$ fainter\nthan -18.0.

Research shows that bias significantly affects stakeholders' trust\nin systems and how they use them. Further, stakeholders of different\nbackgrounds view and trust the same systems differently. Thus, how ML models'\nbehavior is explained plays a key role in comprehension and trust. We survey\nexplainability visualizations, creating a taxonomy of design characteristics.\nWe conduct user studies to evaluate five state-of-the-art visualization tools\n(LIME, SHAP, CP, Anchors, and ELI5) for model explainability, measuring how\ntaxonomy characteristics affect comprehension, bias perception, and trust for\nnon-expert ML users. Surprisingly, we find an inverse relationship between\ncomprehension and trust: the better users understand the models, the less they\ntrust them. We investigate the cause and find that this relationship is\nstrongly mediated by bias perception: more comprehensible visualizations\nincrease people's perception of bias, and increased bias perception reduces\ntrust. We confirm this relationship is causal: Manipulating explainability\nvisualizations to control comprehension, bias perception, and trust, we show\nthat visualization design can significantly (p < 0.001) increase comprehension,\nincrease perceived bias, and reduce trust. Conversely, reducing perceived model\nbias, either by improving model fairness or by adjusting visualization design,\nsignificantly increases trust even when comprehension remains high. Our work\nadvances understanding of how comprehension affects trust and systematically\ninvestigates visualization's role in facilitating responsible ML applications.",

It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features\nfor gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate\nthe model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL\nand (Female and Male).

Despite its standardized format and small file size, the\nhigh complexity and inter-individual variability of ECG signals (typically a\n60,000-size vector with 12 leads at 500 Hz) make it challenging to use in deep\nlearning models, especially when only small training datasets are available.\nThis study addresses these challenges by exploring feature generation methods\nfrom representative beat ECGs, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nand Autoencoders to reduce data complexity. We introduce three novel\nVariational Autoencoder (VAE) variants-Stochastic Autoencoder (SAE), Annealed\nbeta-VAE (A beta-VAE), and Cyclical beta VAE (C beta-VAE)-and compare their\neffectiveness in maintaining signal fidelity and enhancing downstream\nprediction tasks using a Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM). The A beta-VAE\nachieved superior signal reconstruction, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE)\nto 15.7+/-3.2 muV, which is at the level of signal noise. Moreover, the SAE\nencodings, when combined with traditional ECG summary features, improved the\nprediction of reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF), achieving an\nholdout test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)\nof 0.901 with a LGBM classifier. This performance nearly matches the 0.909\nAUROC of state-of-the-art CNN model but requires significantly less\ncomputational resources. Further, the ECG feature extraction-LGBM pipeline\navoids overfitting and retains predictive performance when trained with less\ndata. Our findings demonstrate that these VAE encodings are not only effective\nin simplifying ECG data but also provide a practical solution for applying deep\nlearning in contexts with limited-scale labeled training data.",

Membership inference (MI) has recently emerged as an\neffective tool for assessing privacy risk by identifying whether specific data\nbelong to a model's training set. In parallel, model compression techniques,\nespecially quantization, have gained traction for reducing computational costs\nand enabling the deployment of large models. However, while quantized models\nstill retain knowledge learned from the original training data, it remains\nunclear whether quantization affects their ability to retain and expose privacy\ninformation. Answering this question is of great importance to understanding\nprivacy risks in real-world deployments. In this work, we conduct the first\nempirical study on how quantization influences task performance and privacy\nrisk simultaneously in LLMs4Code. To do this, we implement widely used\nquantization techniques (static and dynamic) to three representative model\nfamilies, namely Pythia, CodeGen, and GPTNeo. Our results demonstrate that\nquantization has a significant impact on reducing the privacy risk relative to\nthe original model.

    "abstract": "HD~5501, a hitherto little studied eclipsing binary with an early A-type\nprimary, has been caught in a short-lived, astrophysically interesting phase of\nits binary evolution. Recent photometric and spectroscopic observations,\nincluding photometric data from {\\it TESS}, show it has a highly variable light\ncurve as well as complex spectral variability, particularly in both the\nabsorption and emission components at H~$\\alpha$. Our current campaign,\nincluding both professional and amateur observers, has determined that the\nprimary is evolving rapidly across the Hertzsprung gap and that, unusually in\nthe case of mass transfer, the orbital period is declining with a\ncharacteristic time-scale $P/\\dot{P} \\approx$ 170,000 years. Significantly, the\norbit is eccentric and it appears that mass transfer from the primary to the\nsecondary occurs only near periastron. Modeling indicates the presumed B7 V\nsecondary to be surrounded by an accretion torus, which likely has dynamically\nchaotic variations in size and shape. Our analysis further implies the presence\nof a circumbinary disc or shell supplied by mass loss through the Lagrange\n$L_3$ point. That mass loss appears to account for most of the emission at\nH$\\alpha$. We describe how this astrophysically interesting system may yield\nvaluable information about binary star evolution at the onset of Roche-lobe\noverflow, as well as insights into eccentricity-modifying mechanisms such as\nthe Soker mechanism.",

Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently,\ntypically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to\nclinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated\nframework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our\nneeds. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include\nContrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding,\nand Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to\nfacilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable\nAI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making\nprocess, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the\nmodel's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further\nclinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where\nhealthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic\nfeedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model\nattains 99.78\\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it\nexceptionally good.

Distinct optimal values of $K_S$ are identified that respectively\nmaximize thrust and efficiency: thrust can be increased by 200%, and efficiency\nby 100%, compared to the rigid case. Interestingly, these optima do not occur\nat resonance but at frequency ratios (flapping to natural) below unity, and\nthis ratio increases with flapping frequency. Using a force decomposition based\non the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor $Q$, which measures the\nrelative strength between the rotation and deformation of fluid elements, we\nshow that thrust primarily arises from $Q$-induced and body-acceleration\nforces. The concave membrane surface can trap the leading-edge vortex (LEV)\nfrom the previous half-stroke, generating detrimental $Q$-induced drag.\nHowever, moderate concave membrane deformation weakens this LEV and enhances\nbody-acceleration-induced thrust. Thus, the optimal $K_S$ for maximum thrust\noccurs below resonance, balancing beneficial deformation against excessive\ndrag. Furthermore, by introducing the membrane's deformation into a tangential\nangle at the leading edge and substituting it into an existing scaling law\ndeveloped for rigid plates, we obtain predictive estimates for the thrust and\npower coefficients of the membrane.",

    "abstract": "In the standard FRW formalism, the scale factor is assumed to describe the\nexpansion of the universe. However, by examining empty space with a positive\ncosmological constant (i.e., a de Sitter space), we find that this assumption\nis incorrect. When described in conformal time, the associated conformal metric\nexhibits a big bang singularity where the effective vacuum energy density\ndiverges, dominating the early universe. The corresponding FRW scale factor\ndecreases after the big bang, so that it does not describe the universe's\nexpansion.\n  Instead, the expansion is driven by global energy conservation: as the\neffective vacuum energy density decreases over time, space must expand to\ncompensate. This leads to a linearly expanding universe, which agrees well with\nvarious cosmological observations - such as the red shifts of supernovae; the\ntemperature dependence of the CMB radiation; and the near equality of the\nHubble time and the age of the universe. Thus, the conformal vacuum metric can\nserve as a dominant background metric in cosmology, especially during the big\nbang era when it suggests new explanations for the creation of the initial\nenergy and the first particles in the universe.\n  Due to this dominance of vacuum energy, matter and radiation can be treated\nperturbatively. Even in their presence, the linear expansion remains the\nleading behavior, with the effective matter and radiation densities decreasing\nlike $1/t^3$, just like the vacuum energy density. However, changes in their\nrelative abundance can cause slight deviations from the linear expansion.\nMatter and radiation change the vacuum metric, thereby generating big secondary\nterms which could be responsible for the phenomenon of dark matter and for the\nacceleration of the expansion.",

This redundancy creates\nsubstantial development overhead for tool creators, steeper learning curves for\nusers who must master different data handling interfaces across tools and a\ndegraded user experience as data handling is usually seen as an after-thought.\n  We propose a modular approach that separates data wrangling and loading\ncapabilities from visualization components. This architecture allows\nvisualization tools to concentrate on their core strengths while providing the\nopportunity to develop a unified, powerful interface for data handling. An\nadditional benefit of this approach is that it allows for multiple tools to\nexist and be used side by side. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach\nby building an early prototype using web technologies to encapsulate\nvisualization tools and manage data flow between them.\n  We discuss future research directions, including downstream integrations with\nother tooling, such as IDEs, literate programming notebooks and applications,\nas well as incorporation of new technologies for efficient data\ntransformations.

By analyzing nuclear bulk properties, binding energy,\ncharge radii, two-neutron separation energies, deformation parameters\n($\\beta_2$), and single-particle levels we trace the evolution of magic\nnumbers. Our results highlight the single-particle energy levels to examine\nnuclear shell closure and the occupancy of individual nucleon orbitals. A\ncomprehensive picture of N = 34 shell closure is particularly prominent in the\nisotopic chains of Cl, Ar, and Ti nuclei, where the magicity associated with\nthis number remains evident across several isotopes. In contrast, the N = 40\nexhibits a more robust and widespread manifestation across all the examined\nnuclei, indicating that its shell closure is less sensitive to the specific\nisotopic environment and more universally applicable across the given nuclear\nsystems. To further validate these closures, we apply the coherent density\nfluctuation model (CDFM) to assess isospin-dependent observables, such as the\nsymmetry energy and its surface and volume components. A systematic analysis of\nthe symmetry energy, computed using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach,\nmaps the evolution of the shell structure at $N = 20$ and 28, supports\nsub-magicity at $N = 34$, and strongly suggests a shell closure at $N = 40$,\nreflected consistently in both bulk and surface properties.

Translators benefit from articulating the theory of\ntheir translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --\nto ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation\nerrors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this\npaper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of\ntheorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling\npractices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic\ncomplexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across\ninterpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --\nespecially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating\nsemiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems\nepistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity.

In this paper, we propose a\nRiemannian optimization framework for solving the EDG problem by formulating it\nas a low-rank matrix completion task over the space of positive semi-definite\nGram matrices. The available distance measurements are encoded as expansion\ncoefficients in a non-orthogonal basis, and optimization over the Gram matrix\nimplicitly enforces geometric consistency through the triangle inequality, a\nstructure inherited from classical multidimensional scaling. Under a Bernoulli\nsampling model for observed distances, we prove that Riemannian gradient\ndescent on the manifold of rank-$r$ matrices locally converges linearly with\nhigh probability when the sampling probability satisfies $p \\geq\n\\mathcal{O}(\\nu^2 r^2 \\log(n)/n)$, where $\\nu$ is an EDG-specific incoherence\nparameter. Furthermore, we provide an initialization candidate using a one-step\nhard thresholding procedure that yields convergence, provided the sampling\nprobability satisfies $p \\geq \\mathcal{O}(\\nu r^{3/2} \\log^{3/4}(n)/n^{1/4})$.\nA key technical contribution of this work is the analysis of a symmetric linear\noperator arising from a dual basis expansion in the non-orthogonal basis, which\nrequires a novel application of the Hanson--Wright inequality to establish an\noptimal restricted isometry property in the presence of coupled terms.\nEmpirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrate that our algorithm achieves\ncompetitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with\nthree datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)\nKinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural\nvideo datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and\nobserve a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions\nin novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more\nwith fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free\nSyn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing\ngreater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve\ntransferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal\nreasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.\nWe further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve\nrecognition in temporally challenging datasets.

    "abstract": "Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are\nrevolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code\ngeneration techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core\nfeatures. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow,\nfrom task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope:\ncapabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full\nsoftware development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering\npracticality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward\npractical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process\nmanagement, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid\ndevelopment and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application\npotential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based\ncode generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from\nits inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both\nsingle-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details\nthe applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes\nmainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative\ntools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose\nseveral foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the\nfield.",

A comprehensive dataset comprising\ndaily Bitcoin returns and COVID-19 metrics (vaccination rates,\nhospitalizations, testing statistics) was constructed. Predictive models,\ntrained with and without COVID-19 features, were optimized using GA over 31\nindependent runs, allowing robust statistical assessment.

While much is\nknown about how integrability breaks down in short-range interacting systems,\nthe corresponding picture for long-range couplings remains incomplete. Yet\nlong-range interactions are both ubiquitous in nature and readily engineered in\nmodern experimental platforms. Here, we show that integrability in fully\nconnected models is either robust or extremely fragile depending on whether the\nperturbation is non-extensive, extensive one-body, or extensive two-body. In a\nfinite system with short-range interactions, any of these perturbations can\ninduce chaos when applied with finite strength. In contrast, in fully connected\nfinite models, chaos is induced by extensive two-body perturbations, and they\ndo so even at infinitesimal strength. In this case, chaos emerges within\nquasi-symmetry sectors, leading to a fragmented manifestation of the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH). This challenges previous claims of ETH\nviolation in quantum systems with strong long-range interactions.",

Inference on unseen test data is performed via Monte Carlo\nDropout, enabling uncertainty estimation across thousands of realizations\nwithin seconds. The network performs best where spectral features are\nprominent, accurately recovering CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in Archean atmospheres and\nO$_2$ and O$_3$ in Modern cases, while avoiding false positives and outputting\nnear-zero abundances in scenarios of true absence such as Archean O$_2$ and\nO$_3$. Interpretation via Integrated Gradients confirms that the model bases\nits predictions on physically meaningful features, including the Fraunhofer A\nband for O$_2$, and the Hartley-Huggins band for O$_3$.

Employing a suite of simulations\nwith realistic Galactic dust emission, we find that spatial variation in the\ndust frequency spectrum, parametrized by $\\beta_d$, can bias the estimate for\n$r$ when modeled using a low-order moment expansion to capture this spatial\nvariation. While this approach performs well across a broad range of dust\ncomplexity, the bias increases with more extreme spatial variation in dust\nfrequency spectrum, reaching as high as $r\\sim0.03$ for simulations with no\nprimordial tensors and a spatial dispersion of $\\sigma(\\beta_d)\\simeq0.3$ --\nthe most extreme case considered, yet still consistent with current\nobservational constraints. This bias is driven by changes in the\n$\\ell$-dependence of the dust power spectrum as a function of frequency that\ncan mimic a primordial $B$-mode tensor signal. Although low-order moment\nexpansions fail to capture the full effect when the spatial variations of\n$\\beta_d$ become large and highly non-Gaussian, our results show that extended\nparametric methods can still recover unbiased estimates of $r$ under a wide\nrange of dust complexities. We further find that the bias in $r$, at the\nhighest degrees of dust complexity, is largely insensitive to the spatial\nstructure of the dust amplitude and is instead dominated by spatial\ncorrelations between $\\beta_d$ and dust amplitude, particularly at higher\norders. If $\\beta_d$ does spatially vary at the highest levels investigated\nhere, we would expect to use more flexible foreground models to achieve an\nunbiased constraint on $r$ for the noise levels anticipated from the Simons\nObservatory.",

In order to supplement\ntraditional analysis approaches, and in order to facilitate deeper insights\nfrom these spectra, we present a new dataset together with an interactive\nportal that applies established self-supervised metric learning techniques,\ndimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, to allow researchers to\nvisualize, analyze, and interact with the Gaia RVS spectra in straightforward\nbut under-utilized manner. We demonstrate a few example interactions with the\ndataset, examining groupings and the most unusual RVS spectra, according to our\nmetric. This combination of methodology and public availability enables broader\nexploration, and may reveal yet-to-be-discovered stellar phenomena.",

Our\nanalysis of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) reveals two prominent sequences\nextending from a magnitude F322W2 ~ 17.5 to the bottom of the main sequence\n(MS). These sequences correspond to the two main stellar populations of omega\nCentauri: the bMS (He-rich) and rMS (He-normal) populations. The two sequences\nintersect at the MS knee (F322W2 ~ 19.5) and change positions for lower\nmagnitudes, with the bMS luminosity function (LF) ending at least ~0.5\nmagnitudes brighter than the rMS LF. We identified a third group of stars\n(named gMS) along the main sequence located between the two primary ones and\nconducted a detailed analysis of the LFs and MFs for these three stellar\npopulations. The LFs of these sequences show similar trends, with the rMS being\nthe most populated and the bMS the least. The MFs display distinct power-law\nslopes: the rMS is well fitted by a single power-law while the gMS and the bMS\nare characterised by MFs steeper than that of the rMS for masses larger than\n0.2 solar masses and flatter MFs for smaller masses. The flattening around ~0.2\nsolar masses for the gMS and the bMS might be a real feature of the MFs of\nthese populations or due to uncertainties in the adopted mass-luminosity\nrelationship (MLR). The variation in the slope of the MFs of the gMS and bMS\ncontributes to the steepening (flattening) of the combined MF for masses higher\n(lower) than 0.2 solar masses.",

This emergent locality is a necessary condition for the\nexistence of a geometric bulk dual with an RT-like formula for entanglement\nentropy. In this paper, we use tools from QEC to study the spread of quantum\ninformation and the emergence of a sharp light-cone in an analytically\ntractable model of chaotic dynamics, namely a one-dimensional Brownian SYK\nchain. We start with an infinite temperature state in this model and inject a\nqudit at time $t=0$ at some point $p$ on the chain.

We find that at\nstrong coupling, this quantity shows a sharp transition as a function of $\\ell$\nfrom near zero to near maximal correlation. The transition occurs at $\\ell \\sim\nv_B T$, with $v_B$ being the butterfly velocity. Underlying the emergence of\nthis sharp light-cone is a non-linear generalization of the diffusion equation\ncalled the FKPP equation, which admits sharp domain wall solutions at late\ntimes and strong coupling.

We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for\nquality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score\ntriplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics\ncompared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and\nmulti-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the\nsimilarity score domain and variability in data quality.",

    "abstract": "Dark matter in the form of macroscopic composites is largely unconstrained at\nmasses of $\\sim 10^{11}- 10^{17}$ g. In this mass range, dark matter may\ncollide with planetary bodies, depositing an immense amount of energy and\nleaving dramatic surface features that remain detectable on geological\ntimescales. In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon,\nprovides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its\ndifferentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark\nmatter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in\na large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's\nconductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface\nmaterial may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key\nobservable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by\ndark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of\ndark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss\npotential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the\nJovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have\nthe ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs\nof dark matter as well.",

When we\nonly care about the output state up to a global phase on $U$, then the\ndecontrolled circuit suffices.

This index heuristically measures the relative size of a\nsubalgebra $\\mathcal{N}$ embedded within a larger algebra $\\mathcal{M}$.\nAccording to subregion-subalgebra duality, bulk subregions are described by von\nNeumann algebras on the boundary. When a causally complete bulk subregion\ncorresponds to the relative commutant $\\mathcal{N}' \\cap \\mathcal{M}$ -- the\nset of operators in $\\mathcal{M}$ that commute with $\\mathcal{N}$ -- of\nboundary subalgebras, we propose that the exponential of the volume of the\nmaximal volume slice of the subregion equals the index of inclusion. This\n``volume-index'' relation provides a new boundary explanation for the growth of\ninterior volume in black holes, reframing it as a change in the relative size\nof operator algebras. It offers a complementary perspective on complexity\ngrowth from the Heisenberg picture, and has a variety of other applications,\nincluding quantifying the relative size of algebras dual to the entanglement\nwedge and the causal wedge of a boundary region, as well as quantifying the\nviolation of additivity of operator algebras in the large $N$ limit.

In particular, this allows us to\nconsistently eliminate all instantons in a local QFT via a suitable topological\ngauging of the (-1)-form symmetry. In two-dimensional U(1) gauge theories, this\nis equivalent to changing the gauge gruop to R. This makes both locality as\nwell as the instanton restriction explicit. We apply this to clarify the\nGross-Taylor string interpretation of the decomposition of two-dimensional pure\nYang-Mills. We also apply decomposition to study two-dimensional R gauge\ntheories, such as the pure R Maxwell theory, and two-dimensional supersymmetric\ngauged linear sigma models whose gauge groups have factors of R. In that\ncontext, we find that analogues of the Witten effect for dyons, here rotating\nbetween universes, play a role in relating anomalies of the individual\nuniverses to (different) anomalies in the disjoint union. Finally, we discuss\nlimits of the Tanizaki-Unsal construction, which accomplish instanton\nrestriction by topologically gauging a Q/Z (-1)-form symmetry, and speculate in\ntwo-dimensional theories on possible interpretations of those limits in terms\nof the adelic solenoid.",

Inspired by this, we consider a variational scheme\nwherein a bag of $N$ parametrized snapshots is used to represent the putative\nground state of a desired local spin Hamiltonian and optimized to lower the\nenergy with respect to it. Additional constraints in the form of positivity of\nreduced density matrices, motivated by work in quantum chemistry, are employed\nto ensure compatibility of the predicted correlations with the underlying\nHilbert space.

Prior work often requires dense multi-view captures with hundreds of\ncalibrated cameras (e.g. Panoptic Studio). Such multi-view setups are\nprohibitively expensive to build and cannot capture diverse scenes in-the-wild.\nIn contrast, we aim to reconstruct dynamic human behaviors, such as repairing a\nbike or dancing, from a small set of sparse-view cameras with complete scene\ncoverage (e.g. four equidistant inward-facing static cameras). We find that\ndense multi-view reconstruction methods struggle to adapt to this sparse-view\nsetup due to limited overlap between viewpoints. To address these limitations,\nwe carefully align independent monocular reconstructions of each camera to\nproduce time- and view-consistent dynamic scene reconstructions. Extensive\nexperiments on PanopticStudio and Ego-Exo4D demonstrate that our method\nachieves higher quality reconstructions than prior art, particularly when\nrendering novel views.

Specifically, when\nsuch a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an\naperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension.\nIn this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological\ncrystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$)\nsymmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological\nbranes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust\nendpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap\nmodes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being\ndevoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that\nsuch branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and\nweak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states\nresiding near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects,\nbesides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers.

We introduce a bilayer model consisting of the surface states\nof a three-dimensional topological insulator (3DTI) coupled to an $s$-wave\nsuperconductor and systematically study the role of interlayer tunneling\nstrength ($t_\\perp$). We find that increasing $t_\\perp$ shifts the\nproximity-induced (PrI) gap minima away from the $\\Gamma$-point, giving rise to\nmomentum-selective interference patterns that manifest as spatial oscillations\nin the in-gap states. By introducing an antidot with a magnetic vortex in the\nSC layer, we investigate the nature of in-gap states including MZMs and\nCaroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) modes. With increasing hybridization strength,\nthe energy separation between MZMs and CdGM states increases, enhancing the\nisolation of MZMs. Importantly, in the strong hybridization limit, the leading\nCdGM separation remains large inspite of the decrease in the PrI gap.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D\nGaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale\nbenchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance\nunderstanding in complex 3DGS environments.

To handle\ncomplex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional\nGeometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete\naffordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a\nrobust geometric prior.

We investigate the impact of\nenvironment heterogeneity on mutant fixation in spatially structured\npopulations with demes on the nodes of a graph. When migrations between demes\nare frequent, we demonstrate that environment heterogeneity can amplify natural\nselection and simultaneously accelerate mutant fixation and extinction, thereby\nfostering the quick fixation of beneficial mutants. We evidence this effect in\nthe star graph, more strongly in the line graph, and also in a more general\nclass of graphs. We show that for amplification to occur, mutants must have a\nstronger fitness advantage in demes with stronger migration outflow. In\ncirculation graphs, where migration inflow and outflow are equal in each deme,\nwe find that environment heterogeneity has no impact in a first approximation,\nbut increases the fixation probability of beneficial mutants to second order.\nWhen migrations between demes are rare, we show that environment heterogeneity\ncan also foster amplification of selection, by allowing demes with sufficient\nmutant advantage to become refugia for mutants.",

    "abstract": "In analyses with severe data-limitations, augmenting the target dataset with\ninformation from ancillary datasets in the application domain, called source\ndatasets, can lead to significantly improved statistical procedures. However,\nexisting methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations\nwhere the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be\nwell-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the\nempirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target\nparameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the\nBayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer\nconditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single\njoint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as\nthe target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty\nquantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over\nindicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how\na particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a\ntransformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our\napproach to moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate that recently\nproposed minimax-frequentist transfer learning techniques may be viewed as an\napproximate Maximum a Posteriori approach to our model. Finally, we demonstrate\nsuperior predictive performance relative to the frequentist baseline on a\ngenetics application, especially when the source data are limited.",

However, these fully automatic methods often\nfail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological\nconstraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.\nIn medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of\nthe required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the\npixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and\nconstrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology\n(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional\ndata due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this\nproblem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation\nbased on the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$). First, we propose a fast\nformulation for $\\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\\chi$ error\nbetween the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation\nmetric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation\nnetwork via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that\nhighlights regions with $\\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from\nthe arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a\ntopology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and\n3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological\ncorrectness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.",

The\nnonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate,\nwhile the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity\nand oscillation frequency.

Designing\nnext-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following\nquestion: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a\ndesired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum\nresource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the\nlower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required\nresource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of\nresources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others --\nyielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope\npositions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results:\n(1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the\nirreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff\nfor any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to\nfree energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem,\nwhich is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a\nwide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing\nresourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource\ncost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in\nfact require an infinite implementation cost.

In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence\nof quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances\nnon-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems, particular to systems which\nexhibit scars-induced entanglement oscillations. We exemplify this with the PXP\nmodel and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of\nscarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to\nhave significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing\ninformation backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between\ntemporally-separated transient states of small subsystems, systematic\nsignatures of subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it\nis seen that scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced\n(diminished) subsystem non-Markovianity. The retention of memory and revivals\nbetween transient subsystem states is a finer form of memory effect than\ncaptured by the revivals of full system's fidelity with the initial states.\nThis sheds new light on the dynamical memories associated with quantum\nscarring, and opens interesting new questions at the interface of quantum\nscarring and an open quantum systems approach to investigating\nfar-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum many-body systems.",

AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and\ntime when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data\nneeded. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors,\naiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster.\nMost strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that\naffect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels.\nThis work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only\nconsidering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue\nlevels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a\nKnowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available\nannotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using\ntheir past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as\ninformation about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing\nliterature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating\nannotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS.\nThe results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and\nfatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators,\nand the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not\nusing internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the\nproposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned.

    "abstract": "Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning\n(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,\ntermed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.\nOCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying\ncompetitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the\nquery. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing\nredundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This\noften results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,\nmainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into\nthe input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal\ninformation. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with\nre-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\\emph{i)}$ We reduce\nredundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to\nupdate the remaining slots; $\\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the\nfirst aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to\nenable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves\nstate-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also\nimproving advanced visual prediction and reasoning.

    "abstract": "The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of\nrotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic\norder parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While\nboth quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through\nthe Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order\npartial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's\nrole as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of\ngeometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline\ndefects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that\nincorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical\nbasis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon\nthe nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations.\nAs a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In\nideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible\nnematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of\ncrystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that\nelastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random\nlongitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order\nparameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with\npinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the\ntransformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of\nnematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of\nlong-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility\nrelations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results\nconstitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all\ncrystalline systems.",

    "abstract": "Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying\ndegrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital,\nor superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of\ndescribing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity,\nby which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However,\nbeing a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility\nrelations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we\ndevelop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic\ncompatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase\nspace of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and\nthus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of\nthe latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any\ncrystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from\npinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce\nboth longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results\nalso reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the\nmean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of\ndomain formation.",

To minimize\nelastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct\norientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the\ninduced shear strain).

This result\nsuggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely\nalong the width of the ribbon.

Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet\nnon-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological\nproperties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus\nexpansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and\nformulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven\nquasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered\ncomplex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust\n(despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving\nparameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to\nemergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame\napproach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when\nappropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To\nsubstantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit\n(TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the\nskin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of\ndistinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance\nprofiles, respectively.

Even\nwhen researchers intend to conduct an IV or proximal analysis, a sensitivity\nanalysis comparing different identification strategies can help to better\nunderstand the implications of each set of assumptions.

    "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled unexpectedly massive\ngalaxy candidates at high redshifts, challenging standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological predictions. In this work, we study the predictions of more\nrealistic dark matter halo models combined with modified matter power spectra\nfor interpreting JWST observations of high-redshift galaxies. We employ three\nhalo mass functions: the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) model and two\nphysically motivated alternatives introduced by Del Popolo (DP1 and DP2). Our\nanalysis of cumulative stellar mass densities at $z \\simeq 8$--$10$ reveals\nthat the standard ST mass function systematically underpredicts JWST\nobservations, achieving marginal consistency only with high star formation\nefficiencies. In contrast, the DP1 and DP2 models demonstrate significantly\nimproved agreement with observations even within standard $\\Lambda$CDM, with\nstatistical consistency within $1$--$2\\sigma$ for moderate star formation\nefficiencies. When combined with modified power spectra, these refined halo\nmodels achieve suitable agreement with JWST data across broad parameter ranges,\nparticularly for steeper spectral indices that amplify high-mass halo\nformation. Crucially, we find that moderate star formation efficiencies coupled\nwith small-scale power enhancements provide robust reconciliation between\ntheory and observations, eliminating the need for extreme astrophysical\nassumptions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating realistic halo collapse\nphysics, often neglected in standard analyses, can substantially alleviate\napparent tensions between JWST observations and $\\Lambda$CDM predictions,\nhighlighting the critical importance of small-scale structure formation physics\nin early cosmic epochs.",

However, at high doping concentrations, B\nincorporation can locally disrupt the hexagonal symmetry, particularly in the\npresence of B clustering; (ii) dopant formation energy calculations reveal that\nB is thermodynamically more stable in the hexagonal phase than in the cubic\nphase across all Ge concentrations, regardless of the doping level; (iii)\nmixing enthalpy calculations demonstrate that hyperdoped hexagonal-diamond SiGe\nalloys are thermodynamically stable across the full range of Ge compositions\nand that their tendency for hyperdoping is more favorable than that of\ncubic-diamond SiGe alloys.

A vector can be written as a linear\ncombination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively\napplying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector\nexpressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$\nprincipal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore,\nwriting a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of\nthe vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based\ndenoising.\n  In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$\n(determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the\ntraining sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire\ndatasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network\nhead to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the\nquantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional\nprobability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and\npotentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training\nlarge-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module\nfor the experiments.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the interactions between three properties that a group\nalgebra or more generally a pointed Hopf algebra may possess: being noetherian,\nhaving finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin\nequivalence. First it is shown that the second and third of these properties\nare equivalent for group algebras $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups, and are,\nin turn, equivalent to $G$ being nilpotent-by-finite. In characteristic 0, this\nenables us to extend this equivalence to certain cocommutative Hopf algebras.\n  In the second and third parts of the paper finiteness conditions for group\nalgebras are studied. In the second section we examine when a group algebra\nsatisfies the Goldie conditions, while in the final section we discuss what can\nbe said about a minimal counterexample to the conjecture that if $kG$ is\nnoetherian then G is polycyclic-by-finite.",

We employ a method that allows us to\ndetermine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a\nlocal operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy\nrelative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the\npresence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant\nbump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the\nquenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the\nquenches.

Albeit, developing high-performance photodetectors based\non low-dimensional quasi-2D metal halide perovskite nanoparticles remains\nchallenging due to quantum and dielectric confinement effects. Several\napproaches have been employed to improve efficiency, with plasmonic\nnanostructures being among the most effective ones. The resonant energy\ntransfer and coupling between plasmons and excitons play a vital role in\nenhancing device performance. Here, we demonstrate enhanced photodetection of\nquasi-2D perovskite nanostripes resulting from the incorporation of\noctadecanethiol (ODT) functionalized Ag nanostructure arrays (ANA). Using\ncolloidal lithography, ANA were fabricated. Reflectance spectroscopy and finite\nelement method (FEM) simulations show that ANA supports localised surface\nplasmon resonance (LSPR) modes that spectrally coincide with the absorption and\nemission band of the perovskite. This spectral overlap enables interesting\ncoupling interactions between the excitons and plasmons. The ODT-functionalized\nANA photodetectors exhibit weak to intermediate coupling, resulting in a\nphotocurrent enhancement factor of 838 %. They achieve photoresponsivities of\nup to 70.41 mA W^-1, detectivities of 1.48*10^11 Jones and external quantum\nefficiencies of 21.55 %, which are approximately 10 times higher than those of\nthe reference photodetector.

Contest Theory, in turn, provides tools to model competitive\ndynamics, where success depends on the investment of resources.

The Hadamard test is hard to implement\nbecause it requires controlled applications of $U^{k}$. Recently, a Sequential\nHadamard test (SHT) was proposed (arXiv:2506.18765) which requires controlled\napplication of $U$ only but its total run time $T_{\\rm tot}$ scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(k^{3}/\\epsilon^{2}r_{\\rm min}^{2})$ where $r_{\\rm min}$ is the\nminimum value of $|\\langle \\psi|U^{k'}|\\psi\\rangle|$ among all integers $k'\n\\leq k$. Typically $r_{\\rm min}$ is exponentially low and SHT becomes too slow.\nWe present a new algorithm, the SANDWICH test to address this bottleneck. Our\nalgorithm uses efficient preparation of the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ to\nefficiently implement the SPROTIS operator $R_{\\psi}^{\\phi}$ where SPROTIS\nstands for the Selective Phase Rotation of the Initial State. It sandwiches the\nSPROTIS operator between $U^{a}$ and $U^{b}$ for integers $\\{a,b\\} \\leq k$ to\nestimate $\\langle \\psi|U^{k}|\\psi\\rangle$. The total run time $T_{\\rm tot}$ is\n$\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}\\ln k/ \\epsilon^{2} s_{\\rm min}^{6})$.

    "abstract": "Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving\nnon-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine\nthe power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven\nlearning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods\nin this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and\nstill rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for\nfunctional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the\naccuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios\nwhere assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation\nstrategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic\napproaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

Its\ndifficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image\nsequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance\nbetween these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image\nCaptioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant\nstudies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for\nobtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are\ntransformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our\nmultifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling\nunder a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced\nstories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach\naccelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and\nreproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named\nideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle\nmodel, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.",

    "abstract": "Time-series anomaly detection plays a central role across a wide range of\napplication domains. With the increasing proliferation of the Internet of\nThings (IoT) and smart manufacturing, time-series data has dramatically\nincreased in both scale and dimensionality. This growth has exposed the\nlimitations of traditional statistical methods in handling the high\nheterogeneity and complexity of such data. Inspired by the recent success of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in multimodal tasks across language and vision\ndomains, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework: A\nTri-Branch Patch-wise Large Language Model Framework for Time-Series Anomaly\nDetection (TriP-LLM). TriP-LLM integrates local and global temporal features\nthrough a tri-branch design-Patching, Selection, and Global-to encode the input\ntime series into patch-wise tokens, which are then processed by a frozen,\npretrained LLM. A lightweight patch-wise decoder reconstructs the input, from\nwhich anomaly scores are derived. We evaluate TriP-LLM on several public\nbenchmark datasets using PATE, a recently proposed threshold-free evaluation\nmetric, and conduct all comparisons within a unified open-source framework to\nensure fairness. Experimental results show that TriP-LLM consistently\noutperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across all datasets, demonstrating\nstrong detection capabilities. Furthermore, through extensive ablation studies,\nwe verify the substantial contribution of the LLM to the overall architecture.\nCompared to LLM-based approaches using Channel Independence (CI) patch\nprocessing, TriP-LLM achieves significantly lower memory consumption, making it\nmore suitable for GPU memory-constrained environments.

Using large-scale lattice Boltzmann\nsimulations, we observe that neutrally wetting swimmers can be either trapped\nor cross the in- terface, depending on their initial angle, swimming speed and\nthe interfacial tension between the two fluids. The simulation results are\nrationalized by considering a competition between interfacial (thermodynamic)\nand active (hydrodynamic) forces. The swimmers get trapped at the interface due\nto a thermodynamic trapping force, akin to Pickering effect, when the forces\nfrom interfacial tension dominate over the swimming forces. The trapping\nbehavior can be captured by calculating a critical capillary number by\nbalancing the interfacial and active energies. This prediction agrees\nremarkably well with the numerical simulations as well as the bacterial\nexperiments of Cheon et al., (Soft Matter 20: 7313-7320, 2024).

The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has\nachieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great\nrepresentation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with\ncomplex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often\noverfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual\nquality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for\nstatic scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic\ncontent. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity\nfield modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed\nFlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering\n(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a\nflow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and\nsize of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on\nmulti-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple\nreal-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not\nonly notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry\nartifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian\ntrajectories.",

To simultaneously support two groups of users energy\nreceivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time\nfrequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving\nERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A\nprotective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs\nto manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently,\nclosed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average\nsum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive\noptimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power\ncontrol, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term\nstatistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then\neffectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems,\nefficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the\nscattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep\nreinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power\ncontrol design.

A\nprimary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or\nenvironments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors\nacross diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this\nchallenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can\nachieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore\nRL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction\ncapabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL\nrepresentation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a\nunified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome\nthe significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task\nsynthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale\nmulti-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework\nto support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction\nsuccess rates by $4\\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial\nreasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings. Our\nfindings underscore the immense potential of RL training in 3D simulated\nenvironments, especially those amenable to large-scale task generation, for\nsignificantly advancing visuomotor agents' spatial reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Mitigating partial observability is a necessary but challenging task for\ngeneral reinforcement learning algorithms. To improve an algorithm's ability to\nmitigate partial observability, researchers need comprehensive benchmarks to\ngauge progress. Most algorithms tackling partial observability are only\nevaluated on benchmarks with simple forms of state aliasing, such as feature\nmasking and Gaussian noise. Such benchmarks do not represent the many forms of\npartial observability seen in real domains, like visual occlusion or unknown\nopponent intent. We argue that a partially observable benchmark should have two\nkey properties. The first is coverage in its forms of partial observability, to\nensure an algorithm's generalizability. The second is a large gap between the\nperformance of a agents with more or less state information, all other factors\nroughly equal. This gap implies that an environment is memory improvable: where\nperformance gains in a domain are from an algorithm's ability to cope with\npartial observability as opposed to other factors. We introduce best-practice\nguidelines for empirically benchmarking reinforcement learning under partial\nobservability, as well as the open-source library POBAX: Partially Observable\nBenchmarks in JAX. We characterize the types of partial observability present\nin various environments and select representative environments for our\nbenchmark. These environments include localization and mapping, visual control,\ngames, and more. Additionally, we show that these tasks are all memory\nimprovable and require hard-to-learn memory functions, providing a concrete\nsignal for partial observability research.

We present a\none-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of\nneutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars,\nsuper-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the\ncomposition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different\nradiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\\dot\nM$, across a vast parameter space of $\\dot{M}\\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\\odot\n\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\\bullet\\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\\odot$ and\ndimensionless spins of $\\chi_\\bullet \\in [0,1)$, as well as $\\alpha$-viscosity\nvalues of $\\alpha\\sim 10^{-3}-1$.

We compute rest-frame reflection spectra and the corresponding\nenergy-dependent linear polarization degree and angle for (un)polarized\nsingle-temperature black-body spectra impinging on a partially ionized\nconstant-density optically thick slab. We use a combination of a Monte Carlo\nsimulation that takes into account scattering, absorption, and spectral lines,\nwith a non-LTE radiative transfer pre-computation of the ionization structure\nof the slab in photo-ionization equilibrium. We discuss the impact of the\nreflector's ionization and of the incident spectral shape on the obtained\nenergy dependence of polarization. Despite the presence of highly polarized\nabsorption features and low-polarized spectral lines, an underlying\nscattering-induced increase of polarization degree with energy in mid to hard\nX-rays naturally arises due to multiple Compton-scattering energy shifts. Such\nre-processing effect is particularly apparent in 2-8 keV for steep incident\nX-ray spectra reflecting from highly-ionized optically thick media. Integration\nof the resulting local reflection tables in specific large-scale reflection\ngeometries occurring in X-ray binary systems, including relativistic effects,\nwill be presented in a follow-up paper. Nonetheless, we anticipate that the\nobtained local energy-dependent features will imprint at large distances from\nthe source to the observed X-ray polarization, and could contribute to the\nobserved increase of total polarization degree with energy in 2-8 keV in many\naccreting systems by the IXPE mission.",

For a\nset of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of\nstate at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with\nsubsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related\nstructural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with\ntheoretical expectations.

This paper introduces a novel\nmethod, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with\nGaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and\nrendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt\nthe adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for medical\nimaging, yet encounters significant challenges due to data limitations and\nhardware variations. We introduce SAMSA, a novel interactive segmentation\nframework that combines an RGB foundation model with spectral analysis. SAMSA\nefficiently utilizes user clicks to guide both RGB segmentation and spectral\nsimilarity computations. The method addresses key limitations in HSI\nsegmentation through a unique spectral feature fusion strategy that operates\nindependently of spectral band count and resolution. Performance evaluation on\npublicly available datasets has shown 81.0% 1-click and 93.4% 5-click DICE on a\nneurosurgical and 81.1% 1-click and 89.2% 5-click DICE on an intraoperative\nporcine hyperspectral dataset. Experimental results demonstrate SAMSA's\neffectiveness in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios and using minimal\ntraining examples. Our approach enables seamless integration of datasets with\ndifferent spectral characteristics, providing a flexible framework for\nhyperspectral medical image analysis.",

The scenario we simulate\nassumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly\nthereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star,\nlaunching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses\nare negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC\n1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin\nand faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a\nsubstantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the\nbinary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope\nevolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary\nsystems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion\ncomplements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass\ntransfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly\ninteracting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets.

In\nthis work, we analyze several different simulated BBH populations to\ndemonstrate that even in the face of this mismodeling, spinning and nonspinning\npopulations can be reliably distinguished using the Default spin magnitude\npopulation model coupled with spin sorting. While typical analyses sort the\nbinary components by their masses, sorting the components by their spin\nmagnitudes instead offers a complementary view of the properties of individual\nsystems consistent with equal mass and of population-level properties, given\nbinary evolution processes like tidal-spin up that predict asymmetric spin\nmagnitudes among the binary components.

    "abstract": "While large-scale pre-training has advanced human trajectory prediction, a\ncritical challenge remains: zero-shot transfer to unseen dataset with varying\ntemporal dynamics. State-of-the-art pre-trained models often require\nfine-tuning to adapt to new datasets with different frame rates or observation\nhorizons, limiting their scalability and practical utility. In this work, we\nsystematically investigate this limitation and propose a robust solution. We\nfirst demonstrate that existing data-aware discrete models struggle when\ntransferred to new scenarios with shifted temporal setups. We then isolate the\ntemporal generalization from dataset shift, revealing that a simple, explicit\nconditioning mechanism for temporal metadata is a highly effective solution.\nBased on this insight, we present OmniTraj, a Transformer-based model\npre-trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset. Our experiments show that\nexplicitly conditioning on the frame rate enables OmniTraj to achieve\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot transfer performance, reducing prediction error by\nover 70\\% in challenging cross-setup scenarios. After fine-tuning, OmniTraj\nachieves state-of-the-art results on four datasets, including NBA, JTA,\nWorldPose, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:\nhttps://github.com/vita-epfl/omnitraj",

Using the steady-state Boltzmann equation,\nwe find that intra-band transitions yield a strong field-like torque on the\nCrI$_3$ layer, while inter-band transitions give rise to a comparatively weaker\ndamping-like torque in the WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ system. Remarkably, the damping-like\ncomponent is enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude in n-doped MoSe$_2$,\nreaching a strength comparable to the field-like torque, which itself is an\norder of magnitude larger than that in the WSe$_2$-based bilayer. Both torque\ncomponents exhibit strong asymmetry between n-type and p-type doping in WSe$_2$\nand MoSe$_2$ systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the twist angle plays a\ncrucial role: depending on the TMDC and chemical potential, twisting can\nreverse the sign of the SOT and significantly modulate its magnitude. Finally,\nwe show that a transverse gate electric field enables substantial tunability of\nthe SOT, by nearly one order of magnitude, and induces a sign reversal at a\ntwist angle of $10.16^{\\circ}$.",

With moderate compressive strain applied, less than -5.5%, BaSnO3\nexhibits stable nonpolarized normal tetragonal structure and an unstable\nsupertetragonal state which is characterized with extremely large c/a ratio and\ngiant polarization. We found that the band gap of the supertetragonal state is\nmuch smaller than the normal tetragonal state, with a difference around 1.2eV.\nTherefore, the energy of the doped electrons selectively favors the smaller gap\nsupertetragonal state than the larger band gap normal tetragonal state, and the\ncritical strain to stabilize the supertetragonal phase could be reduced by\nelectron doping. This mechanism guarantees the controllable supertetragonal\nstructures by electron doping and ensures the coexistence of giant polarization\nand conducting in high-mobility BaSnO3, and is promising to design\nhigh-mobility ferroelectrics conductor.",

However, the recommendations that these computational\napproaches may offer to tackle urgent human development challenges can vary\nsubstantially depending on how we model agents' (people) behaviour and the\ncriteria that we use to measure inequity. In this paper, we integrate the\nconceptual framework of the capability approach (CA), which is explicitly\ndesigned to promote and assess human well-being, to guide the simulation and\nevaluate the effectiveness of policies. We define a reinforcement learning\nenvironment where agents behave to restore their capabilities under the\nconstraints of a specific policy. Working in collaboration with local\nstakeholders, non-profits and domain experts, we apply our model in a case\nstudy to mitigate health inequity among the population experiencing\nhomelessness (PEH) in Barcelona. By doing so, we present the first proof of\nconcept simulation, aligned with the CA for human development, to assess the\nimpact of policies under parliamentary discussion.",

    "abstract": "The release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into Aedes aegypti infested\nareas is a promising strategy for localised eradication of dengue infection. Ae\naegypti mosquitoes favour urban environments as breeding habitats, so are often\nfound in and around houses. Therefore, it is likely that they will infect\nmembers of the households that they reside around. Since population groupings\nwithin households are small, stochastic effects become important. Despite this,\nlittle work has been carried out to investigate the outcome of releasing\nWolbachia-infected mosquitoes at a household scale, either from an empirical\nand theoretical stand point. In previous work, we developed and analysed a\nstochastic (continuous time Markov chain) model for the invasion of\nWolbachia-infected mosquitoes into a single household containing a population\nof wildtype mosquitoes. In the present study, we extend our framework to a\nconnected community of households coupled by the movement of mosquitoes. We use\nnumerical results obtained via Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm to\ninvestigate optimal strategies for the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes\ncarried out at either the community or the household scale. We find that\nhousehold scale releases can facilitate rapid and successful invasion of the\nWolbachia-infected mosquitoes into the household population and then into the\nwider community. We further explore the impact of regular household scale\nreleases of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes for a range of compositions for the\nrelease population, time intervals between releases and proportion of\nhouseholds participating in the releases. We find that a single release\nhousehold can provide sufficient protection to the entire community of\nhouseholds if releases are carried out frequently for a number of years and a\nsufficient number of females are released on each occasion.",

In conventional methods, the agent can retrieve\ninformation from its equipped memory module to help the person recall\nincomplete or vague memories. The limited size of memory module hinders the\nacquisition of complete memories and impacts the memory recall performance in\npractice. Memory theories suggest that the person's relevant memory can be\nproactively activated through some effective cues. Inspired by this, we propose\na novel strategy-guided agent-assisted memory recall method, allowing the agent\nto transform an original query into a cue-rich one via the judiciously designed\nstrategy to help the person recall memories. To this end, there are two key\nchallenges. (1) How to choose the appropriate recall strategy for diverse\nforgetting scenarios with distinct memory-recall characteristics? (2) How to\nobtain the high-quality responses leveraging recall strategies, given only\nabstract and sparsely annotated strategy patterns? To address the challenges,\nwe propose a Recall Router framework. Specifically, we design a 5W Recall Map\nto classify memory queries into five typical scenarios and define fifteen\nrecall strategy patterns across the corresponding scenarios. We then propose a\nhierarchical recall tree combined with the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to\noptimize the selection of strategy and the generation of strategy responses. We\nconstruct an instruction tuning dataset and fine-tune multiple open-source\nlarge language models (LLMs) to develop MemoCue, an agent that excels in\nproviding memory-inspired responses.

    "abstract": "Since its introduction, softmax attention has become the backbone of modern\ntransformer architectures due to its expressiveness and scalability across a\nwide range of tasks. However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the\nquadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the\nsequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and\nsimilar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of\nsoftmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from\nthe original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream\naccuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and\nkey inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other\nnonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains\nunanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of\nsoftmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention. Using\nthis form, each part of softmax attention can be described in the language of\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs). Describing softmax attention as an RNN allows\nfor the ablation of the components of softmax attention to understand the\nimportance of each part and how they interact.

In\ncontrast, Ising model-based decoders reduce topological complexity but demand\nconsiderable decoding time. We propose the Symmetric One-Hot Matching Elector\n(SOME), a novel decoder that reformulates the QEC decoding task as a Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem -- termed the One-Hot QUBO\n(OHQ). Each variable in the QUBO represents whether a given pair of flipped\nsyndromes is matched, while the error probabilities between the pair are\nencoded as interaction coefficients (weight). Constraints ensure that each\nflipped syndrome is matched exactly once. Valid solutions of OHQ correspond to\nself-inverse permutation matrices, characterized by symmetric one-hot encoding.\nTo solve the OHQ efficiently, SOME reformulates the decoding task as the\nconstruction of permutation matrices that minimize the total weight. It\ninitializes each candidate matrix from one of the minimum-weight syndrome\npairs, then iteratively appends additional pairs in ascending order of weight,\nand finally selects the permutation matrix with the lowest total energy. SOME\nachieves up to a 99.9x reduction in variable count and reduces decoding times\nfrom milliseconds to microseconds on a single-threaded commodity CPU.

    "abstract": "Over the last twenty years, smartphones gradually replaced many earlier\ndigital tools such as PDAs, cameras and music players. Today these objects are\nregarded as obsolete: they may hold some esthetic or nostalgic appeal but they\ndo not fit in a modern, zero-friction, cloud-first workflow. Yet these devices\nstill have desirable qualities that smartphones lack: a singular focus on a\nspecific use case; hardware buttons and physical connectors; multi-day battery\nlife. Even their lack of connectivity can be seen as an asset from a\nresilience, privacy and security standpoint. Actually using decades-old tech\ntoday is challenging, in spite of its apparent simplicity, because the friction\nof physical media-based workflows now feels unacceptable. But much like classic\ncars can be fitted with an EV motor, it is possible to retrofit older devices\nin order to make them usable again in a connected world. Long after the\nmanufacturer stops supporting a device, user communities play a crucial role in\nreverse-engineering file formats and communication protocols, maintaining\ndocumentation and software archives, as well as designing and producing spare\nparts that can even overcome initial design flaws. This paper will explore both\nsoftware and hardware retrofitting techniques, using various examples: cameras,\nmusic players, dedicated writing instruments, video games. The resulting\nretrofitted devices are neither vintage nor modern, creating their own hybrid\ninteraction paradigm around monotasking on dedicated hardware with intermittent\nconnectivity. The various examples discussed outline some common factors that\nincrease the likelihood that a successful retrofitting path can be found for a\ndevice. These factors can also be understood as proven design principles to\ncreate resilient hardware.",

The new Multi-Frequency WaveHoltz (MFWH) algorithm is an\nextension of the original WaveHoltz method and both are based on time-filtering\nsolutions to an associated wave equation. With MFWH, the different Helmholtz\nsolutions are computed simultaneously by solving a single wave equation\ncombined with multiple time filters. The MFWH algorithm defines a fixed-point\niteration which can be accelerated with Krylov methods such as GMRES. The\nsolution of the wave equation can be efficiently solved with either explicit\ntime-stepping or implicit time-stepping using as few as five time-steps per\nperiod. When combined with an $O(N)$ solver for the implicit equations, such a\nmultigrid, the scheme has an $O(N)$ solution cost when the frequencies are\nfixed and the number of grid points $N$ increases. High-order accurate\napproximations in space are used together with second-order accurate\napproximations in time. We show how to remove time discretization errors so\nthat the MFWH solutions converge to the corresponding solutions to the\ndiscretized Helmholtz problems.

    "abstract": "Large variations of European storm activity at decadal and longer timescales\nhave been found to be driven by major tropical volcanic eruptions, internal\nclimate variability and anthropogenic aerosols (AA). The insurance industry\nhave the ability to align with these slow fluctuations in windstorm risk, yet\nhave not done so, due to uncertainty in how the climate diagnostics used by\nresearchers relate to insured losses. A key aim of this study was to link past\nresearch findings to insurance applications by measuring the impacts of AA on\nEuropean property damage. This was done by extracting the winds from a set of\nclimate model experiments on AA forcing and converting them into European storm\nlosses using an established technique. The multimodel mean result indicates AA\nboosted insured windstorm losses by 45% in the late 20th century relative to\npreindustrial times, though model changes range from zero to a doubling of\nlosses and suggest large uncertainty in the size of the strengthening. Further\nanalysis of individual model simulations suggested both AA and internal climate\nvariability explain about half of the amplitude of the last peak, implying a\nsignificant role for volcanic eruptions. Looking ahead, we cannot be sure of\nthe timing of the next peak since it may require at least one major volcanic\neruption, but climate models provide encouraging signs that recent cuts in AA\nemissions from North America and Europe will act to reduce its severity.",

This result generalizes the classical celebrated embedding\ntheorems of Takeuchi [30] and Nakagawa-Takagi [27]. Using this embedding, we\nestablish new rigidity phenomena for holomorphic isometries between homogeneous\nK\\\"ahler manifolds. As a first immediate consequence we show the triviality of\na K\\\"ahler-Ricci soliton submanifod of $C \\times \\Omega$, where $C$ is a flag\nmanifold and $\\Omega$ is a homogeneous bounded domain. Secondly, we show that\nno \\emph{weak-relative} relationship can occur among the fundamental classes of\nhomogeneous K\\\"ahler manifolds: flat spaces, flag manifolds, and homogeneous\nbounded domains. Two K\\\"ahler manifolds are said to be \\emph{weak relatives} if\nthey share, up to local isometry, a common K\\\"ahler submanifold of complex\ndimension at least two. Our main result precisely shows that if $E$ is\n(possibly indefinite) flat, $C$ is a flag manifold, and $\\Omega$ is a\nhomogeneous bounded domain, then: $E$ is not weak relative to $C\\times\\Omega$;\n$C$ is not weak relative to $E\\times\\Omega$; $\\Omega$ is not weak relative to\n$E\\times C$. This extends, in two independent directions, the rigidity theorem\nof Loi-Mossa [22]: we pass from \\emph{relatives} to the more flexible notion of\n\\emph{weak relatives} and dispense with the earlier ''special'' restriction on\nthe flag-manifold factor.

We adopt the feudal HRL framework and\nrely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among\nagents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper\nlevels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To\nlearn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment\nmethod based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage\nfunction associated with the upper levels.

Entropic regularization is often employed to solve the SOT\nproblem, leading to a regularized (RSOT) formulation that can be solved\nefficiently via its convex dual. However, a significant computational challenge\nemerges when the continuous source measure is discretized via the finite\nelement (FE) method to handle complex geometries or densities, such as those\narising from solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The evaluation\nof the dual objective function requires dense interactions between the numerous\nsource quadrature points and all target points, creating a severe bottleneck\nfor large-scale problems. This paper presents a cohesive framework of numerical\nstrategies to overcome this challenge. We accelerate the dual objective and\ngradient evaluations by combining distance-based truncation with fast spatial\nqueries using R-trees. For overall convergence, we integrate multilevel\ntechniques based on hierarchies of both the FE source mesh and the discrete\ntarget measure, alongside a robust scheduling strategy for the regularization\nparameter. When unified, these methods drastically reduce the computational\ncost of RSOT, enabling its practical application to complex, large-scale\nscenarios.

Recent studies\ndemonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation\nto compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through\ndynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space\nmodel called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame\nsequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated\nby this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on\nspatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial\nfeatures for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive\nfield visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features\nafter sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive\nfrequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain\nsequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency.

Multivariate curve resolution\n(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed signals into components\n(base patterns) and their concentrations (intensity), playing a key role in\nunderstanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix\nfactorization (MF) and requires a user-specified number of components, usually\nunknown in real data. Once data or component number increases, the scalability\nof these MCR approaches face significant challenges. This study reformulates\nMCR as a data generative process (gMCR), and introduces an Energy-Based solver,\nEB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the smallest component set and their\nconcentrations for reconstructing the mixed signals faithfully. On synthetic\nbenchmarks with up to 256 components, EB-gMCR attains high reconstruction\nfidelity and recovers the component count within 5% at 20dB noise and\nnear-exact at 30dB. On two public spectral datasets, it identifies the correct\ncomponent count and improves component separation over MF-based MCR approaches\n(NMF variants, ICA, MCR-ALS). EB-gMCR is a general solver for fixed-pattern\nsignal unmixing (components remain invariant across mixtures). Domain priors\n(non-negativity, nonlinear mixing) enter as plug-in modules, enabling\nadaptation to new instruments or domains without altering the core selection\nlearning step.

To address these limitations,\nwe leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by\nsampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to limited\n3D training data, such a 3D model alone cannot capture all image details of\nunseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior, ensuring 3D\nconsistency by projecting input images into its latent space and enforcing\nadditional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel approach\nformulates Gaussian avatar creation as model inversion by fitting the\ngenerative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The generative\navatar provides an initialization for model fitting, enforces 3D\nregularization, and helps in refining pose.

To be able to apply control strategies, there is often a need for\nmodel reduction in order to reduce computational needs. This paper presents the\nfirst systematic approach for the joint reduction of state order and scheduling\nsignal dimension of LPV state space models. The existing methods typically\naddress these reductions separately. By formulating a tensorial form of LPV\nmodels with an affine dependency on the scheduling variables, we leverage\ntensor decomposition to find the dominant components of state and scheduling\nsubspaces. We extend the common Petrov-Galerkin projection approach to LPV\nframework by adding a scheduling projection. This extension enables the joint\nreduction. To find suitable subspaces for the extended Petrov-Galerkin\nprojection, we have developed two different methods: tensor-based LPV moment\nmatching, and an approach through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Advantages\nof the proposed methods are demonstrated on two different series-interconnected\nmass-spring-damper systems with nonlinear springs: one primarily used for\ncomparison with other methods and a more elaborate higher-order model designed\nto assess scalability.",

Our method can decompose complex problems,\nautonomously invoke retrieval tools to acquire necessary information, and\nperform effective reasoning. Specifically, we utilize a modified version of\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that supports rollout-with-thinking\ncapability. Next, we design two process-constrained reward functions. To handle\nthe shallow retrieval problem, we design a Progressive Retrieval Attenuation\n(PRA) reward to encourage essential retrievals. Then, to handle the\nover-thinking problem, we design Cost-Aware F1 (CAF) reward to balance the\nmodel performance with computational costs. We further design a phase-dependent\ntraining strategy, containing three training stages corresponding to cold start\nand these two rewards. Lastly, our method adopts a hybrid graph-textual\nretrieval to improve the reasoning capacity.

Existing zero-shot detectors often rely on\nstatistical measures that implicitly assume Gaussian distributions, a premise\nthat falters when confronted with the heavy-tailed statistical artifacts\ncharacteristic of adversarial or non-native English texts. This paper\nintroduces T-Detect, a novel detection method that fundamentally redesigns the\nstatistical core of curvature-based detectors.

This approach is theoretically\ngrounded in the empirical observation that adversarial texts exhibit\nsignificant leptokurtosis, rendering traditional statistical assumptions\ninadequate. T-Detect computes a detection score by normalizing the\nlog-likelihood of a passage against the expected moments of a t-distribution,\nproviding superior resilience to statistical outliers. We validate our approach\non the challenging RAID benchmark for adversarial text and the comprehensive\nHART dataset.

    "abstract": "Three-terminal electrochemical ionic synapses (EIoS) have recently attracted\ninterest for in-memory computing applications. These devices utilize\nelectrochemical ion intercalation to modulate the ion concentration in the\nchannel material. The electrical conductance, which is concentration dependent,\ncan be read separately and mapped to a non-volatile memory state. To compete\nwith other random access memory technologies, linear and symmetric conductance\nmodulation is often sought after, properties typically thought to be limited by\nthe slow ion diffusion timescale. A recent study by Onen et al.[1] examining\nprotonic EIoS with a tungsten oxide (WO3) channel revealed that this limiting\ntimescale seemed irrelevant, and linear conductance modulation was achieved\nover nanosecond timescales, much faster than the bulk ion diffusion. This\ncontrasts with previous studies that have shown similar conductance modulation\nwith pulse timescales of milliseconds to seconds. Understanding the phenomena\nbehind these conductance modulation properties in EIoS systems remains a\ncrucial question gating technological improvements to these devices. Here, we\nprovide a theoretical explanation that demonstrates how linearity and symmetry\narise from consistent control over the electrolyte-WO3 interface. Comparing\nthese past works, changes in the WO3 channel crystallinity were identified,\naffecting material thermodynamics and revealing that the device achieving\nnanosecond pulse timescales underwent phase separation. Coupling of electric\nfield polarizatino and increased electron conductivity in high-concentration\nfilaments, the reaction environment at the gate electrode can be controlled,\nresulting in ideal conductance modulation within the diffusion-limited regime.\nThis work highlights the potential for phase-separating systems to overcome the\ntraditional diffusion barriers that limit EIoS performance.",

A deeper understanding on\nhow synthesis conditions determine the obtained material is crucial to optimize\nthe use of resources when synthesizing new MOFs. In this contribution, we study\nthe impact of changing concentration, solvent and temperature on the molecular\nlevel mechanisms of the solvothermal nucleation process of ZIF-8 relying on\nmolecular dynamics simulations using a force field that incorporates\nmetal-ligand reactivity. We find that the nucleation is faster when the\nsynthesis is performed in dimethylsulfoxide than when it is performed in\nmethanol, in alignment with experimental observations. In the early steps of\nthe nucleation process, we observe the formation of linear oligomers containing\nmetal ions and ligands, which start forming cycles later on. All simulations\nlead to the formation of a final state that is highly-connected and partially\namorphous, which could be correlated to an intermediate species observed in\ndirect experiments. The mechanism of formation of this phase mainly consists of\nthe merging of smaller nuclei. Even though increasing temperature and the\nreactants concentration lead to a similar nucleation speedup, there are\ndifferences in ring populations and lifetimes within the highly-connected\namorphous intermediate phases that are formed in each case.

To this end,\nhere we compare topographic convolutional neural networks trained with two\nspatial constraints: Weight Similarity (WS), which pushes neighboring units to\ndevelop similar incoming weights, and Activation Similarity (AS), which\nenforces similarity in unit activations. We evaluate the resulting models on\nclassification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input\ndegradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations. Compared\nto both AS and standard CNNs, WS provided three main advantages: i) improved\nrobustness to noise, also showing higher accuracy under weight corruption; ii)\ngreater input sensitivity, reflected in higher activation variance; and iii)\nstronger functional localization, with units showing similar activations\npositioned at closer distances. In addition, WS produced differences in\norientation tuning, symmetry sensitivity, and eccentricity profiles of units,\nindicating an influence of this spatial constraint on the representational\ngeometry of the network.

However, the complexity of tasks, the spatiotemporal dynamism of\ndistributed device resources, and the inevitable assessment overhead\ndramatically increase the complexity and resource consumption of the trust\nevaluation process. As a result, ill-timed or overly frequent trust evaluations\ncan reduce utilization rate of constrained resources, negatively affecting\ncollaborative task execution. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an\nautonomous trust orchestration method based on a new concept of semantic\nchain-of-trust. Our technique employs agentic AI and hypergraph to establish\nand maintain trust relationships among devices. By leveraging its strengths in\nautonomous perception, task decomposition, and semantic reasoning, we propose\nagentic AI to perceive device states and autonomously perform trust evaluations\nof collaborators based on historical performance data only during device idle\nperiods, thereby enabling efficient utilization of distributed resources. In\naddition, agentic AI performs task-specific trust evaluations on collaborator\nresources by analyzing the alignment between resource capabilities and task\nrequirements. Moreover, by maintaining a trust hypergraph embedded with trust\nsemantics for each device, agentic AI enables hierarchical management of\ncollaborators and identifies collaborators requiring trust evaluation based on\ntrust semantics, thereby achieving a balance between overhead and trust\naccuracy. Furthermore, local trust hypergraphs from multiple devices can be\nchained together to support multi-hop collaboration, enabling efficient\ncoordination in large-scale systems.

Dimples were placed on the suction side at\nnon-dimensional chordwise locations of $l_D/c = 0.035$ and $0.35$, and the flow\nresponse was studied at a fixed angle of attack $\\alpha = 5^\\circ$.

Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD)\nshowed that dimples redistribute modal energy depending on Reynolds number: at\nlow $Re_c$, they reduce broadband content and suppress unsteadiness, while at\nhigh $Re_c$, they amplify dominant shedding modes and broaden the spectral\nenergy distribution. These results demonstrate that dimples can passively\nmodulate unsteady forces and wake dynamics for a flow over a streamlined body,\neither suppressing or enhancing flow instabilities depending on the regime.",

To address the challenge, this paper proposes a\nnetworked physical computing system that integrates the physical attributes of\ncomputing resources and tasks as well as task-specific trust relationships\namong devices to enable value-driven task completion. Specifically, we propose\na state-of-the-art hypergraph-aided trusted task-resource matching\n(TTR-matching) framework to achieve the envisioned physical computing. First, a\ntask-specific trusted physical resource hypergraph is defined, which integrates\ntask-specific trust, the physical attributes of resources, and task types. This\nenables accurate modeling of device collaboration dependencies under specific\ntask types. Next, a task hypergraph is generated to associate the task\ninitiator with the physical attributes of the corresponding tasks. Based on\nthese two hypergraphs, a hypergraph matching algorithm is designed to\nfacilitate task-specific trusted collaborator selection and accurate\ntask-resource matching for value-maximizing task completion. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed TTR-matching framework\noutperforms comparison algorithms in identifying task-specific trustworthy\ncollaborators and maximizing the average value of task completion.",

    "abstract": "Large language model-based agents, empowered by in-context learning (ICL),\nhave demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning and tool-use tasks.\nHowever, existing works have shown that the effectiveness of ICL is highly\nsensitive to the choice of demonstrations, with suboptimal examples often\nleading to unstable or degraded performance. While prior work has explored\nexample selection, including in some agentic or multi-step settings, existing\napproaches typically rely on heuristics or task-specific designs and lack a\ngeneral, theoretically grounded criterion for what constitutes an effective\ndemonstration across reasoning steps. Therefore, it is non-trivial to develop a\nprincipled, general-purpose method for selecting demonstrations that\nconsistently benefit agent performance. In this paper, we address this\nchallenge with DICE, Dynamic In-Context Example Selection for LLM Agents, a\ntheoretically grounded ICL framework for agentic tasks that selects the most\nrelevant demonstrations at each step of reasoning. Our approach decomposes\ndemonstration knowledge into transferable and non-transferable components\nthrough a causal lens, showing how the latter can introduce spurious\ndependencies that impair generalization. We further propose a stepwise\nselection criterion with a formal guarantee of improved agent performance.\nImportantly, DICE is a general, framework-agnostic solution that can be\nintegrated as a plug-in module into existing agentic frameworks without any\nadditional training cost. Extensive experiments across diverse domains\ndemonstrate our method's effectiveness and generality, highlighting the\nimportance of principled, context-aware demo selection for robust and efficient\nLLM agents.",

This is\na critical limitation, as wide confidence intervals around predictions can\nundermine clinical utility and fairness, particularly if precision varies\nacross subgroups. We propose methodology for calculating the sample size\nrequired to ensure precise and fair predictions in models with continuous\noutcomes. Building on linear regression theory and the Fisher's unit\ninformation matrix, our approach calculates how sample size impacts the\nepistemic (model-based) uncertainty of predictions and allows researchers to\neither (i) evaluate whether an existing dataset is sufficiently large, or (ii)\ndetermine the sample size needed to target a particular confidence interval\nwidth around predictions. The method requires real or synthetic data\nrepresenting the target population. To assess fairness,the approach can\nevaluate prediction precision across subgroups. Extensions to prediction\nintervals are included to additionally address aleatoric uncertainty. Our\nmethodology provides a practical framework for examining required sample sizes\nwhen developing or updating prediction models with continuous outcomes,\nfocusing on achieving precise and equitable predictions.

This paper benchmarks and analyzes popular PEFT methods on\nconvolutional architectures typically deployed in resource-constrained edge\nenvironments. We evaluate LoRA, DoRA, and GaLore for updating standard and\ndepthwise convolutional architectures to handle distribution shifts and\naccommodate unseen classes. We utilize recently proposed PyTorch profilers to\ncompare the updated model performance and computational costs of these PEFT\nmethods with traditional fine-tuning approaches. With resource efficiency in\nmind, we investigate their update behavior across different rank dimensions. We\nfind that the evaluated PEFT methods are only half as memory-efficient when\napplied to depthwise-separable convolution architectures, compared to their\nefficiency with LLMs. Conversely, when targeting convolu- tional architectures\noptimized for edge deployment, adapter-based PEFT methods can reduce floating\npoint operations (FLOPs) during model updates by up to 95%.

The algorithm relies on a simple threshold-based\nprocedure. A key assumption in [Becchetti et al., SODA 2020] is that the input\ngraph $G$ is static - i.e., both its vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ remain\nunchanged throughout the process - while the analysis of RAES in dynamic models\nis left as a major open question.\n  In this work, we investigate the behavior of RAES under a dynamic graph model\ninduced by a streaming node-churn process (also known as the sliding window\nmodel), where, at each discrete round, a new node joins the graph and the\noldest node departs. This process yields a bounded-degree dynamic graph\n$\\mathcal{G} =\\{ G_t = (V_t, E_t) : t \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ that captures essential\ncharacteristics of peer-to-peer networks -- specifically, node churn and\nthreshold on the number of connections each node can manage. We prove that\nevery snapshot $G_t$ in the dynamic graph sequence has good expansion\nproperties with high probability.

These variations introduce qualitatively new\nphysical mechanisms absent in constant-viscosity flows. This review surveys\nsuch phenomena across scales. In low Reynolds number (Stokes) flows, viscosity\ngradients couple translation and rotation, enabling novel particle responses to\nuniform forcing-- mechanisms that microorganisms may exploit. In shear flows,\nviscosity variation alters base flow profiles and breaks symmetries, modifying\nstability and transition dynamics. At high Reynolds numbers, stratification\nfundamentally changes the singular perturbation structure governing energy\nproduction, enhancing or suppressing canonical instabilities and introducing\nnew ones. Viscosity variation also affects nonnormal growth and nonlinear\ninteractions that drive transition to turbulence. While laminar and fully\ndeveloped turbulence have been extensively studied, transitional processes\nremain poorly understood in variable-viscosity flows. In turbulent regimes,\nviscosity variation impacts jets, wall-bounded flows, and mixing layers. At\ngeophysical scales, incorporating eddy viscosity stratification in climate\nmodels may improve predictions, while in Earth's mantle, viscosity contrasts\ndrive large-scale convection and geological evolution. Particle-laden flows,\ncommon across contexts, can generate effective viscosity stratification through\ninhomogeneous loading.

Recent\nrobotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to\nincrease data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse\nmorphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified\ntraining challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics\nDiffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data\nto enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale\negocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations\nprovide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and\ncan benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,\nand (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action\nencoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B\nparameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.\nExtensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,\nsingle-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and\nrobustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from\nscratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving\nsignificant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in\nsimulation and real-world experiments, respectively.

Accurate image\nregistration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion.

To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign\nis the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces\na dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward\nregistration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration\nnetwork reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration\nstructure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic\nHierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into\nhyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing\ninterference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image\nregistration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that\nhyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image\nregistration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in\nboth image alignment and fusion.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent\nnon-communicable chronic disease that substantially reduces life expectancy.\nAccurate estimation of all-cause mortality risk in T2DM patients is crucial for\npersonalizing and optimizing treatment strategies.

Key survival-associated features were identified, and multiple\nmachine learning (ML) models were trained and validated to predict all-cause\nmortality risk. To improve model interpretability, Shapley additive\nexplanations (SHAP) was applied to the best-performing model. Results.

However, a persistent\nchallenge remains the short battery lifetime of such compact sensor edge\ndevices. Integrating artificial intelligence can help overcome this limitation\nby enabling intelligent real-time decision-making, thereby reducing the energy\nconsumption and prolonging the battery life. However, this remains challenging\ndue to data sparsity and the limited resources of the device restricting the\noverall model size. In this work, we introduce a multi-task neural network that\ncombines the functionalities of precise self-localization within the\ngastrointestinal tract with the ability to detect anomalies in the small\nintestine within a single model. Throughout the development process, we\nconsistently restricted the total number of parameters to ensure the\nfeasibility to deploy such model in a small capsule. We report the first\nmulti-task results using the recently published Galar dataset, integrating\nestablished multi-task methods and Viterbi decoding for subsequent time-series\nanalysis. This outperforms current single-task models and represents a\nsignificant advance in AI-based approaches in this field.

In our previous work, the in-medium $NN$ cross sections at various\ndensities and isospin asymmetry were systematically studied within the\nBrueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) framework. The calculation employed are based on\nthe exact treatment of the total momentum of the scattering pair in $G$ matrix,\nin contrast to the commonly used total momentum approximation. In the present\nstudy, we find that the in-medium $NN$ cross sections have negligible effects\non the neutron-to-proton ($n/p$) ratio of emitted nucleons and on the\ndifference between neutron and proton transverse flows.

The microscopic origin of these axions\nis diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and\ncompactification axions in string theory, to \\cm contorted geometries\nexemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan\ntheory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons\n(CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a\nKerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance\nand the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The\nspecific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are\nmassive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a\nTakagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it\nis shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity\n(GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to\nthe CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the\naxionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through\nthe average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be\nproduced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the\nstructure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a\nleft-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the\nanomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.",

To conduct an in-depth performance\nanalysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed\ndataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex\nenvironments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only\n35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410\ndataset.

We show, notably, that secret key generation is potentially feasible\neven with 20 cm ground telescopes, highlighting the high scalability potential\nof such a configuration.",

    "abstract": "The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across\ndistributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has\nprimarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication\nefficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.\nHowever, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose\nestimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a\ncritical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades\nsignificantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level\nheterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as\nanother axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To\naddress this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a\nmethod that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through\nmulti-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs\n(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances\nresolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and\ntheoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates\nresolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also\ncan be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although\nthis paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals\ndistinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution\nrepresentation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks\nthat rely on preserving spatial detail.",

First, the Temperley--Lieb algebra is defined on non-crossing\npartitions, and a bijection between a Dyck path and a non-crossing partition is\nshown to be compatible with the Temperley--Lieb algebra on Dyck paths, or\nequivalently chord diagrams. We show that the Kreweras endomorphism on\nnon-crossing partitions is equivalent to the rotation of chord diagrams under\nthe bijection. Secondly, by considering an increasing $r$-chain in the graded\nlattice of non-crossing partitions, we define the Fuss--Catalan algebras on\nincreasing $r$-chains. Through a bijection between an increasing $r$-chain and\na generalized Dyck path, one naturally obtains the Fuss--Catalan algebra on\ngeneralized Dyck paths. As generalizations of the Fuss--Catalan algebra, we\nintroduce the one- and two-boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras. Increasing\n$r$-chains of symmetric non-crossing partitions give symmetric generalized Dyck\npaths by the bijection, and the boundary Fuss--Catalan algebras naturally act\non them. We show that these representations are compatible with the\ndiagrammatic representations of the algebras by use of generalized chord\ndiagrams. Thirdly, we discuss the integrability of the Fuss--Catalan algebras.\nFor the Fuss--Catalan algebras with boundaries, we obtain a new solution of the\nreflection equation in the case of $r=2$.",

    "abstract": "Modern online platforms configure multiple pages to accommodate diverse user\nneeds. This multi-page architecture inherently establishes a two-stage\ninteraction paradigm between the user and the platform: (1) Stage I: page\nnavigation, navigating users to a specific page and (2) Stage II: in-page\ninteraction, where users engage with customized content within the specific\npage. While the majority of research has been focusing on the sequential\nrecommendation task that improves users' feedback in Stage II, there has been\nlittle investigation on how to achieve better page navigation in Stage I. To\nfill this gap, we formally define the task of Personalized Landing Page\nModeling (PLPM) into the field of recommender systems: Given a user upon app\nentry, the goal of PLPM is to proactively select the most suitable landing page\nfrom a set of candidates (e.g., functional tabs, content channels, or\naggregation pages) to optimize the short-term PDR metric and the long-term user\nengagement and satisfaction metrics, while adhering to industrial constraints.\nAdditionally, we propose KLAN (Kuaishou Landing-page Adaptive Navigator), a\nhierarchical solution framework designed to provide personalized landing pages\nunder the formulation of PLPM. KLAN comprises three key components: (1)\nKLAN-ISP captures inter-day static page preference; (2) KLAN-IIT captures\nintra-day dynamic interest transitions and (3) KLAN-AM adaptively integrates\nboth components for optimal navigation decisions. Extensive online experiments\nconducted on the Kuaishou platform demonstrate the effectiveness of KLAN,\nobtaining +0.205% and +0.192% improvements on in Daily Active Users (DAU) and\nuser Lifetime (LT). Our KLAN is ultimately deployed on the online platform at\nfull traffic, serving hundreds of millions of users.

This framework localizes quantum information to the\nhorizon without invoking entanglement across it, offering a unitary evaporation\nmechanism governed by topological degrees of freedom.

They constitute a key ingredient\nin modelling the systematic uncertainties present in the analysis. However, in\norder to reach the large volume and high precision required for galaxy surveys,\nwe generally populate dark matter haloes with galaxies following certain\ntheoretical recipes. Such recipes contain free parameters that are calibrated\ncomparing the simulations against observations, but the creation of galaxy\nmocks is a stochastic process with a large number of free parameters to\ncalibrate. We present a new pipeline, based on the differential evolution\nalgorithm, that can calibrate galaxy mocks in a fully automated way for\nrealistic scenarios with a large parameter space. We apply the pipeline to\ngalaxy mocks built on a combination of halo occupation distribution and\nsub-halo abundance matching techniques. We show that our pipeline can properly\ncalibrate the galaxy mocks against observations for both $\\Lambda$CDM and\nmodified gravity halo catalogues. This type of calibration pipeline provides a\nnew tool for automating the calibration of future massive galaxy mocks.",

    "abstract": "EEG Source localization is a critical tool in neuroscience, with applications\nranging from epilepsy diagnosis to cognitive research. It involves solving an\nill-posed inverse problem that lacks a unique solution unless constrained by\nprior knowledge. The Bayesian framework enables the incorporation of such\nknowledge, typically encoded through prior models. Various algorithms have been\nproposed for source localization, and they differ significantly in how prior\nknowledge is incorporated. Some approaches rely on anatomical or functional\nconstraints, while others use statistical distributions or sampling-based\ntechniques. In this landscape, the Standardized Kalman Filter (SKF) represents\na dynamic Bayesian approach that integrates temporal modeling with a Gaussian\nprior structure. It addresses the depth bias, a common limitation in source\nlocalization, through a post-hoc standardization step that equalizes\nsensitivity across cortical depths and makes deep activity detection feasible.\n  This study focuses on the development and optimization of Gaussian prior\nmodels within the SKF framework for simultaneous cortical and sub-cortical\nactivity detection. Synthetic data similar to the P20 / N20 component of the\nsomatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) was used to identify effective prior\nparameter configurations for reconstructing both deep and superficial sources\nunder different noise levels. We also investigated the role of RTS smoothing in\nenhancing source separability. Our results indicate that raising the\nstandardization exponent to 1.25, along with smoothing, significantly improves\ndepth localization accuracy at low noise levels.",

This is because of emergence of maximum\ndomain wall density during ``switching\" of the domains. Domain configuration\nchanges from such an ``optimum\" state if higher or lower bias voltage is\napplied at a much faster or slower rate. Phase-field simulation using\ntime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation shows dependence of the domain wall\ndensity during switching on the bias voltage amplitude and its maximization at\na specific bias voltage amplitude. The radius of curvature of the resulting\npolarization ($P$) versus voltage ($V$) hysteresis loop at the coercive voltage\n($V_C$) also turns out to be depending on whether or not intrinsic switching\nkinetics is followed. All these results indicate a close correlation among the\nbias voltage pulse profile (amplitude and time scale), domain wall density\nduring switching, shape of the resulting ferroelectric hysteresis loop, and the\ntransient negative capacitance.

Conducting such an analysis is crucial for\nunderstanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint\nspatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression.

The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to\ncapture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on\ntwo HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nadjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models.

Furthermore, grounded in the principle of Mutual\nInformation Maximization, we introduce a cross-modal enhancement mechanism that\ngenerates proxy modalities from mixed token-level representations and learns\nfine-grained token-level correspondences between modalities. The enhanced\nunimodal features are then fused and passed through the CNN-Mamba backbone,\nenabling local-to-global cross-modal interaction and comprehensive multimodal\nintegration. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MSA datasets demonstrate\nthat HCMEN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving superior performance across various missing modality scenarios.

While recent dual-teacher\nself-supervised frameworks reduce reliance on labeled data, their linear\nprojection layers and localized focus struggle to model global compositional\ncontext and complex style-feature interactions. We enhance the dual-teacher\nknowledge distillation framework to address these limitations by replacing\nconventional MLP projection and prediction heads with Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetworks (KANs). Our approach retains complementary guidance from two teacher\nnetworks, one emphasizing localized texture and brushstroke patterns, the other\ncapturing broader stylistic hierarchies while leveraging KANs' spline-based\nactivations to model nonlinear feature correlations with mathematical\nprecision. Experiments on WikiArt and Pandora18k demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms the base dual teacher architecture in Top-1 accuracy. Our findings\nhighlight the importance of KANs in disentangling complex style manifolds,\nleading to better linear probe accuracy than MLP projections.",

This paper explores the critical role of data in\nAI systems, scrutinizing the training datasets that form the basis of AI's\ngenerative capabilities and the implications for architectural practice. We\nargue that when architects approach AI passively, without actively engaging\ntheir own creative and critical faculties, they risk becoming passive users\nlocked in an endless loop of horizontal expansion without meaningful vertical\ngrowth.

    "abstract": "Timely and informative data dissemination in communication networks is\nessential for enhancing system performance and energy efficiency, as it reduces\nthe transmission of outdated or redundant data. Timeliness metrics, such as Age\nof Information (AoI), effectively quantify data freshness; however, these\nmetrics fail to account for the intrinsic informativeness of the content\nitself. To address this limitation, content-based metrics have been proposed\nthat combine both timeliness and informativeness. Nevertheless, existing\nstudies have predominantly focused on evaluating average metric values, leaving\nthe complete distribution-particularly in multi-hop network scenarios-largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the\nstationary distribution of the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a\ncontent-based metric, under various scheduling policies, including randomized\nstationary, uniform, and threshold-based policies, with transmission\nconstraints in single-hop and multi-hop networks. We derive closed-form\nexpressions for the stationary distribution and average VAoI under these\nscheduling approaches. Furthermore, for threshold-based scheduling, we\nanalytically determine the optimal threshold value that minimizes VAoI and\nderive the corresponding optimal VAoI in closed form.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent proliferation of machine learning methods like SINDy that\npromise automatic discovery of governing equations from time-series data, there\nremain significant challenges to discovering models from noisy datasets. One\nreason is that the linear regression underlying these methods assumes that all\nnoise resides in the training target (the regressand), which is the time\nderivative, whereas the measurement noise is in the states (the regressors).\nRecent methods like modified-SINDy and DySMHO address this error-in-variable\nproblem by leveraging information from the model's temporal evolution, but they\nare also imposing the equation as a hard constraint, which effectively assumes\nno error in the regressand. Without relaxation, this hard constraint prevents\nassimilation of data longer than Lyapunov time. Instead, the fulfilment of the\nmodel equation should be treated as a soft constraint to account for the small\nyet critical error introduced by numerical truncation. The uncertainties in\nboth the regressor and the regressand invite the use of orthogonal distance\nregression (ODR). By incorporating ODR with the Bayesian framework for model\nselection, we introduce a novel method for model discovery, termed ODR-BINDy,\nand assess its performance against current SINDy variants using the Lorenz63,\nRossler, and Van Der Pol systems as case studies. Our findings indicate that\nODR-BINDy consistently outperforms all existing methods in recovering the\ncorrect model from sparse and noisy datasets. For instance, our ODR-BINDy\nmethod reliably recovers the Lorenz63 equation from data with noise\ncontamination levels of up to 30%.",

Namely, the remarkable particle size\neffect arises for the position of lack of fusion boundary, i.e. for the range\nof process parameters where the laser power becomes sufficient for complete\nthrough-thickness melting of the powder layer at given laser scanning speed. We\nestablished that this boundary corresponds to an approximately constant linear\nenergy density at low levels of Peclet number (Pe < 2), while the constant\nenthalpy density defines this boundary at the higher levels (Pe > 2).\nSpecifically, when the mean particle size ranges from 28 to 64 microns, the\nrequired linear energy density for stable track formation ranges from 50 to 167\nJ/m and the nominal enthalpy density ranges from 4.4 to 15 J/mm^3.

Additionally,\npush-based communication is used to proactively send critical data without\nwaiting for a request. This adaptive approach ensures timely, context-aware,\nand efficient data delivery across different network conditions. To achieve\nhigh energy efficiency, we incorporate a wake-up radio mechanism and we design\na tailored medium access control (MAC) protocol that supports data traffic\nbelonging to the different communication classes. A comprehensive system-level\nanalysis is conducted, accounting for the wake-up control operation and\nevaluating three key performance metrics: the success probability of anomaly\nreports (push traffic), the success probability of query responses (pull\ntraffic) and the total energy consumption. Numerical results characterize the\nsystem's behavior and highlight the inherent trade-off in success probabilities\nbetween push- and pull-based traffic as a function of allocated communication\nresources.

The review focuses on two main categories: task-specific multimodal\napproaches and large-scale multimodal foundation models. Task-specific\napproaches are designed for particular clinical applications such as lesion\ndetection, disease diagnosis, and image synthesis. These methods utilize a\nvariety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical\ncoherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models\ncombine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models\npretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust\ncross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision\nsupport. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics,\nand methodological innovations including self-supervised learning,\nattention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing\nchallenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of\ninterpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient\npopulations. Finally, the survey outlines promising future directions that\nemphasize the use of ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning-based\nreasoning frameworks to create intelligent, interpretable, and clinically\napplicable AI systems for ophthalmology.",

Many existing methods focus on monitoring only the\nrespiratory rate, while others focus on monitoring the motion of the chest as a\npatient breathes, which is referred to as the respiratory waveform. This paper\npresents WiRM, a two-staged approach to contactless respiration monitoring. In\nthe first stage, WiRM improves upon existing respiratory rate estimation\ntechniques by using conjugate multiplication for phase sanitisation and\nadaptive multi-trace carving (AMTC) for tracing how the respiratory rate\nchanges over time. When compared against three state-of-the-art methods, WiRM\nhas achieved an average reduction of $38\\%$ in respiratory rate root mean\nsquared error (RMSE). In the second stage, WiRM uses this improved respiratory\nrate estimate to inform the decomposition and selection of the respiratory\nwaveform from the CSI data. Remarkably, WiRM delivers a $178.3\\%$ improvement\nin average absolute correlation with the ground truth respiratory waveform.\nWithin the literature, it is difficult to compare the robustness of existing\nalgorithms in noisy environments.

In UCN massive MIMO systems, the dimension of the\nprecoders is reduced compared to conventional network massive MIMO. It\nsimplifies the implementation of precoders in practical systems. However, the\nmatrix inversion in traditional linear precoders still requires high\ncomputational complexity. To avoid the matrix inversion, we employ the\nsymplectic optimization framework, where optimization problems are solved based\non dissipative Hamiltonian dynamical systems. To better fit symplectic\noptimization, we transform the received model into the real field and\nreformulate the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem. The objective\nfunction of the optimization problem is viewed as the potential energy of the\ndynamical system. Due to energy dissipation, the continuous dynamical system\nalways converges to a state with minimal potential energy. By discretizing the\ncontinuous system while preserving the symplectic structure, we obtain an\niterative method for the precoder design. The complexity analysis of the\nproposed symplectic method is also provided to show its high computational\nefficiency.

Recent theoretical advances have reignited interest in its\nnonlinear counterpart, the nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which spin\nmagnetization is induced by a second-order electric field. However, the\nintrinsic contribution to both effects is generally forbidden in systems\npreserving time-reversal symmetry ($\\mathcal{T}$) or composite symmetries such\nas $\\mathcal{T}\\tau_{1/2}$, where $\\tau_{1/2}$ denotes a half-lattice\ntranslation. In such systems, spin magnetization typically emerges either from\nextrinsic mechanisms but limited to metals due to their Fermi-surface property,\nor from dynamical electric fields with a terahertz driving frequency. Here, we\npropose a new mechanism for spin magnetization, arising from the interplay of\nmagnetic and electric fields, termed the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein\neffect. Remarkably, its intrinsic component, determined purely by the\nmaterial's band structure, can appear even in $\\mathcal{T}$-invariant\nmaterials, but lacking inversion symmetry ($\\mathcal{P}$), including\ninsulators. On the other hand, we illustrate that its extrinsic component can\nserve as a sensitive indicator of the N\\'eel vector reversal in\n$\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials, offering a\nnovel route for antiferromagnetic order detection. To validate our theory, we\nperform explicit calculations using a two-band Dirac model and a tight-binding\nmodel on a honeycomb lattice, finding that both effects yield sizable spin\nmagnetization. Our findings establish the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein\neffect as a versatile platform for both exploring nonlinear spin physics and\nenabling symmetry-based detection of antiferromagnetic order.",

Moreover, leveraging the symmetric multi-level\nToeplitz-like structure of the coefficient matrix in the discrete linear\nsystems, we enhance the computational efficiency of the proposed scheme with a\nsine transform-based preconditioner, ensuring a mesh-size-independent\nconvergence rate for the conjugate gradient method. Finally, two numerical\nexamples validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed preconditioner compared to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing\nthem from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior\nwork has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply\nreject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user\nrequests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm\nwhere models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to\nresolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC\nand GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical\nreasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math\nproblems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify\nand request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty\nby introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions.\nExperiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models\nexcel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and\ninference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking,\nespecially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning\n(RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm,\nwe achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to\n73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more\neffectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.",

    "abstract": "Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a\npromising direction in representation learning. However, current\nvision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify\nclinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their\ninherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically\ndepend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for\nsmall-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping\nmechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we\ncompute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each\ntoken selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch\nselects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive\ngrouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped\nThreshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping\nthresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages\nbased on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,\nwe introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each\nimage-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a\nBidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance\nfine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.\nExtensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method\nachieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks\nunder both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.",

Graph\nclustering is an effective paradigm for addressing this issue, as it models the\ncomplex relationships among documents using graph structures and reduces\ninformation redundancy through clustering, achieving significant research\nprogress. However, existing methods often only consider single-relational\ngraphs and require a predefined number of clusters, which hinders their ability\nto fully represent rich relational information and adaptively partition\nsentence groups to reduce redundancy. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nMRGSEM-Sum, an unsupervised multi-document summarization framework based on\nmulti-relational graphs and structural entropy minimization. Specifically, we\nconstruct a multi-relational graph that integrates semantic and discourse\nrelations between sentences, comprehensively modeling the intricate and dynamic\nconnections among sentences across documents. We then apply a two-dimensional\nstructural entropy minimization algorithm for clustering, automatically\ndetermining the optimal number of clusters and effectively organizing sentences\ninto coherent groups. Finally, we introduce a position-aware compression\nmechanism to distill each cluster, generating concise and informative\nsummaries. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Multi-News,\nDUC-2004, PubMed, and WikiSum) demonstrate that our approach consistently\noutperforms previous unsupervised methods and, in several cases, achieves\nperformance comparable to supervised models and large language models. Human\nevaluation demonstrates that the summaries generated by MRGSEM-Sum exhibit high\nconsistency and coverage, approaching human-level quality.",

In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose\nembedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs\nwithout altering their original architectures or introducing significant\ncomputational overhead.

To\naddress the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight\nPlanning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning.

Experiments on 13\nadvanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only\n21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%.

    "abstract": "Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has arisen as a\npromising technology for enhancing wireless communication systems by enabling\nflexible and intelligent wave manipulation. This is achieved through the\ninterconnections among the ports of the impedance network, enabling wave\nreconfiguration when they flow through the surface. Thus, the output wave at\none port depends on waves impinging on neighboring ports, allowing non-local\ncontrol of both phase and magnitude. Non-reciprocal (NR)-BD-RIS further\nenhances this capability by breaking circuit reciprocity and, consequently,\nchannel reciprocity. This feature potentially benefits communication among\nnon-aligned transceivers. This paper introduces a novel application of\nNR-BD-RIS in full-duplex (FD) wireless circulators, where multiple FD devices\ncommunicate via an NR-BD-RIS. This system is particularly beneficial for secure\ntransmission, as it enforces one-way communication among FD devices, suppresses\nsignal from all other users, and thus prevents eavesdropping. In addition, a\nphysics-compliant system model is considered by incorporating structural\nscattering, also known as specular reflection. By accounting for this effect,\nthe advantages of NR-BD-RIS are further validated. Specifically, we formulate\nan all-user sum-rate maximization problem and propose an iterative optimization\nalgorithm that employs block coordinate descent (BCD) and penalty dual\ndecomposition (PDD) methods. Numerical evaluations illustrate that NR-BD-RIS\nconsistently outperforms reciprocal (R)-BD-RIS and conventional diagonal\n(D)-RIS in terms of sum-rate performance, particularly when more than two\nimpinging and reflection directions need to be supported. By analyzing the\npower of signals from all other users and the beampatterns, we show that secure\ntransmission can be achieved.",

We analyze how\nthe ionization state of the disk atmosphere, approximated with a\nconstant-density surface layer assumed to be either in collisional ionization\nequilibrium or photoionization equilibrium, can influence the\nspectro-polarimetric properties of the radiation at the emitting disk surface.\nSubsequently we study how these are modified by the propagation in a strong\ngravitational field.",

This one-shot alignment struggles with\nnoisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal\nfeature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source\nscenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple\nsource domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this\nissue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting\nCLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a\nhigh-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a\nwell-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training\nprogresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the\nmodel to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label\nnoise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and\npromotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely\ndomain-invariant features.

In\nthis paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly\nintegrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of\nemotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for\nboth tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding\nchain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale\nemotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.\nSimultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to\nguide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the\ndiversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce\nthe emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the\nfusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional\ngeneration guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint\ntraining allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the\nunderstanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to\nselect high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained\nmodel, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these\ngeneration-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding\ncapacity.

We rely\nexclusively on data that would be experimentally accessible -- i.e.,\ntemperature-dependent polarization and strain, both with and without external\nelectric fields and stresses applied --, to explore scenarios where the\ntraining set could be obtained from laboratory measurements. We introduce a\nscheme that allows us to identify optimal polynomial models of the\ntemperature-dependent free energy surface, mapped as a function of the\nhomogeneous electric polarization and homogeneous strain. Our results for\nPbTiO$_{3}$ show that a very simple polynomial -- where only two parameters\ndepend linearly on temperature -- is sufficient to yield a correct description\nof the material's behavior. Remarkably, the obtained models also capture the\nsubtle couplings by which elastic strain controls key features of\nferroelectricity in PbTiO$_{3}$ -- i.e., the symmetry of the polar phase and\nthe discontinuous character of the transition --, despite the fact that no\neffort was made to include such information in the training set.

    "abstract": "Visualizing uncertainty is integral to data analysis, yet its application is\noften hindered by the need for specialized methods for quantifying and\nrepresenting uncertainty for different types of graphics. We introduce a\ngeneral approach that simplifies this process. The core idea is to treat the\nstatistical graphic as a function of the underlying distribution. Instead of\nfirst calculating uncertainty metrics and then plotting them, the method\npropagates uncertainty through to the visualization. By repeatedly sampling\nfrom the data distribution and generating a complete statistical graphic for\neach sample, a distribution over graphics is produced. These graphics are\naggregated pixel-by-pixel to create a single, static image. This approach is\nversatile, requires no specific knowledge from the user beyond how to create\nthe basic statistical graphic, and comes with theoretical coverage guarantees\nfor standard cases such as confidence intervals and bands. We provide a\nreference implementation as a Python library to demonstrate the method's\nutility. Our approach not only reproduces conventional uncertainty\nvisualizations for point estimates and regression lines but also seamlessly\nextends to non-standard cases, including pie charts, stacked bar charts, and\ntables. This approach makes uncertainty visualization more accessible to\npractitioners and can be a valuable tool for teaching uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive\ncapabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical\napplications are still limited by massive model parameters and high\ncomputational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have\nshown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free\ncompression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision\nand language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in\nLVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer\npruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find\nthat non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps\npose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,\nwe propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL\ntokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps.

Each identified regime is subsequently modeled by an\nindependent conditional neural process (CNP), trained to learn localized\nmappings from input contexts to 24-dimensional hourly price trajectories, with\nfinal predictions computed as regime-weighted mixtures of these CNP outputs. We\nrigorously evaluate R-NP against deep neural networks (DNN) and Lasso estimated\nauto-regressive (LEAR) models by integrating their forecasts into diverse\nbattery storage optimization frameworks, including price arbitrage, risk\nmanagement, grid services, and cost minimization.

The analysis begins with foundational\narchitectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced\nresidual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable\neffective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.\nSubsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new\nparadigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image\npatches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale\nimage recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we\ninvestigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are\nanalyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a\ngenerator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,\nLatent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative\nmethods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually\ncompressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater\ncomputational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image\ngeneration. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce\ndependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a\nstudent network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,\nyielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with\nMasked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design\nto reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective\nmethod for pre-training large-scale vision models.",

In this work,\nwe point out a fundamental inconsistency in the conventional treatment of\n$N_{\\rm eff}$ in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), particularly regarding its\napplicability to new physics scenarios where $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$, the\ndeviation of $N_{\\rm eff}$ from the standard BBN prediction, is negative. To\nensure consistent interpretation, it is imperative to either restrict the\nallowed range of $N_{\\rm eff}$ or systematically adjust neutrino-induced\nreaction rates based on physically motivated assumptions. As a concrete\nexample, we consider a simple scenario in which a negative $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$\narises from entropy injection into the electromagnetic sector due to the decay\nof long-lived particles after neutrino decoupling. This process dilutes the\nneutrino density and suppresses the rate of neutrino-driven neutron-proton\nconversion. Under this assumption, we demonstrate that the resulting BBN\nconstraints on $N_{\\rm eff}$ deviate significantly from those obtained by the\nconventional, but unphysical, extrapolation of dark radiation scenarios into\nthe $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} < 0$ regime.",

Current technologies face two significant challenges: first,\nthe traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution,\nresulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional\nconvolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution\nclasses; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small\ntargets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract\nmulti-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage\nframework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning.

For\ntraffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal\nContrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a\nVision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL\nlearns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating\nclass confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method\nachieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for\nall-class recognition.

Our first-principles calculations show that as\nthe smearing temperature is increased, the compound becomes structurally stable\nagain.

The results depend critically\non this selection method, which has caveats and uncertainties associated with\nit, as we discuss in a dedicated section of the paper. Using the column density\nratio of the excited and ground states of C II and Si II, we place upper limits\non the electron density as $n_{\\rm e}$ $<$ 0.2 - 18 cm$^{-3}$ and lower limits\non their radial distance from the flux source $R$ as greater than several\nhundreds of kpc.

Unlike natural images, medical images\ntypically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with\ndomain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique\ncharacteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.\n  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework\ntailored for medical image segmentation.

    "abstract": "Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV)\nroad scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in\nplanning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology\nreasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal\ninformation to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently,\nstream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by\nincorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it\nremains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose\nestimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology\nreasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of\npose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision\nof both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual\nreinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce\nlatent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate\nthe state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This\ndesign substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the\nslow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate\nthat FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment\ndetection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5%\non OLS).",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in deploying automated vehicles (AVs) is ensuring they make\nappropriate decisions in ethically challenging everyday driving situations.\nWhile much attention has been paid to rare, high-stakes dilemmas such as\ntrolley problems, similar tensions also arise in routine scenarios, such as\nnavigating empty intersections, where multiple human considerations, including\nlegality and comfort, often conflict. Current AV planning systems typically\nrely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations\nand can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper\nproposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that\noperationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The\nframework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as\nquantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align\nwith these reasons. By assigning adjustable weights to agent priorities and\nintegrating a balance function to discourage the exclusion of any agent, the\nframework supports interpretable decision evaluation. Through a\nreal-world-inspired overtaking scenario, we show how this approach reveals\ntensions, for instance between regulatory compliance, efficiency, and comfort.\nThe framework functions as a modular evaluation layer over existing planning\nalgorithms. It offers a transparent tool for assessing ethical alignment in\neveryday scenarios and provides a practical step toward implementing MHC in\nreal-world AV deployment.",

This time the 2015-2023\nSAP has been fainter and two years past its conclusion no new eruption has yet\ntaken place. During 2005-2025, a period covering SAP and the preceding\nquiescence, we collected a massive amount of photometric and spectroscopic\nobservations that we have analyzed together with Swift UVOT data. Guided by the\nresults of the orbital solution and in particular by the radiative modeling to\nwhich we subjected the whole set of available data, we found for T CrB a binary\nperiod of 227.5528 days, an inclination of 61 deg, and masses of 1.35 Msun and\n0.93 Msun for the white dwarf and the M3III companion, respectively, making\nmass transfer dynamically stable. The red giant fills completely its Roche\nlobe, and at Vrot sin(i)=4.75 +-0.26 km/s it is rotating much slower that the\n16 km/s co-rotation value. The ~20 deg azimuth of the hot spot, implied by the\nhump shaping the optical light curve in quiescence, fixes the outer radius of\nthe disk to 58 Rsun, the same as the canonical value expected from disk theory.\nIn quiescence the disk is cold and mostly neutral. SAP has been caused by an\ninside-out collapse of the disk, during which the mean accretion rate onto the\nWD has been ~28x larger than in quiescence. SAP ended in April 2023, but from\nMay 2024 mass-flow has intensively resumed at disk inner radii while the\ncollapse wave reached the outer portions of the disk; the consequent revamp in\nmass accretion could fill the gap inherited by the fainter 2015-2023 SAP and\neventually lead the WD accreted shell to ignition.",

To assess appropriateness for\nreal-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and\nTop-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter\ncount, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge\ndeployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and\nadjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed,\nwhile keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80%\nTop-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling\nbalance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results\ngive practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning\nmodels appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines.

    "abstract": "Quantum error mitigation is a crucial technique for suppressing errors\nespecially in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, enabling more reliable\nquantum computation without the overhead of full error correction. Zero-Noise\nExtrapolation (ZNE), which we mainly consider in this work, is one of prominent\nquantum error mitigation methods. For algorithms with deep circuits - such as\niterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's\neffectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise. Extrapolation based\non such low-fidelity data often yields inaccurate estimates and requires\nsubstantial overhead. In this study, we propose a lightweight,\nextrapolation-based error mitigation framework tailored for structured quantum\nalgorithms composed of repeating operational blocks. The proposed method\ncharacterizes the error of the repeated core operational block, rather than the\nfull algorithm, using shallow circuits. Extrapolation is used to estimate the\nblock fidelity, followed by a reconstruction of the mitigated success\nprobability. We validate our method via simulations of the 6-qubit Grover's\nalgorithm on IBM's Aer simulator, then further evaluating it on the real\n127-qubit IBM Quantum system based on Eagle r3 under a physical noise\nenvironment. Our results, particularly those from Aer simulator, demonstrate\nthat the core block's error follows a highly consistent exponential decay. This\nallows our technique to achieve robust error mitigation, overcoming the\nlimitations of conventional ZNE which is often compromised by statistically\nunreliable data from near-random behavior under heavy noise. In low-noise\nconditions, our method approaches theoretical success probability, outperforms\nZNE. In high-noise conditions, ZNE fails to mitigate errors due to overfitting\nof its extrapolation data, whereas our method achieves over a 20% higher\nsuccess probability.",

Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are\northogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this\ndistinction during training.

We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels\nin generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image\nregions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our\nfindings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of\ncontent-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style\nrequested.

    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement enables exponential computational states, while\nsuperposition provides inherent parallelism. Consequently, quantum circuits are\ntheoretically capable of supporting large scale parallel computation. However,\napplying them to financial analysis particularly in the areas of random number\ngeneration and payoff computation remains a significant challenge. Experts\ngenerally believe that quantum computing relies on matrix operations, which are\ndeterministic in nature without randomness. This inherent determinism makes it\nparticularly challenging to design quantum circuits that require random number\ninjection. JP Morgan[1] introduced the piecewise linear (PWL) approach for\nmodeling payoff computations but did not disclose a quantum circuit capable of\nidentifying values exceeding the strike price, suggesting a possible reliance\non classical pre processing for interval classification. This paper presents an\nintegrated quantum circuit with two key components: one for random number\ninjection, applicable to risk assessment, and the other for direct payoff\ncomputation, relevant to financial pricing. These components are compatible\nwith a scalable framework that leverages large scale parallelism and Quantum\nAmplitude Estimation (QAE) to achieve quadratic speedup. The circuit was\nimplemented on IBM Qiskit and evaluated using 8 parallel threads and 1600\nmeasurement shots. Results confirmed both the presence of randomness and the\ncorrectness of payoff computation. While the current implementation uses 8\nthreads, the design scales to 2 to the power of n threads, for arbitrarily\nlarge n, offering a potential path toward demonstrating quantum supremacy.",

To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a\nunified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and\ngenerative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an\ninstance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then\nconstruct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional\nrepresentations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points\nas reference priors.

However, much of the existing research in automated vehicles (AVs)\nhas focused on high-stakes \"trolley problems,\" which involve extreme and rare\nsituations. Such scenarios, though rich in ethical implications, are rarely\napplicable in real-world AV decision-making. In practice, when AVs confront\neveryday ethical dilemmas, they often appear to prioritise strict adherence to\ntraffic rules. By contrast, human drivers may bend the rules in\ncontext-specific situations, using judgement informed by practical concerns\nsuch as safety and efficiency. According to the concept of meaningful human\ncontrol, AVs should respond to human reasons, including those of drivers,\nvulnerable road users, and policymakers. This work introduces a novel human\nreasons-based supervision framework that detects when AV behaviour misaligns\nwith expected human reasons to trigger trajectory reconsideration. The\nframework integrates with motion planning and control systems to support\nreal-time adaptation, enabling decisions that better reflect safety,\nefficiency, and regulatory considerations. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthis approach could help AVs respond more effectively to ethical challenges in\ndynamic driving environments by prompting replanning when the current\ntrajectory fails to align with human reasons.

To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is\ncrucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an\nappropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important\nfor localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp\nsurfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we\nfirst construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact\nand robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms. We develop\na method that leverages a characterized whisker deflection profile to directly\nextract the tip contact position using gradient descent, with a Bayesian filter\napplied to reduce fluctuations. We then propose an active motion control policy\nto maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object\nsurface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature\nand determine the sensor orientation. Results demonstrate that our algorithm\ncan effectively track objects and reconstruct contours with sub-millimeter\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "The applied research is the design and development of an automated folding\nand sewing machine for pleated pants. It represents a significant advancement\nin addressing the challenges associated with manual sewing processes.\nTraditional methods for creating pleats are labour-intensive, prone to\ninconsistencies, and require high levels of skill, making automation a critical\nneed in the apparel industry. This research explores the technical feasibility\nand operational benefits of integrating advanced technologies into garment\nproduction, focusing on the creation of an automated machine capable of precise\nfolding and sewing operations and eliminating the marking operation.\n  The proposed machine incorporates key features such as a precision folding\nmechanism integrated into the automated sewing unit with real-time monitoring\ncapabilities. The results demonstrate remarkable improvements: the standard\nlabour time has been reduced by 93%, dropping from 117 seconds per piece to\njust 8 seconds with the automated system. Similarly, machinery time improved by\n73%, and the total output rate increased by 72%. These enhancements translate\ninto a cycle time reduction from 117 seconds per piece to an impressive 33\nseconds, enabling manufacturers to meet customer demand more swiftly. By\neliminating manual marking processes, the machine not only reduces labour costs\nbut also minimizes waste through consistent pleat formation. This automation\naligns with industry trends toward sustainability and efficiency, potentially\nreducing environmental impact by decreasing material waste and energy\nconsumption.",

In this letter, we report a systematical study on the\nphotoluminescence (PL) from the high energy excitons in few-layer CrSBr and its\napplication on detecting the spin configurations. Besides the broad excitonic\nemission peak (Xl) at around 1.34 eV, we also observed another strong excitonic\nemission peak (Xh) at around 1.37 eV in hBN encapsulated 2L sample, which\nsplits into two peaks in 3L and 4L samples. With help of the first principles\ncalculations, we conclude that the Xh peak is associated with the transition\nbetween the top valence band and the second lowest conduction band, which is\nforbidden by the inversion symmetry in 1L CrSBr. Furthermore, the position and\nintensity of the Xh peak are strongly dependent on the interlayer magnetic\norder of the CrSBr samples, which provides an efficient way to probe their spin\nconfigurations. In addition, when the magnetic field is applied at the easy\naxis direction, we resolve an intermediate magnetic state besides the\nantiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states in 3L and 4L samples.

In this work, we\ninvestigate single titanium (Ti) atoms adsorbed on MgO/Ag(100) surfaces using a\ncombined scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. Our\nmeasurements reveal two distinct spin states, $S = 1/2$ and $S = 1$, depending\non the local adsorption site and the thickness of the MgO film. Density\nfunctional theory calculations suggest a Ti$^+$ configuration for the Ti\nadsorbates with approximately 3 electrons in the 4$s$ and 3$d$ valence shells.\nUsing a multi-orbital atomic multiplet calculations the site dependence of the\nspin can be rationalized as a charge redistribution between spin-polarizing and\ndepolarizing orbitals.

Elevating the stress during the life test\nincurs an additional cost that increases the cost of the life test. In this\ncontext, an adaptive scenario is also considered in that sampling plan.

Existing\nbenchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or\nsimple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better\nevaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm\nconsists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling\nfirewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service\nattacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and\nrule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these\ntasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We\nevaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude\nSonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.\nSurprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these\nfrontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate\n(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these\nmodels are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in\nchatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading\nagentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it\nalso amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from\nalignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to\nmonitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is\nsignificantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,\nwith average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical\nsummarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at\nhttps://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.",

Existing studies on the\nqueueing delay performance of the Aloha model universally treat packets as\natomic transmission units, focusing primarily on delay measured in time slots.\nHowever, the impact of packetization on queueing delay has been consistently\noverlooked, particularly for the mean queueing delay measured in seconds, which\nserves as a more precise and practically relevant performance metric than its\nslot-based counterpart. Here, packetization refers to the process of\ndetermining the number of bits assembled into a packet. To optimize queueing\ndelay from the perspective of packetization, this paper establishes the\nmathematical relationship between packetization and mean queueing delay in\nseconds for both connection-free and connection-based Aloha schemes, and\nexplores the optimal packetization strategy to minimize this delay. We identify\nthe optimal mean queueing delay and its corresponding packet size via numerical\nmethods, and further analyze the influence of various network parameters. We\nfurther use simulations to investigate the similar impact of packetization on\njitter of queueing delay. We then apply our analysis to re-evaluate the complex\ntrade-off between the connection-free and connection-based schemes through the\nnew perspective of packetization.

In contrast to scenario-based approaches that rely on independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) trajectories, this work develops a data-driven\nframework where each trajectory is gathered over a finite horizon and exhibits\ntemporal dependence-referred to as a non-i.i.d. trajectory. To ensure safety of\ndynamical systems using such trajectories, the current body of literature\nprimarily considers dynamics subject to unknown-but-bounded disturbances, which\nfacilitates robust analysis. While promising, such bounds may be violated in\npractice and the resulting worst-case robust analysis tends to be overly\nconservative. To overcome these fundamental challenges, this paper considers\nstochastic systems with unknown mathematical dynamics, influenced by process\nnoise with unknown distributions. In the proposed framework, data is collected\nfrom stochastic systems under multiple realizations within a finite-horizon\nexperiment, where each realization generates a non-i.i.d. trajectory.\nLeveraging the concept of stochastic control barrier certificates constructed\nfrom data, this work quantifies probabilistic safety guarantees with a\ncertified confidence level. To achieve this, the proposed conditions are\nformulated as sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization problems, relying solely on\nempirical average of the collected trajectories and statistical features of the\nprocess noise. The efficacy of the approach has been validated on three\nstochastic benchmarks with both unknown models and noise distributions. In one\ncase study, it is shown that while no safety controller exists for the robust\nanalysis of the system under bounded disturbances, the proposed stochastic\nframework offers a safety controller with guaranteed probabilistic\nsatisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Inferences from observations clearly show that mixing in stars extends beyond\nthe convective boundaries defined by mixing length theory. This triggered the\nproposal of a variety of prescriptions to include additional mixing in stellar\nmodels. These prescriptions typically introduce free parameters to set the\nextent of the additional mixing and may also introduce numerical parameters. In\nthe case of exponential overshooting, one must decide the threshold at which\nthe exponential decay of the mixing coefficient can be treated as zero. Using\nthe MESA stellar evolution code, I explore the effect of varying this parameter\non asteroseismic models of main-sequence stars with growing convective cores.\nFrom this, I conclude that overshoot_D_min should be set to $10^{-2}$ cm$^2$/s\nor lower for these stars. The default value in MESA is four orders of magnitude\nhigher than this recommendation, which results in discontinuous evolution.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents strategies for enhancing the robustness of bidirectional\nquantum teleportation (BQT) through environment-assisted and weak measurement\ntechniques. BQT is a crucial component of distributed quantum networks,\nallowing for the bilateral transfer of quantum information between two nodes.\nWhile perfect teleportation necessitates maximally entangled states, these are\nvulnerable to degradation due to inherent decoherence. We propose a BQT scheme\nthat enables the bilateral transfer of arbitrary qubits between nodes via\namplitude damping channels (ADC), aiming to optimize fidelity using weak\nmeasurements in the final step of the process. Environment-assisted\nmeasurements (EAM) are used to establish a four-qubit channel composed of two\nBell states. We explore two situations: (I) where only the recovery qubits pass\nthrough amplitude damping channels and (II) where the entire four-qubit channel\nis subjected to ADC. Our findings demonstrate a balance between average\nfidelity and success probability when the weak measurement strength ($q_w$) is\nconstrained by the decay rate ($p$), specifically $q_w \\in {[0,p]}$. Perfect\nBQT is achieved when $q_w = p$, indicating complete suppression of ADC effects.\nOn the other hand, a decline in both average fidelity and success probability\nis noted when the weak measurement strength surpasses the ADC strength, marking\nthe prohibited domain as $q_w \\in {(p,1]}$. Additionally, our secured BQT\nprotocol consistently outperforms the unprotected scheme in both scenarios,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of the proposed protection strategies.",

While AI-powered tools hold promise for\naccelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products\nremains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,\nproprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate\nwhether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,\nminimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box\nannotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D\nvolume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,\nbottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large\ncohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most\nconsistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not\ntrained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation\nperformance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation\nperformance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure\nmodes.

(c) We propose to fine-tune the demonstration retriever to\nfully exploit the power of in-context learning (ICL). Extensive experiments on\nquestion answering, mathematical reasoning, and coding tasks demonstrate that\nDynaSwarm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-agent and MAS\nbaselines across multiple LLM backbones. Our findings highlight the importance\nof sample-aware structural flexibility in LLM MAS designs.",

While both\ninterlayer coupling and the presence of clean IPs have been proposed as key\nfactors enhancing superconductivity, their individual roles have been difficult\nto disentangle, as IPs and OPs typically become superconducting simultaneously.\nHere we investigate five-layer (Cu,C)Ba2Ca4Cu5Oy (Cu1245) with Tc = 78 K and\nthree-layer Ba2Ca2Cu3O6(F,O)2 (F0223) with Tc = 100 K using ARPES, and uncover\nan unprecedented situation, in which only the IPs become superconducting while\nthe OPs remain metallic at low temperatures. Model calculations indicate that\nmore than 95% of the OP wavefunction remains confined to OP itself, with\nminimal hybridization from the superconducting IPs. In particular, we\nexperimentally realize an ideal configuration: a single superconducting CuO2\nlayer sandwiched between heavily overdoped metallic outer layers, which screen\ndisorder originating from the dopant layers. Strikingly, this clean CuO2 layer\nexhibits the largest superconducting gap among all known cuprates and coherent\nBogoliubov peaks extending beyond the antiferromagnetic zone boundary -- long\nregarded as the boundary beyond which coherence vanishes in heavily underdoped\ncuprates. Furthermore, a widely extended coherent flat band emerges at the\nBrillouin zone edge, overcoming the pseudogap damping effect. Our results\nintroduce a new physical parameter, the degree of screening, to investigate the\ncompetition between superconductivity and the pseudogap, potentially shedding\nnew light on its origin. The nearly disorder-free superconducting CuO2 layers\noffer a model platform for bridging the gap between disordered real materials\nand idealized theoretical models, which generally neglect disorder effects.",

    "abstract": "Due to growing privacy concerns, machine unlearning, which aims at enabling\nmachine learning models to ``forget\" specific training data, has received\nincreasing attention. Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has\nemerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of\nindividual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,\nthis approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the\nnecessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training\nsamples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and\nscenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the\ndifficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that\nmemorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link\nbetween memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This\nconnection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of\nincremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in\nunlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on\nmore efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned\ncognitive theory. Based on this connection, we introduce the Influence\nApproximation Unlearning (IAU) algorithm for efficient machine unlearning from\nthe incremental perspective. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nIAU achieves a superior balance among removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency,\nand comparable model utility, while outperforming state-of-the-art methods\nacross diverse datasets and model architectures.

While traditional\nnumerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise\naccuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,\nwhich is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we\npropose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation\nmetric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent\ntwo-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image\ntransformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly\nintegrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal\nLoss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series\nmodality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.\nSATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures\nstructural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a\nfrequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast\nFourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that\nmeasures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal\nfeatures with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal\nfeature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior\nperformance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline\nmethods, without additional computational cost during inference.",

We then evaluated 10 recent open source Large Language\nModels (LLMs) in 8 of the translated datasets and performed a comprehensive\nerror analysis to pinpoint their primary failure modes. Our findings reveal\nconsistent performance gaps for Bengali compared to English, particularly for\nsmaller models and specific model families like Mistral. We also identified\npromising robustness in certain architectures, such as DeepSeek, that maintain\nmore stable performance across languages. Our analysis reveals an inverse\nrelationship between tokenization efficiency and LLM accuracy where models tend\nto perform worse when inputs are excessively tokenized, whereas more efficient\n\\& concise tokenization results in improved performance. These findings\nhighlight critical areas where current models fall short and underscore the\nneed for improved dataset quality and evaluation methodologies tailored to\nmultilingual contexts. This work will catalyze further research on NLP for\nunderrepresented languages, helping to democratize access to advanced language\ntechnologies worldwide.

Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of\nreasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to\nenhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing\nmultimodal models predominantly rely on \"one-time\" diagnostic approaches,\nlacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to\nchallenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse\nrewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose\nCX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\"\nreasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and\nverifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an\ninstruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148\nsamples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points\nsupervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under\nthe Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic\nreasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain\ndiagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the\nneed for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain\nMLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,\nachieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable\nCXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves\na mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best\nresults, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical\nutility across multiple dimensions.",

However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed\nCN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN\npair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present\nwhat we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion\ntractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The\nCN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by\nmulti-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable\nclustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for\nmultiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50\nsubjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual\nexperiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence\nwith expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP\ndataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of\npituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8\nfiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,\noculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear\nnerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work\ncontributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient\nand automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing\nthe analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through\nvisualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.",

Its precise nature, particularly its degree of\ncollectivity, remains a topic of debate. In this study, we investigate\nlow-energy dipole excitations in spherical Mo isotopes ($^{82}$Mo to $^{98}$Mo)\nusing a fully consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) and quasiparticle random\nphase approximation (QRPA) framework. We observe that an enhancement in dipole\nstrength near particle emission energies is closely correlated with the\ndevelopment of either neutron or proton skins. To further understand the nature\nof this enhancement, we examine the behavior of proton and neutron transition\ndensities. Our analysis shows that these (low-lying dipole) states exhibit\ndistinct characteristics involving in-phase oscillations within the nucleus and\nneutron- or proton-dominated oscillations at the surface, while the primary\ncontributor to this enhancement displays an intricate underlying structure. We\nalso investigate the collectivity of these excitations by analyzing\ntwo-quasiparticle fragmentations and relative energy shifts. Our findings\nreveal that skin oscillation states exhibit moderate collectivity, as indicated\nby substantial configuration mixing, but limited coherence, whereas the GDR\nstates exhibit strong coherence and large energy shifts characteristic of fully\ndeveloped collective motion. This study paves the way for future investigations\ninto the collective nature of low-energy dipole states in the enhancement\nregion, particularly in deformed nuclei, where nuclear shape effects may play a\ncrucial role in their excitation dynamics.",

However,\nthese studies often assume that the source of unlabeled data is only confined\nto novel classes of the current session, which presents a narrow perspective\nand cannot align well with practical scenarios. To better reflect real-world\nscenarios, we redefine Semi-FSCIL as Generalized Semi-FSCIL (GSemi-FSCIL) by\nincorporating both base and all the ever-seen novel classes in the unlabeled\nset. This change in the composition of unlabeled samples poses a new challenge\nfor existing methods, as they struggle to distinguish between unlabeled samples\nfrom base and novel classes. To address this issue, we propose an\nAmbiguity-guided Learnable Distribution Calibration (ALDC) strategy.

This paper proposes an\nenvironmentaware cross-BS CKM inference method called BS-1-to-N based on the\ngenerative diffusion model. To this end, we first design the BS location\nembedding (BSLE) method tailored for cross-BS CKM inference to embed BS\nlocation information in the feature vector of CKM. Further, we utilize the\ncross- and self-attention mechanism for the proposed BS-1-to-N model to\nrespectively learn the relationships between source and target BSs, as well as\nthat among target BSs. Therefore, given the locations of the source and target\nBSs, together with the source CKMs as control conditions, cross-BS CKM\ninference can be performed for an arbitrary number of source and target BSs.\nSpecifically, in architectures with massive distributed nodes like cell-free\nnetworks, traditional methods of sequentially traversing each BS for CKM\nconstruction are prohibitively costly. By contrast, the proposed BS-1-to-N\nmodel is able to achieve efficient CKM inference for a target BS at any\npotential location based on the CKMs of source BSs. This is achieved by\nexploiting the fact that within a given area, different BSs share the same\nwireless environment that leads to their respective CKMs. Therefore, similar to\nmulti-view synthesis, CKMs of different BSs are representations of the same\nwireless environment from different BS locations. By mining the implicit\ncorrelation between CKM and BS location based on the wireless environment, the\nproposed BS-1-to-N method achieves efficient CKM inference across BSs. We\nprovide extensive comparisons of CKM inference between the proposed BS-1-to-N\ngenerative model versus benchmarking schemes, and provide one use case study to\ndemonstrate its practical application for the optimization of BS deployment.",

Both lifts arise as line graphs of bipartite double\ncovers and are box-perfect.\n  The symmetric lift $\\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$ forms a canonical 2-cover of the line\ngraph $L(G)$. This involution decomposes $\\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$ into symmetric and\nantisymmetric components: the symmetric part recovers $L(G)$, while the\nantisymmetric part yields a signed graph $L^-(G)$, the antisymmetric line\ngraph, with +1/-1 edges encoding consistent vs. crossed overlaps. Thus, all\nadjacency and Laplacian eigenvalues of $L(G)$, with multiplicities, appear\nwithin those of $\\mathrm{HL}'_2(G)$, despite $L(G)$ typically not being a\nsubgraph.\n  For regular graphs such as Paley graphs, this yields infinite families of\nsparse, highly structured regular and box-perfect expanders that also retain\nlarge cliques. The lift retains much of the spectral expansion of the base\nwhile improving the combinatorial expansion. Much the same behavior is observed\nwith random regular base graphs, allowing for the possibility of the study of\nbox-perfect random regular graphs.\n  Finally, we generalize these constructions to parameterized lifts\n$\\mathrm{HL}_{r,d}(G)$ and $\\mathrm{HL}_{r,d}'(G)$ defined on ordered\n$r$-tuples connected by Hamming distance constraints, which structurally encode\nthe base graph and remain box-perfect.",

XRBs play a\ncrucial role in galaxy evolution, reflecting the stellar populations of\ngalaxies and regulating star formation through feedback, thereby shaping galaxy\nstructure. In this study, we report a spectroscopically confirmed X-ray\nemitting galaxy pair (UDF3 and UDF3-2) at $z = 2.544$. By combining\nmulti-wavelength observations from JWST/NIRSpec MSA spectra, JWST/NIRCam and\nMIRI imaging, Chandra, HST, VLT, ALMA, and VLA, we analyze the ionized emission\nlines, which are primarily driven by H II region-like processes. Additionally,\nwe find that the mid-infrared radiation can be fully attributed to dust\nemission from galaxy themselves. Our results indicate that the X-ray emission\nfrom these two galaxies is dominated by high-mass XRBs, with luminosities of\n$L_X= (1.43\\pm0.40) \\times 10^{42} \\, \\text{erg} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3,\nand $(0.40\\pm0.12) \\times 10^{42} \\, \\text{erg} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$ for UDF3-2.\nFurthermore, we measure the star formation rate (SFR) of $529_{-88}^{+64}$\n$M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for UDF3, placing it $\\approx$ 0.5 dex below the\n$L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation. This offset reflects the redshift-dependent enhancement\nof $L_X$/SFR-$z$ relation, which is influenced by metallicity and serves as a\nkey observable for XRB evolution. In contrast, UDF3-2, with the SFR of\n$34_{-6}^{+6}$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, aligns well with the $L_X$/SFR-$z$\nrelation.

Validation in a\nsimulated 5D MRXCAT phantom demonstrated EMORe's superior performance compared\nto standard compressed sensing reconstruction, showing significant improvements\nin peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, edge sharpness, and\nbin assignment accuracy across varying levels of simulated bulk motion. In vivo\nvalidation in 13 volunteers further confirmed EMORe's robustness, significantly\nenhancing blood-myocardium edge sharpness and reducing motion artifacts\ncompared to compressed sensing, particularly in scenarios with controlled\ncoughing-induced motion. Although EMORe incurs a modest increase in\ncomputational complexity, its adaptability and robust handling of bulk motion\nartifacts significantly enhance the clinical applicability and diagnostic\nconfidence of 5D cardiac MRI.",

However, sophisticated models are prone to\nover-fitting to the noise information in financial data, resulting in inferior\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose an information bottleneck asset\npricing model that compresses data with low signal-to-noise ratios to eliminate\nredundant information and retain the critical information for asset pricing.\nOur model imposes constraints of mutual information during the nonlinear\nmapping process. Specifically, we progressively reduce the mutual information\nbetween the input data and the compressed representation while increasing the\nmutual information between the compressed representation and the output\nprediction. The design ensures that irrelevant information, which is\nessentially the noise in the data, is forgotten during the modeling of\nfinancial nonlinear relationships without affecting the final asset pricing. By\nleveraging the constraints of the Information bottleneck, our model not only\nharnesses the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep networks to capture the\nintricate relationships within financial data but also ensures that noise\ninformation is filtered out during the information compression process.",

In this picture, echoes are produced when the line of sight\ncrosses the skin at glancing incidence, which naturally leads to the large\nelectron column density gradients required to get the observed delays even with\nelectron densities comparable to those inferred from optical line emission\nratios. We compare the properties of the predicted echoes with those of a\nrelatively isolated observed one identified during daily monitoring with CHIME.\nWe find that the delays of the simulated echoes follow closely the near\nquadratic evolution known to be a feature of these echoes, and that, unlike in\nprevious models, we match the characteristic observed asymmetry between\nincoming and outgoing arcs, with the size of the gap in between a consequence\nof the skin crossing time. However, our model fails to quantitatively reproduce\nthe magnifications of the echoes.

    "abstract": "Can a recommendation model be self-aware? This paper investigates the\nrecommender's self-awareness by quantifying its uncertainty, which provides a\nlabel-free estimation of its performance. Such self-assessment can enable more\ninformed understanding and decision-making before the recommender engages with\nany users. To this end, we propose an intuitive and effective method,\nprobability-based List Distribution uncertainty (LiDu). LiDu measures\nuncertainty by determining the probability that a recommender will generate a\ncertain ranking list based on the prediction distributions of individual items.\nWe validate LiDu's ability to represent model self-awareness in two settings:\n(1) with a matrix factorization model on a synthetic dataset, and (2) with\npopular recommendation algorithms on real-world datasets. Experimental results\nshow that LiDu is more correlated with recommendation performance than a series\nof label-free performance estimators. Additionally, LiDu provides valuable\ninsights into the dynamic inner states of models throughout training and\ninference. This work establishes an empirical connection between recommendation\nuncertainty and performance, framing it as a step towards more transparent and\nself-evaluating recommender systems.",

    "abstract": "Randomization has emerged as a powerful set of tools for large-scale matrix\nand tensor decompositions. Randomized algorithms involve computing sketches\nwith random matrices. A prevalent approach is to take the random matrix as a\nstandard Gaussian random matrix, for which the theory is well developed.\nHowever, this approach has the drawback that the cost of generating and\nmultiplying by the random matrix can be prohibitively expensive. Khatri-Rao\nrandom projections (KRPs), obtained by sketching with Khatri-Rao products of\nrandom matrices, offer a viable alternative and are much cheaper to generate.\nHowever, the theoretical guarantees of using KRPs are much more pessimistic\ncompared to their accuracy observed in practice. We attempt to close this gap\nby obtaining improved analysis of the use of KRPs in matrix and tensor low-rank\ndecompositions. We propose and analyze a new algorithm for low-rank\napproximations of block-structured matrices (e.g., block Hankel) using KRPs. We\nalso develop new algorithms to accelerate tensor computations in the Tucker\nformat using KRPs, and give theoretical guarantees of the resulting low-rank\napproximations.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a\ndiffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into\ngenerating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the\nclean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD\ninherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as\nin model robustness to some defenses.",

On two evaluation benchmarks, GEAK significantly\noutperformed the baselines of directly prompting frontier LLMs as well as\nReflexion-based generation pipelines by achieving correctness up to $63$% and\nexecution speed up of up to $2.59$X. These results highlight the promise of\nGEAK-like agentic code generation for accelerating the adoption of diverse\nhardware platforms and democratizing access to expert-level kernel performance.",

By exploiting results from the\ndatabase setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data\ncomplexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are\nfirst-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes \"shP\"-hard when the\nontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\\exists R.\nA \\sqsubseteq A$).

We prove that\nintractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language\nsupports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive\nqueries, even in the absence of an ontology.

While existing data-driven methods have\ndemonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich\ndomain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further\nadvancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language\nmodels (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for\ndownstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains\nunderexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain\nknowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge\nGraph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to\nconstruct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent\ndiverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding\nnetwork to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the\nOKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and\nthe complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned\nknowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM\nto model SST patterns for accurate prediction.

    "abstract": "Networked urban systems facilitate the flow of people, resources, and\nservices, and are essential for economic and social interactions. These systems\noften involve complex processes with unknown governing rules, observed by\nsensor-based time series. To aid decision-making in industrial and engineering\ncontexts, data-driven predictive models are used to forecast spatiotemporal\ndynamics of urban systems. Current models such as graph neural networks have\nshown promise but face a trade-off between efficacy and efficiency due to\ncomputational demands. Hence, their applications in large-scale networks still\nrequire further efforts. This paper addresses this trade-off challenge by\ndrawing inspiration from physical laws to inform essential model designs that\nalign with fundamental principles and avoid architectural redundancy. By\nunderstanding both micro- and macro-processes, we present a principled\ninterpretable neural diffusion scheme based on Transformer-like structures\nwhose attention layers are induced by low-dimensional embeddings. The proposed\nscalable spatiotemporal Transformer (ScaleSTF), with linear complexity, is\nvalidated on large-scale urban systems including traffic flow, solar power, and\nsmart meters, showing state-of-the-art performance and remarkable scalability.\nOur results constitute a fresh perspective on the dynamics prediction in\nlarge-scale urban networks.",

The UCI is a class of prefix codes, such that the ratio of the\naverage codeword length to $\\max\\{1, H(P)\\}$ is within a constant expansion\nfactor $K_{\\mathcal{C}}$ for any decreasing probability distribution $P$, where\n$H(P)$ is the entropy of $P$. For any UCI code $\\mathcal{C}$, define \\emph{the\nminimum expansion factor} $K_{\\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ to represent the infimum of the\nset of extension factors of $\\mathcal{C}$. Each $\\mathcal{C}$ has a unique\ncorresponding $K_{\\mathcal{C}}^{*}$, and the smaller $K_{\\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ is,\nthe better the compression performance of $\\mathcal{C}$ is.

As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they\noften require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in\nspecialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce\ntraining costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT\ntechniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT\nmethods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized\napplications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify\nuncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically\nadapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We\npropose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel\nmethod that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines\nAdapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers\nof the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT\nenables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic\nfine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next\nround, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on\nbusiness tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense\nreasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,\nenables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves\nadaptability in dynamic scenarios.

The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the\nmanagement of a centralized platform is an essential requirement.

Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code\ngeneration.

To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a\nmulti-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT\ndevice testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires\nonly binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We\nevaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT\nplatforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average\nsuccess rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any\nhuman involvement.

We study this\nphenomenon in the platform's largest segment, Continuous Integration (CI), by\nlinking 6,983 CI Actions to 3,869 providers and mining their version histories.\nOur graph model timestamps every functionality's debut, tracks its adoption,\nand clusters redundant tools. We find that approximately 65% of new CI Actions\nreplicate existing capabilities, typically within six months, and that a small\nset of first-mover Actions accounts for most subsequent forks and extensions.\nThese insights enable developers to choose the optimal moment to launch, target\nunmet functionality, and help maintainers eliminate redundant tools. We publish\nthe complete graph and dataset to encourage longitudinal research on innovation\nand competition in software ecosystems, and to provide practitioners with a\ndata-driven roadmap for identifying emerging trends and guiding product\nstrategy.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious tasks, with different models excelling in distinct domains and specific\nabilities. Effectively combining the predictions of multiple LLMs is crucial\nfor enhancing system robustness and performance. However, existing ensemble\nmethods often rely on simple techniques like voting or logits ensembling, which\noverlook the varying confidence and reliability of models in different\ncontexts. In this work, we propose LENS (Learning ENsemble confidence from\nNeural States), a novel approach that learns to estimate model confidence by\nanalyzing internal representations. For each LLM, we train a lightweight linear\nconfidence predictor that leverages layer-wise hidden states and normalized\nprobabilities as inputs. This allows for more nuanced weighting of model\npredictions based on their context-dependent reliability. Our method does not\nrequire modifying the model parameters and requires negligible additional\ncomputation. Experimental results on multiple-choice and boolean\nquestion-answering tasks demonstrate that LENS outperforms traditional ensemble\nmethods by a substantial margin. Our findings suggest that internal\nrepresentations provide valuable signals for determining model confidence and\ncan be effectively leveraged for ensemble learning.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoresistance typically exhibits even symmetry with respect to the\nmagnetic field, owing to time reversal symmetry (TRS) as dictated by Onsager\nreciprocity relations. However, in certain systems where TRS is broken,\nmagnetoresistance may acquire an odd component with respect to the magnetic\nfield, referred to as odd parity magnetoresistance (OMR). To date, reported OMR\nvalues have been modest, usually restricted to a few tens of percent even under\nhigh magnetic fields. Here, we report the discovery of a giant OMR reaching up\nto 1,150% under a relatively low field of 1 T in a heterostructure composed of\n3 nm thick alpha Sn and a ferromagnetic semiconductor, (In,Fe)Sb. Although\nalpha Sn in this thickness range is a trivial narrow gap semiconductor,\nanalysis of Shubnikov de Haas oscillations combined with ab initio calculations\nreveals the emergence of tilted topological surface states, induced via\nmagnetic proximity from the (In,Fe)Sb layer. The observed OMR behavior is well\nexplained by a Boltzmann transport model assuming the presence of oppositely\ntilted Weyl cones in the alpha Sn band structure. Our findings not only shed\nnew light on the physics of OMR but also suggest promising avenues for its\napplication in electronic and spintronic devices, such as ultrasensitive\nmagnetic sensors.",

    "abstract": "Since the late 2010s, quantum computers have become commercially available,\nand the number of services that users can run remotely via cloud servers is\nincreasing. In Japan, several domestic superconducting quantum computing\nsystems, including our own, began operation in 2023. However, the design of\nquantum computing systems, especially in the most critical areas near quantum\ncomputers, remains largely undisclosed, creating a significant barrier to entry\ninto the quantum computing field. If this situation continues, progress toward\nstandardization, which is essential for guiding quantum computer development,\nwill stall, and it will be difficult to develop a practical quantum computing\nsystem that can perform calculations on a supercomputer scale. To address this\nissue, we propose Open Quantum Toolchain for OPerators and USers (OQTOPUS), a\nfull-stack quantum computing system developed from research with real quantum\ncomputers. OQTOPUS is one of the world's largest open-source software projects,\ncovering operational software from cloud-based execution environment\nconstruction to system operation. Furthermore, to perform quantum computing\neffectively and efficiently, it implements key features, such as transpilers,\nmultiprogramming, and error mitigation, in an area as close as possible to a\nquantum computer, an area that system vendors rarely disclose. Finally, this\nstudy presents experimental results of applying OQTOPUS to a real quantum\ncomputer. OQTOPUS is publicly available on GitHub and will notably lower the\nbarrier to entry into the quantum computing field, contributing to the\nformation of a quantum computing developer community through open discussion.",

We study two embeddings problems for the universal cover $M$ of an\n$n$-dimensional Riemannian torus $(\\TT^n,g)$. The first concerns the existence\nof an isometric embedding of $M$ into a bounded subset of some Euclidean space\n$\\RR^{D_1}$, and the second one seeks an isometric embdding of $M$ that is\nequivariant with respect to the deck transformation group of covering map. By\nusing a known trick in a novel way, our idea yields results with $D_1 = N+2n$\nand $D_2 = N+n$, where $N$ is the Nash dimension of $\\TT^n$. However, we doubt\nwhether these bounds are optimal.",
