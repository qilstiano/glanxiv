    "abstract": "Most existing social robot navigation techniques either leverage hand-crafted\nrules or human demonstrations to connect robot perception to socially compliant\nactions. However, there remains a significant gap in effectively translating\nperception into socially compliant actions, much like how human reasoning\nnaturally occurs in dynamic environments. Considering the recent success of\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose using language to bridge the gap in\nhuman-like reasoning between perception and socially aware robot actions. We\ncreate a vision-language dataset, Social robot Navigation via Explainable\nInteractions (SNEI), featuring 40K human-annotated Visual Question Answers\n(VQAs) based on 2K human-robot social interactions in unstructured, crowded\npublic spaces, spanning perception, prediction, chain-of-thought reasoning,\naction, and explanation. We fine-tune a VLM, Social-LLaVA, using SNEI to\ndemonstrate the practical application of our dataset. Social-LLaVA outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Gemini, based on the average of fifteen\ndifferent human-judge scores across 50 VQA. Deployed onboard a mobile robot,\nSocial-LLaVA enables human-like reasoning, marking a promising step toward\nsocially compliant robot navigation in dynamic public spaces through language\nreasoning.",

    "abstract": "Interactions among sensors can provide, in addition to entanglement, an\nimportant resource for boosting the precision in quantum estimation protocols.\nDephasing noise, however, remains a leading source of decoherence in\nstate-of-the-art quantum sensing platforms. We analyze the impact of classical\n{\\em collective dephasing with arbitrary temporal correlations} on the\nperformance of generalized Ramsey interferometry protocols with\n\\emph{quadratic} encoding of a target frequency parameter. The optimal\nasymptotic precision bounds are derived for both product coherent spin states\nand for a class of experimentally relevant entangled spin-squeezed states of\n$N$ qubit sensors. While, as in linear metrology, entanglement offers no\nadvantage if the noise is Markovian, a precision scaling of $N^{-1}$ is\nreachable with classical input states in the quadratic setting, which is\nimproved to $N^{-5/4}$ when temporal correlations are present and the Zeno\nregime is accessible. The use of nonclassical spin-squeezed states and a\nnonlinear readout further allows for an $N^{-3/2}$ precision scaling, which we\nprove is asymptotically optimal. We also show how to counter {\\em noise-induced\nbias} by introducing a simple ratio estimator which relies on detecting two\nsuitable system observables, and show that it remains asymptotically unbiased\nin the presence of dephasing, without detriment to the achievable precision.",

Deep learning\napproaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory\ndatasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex\nspatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction\nthat leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on\nhexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by\nintegrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths\nwhile maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of\nTrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and\nmeaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant\nperformance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world\ntrajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons\n(i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and\nperformed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components.\nFurthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps\nby hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a\nspecified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing,\napplying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban\ncenters) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g.,\nrural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational\noverhead.

The typical formation of the Sn$V$ involves placing Sn in\ndiamond by ion implantation, but the formation of a charged Sn$V$ species\nrequires an additional complication. This complication is related to the energy\ncost associated with electronic transitions within the host diamond.\nEffectively, producing the Sn$V^-$ charge state using an electron obtained from\na band edge of the host diamond is less energetically favorable than having the\nSn$V^-$ receive an electron from a neighboring donor dopant. Among donor\ndopants, substitutional N (N$_\\text{C}$) is always present in even the purest\nsynthetic or natural diamond sample. The mechanism of electron donation by\nN$_\\text{C}$ has been proposed by Collins for charging the N$V$ in diamond and\nit has been used to interpret many experimental results. Therefore, in this\npaper we use DFT to explore the pathways for the formation of the Sn$V^-$\ncharge state due to electron donation arising from the presence of N$_\\text{C}$\nin the host diamond. Explicitly, defect concentrations are calculated in\nequilibrium in each of the explored pathways to determine the yield of the\nSn$V^-$ throughout each of the pathways.

    "abstract": "Timestamps play a pivotal role in digital forensic event reconstruction, but\ndue to their non-essential nature, tampering or manipulation of timestamps is\npossible by users in multiple ways, even on running systems. This has a\nsignificant effect on the reliability of the results from applying a timeline\nanalysis as part of an investigation. In this paper, we investigate the problem\nof users tampering with timestamps on a running (``live'') system. While prior\nwork has shown that digital evidence tampering is hard, we focus on the\nquestion of \\emph{why} this is so. By performing a qualitative user study with\nadvanced university students, we observe, for example, a commonly applied\nmulti-step approach in order to deal with second-order traces (traces of\ntraces). We also derive factors that influence the reliability of successful\ntampering, such as the individual knowledge about temporal traces, and\ntechnical restrictions to change them. These insights help to assess the\nreliability of timestamps from individual artifacts that are relied on for\nevent reconstruction and subsequently reduce the risk of incorrect event\nreconstruction during investigations.",

Our main\nresult is that, given a tailored non-local game $G$, it is undecidable to\ndistinguish between the case where $G$ has a special kind of perfect strategy,\nand the case where every strategy for $G$ is far from being perfect. Using a\nreduction introduced in the companion paper [BCLV24], this undecidability\nresult implies a negative answer to the Aldous--Lyons conjecture.

Our main technical contribution is to adapt this technique\nto the class of tailored non-local games.

The best way to achieve this desiderate is by reducing\ntheir training workload to match their constrained computational resources.\nWhile prior FL research has address the workload constrains by introducing\nlightweight models on the edge, limited attention has been given to optimizing\non-device training efficiency through reducing the amount of data need during\ntraining. In this work, we propose FedFT-EDS, a novel approach that combines\nFine-Tuning of partial client models with Entropy-based Data Selection to\nreduce training workloads on edge devices. By actively selecting the most\ninformative local instances for learning, FedFT-EDS reduces training data\nsignificantly in FL and demonstrates that not all user data is equally\nbeneficial for FL on all rounds. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show\nthat FedFT-EDS uses only 50% user data while improving the global model\nperformance compared to baseline methods, FedAvg and FedProx. Importantly,\nFedFT-EDS improves client learning efficiency by up to 3 times, using one third\nof training time on clients to achieve an equivalent performance to the\nbaselines.

We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by applying it to\nthe question of spontaneous cooperation in social dilemmas, specifically the\nPrisoner's Dilemma as the simplest case study. We identify conditions under\nwhich the learning behaviour appears as long-term stable cooperation from an\nexternal perspective. However, our model shows that this behaviour is merely a\nmetastable transient phase and not a true equilibrium, making it exploitable.\nWe further exemplify how specific parameter settings can significantly\nexacerbate the moving target problem in independent learning. Through a\nsystematic analysis of our model, we show that increasing the discount factor\ninduces oscillations, preventing convergence to a joint policy. These\noscillations arise from a supercritical Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, which\ntransforms the unique stable fixed point into an unstable focus surrounded by a\nstable limit cycle.",

This work focuses on short-term forecasting of\nDMA consumption using deep learning and aims to address two key challenging\nissues. First, forecasting based solely on a DMA's historical data may lack\nbroader context and provide limited insights. Second, DMAs may experience\nsensor malfunctions providing incorrect data, or some DMAs may not be monitored\nat all due to computational costs, complicating accurate forecasting. We\npropose a novel method that first identifies DMAs with correlated consumption\npatterns and then uses these patterns, along with the DMA's local data, as\ninput to a deep learning model for forecasting. In a real-world study with data\nfrom five DMAs, we show that: i) the deep learning model outperforms a\nclassical statistical model; ii) accurate forecasting can be carried out using\nonly correlated DMAs' consumption patterns; and iii) even when a DMA's local\ndata is available, including correlated DMAs' data improves accuracy.",

For sufficient reasons to be\nuseful in practice, they should be as small as possible, and a natural way to\nreduce the size of sufficient reasons is to consider a probabilistic\nrelaxation; the probability of $M(\\vec{x}) = M(\\vec{z})$ must be at least some\nvalue $\\delta \\in (0,1]$, for a random instance $\\vec{z}$ that coincides with\n$\\vec{x}$ on the features in $S$.

However, this result took Rokicki et al. around 35 CPU years to prove\nand is therefore very challenging to reproduce.\n  We provide a novel approach to obtain a worse bound of 36 moves with high\nconfidence, but that offers two main advantages: (i) it is easy to understand,\nreproduce, and verify, and (ii) our main idea generalizes to bounding the\ndiameter of other vertex-transitive graphs by at most twice its true value,\nhence the name \"demigod number\".\n  Our approach is based on the fact that, for vertex-transitive graphs, the\naverage distance between vertices is at most half the diameter, and by sampling\nuniformly random states and using a modern solver to obtain upper bounds on\ntheir distance, a standard concentration bound allows us to confidently state\nthat the average distance is around $18.32 \\pm 0.1$, from where the diameter is\nat most $36$.",

Specifically, a semi-implicit formulation of the thermal\nNavier-Stokes equations is used to accelerate the simulations while maintaining\naccuracy. The SBM enables precise enforcement of field and derivative boundary\nconditions on cut (intercepted) elements, allowing for accurate flux\ncalculations near complex geometries, when using non-boundary fitted meshes.\nBoth Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are implemented within the SBM\nframework, with results demonstrating that the SBM ensures precise enforcement\nof Neumann boundary conditions on Octree-based meshes. We illustrate this\napproach by simulating flows across different regimes, spanning several orders\nof magnitude in both the Rayleigh number ($Ra \\sim 10^3$--$10^9$) and the\nReynolds number ($Re \\sim 10^0$--$10^4$), and covering the laminar,\ntransitional, and turbulent flow regimes. Coupled thermal-flow phenomena and\ntheir statistics across all these regimes are accurately captured without any\nadditional numerical treatments, beyond a Residual-based Variational Multiscale\nformulation (RB-VMS). This approach offers a reliable and efficient solution\nfor complex geometries, boundary conditions and flow regimes in computational\nmultiphysics simulations.",

While traditional cameras use a large grid of square pixels, a\nminimalist camera uses freeform pixels that can take on arbitrary shapes to\nincrease their information content. We show that the hardware of a minimalist\ncamera can be modeled as the first layer of a neural network, where the\nsubsequent layers are used for inference. Training the network for any given\ntask yields the shapes of the camera's freeform pixels, each of which is\nimplemented using a photodetector and an optical mask. We have designed\nminimalist cameras for monitoring indoor spaces (with 8 pixels), measuring room\nlighting (with 8 pixels), and estimating traffic flow (with 8 pixels). The\nperformance demonstrated by these systems is on par with a traditional camera\nwith orders of magnitude more pixels. Minimalist vision has two major\nadvantages. First, it naturally tends to preserve the privacy of individuals in\nthe scene since the captured information is inadequate for extracting visual\ndetails. Second, since the number of measurements made by a minimalist camera\nis very small, we show that it can be fully self-powered, i.e., function\nwithout an external power supply or a battery.",

To this end, we developed\nGroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter\narchitecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Healthcare AI models often inherit biases from their training\ndata. While efforts have primarily targeted bias in structured data, mental\nhealth heavily depends on unstructured data. This study aims to detect and\nmitigate linguistic differences related to non-biological differences in the\ntraining data of AI models designed to assist in pediatric mental health\nscreening. Our objectives are: (1) to assess the presence of bias by evaluating\noutcome parity across sex subgroups, (2) to identify bias sources through\ntextual distribution analysis, and (3) to develop a de-biasing method for\nmental health text data. Methods: We examined classification parity across\ndemographic groups and assessed how gendered language influences model\npredictions. A data-centric de-biasing method was applied, focusing on\nneutralizing biased terms while retaining salient clinical information. This\nmethodology was tested on a model for automatic anxiety detection in pediatric\npatients. Results: Our findings revealed a systematic under-diagnosis of female\nadolescent patients, with a 4% lower accuracy and a 9% higher False Negative\nRate (FNR) compared to male patients, likely due to disparities in information\ndensity and linguistic differences in patient notes. Notes for male patients\nwere on average 500 words longer, and linguistic similarity metrics indicated\ndistinct word distributions between genders. Implementing our de-biasing\napproach reduced diagnostic bias by up to 27%, demonstrating its effectiveness\nin enhancing equity across demographic groups. Discussion: We developed a\ndata-centric de-biasing framework to address gender-based content disparities\nwithin clinical text. By neutralizing biased language and enhancing focus on\nclinically essential information, our approach demonstrates an effective\nstrategy for mitigating bias in AI healthcare models trained on text.",

    "abstract": "The elastic tensor provides valuable insight into the mechanical behavior of\na material with lattice strain, such as disordered binary alloys. Traditional\nstress-strain methods have made it possible to compute elastic constants for\nordered structures and individually tailored alloy compositions. However, this\napproach depends on predetermined or iteratively-chosen strain tensors. This\nposes a significant challenge for systematic, composition-dependent studies of\ndisordered materials with low symmetry. DFPT provides a compelling alternative\nto stress-strain methods: it allows for an unbiased determination of the\nelastic tensor, as well as access to local field data derived from the\nunderlying general response function framework. Despite its intrinsic\nflexibility and efficiency, DFPT has seen limited application to the study of\ndisordered systems. At the same time, there is a growing need for expanded\nquantum mechanical data to improve predictive modeling of complex disordered\nmaterial properties. Here we present results for the rigid-ion and relaxed-ion\nelastic tensors computed using DFPT, for a comprehensive set of structural\nrefractory BCC binary alloys of Mo, Nb, Ta, and W. We map the quantum-driven\nheterogeneity in elastic constants and shear modulus, and associated relaxation\nfields at each disordered structure lattice site, by computing the force\nresponse internal strain tensor and displacement response internal strain\ntensors. Derived properties -- the bulk modulus ($B$), shear modulus ($G$),\nYoung's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\\nu$), Pugh's ratio ($B/G$), Cauchy\npressure and elastic anisotropy -- are reported as a function of composition\nfor all refractory binaries. The DFPT-computed mechanical properties data for\nthe refractory binary alloys at systematically-varied Mo, Nb, Ta, and W\ncompositions are in excellent agreement with available experimental data.",

However, these tests can be costly in terms of time and resources,\npotentially exposing users, customers, or other test subjects (units) to\ninferior options. This paper explores practical considerations in applying\nmethodologies inspired by \"synthetic control\" as an alternative to traditional\nA/B testing in settings with very large numbers of units, involving up to\nhundreds of millions of units, which is common in modern applications such as\ne-commerce and ride-sharing platforms. This method is particularly valuable in\nsettings where the treatment affects only a subset of units, leaving many units\nunaffected. In these scenarios, synthetic control methods leverage data from\nunaffected units to estimate counterfactual outcomes for treated units. After\nthe treatment is implemented, these estimates can be compared to actual\noutcomes to measure the treatment effect. A key challenge in creating accurate\ncounterfactual outcomes is interpolation bias, a well-documented phenomenon\nthat occurs when control units differ significantly from treated units. To\naddress this, we propose a two-phase approach: first using nearest neighbor\nmatching based on unit covariates to select similar control units, then\napplying supervised learning methods suitable for high-dimensional data to\nestimate counterfactual outcomes. Testing using six large-scale experiments\ndemonstrates that this approach successfully improves estimate accuracy.\nHowever, our analysis reveals that machine learning bias -- which arises from\nmethods that trade off bias for variance reduction -- can impact results and\naffect conclusions about treatment effects. We document this bias in\nlarge-scale experimental settings and propose effective de-biasing techniques\nto address this challenge.",

Recently, diffusion models and autoregressive models have\ndemonstrated their outstanding expressivity and gradually replaced GAN as the\nfavored architectures for text-to-image synthesis. However, they still face\nsome obstacles: slow inference speed and expensive training costs. To achieve\nmore powerful and faster text-to-image synthesis under complex scenes, we\npropose TIGER, a text-to-image GAN with pretrained representations. To be\nspecific, we propose a vision-empowered discriminator and a high-capacity\ngenerator.

Unlike previous works, we explore\nstacking multiple pretrained models in our discriminator to collect multiple\ndifferent representations. (ii) The high-capacity generator aims to achieve\neffective text-image fusion while increasing the model capacity. The\nhigh-capacity generator consists of multiple novel high-capacity fusion blocks\n(HFBlock).

    "abstract": "We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state\nconstraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability\nof pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with\ncolor superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed\nnonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a\nrelativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition\nis obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the\ntwo-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the\nscalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: (1) the Maxwell\nconstruction can be performed, \\mbox{(2) the maximum} mass of the hybrid\nneutron star is not smaller than \\mbox{2.0 M$_\\odot$} and (3) the onset density\nof the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$\nfm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star\nequation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color\nsuperconducting quark matter core between 0.5-0.7 $M_\\odot$ and maximum masses\nin the range 2.15-2.22 $M_\\odot$. In the typical mass range of 1.2-2.0\n$M_\\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost\nindependent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger\nmaximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.",

    "abstract": "Speaker-attributed automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multi-speaker\nenvironments remains a significant challenge, particularly when systems\nconditioned on speaker embeddings fail to generalize to unseen speakers. In\nthis work, we propose Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW), a novel approach\nto target-speaker ASR that leverages speaker diarization outputs as\nconditioning information. DiCoW extends the pre-trained Whisper model by\nintegrating diarization labels directly, eliminating reliance on speaker\nembeddings and reducing the need for extensive speaker-specific training data.\nOur method introduces frame-level diarization-dependent transformations (FDDT)\nand query-key biasing (QKb) techniques to refine the model's focus on target\nspeakers while effectively handling overlapping speech. By leveraging\ndiarization outputs as conditioning signals, DiCoW simplifies the workflow for\nmulti-speaker ASR, improves generalization to unseen speakers and enables more\nreliable transcription in real-world multi-speaker recordings. Additionally, we\nexplore the integration of a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) head\nto Whisper and demonstrate its ability to improve transcription efficiency\nthrough hybrid decoding. Notably, we show that our approach is not limited to\nWhisper; it also provides similar benefits when applied to the Branchformer\nmodel. We validate DiCoW on real-world datasets, including AMI and NOTSOFAR-1\nfrom CHiME-8 challenge, as well as synthetic benchmarks such as Libri2Mix and\nLibriCSS, enabling direct comparisons with previous methods. Results\ndemonstrate that DiCoW enhances the model's target-speaker ASR capabilities\nwhile maintaining Whisper's accuracy and robustness on single-speaker data.",

    "abstract": "Given a binary string $\\omega$ over the alphabet $\\{0, 1\\}$, a vector $(a,\nb)$ is a Parikh vector if and only if a factor of $\\omega$ contains exactly $a$\noccurrences of $0$ and $b$ occurrences of $1$. Answering whether a vector is a\nParikh vector of $\\omega$ is known as the Binary Jumbled Indexing Problem\n(BJPMP) or the Histogram Indexing Problem. Most solutions to this problem rely\non an $O(n)$ word-space index to answer queries in constant time, encoding the\nParikh set of $\\omega$, i.e., all its Parikh vectors. Cunha et al.\n(Combinatorial Pattern Matching, 2017) introduced an algorithm (JBM2017), which\ncomputes the index table in $O(n+\\rho^2)$ time, where $\\rho$ is the number of\nruns of identical digits in $\\omega$, leading to $O(n^2)$ in the worst case. We\nprove that the average number of runs $\\rho$ is $n/4$, confirming the quadratic\nbehavior also in the average-case. We propose a new algorithm, SFTree, which\nuses a suffix tree to remove duplicate substrings. Although SFTree also has an\naverage-case complexity of $\\Theta(n^2)$ due to the fundamental reliance on run\nboundaries, it achieves practical improvements by minimizing memory access\noverhead through vectorization. The suffix tree further allows distinct\nsubstrings to be processed efficiently, reducing the effective cost of memory\naccess. As a result, while both algorithms exhibit similar theoretical growth,\nSFTree significantly outperforms others in practice. Our analysis highlights\nboth the theoretical and practical benefits of the SFTree approach, with\npotential extensions to other applications of suffix trees.",

    "abstract": "Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems (LS-MAS) consist of several autonomous\ncomponents, interacting in a non-trivial way, so that the emerging behaviour of\nthe ensemble depends on the individual dynamics of the components and their\nreciprocal interactions. These models can describe a rich variety of natural\nsystems, as well as artificial ones, characterised by unparalleled scalability,\nrobustness, and flexibility. Indeed, a crucial objective is devising efficient\nstrategies to model and control the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS to achieve\nspecific goals. However, the inherent complexity of these systems and the wide\nspectrum of their emerging behaviours pose significant challenges. The\noverarching goal of this thesis is, therefore, to advance methods for\nmodelling, analyzing and controlling the spatial behaviours of LS-MAS, with\napplications to cellular populations and swarm robotics. The thesis begins with\nan overview of the existing Literature, and is then organized into two distinct\nparts. In the context of swarm robotics, Part I deals with distributed control\nalgorithms to spatially organize agents on geometric patterns. The contribution\nis twofold, encompassing both the development of original control algorithms,\nand providing a novel formal analysis, which allows to guarantee the emergence\nof specific geometric patterns. In Part II, looking at the spatial behaviours\nof biological agents, experiments are carried out to study the movement of\nmicroorganisms and their response to light stimuli. This allows the derivation\nand parametrization of mathematical models that capture these behaviours, and\npave the way for the development of innovative approaches for the spatial\ncontrol of microorganisms.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) plays a crucial role in time series applications,\nprimarily because time series data is employed across real-world scenarios.\nDetecting anomalies poses significant challenges since anomalies take diverse\nforms making them hard to pinpoint accurately. Previous research has explored\ndifferent AD models, making specific assumptions with varying sensitivity\ntoward particular anomaly types. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nmodel selection for unsupervised AD using a combination of time series forest\n(TSF) and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that dynamically chooses an AD\ntechnique. Our approach allows for effective AD without explicitly depending on\nground truth labels that are often scarce and expensive to obtain.

For\nthe synthetic dataset, our proposed model surpasses all other AD models except\nfor KNN, with an impressive F1 score of 0.989. The proposed model selection\nframework also exceeded the performance of GPT-4 when prompted to act as an\nanomaly detector on the synthetic dataset. Exploring different reward functions\nrevealed that the original reward function in our proposed AD model selection\napproach yielded the best overall scores. We evaluated the performance of the\nsix AD models on an additional three datasets, having global, local, and\nclustered anomalies respectively, showing that each AD model exhibited distinct\nperformance depending on the type of anomalies.

Our evaluation shows Mistral 7b, a smaller\nopen-source model, outperforms larger models on most automatic metrics and\nsuccessfully generates syllabus-like summaries. In contrast, human expert\nannotators indicate that Mistral summaries contain hallucinations. The\nannotators consistently rank GPT-4 summaries as clearer and exhibiting greater\nsensitivity and specificity. Further, we find that LLM-based evaluations are\nnot more correlated with human evaluations than traditional automatic metrics.\nFurthermore, our analysis identifies specific hallucinations in generated\nsummaries, including precedent citation errors and misrepresentations of case\nfacts.

The area difference\nbetween a surface that returns to the boundary, and one that plunges into the\nbulk, determines the potential between two quarks. This result is naturally\nextended to Wilson surfaces associated to general p-form symmetries in boundary\nconformal field theories (BCFTs) by embedding a Karch-Randall (KR) brane in the\ngeometry. We find (generalized) Coulomb law scaling in subregion size $\\Gamma$\nis recovered only above the critical angle for the brane, $\\theta_{c,p}$. The\npotential between the two quarks (or defect operators) vanishes precisely when\nthe surface connecting them ceases to exist at $\\theta_{c,p}$. This screening\neffect, where the operators are fully screened below the critical angle, is a\nphase transition from Coulomb law to perimeter law with the brane angle\n$\\theta_p$ acting as an order parameter. This effect is also explored at finite\ntemperature, where we introduce a new regularization procedure to obtain\nclosed-form results.",

This collaborative approach\nresults in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single\nLLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed\nsetting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely\nassociated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power.\nThese devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms,\nallowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a\ncentralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM\nmodels to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their\nown user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers\nto certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues\nwhen their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge\ndevices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system\nremain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the\nqueuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable\nassumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate\nthrough experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of\ndistributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality\nresponses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.

Building on previous work on 4d anomalies and 5d cobordism\ninvariants, we classify lower-dimensional invertible field theories (iFTs) or\nsymmetry-protected topological states (SPTs) in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d.

By imposing the flat-connection condition\nof the Chern--Simons gauge fields, the path integral reduces to a\nfinite-dimensional matrix integral in\n\\(\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})\\times\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})\\) . Although\nChern-Simons theory is a topological theory, the resulting matrix integral\nremains nontrivial due to noncompact directions and boundary constraints.\n  The large-\\(k\\) expansion of the matrix integral is carried out by selecting\na classical configuration in the space of holonomies and expanding around it in\ninverse powers of \\(k\\). The resulting coefficients of the asymptotic series\nexhibit factorial growth, enabling us to apply the Borel resummation\ntechniques. Summation over these subleading sectors removes potential\nambiguities in the Borel integral and clarifies the emergence of a resurgent\ntransseries structure. In the Borel-resurgent analysis, we show that, despite\nthe apparent simplicity of the reduced action, the wedge geometry yields a rich\ninterplay of perturbative and non-perturbative phenomena. This work presents an\nexplicit example of how a finite-dimensional matrix integral in its expansions\nis physically meaningful through Borel resummation.",

    "abstract": "Nerve impulses, the currency of information flow in the brain, are generated\nby an instability of the neuronal membrane potential dynamics. Neuronal\ncircuits exhibit collective chaos that appears essential for learning, memory,\nsensory processing, and motor control. However, the factors controlling the\nnature and intensity of collective chaos in neuronal circuits are not well\nunderstood. Here we use computational ergodic theory to demonstrate that basic\nfeatures of nerve impulse generation profoundly affect collective chaos in\nneuronal circuits. Numerically exact calculations of Lyapunov spectra,\nKolmogorov-Sinai-entropy, and upper and lower bounds on attractor dimension\nshow that changes in nerve impulse generation in individual neurons moderately\nimpact information encoding rates but qualitatively transform phase space\nstructure. Specifically, we find a drastic reduction in the number of unstable\nmanifolds, Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, and attractor dimension. Beyond a critical\npoint, marked by the simultaneous breakdown of the diffusion approximation, a\npeak in the largest Lyapunov exponent, and a localization transition of the\nleading covariant Lyapunov vector, networks exhibit sparse chaos: prolonged\nperiods of near stable dynamics interrupted by short bursts of intense chaos.\nAnalysis of large, more realistically structured networks supports the\ngenerality of these findings. In cortical circuits, biophysical properties\nappear tuned to this regime of sparse chaos. Our results reveal a close link\nbetween fundamental aspects of single-neuron biophysics and the collective\ndynamics of cortical circuits, suggesting that nerve impulse generation\nmechanisms are adapted to enhance circuit controllability and information flow.",

This algebra acts on a\nlittle Hilbert space that describes excitations about the observer's state and\ntime-translated versions of this state.

At leading order in gravitational perturbation theory, and with a\nspecific choice of dressing, our construction reduces to the modular\ncrossed-product described previously in the literature.

Part of\nthe question is determining a reasonable way to measure levels of nightlife,\nand correspondingly which cities are notorious for it; we colloquially refer to\nsuch cities as \"party cities\". To carry out this study, we exploit data on\nbookmaker spreads: the expected score differential between two teams after\nconditioning on observable performance in past games and expectations about the\nupcoming game. We expect a team to meet the spread half the time, since this is\none of the easiest ways for bookmakers to guarantee a profit.

To the extent that odds of beating the spread\nagainst next day opponent is uncorrelated with playing in a party city the day\nbefore, which should be the case under an efficient betting market, we have\nidentification in our variable of interest.

Photons emitted with energies above $10 \\, \\rm TeV$ at\nthis redshift can hardly be observed on Earth due to their interaction with the\nextragalactic background light (EBL). We show that indeed the LHAASO\nCollaboration should not have observed photons with energies above $10 \\, \\rm\nTeV$ if the state-of-the-art EBL model by Saldana-Lopez et al. is taken into\naccount. A problem therefore arises: the Universe should be more transparent\nthan currently believed. We also show that the issue is solved if we introduce\nthe interaction of photons with axion-like particles (ALPs). ALPs are predicted\nby String Theory, are among the best candidates for dark matter and can produce\nspectral and polarization effects on astrophysical sources in the presence of\nexternal magnetic fields. In particular, for GRB 221009A, photon-ALP\noscillations occur within the crossed magnetized media, i.e. the host galaxy,\nthe extragalactic space, the Milky Way, partially reducing the EBL absorption\nto a level that explains the LHAASO detection of GRB 221009A and its observed\nspectrum without the need of contrived choices of parameter values, which are\ninstead compulsory within proposed emission models within conventional physics.\nThis fact regarding GRB 221009A represents a strong hint at the ALP existence,\nwhich adds to two other indications coming from blazars, a class of active\ngalactic nuclei.",

We study the motion of\nperturbations of the scalar, \"phonons\", on these anisotropic time-dependent\nbackgrounds in curved spacetimes. The phonons propagate on null geodesics of an\neffective acoustic spacetime which has its own metric and a connection\nfeaturing non-metricity with respect to the metric defined by gravity. These\nacoustic geodesics correspond to motion with four-acceleration in the usual\nspacetime. We indicate the differences and duality between the phonons'\ncanonical four-momenta and four-velocities, and the analogies with photons in\nmedia. For an arbitrary moving observer, we covariantly define the phonon's\nenergy, relative phase velocity, effective refraction index and mass tensor. We\npoint out that true instabilities (ghosts, gradient) are observer independent,\nbeing identified by the acoustic metric's signature and determinant. However,\napparent instabilities, such as complex phonon energies, can stem from an\nill-posed Cauchy problem in certain observer frames. Negative phonon energies\nappear for supersonic observers, not signaling true instabilities, but leading\nto Cherenkov radiation. We extend this local picture to a global foliation,\nderiving the condition for a spatial slice to be a Cauchy surface for a\nwell-posed initial value problem. This Hamiltonian is bounded if the\nfoliation's comoving observer is subsonic. Otherwise, for a Killing vector\ntimelike in both metrics, an alternative conserved charge that bounds motion\nexists. The action for perturbations yields an acoustically conserved\nasymmetric energy-momentum tensor (EMT), not conserved in the usual spacetime.\nYet, with a timelike acoustic Killing vector, this EMT forms a current\nconserved in both the acoustic and usual spacetimes, with the acoustic\nHamiltonian functional as its conserved charge.",

Recent\nexperiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based\nsemiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which\nthe hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question.\nIn addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with\nlargely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further\nmotivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects\nand the proximity effect.

This paper explores a deep learning (DL) approach to tackle these\nconcerns, focusing on two critical tasks, namely (i) identifying LoRa devices\nand (ii) classifying them to legitimate and rogue devices. Deep neural networks\n(DNNs), encompassing both convolutional and feedforward neural networks, are\ntrained for these tasks using actual LoRa signal data. In this setting, the\nadversaries may spoof rogue LoRa signals through the kernel density estimation\n(KDE) method based on legitimate device signals that are received by the\nadversaries. Two cases are considered, (i) training two separate classifiers,\none for each of the two tasks, and (ii) training a multi-task classifier for\nboth tasks. The vulnerabilities of the resulting DNNs to manipulations in input\nsamples are studied in form of untargeted and targeted adversarial attacks\nusing the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). Individual and common perturbations\nare considered against single-task and multi-task classifiers for the LoRa\nsignal analysis. To provide resilience against such attacks, a defense approach\nis presented by increasing the robustness of classifiers with adversarial\ntraining.

    "abstract": "Connected Vehicles (CVs) can leverage the unique features of 5G and future\n6G/NextG networks to enhance Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services.\nHowever, even with advancements in cellular network generations, CV\napplications may experience communication interruptions in high-mobility\nscenarios due to frequent changes of serving base station, also known as\nhandovers (HOs). This paper proposes the adoption of Open Radio Access Network\n(Open RAN/O-RAN) and deep learning models for decision-making to prevent\nQuality of Service (QoS) degradation due to HOs and to ensure the timely\nconnectivity needed for CV services. The solution utilizes the O-RAN Software\nCommunity (OSC), an open-source O-RAN platform developed by the collaboration\nbetween the O-RAN Alliance and Linux Foundation, to develop xApps that are\nexecuted in the near-Real-Time RIC of OSC. To demonstrate the proposal's\neffectiveness, an integrated framework combining the OMNeT++ simulator and OSC\nwas created. Evaluations used real-world datasets in urban application\nscenarios, such as video streaming transmission and over-the-air (OTA) updates.\nResults indicate that the proposal achieved superior performance and reduced\nlatency compared to the standard 3GPP HO procedure.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the parameter recovery of Markov-switching ordinary\ndifferential processes from discrete observations, where the differential\nequations are nonlinear additive models. This framework has been widely applied\nin biological systems, control systems, and other domains; however, limited\nresearch has been conducted on reconstructing the generating processes from\nobservations. In contrast, many physical systems, such as human brains, cannot\nbe directly experimented upon and rely on observations to infer the underlying\nsystems. To address this gap, this manuscript presents a comprehensive study of\nthe model, encompassing algorithm design, optimization guarantees, and\nquantification of statistical errors. Specifically, we develop a two-stage\nalgorithm that first recovers the continuous sample path from discrete samples\nand then estimates the parameters of the processes. We provide novel\ntheoretical insights into the statistical error and linear convergence\nguarantee when the processes are $\\beta$-mixing. Our analysis is based on the\ntruncation of the latent posterior processes and demonstrates that the\ntruncated processes approximate the true processes under mixing conditions. We\napply this model to investigate the differences in resting-state brain networks\nbetween the ADHD group and normal controls, revealing differences in the\ntransition rate matrices of the two groups.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in exploring quantities associated with\nquantum information at colliders. We perform a detailed analysis describing how\nto measure the quantum discord in the top anti-top quantum state at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). While for pure states, quantum discord, entanglement,\nand Bell nonlocality all probe the same correlations, for mixed states they\nprobe different aspects of quantum correlations. The quantum discord, in\nparticular, is interesting because it aims to encapsulate all correlations\nbetween systems that cannot have a classical origin. We employ two\ncomplementary approaches for the study of the top anti-top system, namely the\ndecay method and the kinematic method. We highlight subtleties associated with\nmeasuring discord for reconstructed quantum states at colliders. Usually\nquantum discord is difficult to compute due to an extremization that must be\nperformed. We show, however, that for the $t\\bar{t}$ system this extremization\ncan be performed analytically and we provide closed-form formulas for the\nquantum discord. We demonstrate that at the high luminosity LHC, discord is\nprojected to be measurable with a precision of approximately 5% using the decay\nmethod and sub-percent levels using the kinematic method. Even with current LHC\ndatasets, discord can be measured with 1-2% precision with the kinematic\nmethod. By systematically investigating quantum discord for the first time\nthrough a detailed collider analysis, this work expands the toolkit for quantum\ninformation studies in particle physics and lays the groundwork for deeper\ninsights into the quantum properties in high-energy collisions.",

The general strategy we employ is to\nsupplement the Standard Model and its grand unified extensions by an\nanomaly-free axial $U(1)_a$ symmetry that is gauged. We show that for several\nchoices of the gauge quantum numbers of the fermions, this setup leads to an\naccidental $U(1)$ symmetry with a QCD anomaly which can be identified as the\nPeccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry that solves the strong CP problem. The $U(1)_a$\ngauge symmetry controls the amount of explicit PQ symmetry violation induced by\nquantum gravity, resulting in a high quality axion. We present two classes of\nmodels employing this strategy. In the first class (models I and II), the axial\n$U(1)_a$ gauge symmetry acts on vector-like quarks leading to an accidental\nKSVZ-type axion. The second class (model III) is based on $SO(10)$ grand\nunified theory extended by a gauged $U(1)_a$ symmetry that leads to a hybrid\nKSVZ--DFSZ type axion. The couplings of the axion to the electron and the\nnucleon are found to be distinct in this class of hybrid models from those in\nthe KSVZ and DFSZ models, when the axion is identified as the dark matter of\nthe universe, which can be used to test these models.

    "abstract": "We study when low coordinate degree functions (LCDF) -- linear combinations\nof functions depending on small subsets of entries of a vector -- can test for\nthe presence of categorical structure, including community structure and\ngeneralizations thereof, in high-dimensional data. This complements the first\npaper of this series, which studied the power of LCDF in testing for continuous\nstructure like real-valued signals perturbed by additive noise. We apply the\ntools developed there to a general form of stochastic block model (SBM), where\na population is assigned random labels and every $p$-tuple of the population\ngenerates an observation according to an arbitrary probability measure\nassociated to the $p$ labels of its members. We show that the performance of\nLCDF admits a unified analysis for this class of models. As applications, we\nprove tight lower bounds against LCDF (and therefore also against low degree\npolynomials) for nearly arbitrary graph and regular hypergraph SBMs, always\nmatching suitable generalizations of the Kesten-Stigum threshold. We also prove\ntight lower bounds for group synchronization and abelian group sumset problems\nunder the \"truth-or-Haar\" noise model, and use our technical results to give an\nimproved analysis of Gaussian multi-frequency group synchronization. In most of\nthese models, for some parameter settings our lower bounds give new evidence\nfor conjectural statistical-to-computational gaps. Finally, interpreting some\nof our findings, we propose a precise analogy between categorical and\ncontinuous signals: a general SBM as above behaves, in terms of the tradeoff\nbetween subexponential runtime cost of testing algorithms and the signal\nstrength needed for a testing algorithm to succeed, like a spiked $p_*$-tensor\nmodel of a certain order $p_*$ that may be computed from the parameters of the\nSBM.",

In the FRM\nparadigm, for each data point $(x_i,y_i)$ there is function $f_{\\theta_i}$ that\nfits it: $y_i = f_{\\theta_i}(x_i)$. This allows FRM to subsume ERM for many\ncommon loss functions and to capture more realistic noise processes. We also\nshow that FRM provides an avenue towards understanding generalization in the\nmodern over-parameterized regime, as its objective can be framed as finding the\nsimplest model that fits the training data.",

In this research, we\nfirst develop an analytical solution for the alloy-solidification Stefan\nproblem, which involves melt, solid, and mushy regions. This new analytical\nsolution extends a previous solution (S. Cho and J. Sunderland,\n\"Heat-conduction problems with melting or freezing\", J. Heat Transfer, vol. 91,\npp. 421-426, 1969) by incorporating a linear microsegregation law as a function\nof temperature in place of spatial coordinate. Then, we adopt this solution to\nverify an OpenFOAM MS solver in a limiting condition, where only heat diffusion\nis present. Subsequently, to capture the MS map of the Sn-3%Pb AFRODITE\nbenchmark, the solver is incorporated using the standard Blake-Kozeny-Carman\npermeability law and one of its hybrid variants, slightly modified in this work\nto better align with physics by ensuring a continuous transition of\ncharacteristics from the slurry to the porous regions of the mush. It is\ndemonstrated that the hybrid model predicts the main features of the MS map,\nincluding the channel segregates morphology and peak segregation degree due to\nthe pile-up effect, in much finer agreement with the experimental observation.\nCareful analyses of the results reveal that these improved predictions stem\nfrom the hybrid model's more accurate estimation of the re-melting, melt flow\nadvection parallel, and advection normal to the solidification front.",

In this framework, infections spread as\ninfected vertices recover at rate 1, infect susceptible neighbors independently\nat rate $\\lambda$, and recovered vertices become susceptible again at rate\n$\\alpha$. This model presents a significantly greater analytical challenge\ncompared to the SIS model, which has consequently inspired a much more\nextensive and rich body of mathematical literature for the latter.\nUnderstanding the survival time, the duration before the infection dies out\ncompletely, is a fundamental question in this context. On general graphs,\nsurvival time heavily depends on the infection's persistence around high-degree\nvertices (known as hubs or stars), as long persistence enables transmission\nbetween hubs and prolongs the process. In contrast, short persistence leads to\nrapid extinction, making the dynamics on star graphs, which serve as key\nrepresentatives of hubs, particularly important to study.\n  In the 2016 paper by Ferreira, Sander, and Pastor-Satorras, it was\nconjectured, based on intuitive arguments, that the survival time for SIRS on a\nstar graph with $n$ leaves is bounded above by $(\\lambda^2 n)^\\alpha$ for large\n$n$. Later, in one of a few mathematically rigorous results for SIRS,\nFriedrich, G{\\\"o}bel, Klodt, Krejca, and Pappik provided an upper bound of\n$n^\\alpha \\log n$, with contains an additional $\\log n$ and no dependence on\n$\\lambda$.\n  We resolve this conjecture by proving that the survival time is indeed of\norder $(\\lambda^2 n)^\\alpha$, with matching upper and lower bounds.\nAdditionally, we show that this holds even in the case where only the root\nundergoes immunization, while the leaves revert to susceptibility immediately\nafter recovery.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new bilevel version of the classic shortest path problem and\ncompletely characterize its computational complexity with respect to several\nproblem variants. In our problem, the leader and the follower each control a\nsubset of the edges of a graph and together aim at building a path between two\ngiven vertices, while each of the two players minimizes the cost of the\nresulting path according to their own cost function. We investigate both\ndirected and undirected graphs, as well as the special case of directed acyclic\ngraphs. Moreover, we distinguish two versions of the follower's problem: Either\nthey have to complete the edge set selected by the leader such that the joint\nsolution is exactly a path, or they have to complete the edge set selected by\nthe leader such that the joint solution is a superset of a path. In general,\nthe bilevel problem turns out to be much harder in the former case: We show\nthat the follower's problem is already NP-hard here and that the leader's\nproblem is even hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, while\nboth problems are one level easier in the latter case. Interestingly, for\ndirected acyclic graphs, this difference turns around, as we give a\npolynomial-time algorithm for the first version of the bilevel problem, but it\nstays NP-hard in the second case. Finally, we consider restrictions that render\nthe problem tractable. We prove that, for a constant number of leader's edges,\none of our problem variants is actually equivalent to the shortest-$k$-cycle\nproblem, which is a known combinatorial problem with partially unresolved\ncomplexity status. In particular, our problem admits a polynomial-time\nrandomized algorithm that can be derandomized if and only if the\nshortest-$k$-cycle problem admits a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm.",

Traditional methods for\nvibration control often rely on active systems to mitigate unpredictable\nvibrations, which may lead to resonance and potential structural failure.\nHowever, these methods face significant challenges when addressing the\nnonlinear inverse eigenvalue problems required for optimizing structures\nsubjected to a wide range of frequencies.

We introduce a new Galaxy Spectra Neural Network\n(GaSNet-III) model that takes advantage of generative neural networks to\nperform these three tasks at once with very high efficiency. We use two\ndifferent generative networks, an autoencoder-like network and U-Net, to\nreconstruct the rest-frame spectrum (after redshifting). The autoencoder-like\nnetwork operates similarly to the classical PCA, learning templates\n(eigenspectra) from the training set and returning modeling parameters.

By reconstructing spectra, we can achieve classification,\nredshift estimation, and anomaly detection in the same framework. Each\nrest-frame reconstructed spectrum is extended to the UV and a small part of the\ninfrared (covering the blueshift of stars). Owing to the high computational\nefficiency of deep learning, we scan the chi-squared value for the entire type\nand redshift space and find the best-fitting point. Our results show that\ngenerative networks can achieve accuracy comparable to the classical PCA\nmethods in spectral modeling with higher efficiency, especially achieving an\naverage of $>98\\%$ classification across all classes ($>99.9\\%$ for star), and\n$>99\\%$ (stars), $>98\\%$ (galaxies) and $>93\\%$ (quasars) redshift accuracy\nunder cosmology research requirements.

Despite this dilemma, the common practice of choosing batch sizes in\nlanguage model training often prioritizes training efficiency -- employing\neither constant large sizes with data parallelism or implementing batch size\nwarmup schedules. However, such batch size schedule designs remain heuristic\nand often fail to adapt to training dynamics, presenting the challenge of\ndesigning adaptive batch size schedules. Given the abundance of available\ndatasets and the data-hungry nature of language models, data parallelism has\nbecome an indispensable distributed training paradigm, enabling the use of\nlarger batch sizes for gradient computation. However, vanilla data parallelism\nrequires replicas of model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states at each\nworker, which prohibits training larger models with billions of parameters. To\noptimize memory usage, more advanced parallelism strategies must be employed.\nIn this work, we propose general-purpose and theoretically principled adaptive\nbatch size schedules compatible with data parallelism and model parallelism. We\ndevelop a practical implementation with PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel,\nfacilitating the pretraining of language models of different sizes.

To empower data owners with\ndirect control, we propose ExpShiled, a proactive self-defense mechanism that\nmitigates sample-specific memorization via imperceptible text perturbations.\nThis approach requires no external collaboration while maintaining original\nreadability. To evaluate individual-level defense efficacy, we first propose\nthe metric of instance exploitation: a zero value indicates perfect defense,\nachieved when a protected text's log-perplexity ranking aligns with its\ncounterfactual untrained ranking. We then reveal and validate the memorization\ntrigger hypothesis, demonstrating that a model's memorization of a specific\ntext sample stems primarily from its outlier tokens. Leveraging this insight,\nwe design targeted perturbations that (1) prioritize inherent trigger tokens\nand (2) introduce artificial trigger tokens as pitfalls to disrupt memorization\non the protected sample. Experiments validate our defense across model scales,\nlanguages, vision-to-language tasks, and fine-tuning methods. Even with privacy\nbackdoors, the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) AUC drops from 0.95 to 0.55,\nand instance exploitation approaches zero.

In TEM, both the\nBloch wave formulation and the multislice method are commonly employed to model\nthe scattering process, but comparing these models directly is challenging.\nUnlike the Bloch wave formulation, which represents the transmission function\nin terms of the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method does not\nhave a pure transmission function due to the entanglement between electron\nwaves and the propagation function within the crystal. To address this, we\npropose a reformulation of the multislice method into a matrix framework, which\nwe refer to as transmission matrix. This enables a direct comparison to the\nwell-known scattering matrix, derived from the Bloch wave formulation, and\nanalysis of their eigenstructures. We show theoretically that both matrices are\nequal, under the condition that the angles of the eigenvalues differ no more\nthan modulo $2\\pi n$ for integer $n$, and the eigenvectors of the transmission\nand scattering matrix are related in terms of a two-dimensional Fourier matrix.\nThe characterization of both matrices in terms of physical parameters, such as\ntotal projected potentials, is also discussed, and we perform numerical\nsimulations to validate our theoretical findings.

We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our BP+ADOSD approach through extensive simulations on a varity of quantum\ncodes, including generalized hypergraph-product codes, topological codes,\nlift-connected surface codes, and bivariate bicycle codes. The results indicate\nthat the BP+ADOSD decoder outperforms existing methods, achieving higher error\nthresholds and enhanced performance at low error rates.

We conduct\na thorough study on token similarity characteristics, revealing three key\ninsights: (1) spatially corresponding visual tokens between adjacent frames\nhave higher cosine similarities compared to other token pairs; (2) high token\nsimilarities prominently decrease in deeper model layers; and (3) token\nsimilarity rankings are highly consistent across different layers. Guided by\nthese observations, FrameFusion computes token similarities exclusively between\ncorresponding visual tokens from adjacent frames, applies token merging at\ninitial successive layers followed by pruning in deeper layers, and adopts a\ncascaded merging strategy to further enhance efficiency. We evaluate\nFrameFusion comprehensively across six diverse LVLMs, ranging from 2B to 72B\nparameters, using five video benchmarks encompassing video retrieval,\nquestion-answering, and spatial-temporal understanding tasks. Experiments show\nthat FrameFusion reduces visual tokens by 70%, achieving 1.6-3.6x end-to-end\nspeedups, with an average performance impact of less than 3%.

    "abstract": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is transforming industries and\neconomies worldwide, presenting both opportunities and challenges for Small and\nMedium Enterprises (SMEs) and employment. This study qualitatively explores the\nimpact of 4IR on the SME sector in Bangladesh. Initially, secondary data\nsources are reviewed to establish the context and to prepare the questionnaire\nfor primary data collection. Then, the primary data is collected through Key\nInformant Interviews and Focus Group Discussions with different stakeholders\nincluding SME owners, association representatives, and government officials.\nThe study reveals that while most of the participants have only a superficially\nawareness of 4IR, they view it as a blessing for the SME sector. Despite being\nin early adoption stages in Bangladesh, SMEs anticipate numerous benefits\nincluding enhanced customer experiences, reduced production times, improved\nquality, etc. Regarding employment, most participants believe that adopting 4IR\nin the SME sector of Bangladesh will create new job opportunities. However,\nparticipants express concern about challenges during the transition to 4IR,\nincluding a lack of technical knowledge, financial constraints, inadequate\ntraining, safety and security issues, etc. To fully harness 4IR's potential\nbenefits for SMEs in Bangladesh, several key recommendations emerge that\ninclude analyzing of the current SME landscape, establishing a collaborative\ninformation sharing platform, organizing effective training and workshops,\npromoting resource sharing, encouraging local innovation, attracting foreign\nclients, ensuring proper policy implementation and fostering collaboration\namong government, associations, and academia. By addressing these challenges\nand implementing the recommended strategies, Bangladesh can effectively embrace\nthe transformative benefits of 4IR, simultaneously improving its SME sector.",

Despite significant\nadvancements toward faster and more efficient scintillators, there remains a\nfundamental limit arising from the intrinsic properties of scintillating\nmaterials. The scintillation process culminates in spontaneous emission of\nvisible light, which is restricted in rate by the oscillator strength of\nindividual emission centers. Here, we observe a novel collective emission\nphenomenon under X-ray excitation, breaking this limit and accelerating the\nemission. Our observation reveals that strong interactions between\nsimultaneously excited coupled perovskite quantum dots can create collective\nradioluminescence. This effect is characterized by a spectral shift and an\nenhanced rate of emission, with an average lifetime of 230 ps, 14 times faster\nthan their room temperature spontaneous emission. It has been established that\nsuch quantum dots exhibit superfluorescence under UV excitation. However, X-ray\nsuperfluorescence is inherently different, as each high-energy photon creates\nmultiple synchronized excitation events, triggered by a photoelectron and\nresulting in even faster emission rates, a larger spectral shift, and a broader\nspectrum. This observation is consistent with a quantum-optical analysis\nexplaining both the UV-driven and X-ray-driven effects. We use a\nHanbury-Brown-Twiss g^(2) ({\\tau}) setup to analyze the temperature-dependent\ntemporal response of these scintillators. Collective radioluminescence breaks\nthe limit of scintillation lifetime based on spontaneous emission and could\ndramatically improve time-of-flight detector performance, introducing quantum\nenhancements to scintillation science.",

This means that quasinormal modes are stable\nin time-domain regardless of the shapes of the original effective potentials.\nIn this way, our study reveals the non-equivalence of the stability of\nquasinormal modes in the frequency-domain and the time-domain. Besides, we also\nnumerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with\nthe assistance of the hyperboloidal approach.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are the most common cause of mortality among primary brain tumors.\nMolecular markers, including Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (IDH) and\nO[6]-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) influence treatment responses\nand prognosis. Deep learning (DL) models may provide a non-invasive method for\npredicting the status of these molecular markers. To achieve non-invasive\ndetermination of gene mutations in glioma patients, we compare 2D and 3D ResNet\nmodels to predict IDH and MGMT status, using T1, post-contrast T1, and FLAIR\nMRI sequences. USCF glioma dataset was used, which contains 495 patients with\nknown IDH and 410 patients with known MGMT status. The dataset was divided into\ntraining (60%), tuning (20%), and test (20%) subsets at the patient level. The\n2D models take axial, coronal, and sagittal tumor slices as three separate\nmodels. To ensemble the 2D predictions the three different views were combined\nusing logistic regression. Various ResNet architectures (ResNet10, 18, 34, 50,\n101, 152) were trained. For the 3D approach, we incorporated the entire brain\ntumor volume in the ResNet10, 18, and 34 models. After optimizing each model,\nthe models with the lowest tuning loss were selected for further evaluation on\nthe separate test sets. The best-performing models in IDH prediction were the\n2D ResNet50, achieving a test area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve (AUROC) of 0.9096, and the 3D ResNet34, which reached a test AUROC of\n0.8999. For MGMT status prediction, the 2D ResNet152 achieved a test AUROC of\n0.6168; however, all 3D models yielded AUROCs less than 0.5. Overall, the study\nindicated that both 2D and 3D models showed high predictive value for IDH\nprediction, with slightly better performance in 2D models.",

Recognizing these limitations, our research\npivots towards enabling robust ransomware detection in storage systems keeping\nin mind their limited computational resources available. To perform our\nstudies, we propose a kernel-based framework capable of efficiently extracting\nand analyzing IO operations to identify ransomware activity. The framework can\nbe adopted to storage systems using computational storage devices to improve\nsecurity and fully hide detection overheads.

This suggests a way to search for those states\nthat are as distinct as possible from the stabilizer states. In this work we\nexplore the problem in any finite dimension $d$ and characterize the states\nthat saturate an upper bound on stabilizer entropies of order $\\alpha\\geq2$.\nParticularly, we show that if a Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) covariant Symmetric\nInformationally Complete (SIC) quantum measurement exists, its states uniquely\nmaximize the stabilizer entropies by saturating the bound. No other states can\nreach so high. This result is surprising, as the initial motivation for\nstudying SICs was a purely quantum-foundational concern in QBism.

    "abstract": "In modern engineering scenarios, there is often a strict upper bound on the\nnumber of algorithm iterations that can be performed within a given time limit.\nThis raises the question of optimal algorithmic configuration for a fixed and\nfinite iteration budget. In this work, we introduce the framework of finite\nhorizon optimization, which focuses on optimizing the algorithm performance\nunder a strict iteration budget $T$. We apply this framework to linear\nprogramming (LP) and propose Finite Horizon stepsize rule for the primal-dual\nmethod. The main challenge in the stepsize design is controlling the singular\nvalues of $T$ cumulative product of non-symmetric matrices, which appears to be\na highly nonconvex problem, and there are very few helpful tools. Fortunately,\nin the special case of the primal-dual method, we find that the optimal\nstepsize design problem admits hidden convexity, and we propose a convex\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) reformulation. This SDP only involves matrix\nconstraints of size $4 \\times 4$ and can be solved efficiently in negligible\ntime. Theoretical acceleration guarantee is also provided at the pre-fixed\n$T$-th iteration, but with no asymptotic guarantee. On more than 90 real-world\nLP instances, Finite Horizon stepsize rule reaches an average 3.9$\\times$\nspeed-up over the optimal constant stepsize, saving 75\\% wall-clock time. Our\nnumerical results reveal substantial room for improvement when we abandon\nasymptotic guarantees, and instead focus on the performance under finite\nhorizon.

    "abstract": "Quantum computers can efficiently simulate Lindbladian dynamics, enabling\npowerful applications in open system simulation, thermal and ground-state\npreparation, autonomous quantum error correction, dissipative engineering, and\nmore. Despite the abundance of well-established algorithms for closed-system\ndynamics, simulating open quantum systems on digital quantum computers remains\nchallenging due to the intrinsic requirement for non-unitary operations.\nExisting methods face a critical trade-off: either relying on\nresource-intensive multi-qubit operations with experimentally challenging\napproaches or employing deep quantum circuits to suppress simulation errors\nusing experimentally friendly methods. In this work, we challenge this\nperceived trade-off by proposing an efficient Lindbladian simulation framework\nthat minimizes circuit depths while remaining experimentally accessible. Based\non the incoherent linear combination of superoperators, our method achieves\nexponential reductions in circuit depth using at most two ancilla qubits and\nthe straightforward Trotter decomposition of the process. Furthermore, our\napproach extends to simulate time-dependent Lindbladian dynamics, achieving\nlogarithmic dependence on the inverse accuracy for the first time. Rigorous\nnumerical simulations demonstrate clear advantages of our method over existing\ntechniques. This work provides a practical and scalable solution for simulating\nopen quantum systems on quantum devices.",

It has led to the release of popular black-box tools\n(e.g., APIs) for users to upload personal data and receive protected\ncounterparts. In this work, we show that such black-box protections can be\nsubstantially compromised if a small set of unprotected in-distribution data is\navailable. Specifically, we propose a novel threat model of protection leakage,\nwhere an adversary can (1) easily acquire (unprotected, protected) pairs by\nquerying the black-box protections with a small unprotected dataset; and (2)\ntrain a diffusion bridge model to build a mapping between unprotected and\nprotected data. This mapping, termed BridgePure, can effectively remove the\nprotection from any previously unseen data within the same distribution.\nBridgePure demonstrates superior purification performance on classification and\nstyle mimicry tasks, exposing critical vulnerabilities in black-box data\nprotection. We suggest that practitioners implement multi-level countermeasures\nto mitigate such risks.",

Nevertheless, the Rindler\nmapping is not confined in the entanglement wedges. While the outer horizon of\nthe Rindler $\\widetilde{\\text{AdS}_3}$ is mapped to the RT surface, we also\nidentify the pre-image of the inner horizon in the original AdS$_3$, which we\ncall the inner RT surface. In this paper we give some new physical\ninterpretation for the inner RT surface. First, the inner RT surface breaks\ninto two pieces which anchor on the two tips of the causal development.\nFurthermore, we can take the two tips as the endpoints of a certain timelike\ninterval and the inner RT surface is exactly the spacelike geodesic that\nrepresents the real part of the so-called holographic timelike entanglement\nentropy (HTEE). We also identify a timelike geodesic at boundary of the\nextended entanglement wedge, which represents the imaginary part of the HTEE.\nSecond, in the duality between the topological massive gravity (TMG) and\ngravitational anomalous CFT$_2$, the entanglement entropy and the mixed state\ncorrelation that is dual to the entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) receive\ncorrection from the Chern-Simons term in the TMG. We find that, the correction\nto the holographic entanglement entropy can be reproduced by the area of the\ninner RT surface with a proper regulation, while the mixed state correlation\ncan be represented by the saddle geodesic chord connecting the two pieces of\nthe inner RT surface of the mixed state we consider, which we call the inner\nEWCS. The equivalence between the twist on the RT surface and the length of\ninner RT surface is also discussed.",

To manage the scale and complexity of these graph\ndatasets, machine learning (ML) approaches have become essential. However,\nCTDGs pose challenges for ML because traditional static graph methods do not\nnaturally account for event timings. Newer approaches, such as graph recurrent\nneural networks (GRNNs), are inherently time-aware and offer advantages over\nstatic methods for CTDGs. However, GRNNs face another issue: the short\ntruncation of backpropagation-through-time (BPTT), whose impact has not been\nproperly examined until now. In this work, we demonstrate that this truncation\ncan limit the learning of dependencies beyond a single hop, resulting in\nreduced performance. Through experiments on a novel synthetic task and\nreal-world datasets, we reveal a performance gap between full\nbackpropagation-through-time (F-BPTT) and the truncated\nbackpropagation-through-time (T-BPTT) commonly used to train GRNN models. We\nterm this gap the \"truncation gap\" and argue that understanding and addressing\nit is essential as the importance of CTDGs grows, discussing potential future\ndirections for research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have established themselves as the de facto primary paradigm\nin visual generative modeling, revolutionizing the field through remarkable\nsuccess across various diverse applications ranging from high-quality image\nsynthesis to temporal aware video generation. Despite these advancements, three\nfundamental limitations persist, including 1) discrepancy between training and\ninference processes, 2) progressive information leakage throughout the noise\ncorruption procedures, and 3) inherent constraints preventing effective\nintegration of modern optimization criteria like perceptual and adversarial\nloss. To mitigate these critical challenges, we in this paper present a novel\nend-to-end learning paradigm that establishes direct optimization from the\nfinal generated samples to initial noises. Our proposed End-to-End\nDifferentiable Diffusion, dubbed E2ED^2, introduces several key improvements:\nit eliminates the sequential training-sampling mismatch and intermediate\ninformation leakage via conceptualizing training as a direct transformation\nfrom isotropic Gaussian noise to the target data distribution. Additionally,\nsuch training framework enables seamless incorporation of adversarial and\nperceptual losses into the core optimization objective. Comprehensive\nevaluation across standard benchmarks including COCO30K and HW30K reveals that\nour method achieves substantial performance gains in terms of Fr\\'echet\nInception Distance (FID) and CLIP score, even with fewer sampling steps (less\nthan 4). Our findings highlight that the end-to-end mechanism might pave the\nway for more robust and efficient solutions, \\emph{i.e.,} combining diffusion\nstability with GAN-like discriminative optimization in an end-to-end manner.",

Remarkably, it\nhas been predicted that quantum metastability can also occur in continuous-time\nand discrete-time open quantum dynamics. However, the direct experimental\nobservation of metastability in open quantum systems has remained elusive.\nHere, we experimentally observe metastability in the discrete-time evolution of\na single nuclear spin in diamond, realized by sequential Ramsey interferometry\nmeasurements of a nearby nitrogen-vacancy electron spin. We demonstrate that\nthe metastable polarization of the nuclear spin emerges at around\n60,000-250,000 sequential measurements, enabling high-fidelity single-shot\nreadout of the nuclear spin under a small magnetic field of 108.4 gauss. An\nultra-long spin relaxation time of more than 10 s has been observed at room\ntemperature. By further increasing the measurement number, the nuclear spin\neventually relaxes into the maximally mixed state.

    "abstract": "We study two well-known reconfiguration problems. Given a start and a target\nconfiguration of geometric objects in a polygon, we wonder whether we can move\nthe objects from the start configuration to the target configuration while\navoiding collisions between the objects and staying within the polygon.\nProblems of this type have been considered since the early 80s by roboticists\nand computational geometers. In this paper, we study some of the simplest\npossible variants where the objects are unlabeled unit squares or unit disks.\nIn unlabeled reconfiguration, the objects are identical, so that any object is\nallowed to end at any of the targets positions.\n  We show that it is PSPACE-hard to decide whether there exists a\nreconfiguration of unit squares even in a simple polygon. Previously, it was\nonly known to be PSPACE-hard in a polygon with holes [Solovey and Halperin,\nInt. J. Robotics Res. 2016]. Our proof is based on a result of independent\ninterest, namely that reconfiguration between two satisfying assignments of a\nformula of Monotone-Planar-3SAT is also PSPACE-complete. The reduction from\nreconfiguration of Monotone-Planar-3SAT to reconfiguration of unit squares\nextends techniques recently developed to show NP-hardness of packing unit\nsquares in a simple polygon [Abrahamsen and Stade, FOCS 2024]. We also show\nPSPACE-hardness of reconfiguration of unit disks in a polygon with holes.\nPreviously, it was only known that reconfiguration of disks of two different\nsizes was PSPACE-hard [Brocken, van der Heijden, Kostitsyna, Lo-Wong and\nSurtel, FUN 2021].",

    "abstract": "Benefiting from the advancements in LLMs, NLP software has undergone rapid\ndevelopment. Such software is widely employed in various safety-critical tasks,\nsuch as financial sentiment analysis, toxic content moderation, and log\ngeneration. Unlike traditional software, LLM-based NLP software relies on\nprompts and examples as inputs. Given the complexity of LLMs and the\nunpredictability of real-world inputs, quantitatively assessing the robustness\nof such software is crucial. However, to the best of our knowledge, no\nautomated robustness testing methods have been specifically designed to\nevaluate the overall inputs of LLM-based NLP software. To this end, this paper\nintroduces the first AutOmated Robustness Testing frAmework, AORTA, which\nreconceptualizes the testing process into a combinatorial optimization problem.\nExisting testing methods designed for DNN-based software can be applied to\nLLM-based software by AORTA, but their effectiveness is limited. To address\nthis, we propose a novel testing method for LLM-based software within AORTA\ncalled Adaptive Beam Search. ABS is tailored for the expansive feature space of\nLLMs and improves testing effectiveness through an adaptive beam width and the\ncapability for backtracking. We successfully embed 18 test methods in the\ndesigned framework AORTA and compared the test validity of ABS with three\ndatasets and five threat models. ABS facilitates a more comprehensive and\naccurate robustness assessment before software deployment, with an average test\nsuccess rate of 86.138%. Compared to the currently best-performing baseline\nPWWS, ABS significantly reduces the computational overhead by up to 3441.895\nseconds per successful test case and decreases the number of queries by 218.762\ntimes on average. Furthermore, test cases generated by ABS exhibit greater\nnaturalness and transferability.",

The update rule in the\nstandard RL states that the TD error is linearly proportional to the degree of\nupdates, treating all rewards equally without no bias. On the other hand, the\nrecent biological studies revealed that there are nonlinearities in the TD\nerror and the degree of updates, biasing policies optimistic or pessimistic.\nSuch biases in learning due to nonlinearities are expected to be useful and\nintentionally leftover features in biological learning. Therefore, this\nresearch explores a theoretical framework that can leverage the nonlinearity\nbetween the degree of the update and TD errors. To this end, we focus on a\ncontrol as inference framework, since it is known as a generalized formulation\nencompassing various RL and optimal control methods. In particular, we\ninvestigate the uncomputable nonlinear term needed to be approximately excluded\nin the derivation of the standard RL from control as inference. By analyzing\nit, Weber-Fechner law (WFL) is found, namely, perception (a.k.a. the degree of\nupdates) in response to stimulus change (a.k.a. TD error) is attenuated by\nincrease in the stimulus intensity (a.k.a. the value function). To numerically\nreveal the utilities of WFL on RL, we then propose a practical implementation\nusing a reward-punishment framework and modifying the definition of optimality.\nAnalysis of this implementation reveals that two utilities can be expected i)\nto increase rewards to a certain level early, and ii) to sufficiently suppress\npunishment. We finally investigate and discuss the expected utilities through\nsimulations and robot experiments. As a result, the proposed RL algorithm with\nWFL shows the expected utilities that accelerate the reward-maximizing startup\nand continue to suppress punishments during learning.",

Considering the pretrained reward model may generate\nincorrect labels for unlabeled data, we design an uncertainty-aware mechanism\nto ensure the performance of reward model, where only high confidence and low\nvariance data are selected. Moreover, we provide the generalization bound of\nreward model to analyze the factors influencing reward accuracy, and\ndemonstrate that the policy learned by LEASE has theoretical improvement\nguarantee. The developed theory is based on state-action pair, which can be\neasily combined with other offline algorithms. The experimental results show\nthat LEASE can achieve comparable performance to baseline under fewer\npreference data without online interaction.",

    "abstract": "As quantum chips scale up for large-scale computation, hardware defects\nbecome inevitable and must be carefully addressed. In this work, we introduce\nHalma, a defect mitigation technique empowered by an expanded native gate set\nthat incorporates the iSWAP gate alongside the conventional CNOT gate, both\ncommonly available on many superconducting processors. Halma effectively\nmitigates ancilla qubit defects during surface code stabilizer measurements,\nenhancing the robustness and reliability of quantum computation.\n  Halma introduces zero reduction in the spacelike distance of the code,\nleading to effective preservation of encoded logical information. Meanwhile, it\ndoes not further sacrifice the timelike distance, which enables efficient\nlogical operations on surface code patches. Under a realistic physical noise\nlevel of $10^{-3}$, Halma achieves a logical error rate that is only\n$\\sim1.5\\times$ that of the defect-free code when handling a single ancilla\nqubit defect on a small-distance surface code. In comparison to previous\ndefect-handling methods, Halma provides a $\\sim10\\times$ improvement in the\naverage logical error rate of distance-11 surface codes with a defect rate of\n2%, and a $\\sim3\\times$ reduction in the teraquop footprint, that is, the\nnumber of physical qubits required to reach a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$.\nGenerally speaking, Halma can be viewed as an additional equipment in the\ntoolbox of defect mitigation, or an upgrade patch, as it is directly compatible\nwith most of the existing superstabilizer-based approaches in handling data\nqubit defects and defect clusters.\n  Halma not only significantly eases the near-term realization of\nfault-tolerant quantum computing on hardware with fabrication defects, but also\nexemplifies how leveraging intrinsic hardware capabilities can enhance quantum\nhardware performance, particularly in the context of quantum error correction.",

Hence, to assist in tasks\ninvolving deformable objects, taxonomies need to capture more comprehensively\nthe interactions inherent in deformable object manipulation. To this end, we\nintroduce T-DOM, a taxonomy that analyses key aspects involved in the\nmanipulation of deformable objects, such as robot motion, forces, prehensile\nand non-prehensile interactions and, for the first time, a detailed\nclassification of object deformations. To evaluate T-DOM, we curate a dataset\nof ten tasks involving a variety of deformable objects, such as garments,\nropes, and surgical gloves, as well as diverse types of deformations. We\nanalyse the proposed tasks comparing the T-DOM taxonomy with previous well\nestablished manipulation taxonomies. Our analysis demonstrates that T-DOM can\neffectively distinguish between manipulation skills that were not identified in\nother taxonomies, across different deformable objects and manipulation actions,\noffering new categories to characterize a skill.

To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted\nReasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global\nplanning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA\noperates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global\nplanning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding\nmodel, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers. Unlike existing KGQA\nmethods, KARPA avoids stepwise traversal, requires no additional training, and\nis adaptable to various LLM architectures.

Speckle interferometric observations at the 2.5 meter\ntelescope of SAI MSU observatory were combined with Gaia data, enabling the\nidentification of 61 resolved binary or multiple systems within the 0.04 - 10\narcsec (5 - 1350 au) separation range. With speckle observations, we discovered\n21 components in 20 systems. The existence of a Merope (23 Tau) companion is\nconfirmed after several previous unsuccessful attempts. We show that the Gaia\nmultipeak fraction is a strong predictor of subarcsecond multiplicity, as all\nsources with ipd_frac_multi_peak > 4% are successfully resolved. We found that\n10% of Pleiades stars have a companion with a mass ratio q > 0.5 within\nprojected separation of 27 < s < 1350 au, and confirm a deficit of wide\nbinaries with s > 300 au. An observed dearth of wide pairs with large mass\nratio (q > 0.55) may imprint the transition from hard to soft binaries regime\nat the early stages of cluster evolution. The total binary fraction for q > 0.5\nsystems is extrapolated to be around 25%.",

The computation of the cost\nfunction and its derivatives, coupled with their effective utilization,\nfacilitates faster convergence by enabling smooth navigation through complex\nlandscapes, ensuring the algorithm's success in addressing challenging\nvariational problems. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization\nmethodology that conceptualizes the parameterized quantum circuit as a weighted\nsum of distinct unitary operators, enabling the cost function to be expressed\nas a sum of multiple terms. This representation facilitates the efficient\nevaluation of nonlocal characteristics of cost functions, as well as their\narbitrary derivatives. The optimization protocol then utilizes the nonlocal\ninformation on the cost function to facilitate a more efficient navigation\nprocess, ultimately enhancing the performance in the pursuit of optimal\nsolutions. We utilize this methodology for two distinct cost functions. The\nfirst is the squared residual of the variational state relative to a target\nstate, which is subsequently employed to examine the nonlinear dynamics of\nfluid configurations governed by the one-dimensional Burgers' equation. The\nsecond cost function is the expectation value of an observable, which is later\nutilized to approximate the ground state of the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. Our findings reveal substantial enhancements in convergence speed and\naccuracy relative to traditional optimization methods, even within complex,\nhigh-dimensional landscapes.

In\nthis study, we introduce a new approach that models video-text as game players\nusing multivariate cooperative game theory to handle uncertainty during\nfine-grained semantic interactions with diverse granularity, flexible\ncombination, and vague intensity. Specifically, we design the Hierarchical\nBanzhaf Interaction to simulate the fine-grained correspondence between video\nclips and textual words from hierarchical perspectives. Furthermore, to\nmitigate the bias in calculations within Banzhaf Interaction, we propose\nreconstructing the representation through a fusion of single-modal and\ncross-modal components. This reconstructed representation ensures fine\ngranularity comparable to that of the single-modal representation, while also\npreserving the adaptive encoding characteristics of cross-modal representation.\nAdditionally, we extend our original structure into a flexible encoder-decoder\nframework, enabling the model to adapt to various downstream tasks.

To test the internal consistency of this\nproposal, we analyze the phi4 kink in (1+1) dimensions, an established\ntopological defect with a well-known oscillation spectrum. We introduce an\nemergent gravitational term, h00(x), regulated by a coupling parameter G, under\na linearized regime valid up to G = 0.02. Using numerical methods, including\nthe shooting method and fine-tuning in Mathematica, we solve for both h00(x)\nand kink fluctuations, evaluating the fundamental eigenvalue omega^2. Our\nresults show that, for G <= 0.02, omega^2 remains very close to 1.0, virtually\nunchanged from the case without gravity. This indicates that the adopted\nemergent gravity does not break the topological stability of the phi4 kink,\ndemonstrating the initial robustness of the theory. We discuss the implications\nof these findings, connections to other emergent gravity approaches, and\nextensions to nonlinear regimes, higher-dimensional frameworks, and time\nquantization.

We highlight that symmetry-controlled chiral\nresponse provides an additional degree of freedom in optical signal processing,\nand showcase this with simultaneous mid-IR image encoding in two fundamental\nquantities, transmission and circular dichroism. Our proposed concept\nrepresents a universal toolkit for on-demand design and control of chiral\nmetastructures that has potential for numerous applications in life sciences,\nquantum optics and more.",

    "abstract": "Customized processors are attractive solutions for vast domain-specific\napplications due to their high energy efficiency. However, designing a\nprocessor in traditional flows is time-consuming and expensive. To address\nthis, researchers have explored methods including the use of agile development\ntools like Chisel or SpinalHDL, high-level synthesis (HLS) from programming\nlanguages like C or SystemC, and more recently, leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs) to generate hardware description language (HDL) code from natural\nlanguage descriptions. However, each method has limitations in terms of\nexpressiveness, correctness, and performance, leading to a persistent\ncontradiction between the level of automation and the effectiveness of the\ndesign. Overall, how to automatically design highly efficient and practical\nprocessors with minimal human effort remains a challenge.\n  In this paper, we propose AGON, a novel framework designed to leverage LLMs\nfor the efficient design of out-of-order (OoO) customized processors with\nminimal human effort. Central to AGON is the nano-operator function (nOP\nfunction) based Intermediate Representation (IR), which bridges high-level\ndescriptions and hardware implementations while decoupling functionality from\nperformance optimization, thereby providing an automatic design framework that\nis expressive and efficient, has correctness guarantees, and enables PPA\n(Power, Performance, and Area) optimization.\n  Experimental results show that superior to previous LLM-assisted automatic\ndesign flows, AGON facilitates designing a series of customized OoO processors\nthat achieve on average 2.35 $\\times$ speedup compared with BOOM, a\ngeneral-purpose CPU designed by experts, with minimal design effort.",

Still, like other search\nmethods, embedding-based retrieval may be susceptible to search-engine\noptimization (SEO) attacks, where adversaries promote malicious content by\nintroducing adversarial passages to corpora. To faithfully assess and gain\ninsights into the susceptibility of such systems to SEO, this work proposes the\nGASLITE attack, a mathematically principled gradient-based search method for\ngenerating adversarial passages without relying on the corpus content or\nmodifying the model. Notably, GASLITE's passages (1) carry adversary-chosen\ninformation while (2) achieving high retrieval ranking for a selected query\ndistribution when inserted to corpora. We use GASLITE to extensively evaluate\nretrievers' robustness, testing nine advanced models under varied threat\nmodels, while focusing on realistic adversaries targeting queries on a specific\nconcept (e.g., a public figure).

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a novel generative artificial intelligence (GAI)\nempowered multi-user semantic communication system called semantic feature\nmultiple access (SFMA) for video transmission, which comprises a base station\n(BS) and paired users. The BS generates and combines semantic information of\nseveral frames simultaneously requested by paired users into a single signal.\nUsers recover their frames from this combined signal and input the recovered\nframes into a GAI-based video frame interpolation model to generate the\nintermediate frame. To optimize transmission rates and temporal gaps between\nsimultaneously transmitted frames, we formulate an optimization problem to\nmaximize the system sum rate while minimizing temporal gaps. Since the standard\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) equation does not accurately\ncapture the performance of our semantic communication system, we introduce a\nweight parameter into the SINR equation to better represent the system's\nperformance. Due to its dependence on transmit power, we propose a three-step\nsolution. First, we develop a user pairing algorithm that pairs two users with\nthe highest preference value, a weighted combination of semantic transmission\nrate and temporal gap. Second, we optimize inter-group power allocation by\nformulating an optimization problem that allocates proper transmit power across\nall user groups to maximize system sum rates while satisfying each user's\nminimum rate requirement. Third, we address intra-group power allocation to\nenhance each user's performance.

    "abstract": "Influence maximization in temporal social networks presents unique challenges\ndue to the dynamic interactions that evolve over time. Traditional diffusion\nmodels often fall short in capturing the real-world complexities of\nactive-inactive transitions among nodes, obscuring the true behavior of\ninfluence spread. In dynamic networks, nodes do not simply transition to an\nactive state once; rather, they can oscillate between active and inactive\nstates, with the potential for reactivation and reinforcement over time. This\nreactivation allows previously influenced nodes to regain influence potency,\nenhancing their ability to spread influence to others and amplifying the\noverall diffusion process. Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the\ncumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any\neffective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the\nContinuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and\nRe-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive\ntransitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more\npotent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular\nand monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed\nselection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an\nefficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of\nevolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our\nmodel and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and\nenhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse\ndatasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline\nmethods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal\nnetworks",

It is found that the introduction of gamma can completely reverse\nthe concurrence distribution between odd and even bonds. Under CBC, the\ngeneration of the interleg concurrence is inhibited when gamma=0, and the\nintroduction of gamma can cause interleg concurrence between chains 1 and 3, in\nwhich the behavior is more complicated due to the competition between CBC and\ngamma. Additionally, we find that gamma induces two types of long-distance\nentanglement (LDE) in the system under OBC: intraleg LDE and inter-leg one.\nWhen the system size is sufficiently large, both types of LDE reach similar\nstrength and stabilize at a constant value. The study indicates that the\nthree-leg ladder makes it easier to generate LDE compared with the two-leg\nsystem. However, the generation of LDE is inhibited under CBC which the spin\nfrustration exists. In addition, the calculated results of energy, entanglement\nentropy and concurrence all show that there are essential relations between\nthese quantities and phase transitions of the system.

    "abstract": "Tissue semantic segmentation is one of the key tasks in computational\npathology. To avoid the expensive and laborious acquisition of pixel-level\nannotations, a wide range of studies attempt to adopt the class activation map\n(CAM), a weakly-supervised learning scheme, to achieve pixel-level tissue\nsegmentation. However, CAM-based methods are prone to suffer from\nunder-activation and over-activation issues, leading to poor segmentation\nperformance. To address this problem, we propose a novel weakly-supervised\nsemantic segmentation framework for histopathological images based on\nimage-mixing synthesis and consistency regularization, dubbed HisynSeg.\nSpecifically, synthesized histopathological images with pixel-level masks are\ngenerated for fully-supervised model training, where two synthesis strategies\nare proposed based on Mosaic transformation and B\\'ezier mask generation.\nBesides, an image filtering module is developed to guarantee the authenticity\nof the synthesized images. In order to further avoid the model overfitting to\nthe occasional synthesis artifacts, we additionally propose a novel\nself-supervised consistency regularization, which enables the real images\nwithout segmentation masks to supervise the training of the segmentation model.\nBy integrating the proposed techniques, the HisynSeg framework successfully\ntransforms the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation problem into a\nfully-supervised one, greatly improving the segmentation accuracy. Experimental\nresults on three datasets prove that the proposed method achieves a\nstate-of-the-art performance. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Vison307/HisynSeg.",

Researchers have consistently aimed to leverage LiDAR's\nprecise spatial information to enhance camera-based detectors through methods\nlike depth supervision and bird-eye-view (BEV) feature distillation. However,\nexisting approaches often face challenges due to the inherent differences\nbetween LiDAR and camera data representations. In this paper, we introduce the\nTiGDistill-BEV, a novel approach that effectively bridges this gap by\nleveraging the strengths of both sensors. Our method distills knowledge from\ndiverse modalities(e.g., LiDAR) as the teacher model to a camera-based student\ndetector, utilizing the Target Inner-Geometry learning scheme to enhance\ncamera-based BEV detectors through both depth and BEV features by leveraging\ndiverse modalities. Specially, we propose two key modules: an inner-depth\nsupervision module to learn the low-level relative depth relations within\nobjects which equips detectors with a deeper understanding of object-level\nspatial structures, and an inner-feature BEV distillation module to transfer\nhigh-level semantics of different key points within foreground targets. To\nfurther alleviate the domain gap, we incorporate both inter-channel and\ninter-keypoint distillation to model feature similarity. Extensive experiments\non the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that TiGDistill-BEV significantly boosts\ncamera-based only detectors achieving a state-of-the-art with 62.8% NDS and\nsurpassing previous methods by a significant margin.

However, in contrast to other primordial GW sources\nwhose signal may be modeled by simple analytic expressions, computing the GW\nsignal from cosmic strings requires the numerical evaluation of complicated\nintegral and sum expressions, which can become computationally costly in large\nparameter scans. This shortcoming motivates us to rederive the GW signal from a\nnetwork of local stable cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto approximation and\nbased on the velocity-dependent one-scale model from a \"pedestrian\"\nperspective. That is, we derive purely analytical expressions for the total GW\nspectrum, which remain exact wherever possible and whose error can be tracked\nand reduced in a controlled way in crucial situations in which we are forced to\nintroduce approximations. In this way, we obtain powerful formulas that, unlike\nexisting results in the literature, are valid across the entire frequency\nspectrum and across the entire conceivable range of cosmic-string tensions. We\nprovide an in-depth discussion of the GW spectra thus obtained, including their\ncharacteristic break frequencies and approximate power-law behaviors, comment\non the effect of changes in the effective number of degrees of freedom during\nradiation domination, and conclude with a concise summary of our main formulas\nthat can readily be used in future studies.",

In this\npaper, we firstly propose an ILDiff method to generate animated transparent\nchannels through implicit layout distillation, which solves the problems of\nsemi-open area collapse and no consideration of temporal information in\nexisting methods. Secondly, we create the Transparent Animated Sticker Dataset\n(TASD), which contains 0.32M high-quality samples with transparent channel, to\nprovide data support for related fields.

    "abstract": "Generative AIBIM, a successful structural design pipeline, has proven its\nability to intelligently generate high-quality, diverse, and creative shear\nwall designs that are tailored to specific physical conditions. However, the\ncurrent module of Generative AIBIM that generates designs, known as the\nphysics-based conditional diffusion model (PCDM), necessitates 1000 iterations\nfor each generation due to its reliance on the denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic model (DDPM) sampling process. This leads to a time-consuming and\ncomputationally demanding generation process. To address this issue, this study\nintroduces the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), an accelerated\ngeneration method that replaces the DDPM sampling process in PCDM. While the\noriginal DDIM was designed for DDPM and the optimization process of PCDM\ndiffers from that of DDPM, this paper designs \"DDIM sampling for PCDM,\" which\nmodifies the original DDIM formulations to adapt to the optimization process of\nPCDM. Experimental results demonstrate that DDIM sampling for PCDM can\naccelerate the generation process of the original PCDM by a factor of 100 while\nmaintaining the same visual quality in the generated results. This study\neffectively showcases the effectiveness of DDIM sampling for PCDM in expediting\nintelligent structural design. Furthermore, this paper reorganizes the contents\nof DDIM, focusing on the practical usage of DDIM. This change is particularly\nmeaningful for researchers who may not possess a strong background in machine\nlearning theory but are interested in utilizing the tool effectively.",

    "abstract": "Superconductivity has been investigated for over a century, but there are\nstill open questions about what determines the critical current; the maximum\ncurrent a superconductor can carry before switching to its normal state. For a\ngiven superconductor, the zero-field critical current is widely believed to be\ndetermined by its inherent properties and be related to its critical magnetic\nfield. Here, by studying superconducting polycrystalline films, single crystal\nflakes, and layered heterostructures, we find that the critical current of a\nsuperconductor can vary with measurement configuration. It can be influenced,\nor even determined, by adjacent superconducting segments along the applied\ncurrent trajectory, whereas the critical magnetic field and critical\ntemperature remain unaffected. This global critical current effect both reveals\nthe need to revisit fundamental theory describing superconductivity, as well as\nimplies that superconductors can transfer critical current related properties\nto each other. We demonstrate this by designing and fabricating a simple\nsuperconducting structure that transferred a superconducting diode effect from\none segment to another segment which could not manifest the effect on its own.\nThis observation merits a reconsideration of contemporary superconducting\ncircuit design, and developing a full understanding will lead to a new paradigm\nof superconducting electronics.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present an architecture that enables the redesign of\nlarge-scale quantum circuits on quantum hardware based on the entangling\nquantum generative adversarial network (EQ-GAN). Specifically, by prepending a\nrandom quantum circuit module to the standard EQ-GAN framework, we extend its\ncapability from quantum state learning to unitary transformation learning. The\ncompleteness of this architecture is theoretically proved. Moreover, an\nefficient local random circuit is proposed, which significantly enhances the\npracticality of our architecture. For concreteness, we apply this architecture\nto three crucial applications in circuit optimization, including the\nequivalence checking of (non-) parameterized circuits, as well as the\nvariational reconstruction of quantum circuits. The feasibility of our approach\nis demonstrated by excellent results in both classical and noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware implementations. We believe our work\nwill facilitate the implementation and validation of the advantages of quantum\nalgorithms.",

This challenge is primarily due to the\ninherent modeling differences between molecules and texts: molecules operate\nunified modeling to learn chemical space, while natural language sequentially\nmodels the semantic space. Additionally, the limited availability of\nhigh-quality text-to-molecule datasets further exacerbates this challenge. To\naddress the problem, we first verified the information bias in molecular\nrepresentations from different perspectives.

As an\nenabler for multi-band transmission, channel fingerprints (CF), also known as\nthe channel knowledge map or radio environment map, are used to assist channel\nstate information (CSI) acquisition and reduce computational complexity. In\nthis paper, we propose CF-CGN (Channel Fingerprints with Cycle-consistent\nGenerative Networks) to extrapolate CF for multi-band massive MIMO transmission\nwhere licensed and unlicensed spectra cooperate to provide ubiquitous\nconnectivity. Specifically, we first model CF as a multichannel image and\ntransform the extrapolation problem into an image translation task, which\nconverts CF from one frequency to another by exploring the shared\ncharacteristics of statistical CSI in the beam domain. Then, paired generative\nnetworks are designed and coupled by variable-weight cycle consistency losses\nto fit the reciprocal relationship at different bands. Matched with the coupled\nnetworks, a joint training strategy is developed accordingly, supporting\nsynchronous optimization of all trainable parameters. During the inference\nprocess, we also introduce a refining scheme to improve the extrapolation\naccuracy based on the resolution of CF. Numerical results illustrate that our\nproposed CF-CGN can achieve bidirectional extrapolation with an error of 5-17\ndB lower than the benchmarks in different communication scenarios,\ndemonstrating its excellent generalization ability.

This task can be applied for cameras and LiDAR\nsensors, but there has been a limited focus on combining both sensors to\nenhance image panoptic segmentation (PS). Although previous research has\nacknowledged the benefit of 3D data on camera-based scene perception, no\nspecific study has explored the influence of 3D data on image and video\npanoptic segmentation (VPS).This work seeks to introduce a feature fusion\nmodule that enhances PS and VPS by fusing LiDAR and image data for autonomous\nvehicles. We also illustrate that, in addition to this fusion, our proposed\nmodel, which utilizes two simple modifications, can further deliver even more\nhigh-quality VPS without being trained on video data. The results demonstrate a\nsubstantial improvement in both the image and video panoptic segmentation\nevaluation metrics by up to 5 points.",

Inspired greatly by the elegance of the counting problems along\nwith the very striking results of Bhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their\ncollaborators in arithmetic statistics and by an interesting point-counting\nresult of Narkiewicz on rational periodic points of $\\varphi_{d, c}$ for any\nodd degree $d>2$ in arithmetic dynamics, we prove that for any given prime\ninteger $p\\geq 3$, the average number of distinct integral fixed points of any\n$\\varphi_{p, c}$ modulo $p$ is 3 or 0, as $p$ tends to infinity. Moreover, we\nalso show that a density of $0\\%$ of integer polynomials $\\varphi_{p, c}(x)$\nhave three fixed points modulo $p$, as $c$ tends to infinity. Consequently, a\ndensity of $100\\%$ of integer polynomials $f(x): = x^p -x + c$ induces odd\nprime degree-$p$ number fields $K_{f}:=\\mathbb{Q}[x]\\slash (f(x))$. Since every\nnumber field $K_{f}$ comes naturally with the ring $\\mathcal{O}_{K_{f}}$ of\nintegers, applying a density result of Bhargava-Shankar-Wang on our irreducible\ninteger polynomials $f(x)$ yields that a density equal to $\\zeta(2)^{-1}$ of\nmonic polynomials $f(x)$ is such that $\\mathbb{Z}[x]\\slash (f(x))$ is the ring\n$\\mathcal{O}_{K_{f}}$ of integers. Motivated by a conjecture of Hutz on\nrational periodic points of $\\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any given prime $p\\geq 5$ in\narithmetic dynamics, we then also prove unconditionally that the average number\nof distinct integral fixed points of any $\\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is $1$\nor $2$ or $0$, as $p$ tends to infinity.

To address this issue, Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) models have been\nproposed to dynamically assign computations only to the most relevant parts of\nthe inputs, thereby enabling the deployment of large-parameter models with high\nefficiency during inference and training. These MoD models utilize a routing\nmechanism to determine which tokens should be processed by a layer, or skipped.\nHowever, conventional MoD models employ additional network layers specifically\nfor the routing which are difficult to train, and add complexity and deployment\noverhead to the model. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention-based\nrouting mechanism A-MoD that leverages the existing attention map of the\npreceding layer for routing decisions within the current layer. Compared to\nstandard routing, A-MoD allows for more efficient training as it introduces no\nadditional trainable parameters and can be easily adapted from pretrained\ntransformer models. Furthermore, it can increase the performance of the MoD\nmodel. For instance, we observe up to 2% higher accuracy on ImageNet compared\nto standard routing and isoFLOP ViT baselines. Furthermore, A-MoD improves the\nMoD training convergence, leading to up to 2x faster transfer learning.",

This paper emphasizes the critical role of\ncomputational context in determining the content of neural structures. We\nintroduce four criteria - Sensitivity, Organization, Exploitation, and\nContextualization - to evaluate which neural structures are viable NCCC\ncandidates. These criteria highlight that, for neural structures to\nmeaningfully mirror phenomenal structures they have to be actively exploited\nand be able to influence behavior in a structure-preserving way. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that anatomical and causal neural structures fail to meet certain\ncriteria, whereas activation structures can, provided they are embedded within\nthe appropriate computational context. Our findings challenge both local and\nrich global structuralist theories for overlooking the content-constituting\nrole of computational context, leading to proposed NCCCs that fail to fully\naccount for conscious content. We conclude that incorporating computational\ncontext is essential for any structuralist account of consciousness, as it\ndetermines the nature of dimensions within neural activation spaces and,\nconsequently, the content of conscious experiences.",

Training with noisy\ndata is an inevitable problem in real-world anomaly detection but is seldom\ndiscussed. This paper is the first to consider fully unsupervised industrial\nanomaly detection (i.e., unsupervised AD with noisy data). To solve this\nproblem, we proposed memory-based unsupervised AD methods, SoftPatch and\nSoftPatch+, which efficiently denoise the data at the patch level. Noise\ndiscriminators are utilized to generate outlier scores for patch-level noise\nelimination before coreset construction. The scores are then stored in the\nmemory bank to soften the anomaly detection boundary. Compared with existing\nmethods, SoftPatch maintains a strong modeling ability of normal data and\nalleviates the overconfidence problem in coreset, and SoftPatch+ has more\nrobust performance which is articularly useful in real-world industrial\ninspection scenarios with high levels of noise (from 10% to 40%). Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted in diverse noise scenarios demonstrate that both\nSoftPatch and SoftPatch+ outperform the state-of-the-art AD methods on the\nMVTecAD, ViSA, and BTAD benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Due to the inherent immutability of blockchain technology, smart contract\nupdates require their deployment at new addresses rather than modifying\nexisting ones, thus fragmenting version histories and creating critical blind\nspots for analyses. Indeed, for example, this fragmentation severely hinders\nsecurity researchers ability to track vulnerability lifecycles across contract\nversions. While platforms like Etherscan provide detailed information about\nEthereum smart contracts, they lack crucial functionality to trace\npredecessor-successor relationships within smart contract lineages, preventing\nsystematic analysis of how vulnerabilities emerge, propagate, and potentially\nremain unresolved across versions.To address the challenge of tracing smart\ncontract lineages, we adopt a Design Science Research (DSR) approach and\nintroduce ContractTrace, an automated infrastructure that accurately identifies\nand links versions of smart contracts into coherent lineages. This tool enables\nthe construction of lineageSet, an up-to-date, open-source dataset specifically\ndesigned to support security research on vulnerability, defect or any other\nproperty evolution patterns in smart contracts. Through a security-focused case\nstudy we demonstrate how ContractTrace reveals previously obscured\nvulnerability life-cycles within smart contract lineages, tracking whether\ncritical security flaws persist or get resolved across versions. This\ncapability is essential for understanding vulnerability propagation patterns\nand evaluating the effectiveness of security patches in blockchain\nenvironments. In the evaluation phase of our DSR approach, we validated our\nlineage detection methodology against an alternative approach using\nLocality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to cluster contract versions, confirming the\nsecurity relevance and accuracy of our technique.",

While interferometers like LOFAR, MWA,\nHERA, and SKA focus on detecting the 21cm power spectrum, single-dish\nexperiments such as EDGES target the global signal. Our method utilizes ANNs to\nestablish a connection between these two observables, providing a means to\ncross-validate independent 21cm line observations. This capability is\nsignificant as it allows different observational approaches to verify each\nother's results, ensuring greater reliability in 21cm cosmology. We demonstrate\nthat our ANN-based approach can accurately recover the 21cm global signal\nacross a wide redshift range (z=7.5-35) from simulated data, even when\nrealistic thermal noise levels, such as those expected from SKA-1, are\nconsidered.

We evaluate these\nstrategies, using (i) an emulated setup of a fleet of over 80 drones supporting\nover 25 VIPs, with real DNN models executing on pre-recorded drone video\nstreams, using Jetson Nano edges and AWS Lambda cloud functions, and (ii) a\nreal-world setup of a Tello drone and a Jetson Orin Nano edge generating drone\ncommands to follow a VIP in real-time.

Since the shell contraction is a\ncontinuous process, at each instant of time there is a nonzero dark matter\ndensity at the halo center. This density is determined by the influence of the\ntidal gravitational forces from inflationary density perturbations and from\nother primordial black holes. The scattering of dark matter particles by a pair\nof black holes leads to a loss of the energy of its orbital motion and to an\naccelerated pair merger.

In 1989\nNicolas Gisin proved a powerful no-go theorem, according to which nonlinear\nquantum dynamics would lead to superluminal signalling, violating Einstein's\ncausality. Here we analyse the theorem from the perspective of recent\ndevelopments. First, we observe that it harmonises with the no-restriction\nhypothesis from General Probabilistic Theories. Second, we note that it\nrequires a suitable synchronisation of Alice's and Bob's clocks and actions.\nNext, we argue that it does not automatically exclude the possibility of global\nnonlinear quantum dynamics on a tensor product Hilbert space. Consequently, we\ninvestigate a class of such dynamics inspired by discrete analogues of\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations. We show that, in general, they exhibit a\nchaotic character. In this context we inspect whether superluminal signalling\ncan be avoided by relaxing the no-restriction hypothesis. We study three\npossible communication protocols involving either local measurements or\nmodifications of a local Hamiltonian. We conclude that, in general, in all\nthree cases, two spacelike separated parties can effectuate statistical\nsuperluminal information transfer. Nevertheless, we show an example of a\nnonlocal nonlinear quantum dynamics, which does not allow for it, provided that\nwe relax the no-restriction hypothesis.",

The primary difficulty in this context is that the\ntreatment assignment is deterministically defined by the running variable,\nviolating the commonly assumed positivity assumption. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel framework for identifying the average causal effect in\nregression discontinuity designs. Our approach assumes the existence of an\nauxiliary variable for which the running variable can be seen as a surrogate,\nand an additional dataset that consists of the running variable and the\nauxiliary variable alongside the traditional regression discontinuity design\nsetup.

Asymptotically\nvalid inference procedures are also provided.

    "abstract": "We present a re-discovery of G278.94+1.35 as possibly one of the largest\nknown Galactic supernova remnants (SNR) - that we name Diprotodon. While\npreviously established as a Galactic SNR, Diprotodon is visible in our new EMU\nand GLEAM radio continuum images at an angular size of 3.33x3.23 deg, much\nlarger than previously measured. At the previously suggested distance of 2.7\nkpc, this implies a diameter of 157x152 pc. This size would qualify Diprotodon\nas the largest known SNR and pushes our estimates of SNR sizes to the upper\nlimits. We investigate the environment in which the SNR is located and examine\nvarious scenarios that might explain such a large and relatively bright SNR\nappearance. We find that Diprotodon is most likely at a much closer distance of\n$\\sim$1 kpc, implying its diameter is 58x56 pc and it is in the radiative\nevolutionary phase. We also present a new Fermi-LAT data analysis that confirms\nthe angular extent of the SNR in gamma-rays. The origin of the high-energy\nemission remains somewhat puzzling, and the scenarios we explore reveal new\npuzzles, given this unexpected and unique observation of a seemingly evolved\nSNR having a hard GeV spectrum with no breaks. We explore both leptonic and\nhadronic scenarios, as well as the possibility that the high-energy emission\narises from the leftover particle population of a historic pulsar wind nebula.",

To solve this, we present ReFlow6D, a novel method for\ntransparent object 6D pose estimation that harnesses the\nrefractive-intermediate representation. Unlike conventional approaches, our\nmethod leverages a feature space impervious to changes in RGB image space and\nindependent of depth information. Drawing inspiration from image matting, we\nmodel the deformation of the light path through transparent objects, yielding a\nunique object-specific intermediate representation guided by light refraction\nthat is independent of the environment in which objects are observed. By\nintegrating these intermediate features into the pose estimation network, we\nshow that ReFlow6D achieves precise 6D pose estimation of transparent objects,\nusing only RGB images as input.

Empirical evaluations show that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TOD and Trans32K-6D\ndatasets.

We also find its relation to the\nnon-closure of the Lie transport of the spinor field around a loop. We discuss\nvarious algebras formed by these operators and constrain the test functions by\nthe requirement of eliminating the non-local terms and satisfying the Jacobi\nidentities. Furthermore, we explore their $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric\nextension in the Wess-Zumino model. There are four kinds of quantum flux\noperators, which correspond to the supertranslation, superrotation,\nsuperduality and supersymmetry, respectively.

The impact of\nrow redundancy and rank deficiency in the dual code's minimum-weight codewords\non decoding performance is analyzed. To improve convergence, three random\nautomorphisms are applied simultaneously to the inputs, with the resulting\nmessages merged at the end of each iteration.

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of mobile edge computing (MEC) has introduced significant\nchallenges in optimizing resource allocation in highly dynamic wireless\ncommunication systems, in which task offloading decisions should be made in\nreal-time. However, existing resource allocation strategies cannot well adapt\nto the dynamic and heterogeneous characteristics of MEC systems, since they are\nshort of scalability, context-awareness, and interpretability. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method\nto improve the performance of MEC systems. Specifically, a latency minimization\nproblem is first proposed to jointly optimize the data offloading ratio,\ntransmit power allocation, and computing resource allocation. Then, an\nLLM-enabled information-retrieval mechanism is proposed to solve the problem\nefficiently. Extensive experiments across multi-user, multi-task, and highly\ndynamic offloading scenarios show that the proposed method consistently reduces\nlatency compared to several DL-based approaches, achieving 57% improvement\nunder varying user computing ability, 86% with different servers, 30% under\ndistinct transmit powers, and 42% for varying data volumes. These results show\nthe effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions to solve the resource allocation\nproblems in MEC systems.",

For this purpose, we introduce an observable that we call the\noverlap ratio $\\Omega(t)$, whose average is the probability that a particle\nthat is on the top-$n$ list at some time will also be on the top-$n$ list after\ntime $t$. The overlap ratio is a local observable which is concentrated at the\ntop of the ranking and does not require the full ranking of all particles. It\nis simple to measure in practice. We derive an analytical formula for the\naverage overlap ratio for a system of $N$ particles in the stationary state\nthat undergo independent Brownian motion on the positive real half-axis with a\nreflecting wall at the origin and a drift towards the wall. In particular, we\nshow that for $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, the overlap ratio takes a rather simple\nform $\\langle \\Omega(t)\\rangle = {\\rm erfc}(a \\sqrt{t})$ for $n\\gg 1$ with some\nscaling parameter $a>0$.

They also present an exciting\nopportunity to explore new gravitational physics beyond the traditional\nframework of GR. Thus, investigating alternative theories of gravity in the\ncontext of superdense stars is intriguing and essential for advancing our\nunderstanding of gravitational phenomena in extreme environments.\nEnergy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG) is a modified theory of gravity that\nextends GR by including nonlinear terms involving the energy-momentum tensor\n$T_{\\mu \\nu}$. This study examines the effects of EMSG on the properties and\nbehaviour of NSs by varying the free parameter $\\alpha$. The hydrostatic\nequilibrium equations in the EMSG framework are derived and solved numerically\nto obtain mass-radius relations for soft, stiff, and intermediate equations of\nstate (EOS). Observational measurements of NS masses and radii are used to\nconstrain the fundamental-mode ($f$-mode) oscillation frequency through its\nuniversal relation with the tidal Love number and compactness. Results indicate\nthat the Stiff EOS undergoes a phase transition at the highest energy densities\nand pressures, followed by the Intermediate and Soft EOSs, highlighting the\ndistinctive characteristics of these models.

The eigenvalue problem governing\ndensity and velocity perturbations is a compressible version of Rayleigh's\nequation and involves two parameters: a flow Mach number $M$ and the\nperturbation wavenumber $k$. For an odd background velocity profile, there is a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and growth rates $\\gamma$ come in\nsymmetrically placed 4-tuples in the complex eigenplane.

Using a search algorithm based on the Fredholm\nalternative, we find that the transitions are associated to level crossings\nbetween neighboring eigenmodes. Repeated level crossings result in windows of\ninstability. For a given eigenmode, they are arranged in a zebra-like striped\npattern on the $k$-$M$ plane.

In this\npaper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the\nrole of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the\nenergy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the\npresence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited\nstates.

We\nfirstly propose a spreading-based multi-frame transmission scheme with\northogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation to mitigate the doubly\ndispersive effect in time and frequency, and then analyze the input-output\nrelationship of the system. Next, we propose a receiver structure based on\nthree modules: a linear module for identifying active devices that leverages\nthe generalized approximate message passing algorithm to eliminate inter-user\nand inter-carrier interference; a non-linear module that employs the message\npassing algorithm to jointly estimate the channel and detect the transmitted\nsymbols; and a third module that aims to exploit the three dimensional block\nchannel sparsity in the delay-Doppler-angle domain. Soft information is\nexchanged among the three modules by careful message scheduling. Furthermore,\nthe expectation-maximization algorithm is integrated to adjust phase rotation\ncaused by the fractional Doppler and to learn the hyperparameters in the\npriors. Finally, the convolutional neural network is incorporated to enhance\nthe symbol detection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\ntransmission scheme boosts the system performance, and the designed algorithms\noutperform the conventional methods significantly in terms of the device\nidentification, channel estimation, and symbol detection.",

Therefore,\nerrors in numerical results would lead to harmful consequences, especially in\nsafety-critical applications. Since only a few inputs may lead to substantial\nerrors for numerical programs, it is essential to determine whether a given\ninput could result in a significant error. Existing researchers tend to use the\nresults of high-precision programs to assess whether there is a substantial\nerror, which introduces three main challenges: difficulty of implementation,\nexistence of potential faults in the detection of numerical errors, and long\nexecution time.\n  To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named DELA. Our\napproach is based on the observation that most numerical errors stem from large\ncondition numbers in atomic operations (such as subtraction), which then\npropagate and accumulate. DELA injects small perturbations into the results of\nindividual atomic operations within the program and compares the outcomes of\nthe original program with the perturbed version to detect errors. We evaluate\nDELA with datasets from ATOMU and HSED, as well as data from a complex linear\nsystem-solving program. Experimental results demonstrate that we can detect all\nthe significant errors that were reported by prior research. DELA shows strong\nalignment with high-precision programs of ATOMU and HSED, with average Pearson\nand Spearman correlations of 0.86 and 0.61. Additionally, DELA effectively\ndetects significant errors in complex programs, achieving correlation scores of\n0.9763 and 0.8993. More importantly, in experiments with ATOMU and HSED, DELA's\nperturbed programs run within only 0.13% of the time needed by high-precision\nversions; while for the linear system-solving programs, DELA is 73.46 times\nfaster than the high-precision programs.",

    "abstract": "The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA L-class mission, is\ndesigned to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, with\noperations expected to begin in the next decade. LISA will enable studies of\nastrophysical phenomena such as massive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio\ninspirals, and compact binary systems. A key challenge in analyzing LISA's data\nis the significant laser frequency noise, which must be suppressed using\ntime-delay interferometry (TDI). Classical TDI mitigates this noise by\nalgebraically combining phase measurements taken at different times and\nspacecraft. However, data gaps caused by instrumental issues or operational\ninterruptions complicate the process. These gaps affect multiple TDI samples\ndue to the time delays inherent to the algorithm, rendering surrounding\nmeasurements unusable for parameter inference. In this paper, we apply the\nrecently proposed variant of TDI known as TDI-$\\infty$ to astrophysical\nparameter inference, focusing on the challenge posed by data gaps. TDI-$\\infty$\nframes the LISA likelihood numerically in terms of raw measurements,\nmarginalizing over laser phase noises under the assumption of infinite noise\nvariance. Additionally, TDI-$\\infty$ is set up to incorporate and cancel other\nnoise sources beyond laser noise, including optical bench motion, clock noise,\nand modulation noise, establishing it as an all-in-one TDI solution. The method\ngracefully handles measurement interruptions, removing the need to explicitly\naddress discontinuities during template matching. We integrate TDI-$\\infty$\ninto a Bayesian framework, demonstrating its superior performance in scenarios\ninvolving gaps. Compared to classical TDI, the method preserves signal\nintegrity more effectively and is particularly interesting for low-latency\napplications, where the limited amount of available data makes data gaps\nparticularly disruptive.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning underpins most current self-supervised time series\nrepresentation methods. The strategy for constructing positive and negative\nsample pairs significantly affects the final representation quality. However,\ndue to the continuous nature of time series semantics, the modeling approach of\ncontrastive learning struggles to accommodate the characteristics of time\nseries data. This results in issues such as difficulties in constructing hard\nnegative samples and the potential introduction of inappropriate biases during\npositive sample construction. Although some recent works have developed several\nscientific strategies for constructing positive and negative sample pairs with\nimproved effectiveness, they remain constrained by the contrastive learning\nframework. To fundamentally overcome the limitations of contrastive learning,\nthis paper introduces Frequency-masked Embedding Inference (FEI), a novel\nnon-contrastive method that completely eliminates the need for positive and\nnegative samples. The proposed FEI constructs 2 inference branches based on a\nprompting strategy: 1) Using frequency masking as prompts to infer the\nembedding representation of the target series with missing frequency bands in\nthe embedding space, and 2) Using the target series as prompts to infer its\nfrequency masking embedding. In this way, FEI enables continuous semantic\nrelationship modeling for time series. Experiments on 8 widely used time series\ndatasets for classification and regression tasks, using linear evaluation and\nend-to-end fine-tuning, show that FEI significantly outperforms existing\ncontrastive-based methods in terms of generalization. This study provides new\ninsights into self-supervised representation learning for time series.

In contrast, Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CFmMIMO)\ncan serve multiple clients on shared resources, boosting spectral efficiency\nand reducing latency for large-scale FL. However, clients' communication\nresource limitations can hinder the completion of the FL training.

The magnetic disconnection between\nthe turbulent low-field side (LFS) and the quiescent high-field side (HFS)\nresults in most of the heat flux reaching the DN outer targets. In NT plasmas,\nthe power load on the outer target is reduced, while it increases on the inner\ntarget, indicating a reduced in-out power asymmetry compared PT plasmas.\nFurthermore, the analysis of power load asymmetry between the upper and lower\ntargets shows that the up-down power asymmetry is mitigated in NT plasmas,\nmainly due to the reduced total power crossing the separatrix. The reduction of\ninterchange instabilities in NT plasmas also affects the blob dynamics. A\nthree-dimensional blob analysis reveals that NT plasmas feature smaller blob\nsizes and slower propagation velocities.

Without prior knowledge of a\nparticle's mass, it is especially critical to estimate its global significance.\nThe usual approach is to count the number of times a significance limit is\nexceeded in a collection of simulated Monte Carlo (MC) 'toy experiments.' To\ndemonstrate this conventional method for global significance, we performed\nsimulation studies according to a recent Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) result to\nshow its effectiveness. However, this counting method is not practical for\ncomputing large global significances. To address this problem, we developed a\nnew 'extrapolation' method to evaluate the global significance. We compared the\nglobal significance estimated by our new method with that of the conventional\napproach, and verified its feasibility and effectiveness. This method is also\napplicable for cases where only small toy MC samples are available. In this\napproach, the significance is calculated based on p-values, assuming\nsymmetrical Gaussian distributions.",

    "abstract": "Context: The C-19 stellar stream is the most metal-poor stream known to date.\nWhile its width and velocity dispersion indicate a dwarf galaxy origin, its\nmetallicity spread and abundance patterns are more similar to those of globular\nclusters (GCs). If it is indeed of GC origin, its extremely low metallicity\n([Fe/H]=-3.4, estimated from giant stars) implies that these stellar systems\ncan form out of gas that is as extremely poor in metals as this. Previously,\nonly giant stream stars were observed spectroscopically, although the majority\nof stream stars are unevolved stars. Aims: We pushed the spectroscopic\nobservations to the subgiant branch stars ($G\\approx 20$) in order to\nconsolidate the chemical and dynamical properties of C-19. Methods: We used the\nhigh-efficiency spectrograph X-shooter fed by the ESO 8.2 m VLT telescope to\nobserve 15 candidate subgiant C-19 members. The spectra were used to measure\nradial velocities and to determine chemical abundances using the \\mygi\\ code.\nResults; We developed a likelihood model that takes metallicity and radial\nvelocities into account. We conclude that 12 stars are likely members of C-19,\nwhile 3 stars (S05, S12, and S13) are likely contaminants. When these 3 stars\nare excluded, our model implies a mean metallicity $\\rm \\langle [Fe/H]\\rangle =\n-3.1\\pm 0.1$, the mean radial velocity is $\\langle v_r\\rangle = -192\\pm3$\nkms$^{-1}$, and the velocity dispersion is $\\sigma_{vr} = 5.9^{+3.6}_{-5.9}$\nkms$^{-1}$. This all agrees within errors with previous studies. The A(Mg) of a\nsample of 15 C-19 members, including 6 giant stars, shows a standard deviation\nof 0.44 dex, and the mean uncertainty on Mg is 0.25 dex. Conclusions: Our\npreferred interpretation of the current data is that C-19 is a disrupted GC. We\ncannot completely rule out the possibility that the GC could have belonged to a\ndwarf galaxy that contained more metal-rich stars, however. This scenario would\nexplain the radial velocity members at higher metallicity, as well as the width\nand velocity dispersion of the stream. In either case, a GC formed out of gas\nas poor in metals as these stars seems necessary to explain the existence of\nC-19. The possibility that no GC was associated with C-19 cannot be ruled out\neither.",

Given that hydrogen is the most abundant atom in the\nuniverse, it is particularly intriguing to investigate the decay of hydrogen\natom as a means to probe BNV interactions. In this study, for the first time,\nwe employ a robust effective field theory (EFT) approach to estimate the decay\nwidths of two-body decays of hydrogen atom into standard model particles, by\nutilizing the constraints on the EFT cutoff scale derived from conventional\nnucleon decay processes. We integrate low energy effective field theory (LEFT),\nchiral perturbation theory (ChPT), and standard model effective field theory\n(SMEFT) to formulate the decay widths in terms of the LEFT and SMEFT Wilson\ncoefficients (WCs), respectively. By applying the bounds on the WCs from\nconventional nucleon decays, we provide a conservative estimate on hydrogen BNV\ndecays. Our findings indicate that the bounds on the inverse partial widths of\nall dominant two-body decays exceed $10^{44}$ years. Among these modes, the\nleast constrained diphoton decay $\\Hy\\to \\gamma\\gamma$ might be astrophysically\ninteresting, although the monochromatic photon signal from our Sun is difficult\nto detect with current near-Earth telescopes.",

However, existing methods\nstill heavily depend on accurate camera poses for reconstruction. Although some\nrecent approaches attempt to train 3DGS models without the\nStructure-from-Motion (SfM) preprocessing from monocular video datasets, these\nmethods suffer from prolonged training times, making them impractical for many\napplications.\n  In this paper, we present an efficient framework that operates without any\ndepth or matching model.

This framework effectively addresses the\nissue of long training times. Additionally, we integrate the densification\nprocess with joint refinement and propose a coarse-to-fine frequency-aware\ndensification to reconstruct different levels of details.

Quantum\nteleportation, a process that transfers quantum states between distant\nlocations without physical transmission of the particles themselves, has\nrecently been implemented in real-world networks. This position paper explores\nthe potential of integrating quantum teleportation into federated learning\nframeworks to bolster privacy.

To quantify\nmemorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel\nmetric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image\npresentations into its calculation. Furthermore, we curate the Intra-Class\nMemorability Dataset (ICMD), comprising over 5,000 images across ten object\nclasses with their ICMscores derived from 2,000 participants' responses.\nSubsequently, we demonstrate the usefulness of ICMD by training AI models on\nthis dataset for various downstream tasks: memorability prediction, image\nrecognition, continual learning, and memorability-controlled image editing.\nSurprisingly, high-ICMscore images impair AI performance in image recognition\nand continual learning tasks, while low-ICMscore images improve outcomes in\nthese tasks. Additionally, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art image diffusion\nmodel on ICMD image pairs with and without masked semantic objects. The\ndiffusion model can successfully manipulate image elements to enhance or reduce\nmemorability.

    "abstract": "In this thesis, we make progress in two concrete directions in the vast\nlandscape of hot QCD physics. The first one is quarkonium transport inside\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP), the high temperature phase of QCD. Over the past two\ndecades it has been realized that a significant fraction of quarkonium\nsuppression in high energy heavy ion collisions comes from dynamic dissociation\nand recombination processes, instead of static screening of the interaction\npotential as originally proposed by Matsui and Satz. Our contribution is the\nformulation of the precise correlation functions in QCD at finite temperature\nthat describe the dissociation and recombination processes of heavy quarkonium\nin QGP, as well as their calculation in weakly coupled QCD and strongly coupled\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We also formulate the\nEuclidean version of these correlation functions so that they may be calculated\nusing Lattice QCD techniques. The second contribution we make is the\ndevelopment of tools to understand the process of hydrodynamization in QCD\nkinetic theory and their application to a simplified description where only a\nsubset of the QCD scattering mechanisms are included. By doing this, we learn\nthat the process of hydrodynamization in this theory, and specifically, how\nmemory of the initial condition is lost, follows the recently proposed\nAdiabatic Hydrodynamization scenario. Concretely, hydrodynamization proceeds\nthrough a sequential process in which a monotonously shrinking set of\nlow-energy states dominate the dynamics, where the opening of an energy gap\nrelative to the ground state(s) signals the start of each stage of this\nprocess. The hydrodynamic attractor is reached when only one low-energy state\nremains as the ground state, and the system approaches local thermal\nequilibrium following the adiabatic evolution of this low-energy state.",

Neural\nretrieval models, particularly dense retrieval models built with transformers\nand pretrained language models, have been popular due to their superior\nperformance. However, criticisms have also been raised on their lack of\nexplainability and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In response to these\nchallenges, we propose to improve the robustness of dense retrieval models by\nenhancing their sensitivity of fine-graned relevance signals. A model achieving\nsensitivity in this context should exhibit high variances when documents' key\npassages determining their relevance to queries have been modified, while\nmaintaining low variances for other changes in irrelevant passages. This\nsensitivity allows a dense retrieval model to produce robust results with\nrespect to attacks that try to promote documents without actually increasing\ntheir relevance. It also makes it possible to analyze which part of a document\nis actually relevant to a query, and thus improve the explainability of the\nretrieval model. Motivated by causality and counterfactual analysis, we propose\na series of counterfactual regularization methods based on game theory and\nunsupervised learning with counterfactual passages. Experiments show that, our\nmethod can extract key passages without reliance on the passage-level relevance\nannotations.

We start from the\ngeneral many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction\nand derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time\ntwo-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system\nunder study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation\nof the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in\nthe basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\\times 4$\nblock matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction\nkernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel\nreproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase\napproximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the\nfinite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the\nlatter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a\nminimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of\nemergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling\n(qPVC).

It\ndemonstrates that the orbital-free energy density functional, which is directly\nbased on the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, is not only a theoretical concept but also\na practical one for nuclear systems.",

XMRIs are formed by\nbrown dwarfs (BD) inspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH), thus\nemitting gravitational waves (GWs) inside the detection band of future\nspace-based detectors such as LISA and TianQin. Theoretical estimates suggest\nthe presence of approximately 10 XMRIs emitting detectable GWs, making them\nsome of the most promising candidates for space-based GW detectors. Our\nanalysis indicates that even if individual sources have low SNRs ($\\approx10$),\nhigh-precision parameter estimates can still be achieved by detecting multiple\nsources. In this case, the accuracy of the parameter estimates increases by\napproximately one to two orders of magnitude, at least. Moreover, by analyzing\na small sample of 400 initial conditions for XMRIs formed in the Galactic\nCenter, we estimate that almost 80\\,\\% of the detectable XMRIs orbiting\nSgrA$^\\ast$ will have eccentricities between 0.43 to 0.95 and an\n$\\mathrm{SNR}\\in [10,100]$.

    "abstract": "Based on simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model (IILM) with\nthree-flavor quarks, we compute the free energy density of the QCD vacuum as a\nfunction of the quark condensate. We then evaluate the second derivative of the\nfree energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. This\nevaluation allows us to investigate whether chiral symmetry breaking in the\nIILM occurs in an anomaly-driven way. Such a breaking pattern of chiral\nsymmetry has been proposed in a previous study to connect the QCD vacuum\nstructure with meson properties, such as the mass of the sigma meson. We also\nperform the quenched simulations, in which no dynamical quarks interact with\ninstantons. Comparing these results with the full calculations provides a\nbetter understanding of the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking in the IILM. We\nfind that in the full IILM, chiral symmetry is dynamically broken in\nanomaly-driven way, whereas in the quenched IILM, it is broken through the\nordinary mechanism. Based on these results, we suggest that chiral symmetry\nbreaking in real QCD could also occur in an anomaly-driven way. Consequently,\nin phenomena where chiral symmetry breaking plays a crucial role, the anomaly\neffect may also have significant influence.",

We demonstrate that this\nimpossibility result can be overcome through the joint evaluation of multiple\nagents. When agents are made to engage in zero-sum competition, their incentive\nto influence the action taken is eliminated, and the principal can identify and\ntake the action they most prefer.

A key focus of recent research has been the design of\ncodebooks that strike a trade-off between achievable gain and codebook size,\nwhich directly impacts beam search time. Statistical approaches have shown\npromise by leveraging the likelihood that certain beam directions\n(equivalently, sets of phase-shifter configurations) are more probable than\nothers. Such approaches are shown to be valid for static, non-rotating\ntransmission stations such as base stations. However, for the case of user\nterminals that are constantly changing orientation, the possible phase-shifter\nconfigurations become equally probable, rendering statistical methods less\nrelevant. On the other hand, user terminals come with a large number of\npossible steering vector configurations, which can span up to six orders of\nmagnitude. Therefore, efficient solutions to reduce the codebook size (set of\npossible steering vectors) without compromising array gain are needed. We\naddress this challenge by proposing a novel and practical codebook refinement\ntechnique, aiming to reduce the codebook size while maintaining array gain\nwithin $\\gamma$ dB of the maximum achievable gain at any random orientation of\nthe user terminal. We project that a steering vector at a given angle could\neffectively cover adjacent angles with a small gain loss compared to the\nmaximum achievable gain.

The $S{\\alpha}S$\nsynaptic weight priors have power-law bell-curve tails that are thicker than\nthe thin exponential tails of Gaussian bell curves that underly ridge\nregularizers. Their tails get thicker as the $\\alpha$ parameter decreases.\nThese thicker tails model more impulsive behavior and allow for occasional\ndistant search in synaptic weight spaces of extremely high dimension. The\ngeometry of their constraint sets has a diamond shape. The shape varies from a\ncircle to a star or diamond that depends on the $\\alpha$ tail thickness and\ndispersion of the $S{\\alpha}S$ weight prior. These $S{\\alpha}S$ bell curves\nlack a closed form in general and this makes direct training computationally\nintensive. We removed this computational bottleneck by using a precomputed\nlook-up table. We tested the soft diamond regularizers with deep neural\nclassifiers on both image test sets and German-to-English language translation.\nThe image simulations used the three datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nCaltech-256. The regularizers improved the accuracy and sparsity of the\nclassifiers. We also tested with deep neural machine-translation models on the\nIWSLT-2016 Evaluation dataset for German-to-English text translation. They also\noutperformed ridge regularizers and lasso regularizers. These findings\nrecommend the sub-Cauchy $\\alpha = 0.5$ soft diamond regularizer as a\ncompetitive and sparse regularizer for large-scale machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts\nand interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and\ndelivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis. Traditional\nmethods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage\npipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and\ntextual information. In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are\nmore dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while\nignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges. To\naddress these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight\ntransformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual\nsummaries. ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit\nsemantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to\nenhance vision-to-language generative learning. By integrating ChartAdapter\nwith an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization.\nTo further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical\ntraining procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for\nchart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples. Experimental results on the\nstandard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly\noutperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating\nhigh-quality chart summaries.

A numerical study on\ndifferent types of instances of the distributionally robust facility location\nproblem demonstrates that the proposed solution algorithm (and its variants)\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Agency-Driven Labor Theory as a new theoretical\nframework for understanding human work in AI-augmented environments. While\ntraditional labor theories have focused primarily on task execution and labor\ntime, ADLT proposes that human labor value is increasingly derived from agency\n- the capacity to make informed judgments, provide strategic direction, and\ndesign operational frameworks for AI systems. The paper presents a mathematical\nframework expressing labor value as a function of agency quality, direction\neffectiveness, and outcomes, providing a quantifiable approach to analyzing\nhuman value creation in AI-augmented workplaces. Drawing on recent work in\norganizational economics and knowledge worker productivity, ADLT explains how\nhuman workers create value by orchestrating complex systems that combine human\nand artificial intelligence. The theory has significant implications for job\ndesign, compensation structures, professional development, and labor market\ndynamics. Through applications across various sectors, the paper demonstrates\nhow ADLT can guide organizations in managing the transition to AI-augmented\noperations while maximizing human value creation. The framework provides\npractical tools for policymakers and educational institutions as they prepare\nworkers for a labor market where value creation increasingly centers on agency\nand direction rather than execution.",

We focus particularly on the behavior near the strain-tuned bicritical\npoint that occurs in pristine ErTe$_3$ (x=0). Our study reveals that while Pd\nintercalation somewhat broadens the signatures of the CDW phase transitions,\nthe line of first-order transitions at which the CDW reorients as a function of\napplied strain persists in the presence of disorder and still seemingly\nterminates at a critical point. The critical point occurs at a lower\ntemperature and a lower strain compared to pristine ErTe$_3$. Similarly, the\nnematic elastoresistance of Pd$_x$ErTe$_3$, though suppressed in magnitude and\nbroadened relative to that of ErTe$_3$, has a markedly more symmetric response\naround the critical point. These observations point to disorder driving a\nreduction in the system's electronic orthorhombicity even while the material\nremains irrevocably orthorhombic due to the presence of a glide plane in the\ncrystal structure.

We utilized the deep\ndiffractive neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of\nchannels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations,\npermutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel\nsingle-focus/multi-focus, and 60-channel orbital angular momentum (OAM)\nbeam/comb generation were numerically achieved and experimentally validated\nusing a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a reflective mirror. Our strategy not\nonly provides a novel paradigm to improve metasurface capacity to super-high\nlevel with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in\noptical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.",

    "abstract": "Metamorphic testing (MT) is a simple yet effective technique to alleviate the\noracle problem in software testing. The underlying idea of MT is to test a\nsoftware system by checking whether metamorphic relations (MRs) hold among\nmultiple test inputs (including source and follow-up inputs) and the actual\noutput of their executions. Since MRs and source inputs are two essential\ncomponents of MT, considerable efforts have been made to examine the systematic\nidentification of MRs and the effective generation of source inputs, which has\ngreatly enriched the fundamental theory of MT since its invention. However, few\nstudies have investigated the test adequacy assessment issue of MT, which\nhinders the objective measurement of MT's test quality as well as the effective\nconstruction of test suites. Although in the context of traditional software\ntesting, there exist a number of test adequacy criteria that specify testing\nrequirements to constitute an adequate test from various perspectives, they are\nnot in line with MT's focus which is to test the software under testing (SUT)\nfrom the perspective of necessary properties. In this paper, we proposed a new\nset of criteria that specifies testing requirements from the perspective of\nnecessary properties satisfied by the SUT, and designed a test adequacy\nmeasurement that evaluates the degree of adequacy based on both MRs and source\ninputs. The experimental results have shown that the proposed measurement can\neffectively indicate the fault detection effectiveness of test suites, i.e.,\ntest suites with increased test adequacy usually exhibit higher effectiveness\nin fault detection. Our work made an attempt to assess the test adequacy of MT\nfrom a new perspective, and our criteria and measurement provide a new approach\nto evaluate the test quality of MT and provide guidelines for constructing\neffective test suites of MT.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across\ndiverse natural language processing tasks. However, as the model size and the\ninput sequence's length increase, the linearly increasing key-value (KV) cache\nsignificantly degrades inference throughput. Therefore, grouped-query attention\n(GQA), as an alternative to multi-head attention (MHA), has been widely\nintroduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a cost-effective method for\nconverting MHA into GQA with any compression ratio of KV heads. The key point\nof our method lies in the application of Procrustes analysis to the attention\nheads, which enhances the similarity among attention heads while preserving\ncomputational invariance, thereby improving the model's post-training\nperformance. Subsequently, we employ $\\mathit{L_0}$ regularization to prune\nredundant parameters. The model after pruning can be adapted to the standard\nGQA framework. Experimental results show that our strategy can compress up to\n87.5\\% KV heads of LLaMA2-7B model and 75\\% KV heads of Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B with\nacceptable performance degradation.

    "abstract": "Magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots are widely utilized in\nhigh-altitude inspection, welding, and cleaning tasks due to their ability to\nperform various operations against gravity on vertical or inclined walls.\nHowever, during operation, the robot may experience overturning torque caused\nby its own weight and load, which can lead to the detachment of magnetic plates\nand subsequently pose safety risks. This paper proposes an improved ICNN-LSTM\nnetwork classification method based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)\nattitude sensor data for real-time monitoring and assessment of hazardous\nstates in magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots. Firstly, a data\nacquisition strategy for attitude sensors capable of capturing minute\nvibrations is designed. Secondly, a feature extraction and classification model\ncombining an Improved Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) with a Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) network is proposed. Experimental validation\ndemonstrates that the proposed minute vibration sensing method achieves\nsignificant results, and the proposed classification model consistently\nexhibits high accuracy compared to other models.

Recently, there has been\ngrowing interest in source-free domain adaptation, a paradigm in which only a\npre-trained model, rather than the labeled source data, is provided to the\ntarget domain. Given the potential risk of source data leakage via model\ninversion attacks, this paper introduces a novel setting called black-box\ndomain adaptation, where the source model is accessible only through an API\nthat provides the predicted label along with the corresponding confidence value\nfor each query. We develop a two-step framework named $\\textbf{Pro}$totypical\n$\\textbf{D}$istillation and $\\textbf{D}$ebiased tun$\\textbf{ing}$\n($\\textbf{ProDDing}$). In the first step, ProDDing leverages both the raw\npredictions from the source model and prototypes derived from the target domain\nas teachers to distill a customized target model. In the second step, ProDDing\nkeeps fine-tuning the distilled model by penalizing logits that are biased\ntoward certain classes. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that ProDDing outperforms existing black-box domain adaptation\nmethods. Moreover, in the case of hard-label black-box domain adaptation, where\nonly predicted labels are available, ProDDing achieves significant improvements\nover these methods.

For second-generation (2G)\ndetectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, the typical duration of GW signals\nranges from $\\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ seconds to several tens of seconds due to their\noptimal sensitivities only at higher frequencies. This limited duration is\ninsufficient to provide adequate early warning and localization for potential\nGWs and their associated EM counterparts. In this paper, we investigate whether\neccentricity-induced higher harmonic modes, which enter the detector band much\nearlier than the dominant mode, can aid early detection and localization of GW\nsources using the 2G ground-based detector network. We select two typical\nevents, a GW170817-like BNS and a GW150914-like BBH, as illustrative examples.\nFor a GW170817-like BNS, we find that the eccentric case with $e_0=0.4$ at 10\nHz can achieve an SNR of 4 and the threshold SNR of 8 approximately 12 minutes\nand 5 minutes before merger, representing 4.5- and 1.5-minute improvements in\ntime-to-merger compared to the circular case, respectively.

This limitation\nstems, in part, from the message passing process, leading GNNs to overfit to\nthe limited neighborhood of annotated nodes from minority classes and impeding\nthe propagation of discriminative information throughout the entire graph.

By\ncombining these connectivity types, Uni-GNN extends the propagation of node\nembeddings beyond immediate neighbors, encompassing non-adjacent structural\nnodes and semantically similar nodes, enabling efficient diffusion of\ndiscriminative information throughout the graph. Moreover, to harness the\npotential of unlabeled nodes within the graph, we employ a balanced\npseudo-label generation mechanism that augments the pool of available labeled\nnodes from minority classes in the training set.

This review pointed to both\ntheoretical foundations and contributions (concepts and methods) and practical\ninsights, reinforcing the relevance of chaos synchronization in physics,\nbiology, engineering, social sciences, economics and communication systems. The\nstudy investigates various coupling schemes, such as unidirectional and\nbidirectional coupling, and presents stability criteria under different\nconfigurations. In a very concise way, some ongoing research carried out by the\nauthors is also indicated, using Lorenz, Rossler and hyperchaotic Rossler\nsystems, and quadratic maps as case studies with parameter values leading to\nchaotic behavior. Special attention is given to the stability of synchronized\nstates and the role of multi-stability and bifurcations, and its implications\nto loss of synchronization.

    "abstract": "How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central\nquestion in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena\nand optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above\nquestion is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level\nparticle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes.\nPrevious analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the\nparticle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the\ntime evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state\nexhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when\nthe coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a\nfinite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the\ncoupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the\ncase that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their\nvacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type\ninteraction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out\nby the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method.\nWe find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and\nis suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising\ninteraction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on\ninteracting quantum systems.",

While systems such as this can become\nincreasingly complex as more states or response types are included, new\nresearch in the application of large language models towards human-robot\ninteraction has allowed for more streamlined perception and reaction pipelines.\nLLM-selected actions and emotional expressions can help reinforce the realism\nof displayed empathy and allow for improved communication between the robot and\nuser. Beyond portraying empathy in spoken or written responses, this shows the\npossibilities of using LLMs in actuated, real world scenarios. In this work we\nextend research in LLM-driven nonverbal behavior for social robots by\nconsidering more open-ended emotional response selection leveraging new\nadvances in vision-language models, along with emotionally aligned motion and\ncolor pattern selections that strengthen conveyance of meaning and empathy.",

    "abstract": "Recently, \"visual o1\" began to enter people's vision, with expectations that\nthis slow-thinking design can solve visual reasoning tasks, especially\ngeometric math problems. However, the reality is that current LVLMs (Large\nVision Language Models) can hardly even accurately copy a geometric figure, let\nalone truly understand the complex inherent logic and spatial relationships\nwithin geometric shapes. We believe accurate copying (strong perception) is the\nfirst step to visual o1. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of \"slow\nperception\" (SP), which guides the model to gradually perceive basic point-line\ncombinations, as our humans, reconstruct complex geometric structures\nprogressively. There are two-fold stages in SP: a) perception decomposition.\nPerception is not instantaneous. In this stage, complex geometric figures are\nbroken down into basic simple units to unify geometry representation. b)\nperception flow, which acknowledges that accurately tracing a line is not an\neasy task. This stage aims to avoid \"long visual jumps\" in regressing line\nsegments by using a proposed \"perceptual ruler\" to trace each line\nstroke-by-stroke. Surprisingly, such a human-like perception manner enjoys an\ninference time scaling law -- the slower, the better. Researchers strive to\nspeed up the model's perception in the past, but we slow it down again,\nallowing the model to read the image step-by-step and carefully.",

These coils are commonly consist of a several volume\nresonators to perform bilateral breast imaging. Due to the electrically close\nlocation of volume resonators, strong inductive coupling is observed, resulting\nin the occurrence of hybrid modes. In principle, MR imaging using one of the\nhybrid modes is possible provided by the homogeneity of a B+ distribution.\nHowever, the question of influence of volume resonators coupling on wireless\ncoil transmit efficiency and receive sensitivity was not previously studied. By\nthis work, we performed study to understand this issue. The first wireless coil\nwith decoupled resonators is developed, evaluated numerically and\nexperimentally including in vivo study on healthy volunteers.
