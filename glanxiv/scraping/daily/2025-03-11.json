The proposed reconfigurable\nNeuromorphic Navigation framework adapts to the specific needs of both ground\nrobots (Turtlebot) and aerial robots (Bebop2 quadrotor), addressing the\ntask-specific design requirements (algorithms) for optimal performance across\nthe autonomous navigation stack -- Perception, Planning, and Control. We\ndemonstrate the versatility and the effectiveness of the framework through two\ncase studies: a Turtlebot performing local replanning for real-time navigation\nand a Bebop2 quadrotor navigating through moving gates.

    "abstract": "In tasks like summarization and open-book question answering (QA), Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) often encounter \"contextual hallucination\", where they\nproduce irrelevant or incorrect responses despite having access to accurate\nsource information. This typically occurs because these models tend to\nprioritize self-generated content over the input context, causing them to\ndisregard pertinent details. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel\nmethod called \"Guided Attention Map Editing\" (GAME), which dynamically adjusts\nattention maps to improve contextual relevance. During inference, GAME employs\na trained classifier to identify attention maps prone to inducing\nhallucinations and executes targeted interventions. These interventions, guided\nby gradient-informed \"edit directions'', strategically redistribute attention\nweights across various heads to effectively reduce hallucination. Comprehensive\nevaluations on challenging summarization and open-book QA tasks show that GAME\nconsistently reduces hallucinations across a variety of open-source models.\nSpecifically, GAME reduces hallucinations by 10% in the XSum summarization task\nwhile achieving a 7X speed-up in computational efficiency compared to the\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

Prior arts required tedious per-style\noptimization or time-consuming per-scene training stage and were limited to\nsmall-scale 3D scenes. FPGS efficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by\nintroducing a style-decomposed 3D feature field, which inherits AdaIN's\nfeed-forward stylization machinery, supporting arbitrary style reference\nimages. Furthermore, FPGS supports multi-reference stylization with the\nsemantic correspondence matching and local AdaIN, which adds diverse user\ncontrol for 3D scene styles. FPGS also preserves multi-view consistency by\napplying semantic matching and style transfer processes directly onto queried\nfeatures in 3D space.

Here, we report on deep X-ray observations with XMM-Newton,\nNuSTAR, and NICER, obtained at a range of X-ray flux levels. We detect a\nprominent soft excess below 2 keV; its flux is tightly correlated with that of\nboth the X-ray and UV continuum, and it persists at the lowest flux levels\ncaptured. Our Bayesian model comparison strongly favors inverse Comptonization\nas the origin of this soft excess, instead of blurred reflection. We find only\nweak reflection features, with R~0.4 assuming Compton-thick reflection. Most of\nthis reprocessing occurs at least $\\sim$800 gravitational radii (roughly three\nlight-days) from the continuum source. Relativistically broadened emission is\nweak or absent, suggesting the lack of a standard `thin disk' at small radii.\nWe confirm that the predicted broad-band emission due to Comptonization is\nroughly consistent with the observed UV--optical photometry. This implies an\noptically thick, warm ($kT_e\\sim0.3$ keV) scattering region that extends to at\nleast $\\sim10^3$ gravitational radii, reprocessing any UV thermal emission. The\nlack of a standard `thin disk' may also explain the puzzling $\\sim3$-day X-ray\nto UV delay previously measured for Mrk 590. Overall, we find that the X-ray\nspectral changes in Mrk 590 are minimal, despite substantial luminosity\nchanges. Other well-studied changing look AGN display more dramatic spectral\nevolution, e.g., disappearing continuum or soft excess.

Considering the\ndegradation behavior in the system lifecycle, these methods fail to enable DT\nmodels to predict the system responses affected by the system degradation over\ntime. To alleviate this problem, degradation models of measurable parameters\nhave been integrated into DT construction. However, identifying the degradation\nparameters relies on prior knowledge of the system and expensive experiments.\nTo mitigate those limitations, this paper proposes a lifelong update method for\nDT models to capture the effects of system degradation on system responses\nwithout any prior knowledge and expensive offline experiments on the system.\nThe core idea in the work is to represent the system degradation during the\nlifecycle as the dynamic changes of DT configurations (i.e., model parameters\nwith a fixed model structure) at all degradation stages. During the lifelong\nupdate process, an Autoencoder is adopted to reconstruct the model parameters\nof all hidden layers simultaneously, so that the latent features taking into\naccount the dependencies among hidden layers are obtained for each degradation\nstage. The dynamic behavior of latent features among successive degradation\nstages is then captured by a long short-term memory model, which enables\nprediction of the latent feature at any unseen stage. Based on the predicted\nlatent features, the model configuration at future degradation stage is\nreconstructed to determine the new DT model, which predicts the system\nresponses affected by the degradation at the same stage. The test results on\ntwo engineering datasets demonstrate that the proposed update method could\ncapture effects of system degradation on system responses during the lifecycle.",

We performed also a check of the\nGRID coverage for each burst in the $0.03 - 10$ GeV energy band on short\ntimescales, from $10$ to $10^3$ s, and on longer ones including the complete\n$\\sim$17 years AGILE/GRID archive. We then considered the famous event FRB\n200428 from the galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 as reference to extrapolate a\npossible X-ray emission in MCAL and SuperAGILE bands, from the radio energies\nof R-FRBs using the E$_{\\mathrm{X}}$/E$_{\\mathrm{radio}}$ of FRB 200428 as\nfixed parameter. We compared these energies with historical magnetar X-ray\nbursts rescaled in the same bands. Our observations set useful constraints on\nthe FRB magnetar model in particular, the MCAL ULs are currently the most\nstringent in the 0.4--30 MeV band",

A prerequisite for this claim is the existence of a\nsuperconducting gap in the nanowire device. However, to determine the presence\nof a gap, Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) relied on the so-called topological gap\nprotocol (TGP). Here, we show that the TGP can report the regions where the\n'parity readout' occurred as either gapped or gapless, depending on data\nparameters such as magnetic field range and cutter pair (junction\ntransparency). Compounding these issues are inaccuracies in the presented TGP\noutcomes, which limited investigation of reproducibility. Since these\ninconsistent outcomes demonstrate that the TGP is not a reliable diagnostic\ntool for the presence of a superconducting gap, we instead investigate the\nconductance data for the studied regions -- data that were not presented in\nNature 638, 651-655 (2025), but are in the public data repository. These\nconductance data show that the regions where 'parity readout' occurred are in\nfact highly disordered and present no clear gap in the nanowire, i.e., the\nunderlying conductance data show that these regions are indeed gapless. That\nthese regions are gapless contradicts the claim that the reported measurements\nare of the parity of a superconducting nanowire, let alone the parity of a\ntopological superconducting nanowire. Taken together, these issues mean that\nthe core findings in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) are not reliable and should be\nrevisited.",

However, it has been demonstrated through numerical simulations\nand experiments that a high degree of organization of CS could be attributed to\nthe constitution of a turbulent state. Understanding these organizational\ndynamics promises to bring valuable theoretical and applied predictions, such\nas the average lifetime of turbulent structures and understanding the role of\nCS in particulate transport.\n  The identification of CS was achieved by selecting the most energetic mode in\nthe flow direction within a specified reference shell. Furthermore, the\ntransition dynamics between the identified CS was investigated as a stochastic\nprocess, revealing a non-Markovian effect through an algebraic decay of the\ntemporal self-correlation of the identified CS. Finally, the non-Markovian\nbehavior observed between the transitions of CS was reproduced by a low-level\nMarkovian model, which takes into account the degeneracy effects in the\ndefinition of the identified CS.\n  In order to obtain an algorithm capable of simulating the quasi-static regime\nin magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) model and a\ndistance-dependent boundary condition were introduced for the lattice Boltzmann\nmethod (LBM) associated with the induction equation for MHD flows.

By integrating multi-modal transformer models with a\nmulti-agent contextual bandit algorithm, our approach utilizes ISAC sensing\ndata to improve communication performance and achieves high spectral efficiency\n(SE). Specifically, the multi-modal transformer can capture inter-modal\nrelationships, enhancing model generalization across diverse scenarios.\nExperimental evaluations on the DeepSense 6G dataset demonstrate that our model\noutperforms traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, achieving\nsuperior beam prediction accuracy and adaptability. In the single-user\nscenario, we achieve an average SE regret improvement of 49.6% as compared to\nDRL. Furthermore, we employ transfer reinforcement learning to reduce training\ntime and improve model performance in multi-user environments. In the\nmulti-user scenario, this approach enhances the average SE regret, which is a\nmeasure to demonstrate how far the learned policy is from the optimal SE\npolicy, by 19.7% compared to training from scratch, even when the latter is\ntrained 100 times longer.",

In\nthis paper, we present MultiSim, a novel approach to multi-simulation ADAS\ntesting based on a search-based testing approach that leverages an ensemble of\nsimulators to identify failure-inducing, simulator-agnostic test scenarios.\nDuring the search, each scenario is evaluated jointly on multiple simulators.\nScenarios that produce consistent results across simulators are prioritized for\nfurther exploration, while those that fail on only a subset of simulators are\ngiven less priority, as they may reflect simulator-specific issues rather than\ngeneralizable failures. Our case study, which involves testing a deep neural\nnetwork-based ADAS on different pairs of three widely used simulators,\ndemonstrates that MultiSim outperforms single-simulator testing by achieving on\naverage a higher rate of simulator-agnostic failures by 51%. Compared to a\nstate-of-the-art multi-simulator approach that combines the outcome of\nindependent test generation campaigns obtained in different simulators,\nMultiSim identifies 54% more simulator-agnostic failing tests while showing a\ncomparable validity rate.

We extended the analysis to a\nthermal ensemble of atoms, where Doppler detuning affects the velocity\ndistribution of the hydrogen atoms produced in the 2S level. We found that the\nwidth of such velocity distribution is controlled by the Rabi frequency. We\nshow that the peak velocity of the hydrogen atoms in the 2S level after STIRAP\ncan be controlled by the Ly-$\\alpha$ pulse detuning.

Although the\nstate-of-the-art methods focus on memory-efficient neural representations for\nhigh-fidelity surface generation, they often fail to produce artifact-free\nmanifolds, with artifacts arising due to noisy and sparse inputs. To address\nthis issue, we frame surface mapping as a physics-informed energy optimization\nproblem, enforcing surface smoothness by optimizing an energy functional that\npenalizes sharp surface ridges. Specifically, we propose a deep learning based\napproach that learns the signed distance field (SDF) of the surface manifold\nfrom raw LiDAR point clouds using a physics-informed loss function that\noptimizes the $L_2$-Hessian energy of the surface. Our learning framework\nincludes a hierarchical octree based input feature encoding and a multi-scale\nneural network to iteratively refine the signed distance field at different\nscales of resolution. Lastly, we introduce a test-time refinement strategy to\ncorrect topological inconsistencies and edge distortions that can arise in the\ngenerated mesh. We propose a \\texttt{CUDA}-accelerated least-squares\noptimization that locally adjusts vertex positions to enforce\nfeature-preserving smoothing.

    "abstract": "Hardware verification is crucial in modern SoC design, consuming around 70%\nof development time. SystemVerilog assertions ensure correct functionality.\nHowever, existing industrial practices rely on manual efforts for assertion\ngeneration, which becomes increasingly untenable as hardware systems become\ncomplex.

However, proprietary SOTA models like GPT-4o often generate\ninaccurate assertions and require expensive licenses, while smaller open-source\nLLMs need fine-tuning to manage HDL code complexities. To address these issues,\nwe introduce **VERT**, an open-source dataset designed to enhance SystemVerilog\nassertion generation using LLMs. VERT enables researchers in academia and\nindustry to fine-tune open-source models, outperforming larger proprietary ones\nin both accuracy and efficiency while ensuring data privacy through local\nfine-tuning and eliminating costly licenses. The dataset is curated by\nsystematically augmenting variables from open-source HDL repositories to\ngenerate synthetic code snippets paired with corresponding assertions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned models like Deepseek Coder\n6.7B and Llama 3.1 8B outperform GPT-4o, achieving up to 96.88% improvement\nover base models and 24.14% over GPT-4o on platforms including OpenTitan, CVA6,\nOpenPiton and Pulpissimo.

    "abstract": "A distributed integrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC) system offers\nsignificant cooperative gains for both sensing and communication performance.\nThese gains, however, can only be fully realized when the distributed nodes are\nperfectly synchronized, which is a challenge that remains largely unaddressed\nin current ISAC research. In this paper, we propose an over-the-air\ntime-frequency synchronization framework for the D-ISAC system, leveraging the\nreciprocity of bistatic sensing channels. This approach overcomes the\nimpractical dependency of traditional methods on a direct line-of-sight (LoS)\nlink, enabling the estimation of time offset (TO) and carrier frequency offset\n(CFO) between two ISAC nodes even in non-LoS (NLOS) scenarios. To achieve this,\nwe introduce a bistatic signal matching (BSM) technique with delay-Doppler\ndecoupling, which exploits offset reciprocity (OR) in bistatic observations.\nThis method compresses multiple sensing links into a single offset for\nestimation. We further present off-grid super-resolution estimators for TO and\nCFO, including the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the matrix pencil\n(MP) method, combined with BSM processing. These estimators provide accurate\noffset estimation compared to spectral cross-correlation techniques. Also, we\nextend the pairwise synchronization leveraging OR between two nodes to the\nsynchronization of $N$ multiple distributed nodes, referred to as centralized\npairwise synchronization. We analyze the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for TO and\nCFO estimates and evaluate the impact of D-ISAC synchronization on the\nbottom-line target localization performance. Simulation results validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm, confirm the theoretical analysis, and\ndemonstrate that the proposed synchronization approach can recover up to 96% of\nthe bottom-line target localization performance of the fully-synchronous\nD-ISAC.",

    "abstract": "Investigating critical phenomena or phase transitions is of high interest in\nphysics and chemistry, for which Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, a crucial tool\nfor numerically analyzing macroscopic properties of given systems, are often\nhindered by an emerging divergence of correlation length -- known as scale\ninvariance at criticality (SIC) in the renormalization group theory. SIC causes\nthe system to behave the same at any length scale, from which many existing\nsampling methods suffer: long-range correlations cause critical slowing down in\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and require intractably large receptive fields\nfor generative samplers. In this paper, we propose a Renormalization-informed\nGenerative Critical Sampler (RiGCS) -- a novel sampler specialized for\nnear-critical systems, where SIC is leveraged as an advantage rather than a\nnuisance. Specifically, RiGCS builds on MultiLevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with Heat\nBath (HB) algorithms, which perform ancestral sampling from low-resolution to\nhigh-resolution lattice configurations with site-wise-independent conditional\nHB sampling. Although MLMC-HB is highly efficient under exact SIC, it suffers\nfrom a low acceptance rate under slight SIC violation. Notably, SIC violation\nalways occurs in finite-size systems, and may induce long-range and\nhigher-order interactions in the renormalized distributions, which are not\nconsidered by independent HB samplers. RiGCS enhances MLMC-HB by replacing a\npart of the conditional HB sampler with generative models that capture those\nresidual interactions and improve the sampling efficiency. Our experiments show\nthat the effective sample size of RiGCS is a few orders of magnitude higher\nthan state-of-the-art generative model baselines in sampling configurations for\n128x128 two-dimensional Ising systems.",

In the second\ntopic, we study criteria for existence and extension of finitely additive\nmeasures for Boolean algebras, offering a relatively short proof of the\n\\emph{compatibility theorem} for fams.\n  Finally, we study a Riemann-type integration theory on fields of sets with\nrespect to finitely additive measures, allowing us to extend and generalize\nsome classical concepts and results from real analysis, such as Riemann\nintegration over rectangles in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and the Jordan measure. We also\ngeneralize the extension criteria for fams allowing desired values of integrals\nof a given set of functions. At the end, we explore the connection between\nintegration in fields of sets and the Lebesgue integration in the Stone space\nof the corresponding field, where we establish a characterization of\nintegrability in the sense of the Lebesgue-Vitali theorem, which follows as a\nconsequence of our results.",

The introduced framework subsumes the various existing\nrisk-sensitive models. An important and hitherto unknown observation is that\nfor a wide range of riskmetrics, the optimal bandit policy involves selecting a\nmixture of arms. This is in sharp contrast to the convention in the multi-arm\nbandit algorithms that there is generally a solitary arm that maximizes the\nutility, whether purely reward-centric or risk-sensitive. This creates a major\ndeparture from the principles for designing bandit algorithms since there are\nuncountable mixture possibilities. The contributions of the paper are as\nfollows: (i) it formalizes a general framework for risk-sensitive bandits, (ii)\nidentifies standard risk-sensitive bandit models for which solitary arm\nselections is not optimal, (iii) and designs regret-efficient algorithms whose\nsampling strategies can accurately track optimal arm mixtures (when mixture is\noptimal) or the solitary arms (when solitary is optimal). The algorithms are\nshown to achieve a regret that scales according to $O((\\log T/T )^{\\nu})$,\nwhere $T$ is the horizon, and $\\nu>0$ is a riskmetric-specific constant.",

    "abstract": "Mutual adaptation can significantly enhance overall task performance in\nhuman-robot co-transportation by integrating both the robot's and human's\nunderstanding of the environment. While human modeling helps capture humans'\nsubjective preferences, two challenges persist: (i) the uncertainty of human\npreference parameters and (ii) the need to balance adaptation strategies that\nbenefit both humans and robots. In this paper, we propose a unified framework\nto address these challenges and improve task performance through mutual\nadaptation. First, instead of relying on fixed parameters, we model a\nprobability distribution of human choices by incorporating a range of uncertain\nhuman parameters. Next, we introduce a time-varying stubbornness measure and a\ncoordination mode transition model, which allows either the robot to lead the\nteam's trajectory or, if a human's preferred path conflicts with the robot's\nplan and their stubbornness exceeds a threshold, the robot to transition to\nfollowing the human. Finally, we introduce a pose optimization strategy to\nmitigate the uncertain human behaviors when they are leading. To validate the\nframework, we design and perform experiments with real human feedback. We then\ndemonstrate, through simulations, the effectiveness of our models in enhancing\ntask performance with mutual adaptation and pose optimization.",

Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to\nstudy the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class\nof loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior\nwork [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly\nstressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric\ncompatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective\ndeformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation.\nIt also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to\nthese effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the\ntheory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via\ncorresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy\ndensity to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric\npenalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized\nelastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and\nangle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a\nfinite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty\nmethod to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the\nopen source computing platform Firedrake.

While their transition region (TR)\ncounterpart has unequivocally been established over the past decade, the\nobservations concerning the coronal contribution of spicules have often been\ncontested. This is mainly attributed to the lack of adequate coordinated\nobservations, their small spatial scales, highly dynamic nature, and complex\nmulti-thermal evolution, which are often observed at the limit of our current\nobservational facilities. Therefore, it remains unclear how much heating occurs\nin association with spicules to coronal temperatures. In this study, we use\ncoordinated high-resolution observations of the solar chromosphere, TR, and\ncorona of a quiet Sun region and a coronal hole with the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) to\ninvestigate the (lower) coronal ($\\sim$1MK) emission associated with spicules.\nWe perform differential emission measure (DEM) analysis on the AIA passbands\nusing basis pursuit and a newly developed technique based on Tikhonov\nregularization to probe the thermal structure of the spicular environment at\ncoronal temperatures.

Detailed space-time analysis of the\nchromospheric, TR, and EM maps show unambiguous evidence of rapidly outward\npropagating spicules with strong emission (2--3 times higher than the\nbackground) at 1 MK.

Beyond diagnosing these\nfailures, we explore potential mitigation strategies, such as prompt ensembling\nand reasoning-based prompting, and conduct ablation studies to examine the root\ncauses of spurious bias in MLLMs. By exposing the persistence of spurious\ncorrelations, our study calls for more rigorous evaluation methods and\nmitigation strategies to enhance the reliability of MLLMs.",

    "abstract": "Stackelberg games, widely applied in domains like economics and security,\ninvolve asymmetric interactions where a leader's strategy drives follower\nresponses. Accurately modeling these dynamics allows domain experts to optimize\nstrategies in interactive scenarios, such as turn-based sports like badminton.\nIn multi-agent systems, agent behaviors are interdependent, and traditional\nMulti-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) methods often fail to capture these\ncomplex interactions. Correlated policies, which account for opponents'\nstrategies, are essential for accurately modeling such dynamics. However, even\nmethods designed for learning correlated policies, like CoDAIL, struggle in\nStackelberg games due to their asymmetric decision-making, where leaders and\nfollowers cannot simultaneously account for each other's actions, often leading\nto non-correlated policies. Furthermore, existing MAIL methods that match\noccupancy measures or use adversarial techniques like GAIL or Inverse RL face\nscalability challenges, particularly in high-dimensional environments, and\nsuffer from unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose a\ncorrelated policy occupancy measure specifically designed for Stackelberg games\nand introduce the Latent Stackelberg Differential Network (LSDN) to match it.\nLSDN models two-agent interactions as shared latent state trajectories and uses\nmulti-output Geometric Brownian Motion (MO-GBM) to effectively capture joint\npolicies. By leveraging MO-GBM, LSDN disentangles environmental influences from\nagent-driven transitions in latent space, enabling the simultaneous learning of\ninterdependent policies. This design eliminates the need for adversarial\ntraining and simplifies the learning process. Extensive experiments on\nIterative Matrix Games and multi-agent particle environments demonstrate that\nLSDN can better reproduce complex interaction dynamics than existing MAIL\nmethods.",

In this paper, we find\nthat attention in diverse long-context tasks exhibits sparsity, and LLMs\nimplicitly \"know\" which tokens can be dropped or evicted at the head level\nafter the pre-filling stage. Based on this insight, we propose Self-Attention\nGuided Eviction~(SAGE-KV), a simple and effective KV eviction cache method for\nlong-context inference. After prefilling, our method performs a one-time top-k\nselection at both the token and head levels to compress the KV cache, enabling\nefficient inference with the reduced cache. Evaluations on LongBench and three\nlong-context LLMs (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct-128k, Llama3-8B-Prolong-512k-Instruct,\nand Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-128k) show that SAGE-KV maintains accuracy comparable\nto full attention while significantly improving efficiency.

A Taylor-Couette (TC) flow between two coaxial cylinders\nsubject to an axial magnetic field is a preferred setup for MRI-experiments. A\nmain challenge in those experiments has been to minimize the effects of axial\nboundaries, or endcaps, which substantially alter the flow structure compared\nto the axially unbounded idealized case. Understanding the influence of endcaps\non the flow stability is crucial for the unambiguous experimental\nidentification of MRI. In this paper, we examine the hydrodynamic evolution of\na TC flow in the presence of split endcap rims up to Reynolds number $Re =$\n$2\\times 10^5$. At this $Re$, the flow deviates from the ideal TC flow profile,\nresulting in about $15\\%$ deviation in angular velocity at the mid-height of\nthe cylinders. Aside from turbulent fluctuations caused by shearing instability\nat the endcaps, the bulk flow remains axially independent and exhibits Rayleigh\nstability. We characterize the scaling of the Ekman and Stewartson boundary\nlayer thickness with respect to $Re$. We also study the effect of changing the\nrotation ratio of the cylinders $\\mu$ on the flow at large $Re$ and show that\nTC experiments can be conducted for larger $\\mu \\sim 0.5$ to safely ensure the\nhydrodynamic stability of the flow in the upcoming DRESDYN-MRI experiment. In\nall configurations considered, the modification of the flow profile by the\nendcaps further decreases the required critical threshold for the onset of MRI\nthat can facilitate its detection in future experiments.",

Our results show that discriminative\nperformance across a multitude of metrices is dependent on endpoint frequency\nand predictor matrix properties, with very robust performance of (penalised)\nCOX Proportional Hazards (COX-PH) models. Of note, there are certain scenarios\nwhich favour more complex frameworks, specifically if working with larger\nnumbers of observations and relatively simple predictor matrices. The observed\ncomputational requirements were vastly different, and we provide solutions in\ncases where current implementations were impracticable. In conclusion, this\nwork delineates how optimal model choice is dependent on a variety of factors,\nincluding sample size, endpoint frequency and predictor matrix properties, thus\nconstituting an informative resource for researchers working on similar\ndatasets. Furthermore, we showcase how linear models still display a highly\neffective and scalable platform to perform risk modelling at scale and suggest\nthat those are reported alongside non-linear ML models.",

Unlike conventional guidewires\nwith pre-shaped tips, MSCRs feature a magnetic tip that actively bends under\napplied magnetic fields. Despite extensive studies in modeling and simulation,\nachieving real-time navigation control of MSCRs in confined lumens remains a\nsignificant challenge. The primary reasons are due to robot-lumen contact\ninteractions and computational limitations in modeling MSCR nonlinear behavior\nunder magnetic actuation. Existing approaches, such as Finite Element Method\n(FEM) simulations and energy-minimization techniques, suffer from high\ncomputational costs and oversimplified contact interactions, making them\nimpractical for real-world applications. In this work, we develop a real-time\nsimulation and navigation control framework that integrates hard-magnetic\nelastic rod theory, formulated within the Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG)\nframework, with an order-reduced contact handling strategy. Our approach\ncaptures large deformations and complex interactions while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency. Next, the navigation control problem is formulated as\nan inverse design task, where optimal magnetic fields are computed in real time\nby minimizing the constrained forces and enhancing navigation accuracy. We\nvalidate the proposed framework through comprehensive numerical simulations and\nexperimental studies, demonstrating its robustness, efficiency, and accuracy.\nThe results show that our method significantly reduces computational costs\nwhile maintaining high-fidelity modeling, making it feasible for real-time\ndeployment in clinical settings.",

To enhance\nthe operational performance under specific wind conditions and to validate the\naerodynamic design of flexible blades, it is crucial to obtain comprehensive\ndata on the aerodynamic behaviour of the blades in the field, such as\ntime-resolved pressure distributions, local inflow conditions and dynamic\nresponses of the blade. However, published field measurements are scarce for\nlarge-scale rotor blades due to the complex and costly installation of the\nrequisite measurement systems. In recent work, we developed a wireless and\nself-sufficient aerodynamic measurement system, named Aerosense, which is less\ncomplex and costly than conventional aerodynamic measurement systems. The\nAerosense system uses Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors to obtain\nlocal aerodynamic pressures, blade motions, and inflow conditions. In this\npaper, we demonstrate the value of Aerosense in understanding the aerodynamic\nbehaviour of rotor blades, using a 7kW wind turbine operating in the field.\nAfter a thorough calibration and correction process, we demonstrate, for\nexample, that the pressure distribution can vary significantly during one\nrotation of the blade, even under stable wind conditions. These variations are\nfound to be due to the misalignment of the wind direction with the wind\nturbine's rotational axis. We therefore conclude that the Aerosense measurement\nsystem is valuable for understanding the aerodynamic loading on rotor blades as\nwell as the influence of the inflow conditions on wind turbine performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to Dialogue State Tracking (DST) that\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate natural language\ndescriptions of dialogue states, moving beyond traditional slot-value\nrepresentations. Conventional DST methods struggle with open-domain dialogues\nand noisy inputs. Motivated by the generative capabilities of LLMs, our Natural\nLanguage DST (NL-DST) framework trains an LLM to directly synthesize\nhuman-readable state descriptions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments\non MultiWOZ 2.1 and Taskmaster-1 datasets that NL-DST significantly outperforms\nrule-based and discriminative BERT-based DST baselines, as well as generative\nslot-filling GPT-2 DST models, in both Joint Goal Accuracy and Slot Accuracy.\nAblation studies and human evaluations further validate the effectiveness of\nnatural language state generation, highlighting its robustness to noise and\nenhanced interpretability. Our findings suggest that NL-DST offers a more\nflexible, accurate, and human-understandable approach to dialogue state\ntracking, paving the way for more robust and adaptable task-oriented dialogue\nsystems.",

The rigid villi follow\nsimple harmonic axial motion, but with a phase lag to their neighbours,\nresulting in travelling intervillous contractions. We use lattice Boltzmann\nsimulations to resolve the flow around the villi and the luminal channel space,\nsampling small to moderate Womersley numbers. We analyse an emergent `mixing'\nboundary layer in the lumen, separating two distinct flow regions. A mixing\nregion is formed above the villi, characterised by semi-vortical flow patterns,\nwhich travel along with the wave. In the channel centre, unidirectional axial\nflow emerges, flowing opposite to the imposed wave direction, even in the\nStokes flow regime. This behaviour contrasts with canonical wave driven\nperistaltic flow (Jaffrin & Shapiro 1971). The fluid trapped in the\nintervillous gaps is forced to take a non-reciprocal path due to the travelling\npendular-wave, which breaks time-symmetry in the Stokes regime. We propose an\neffective velocity boundary condition, incorporating perturbations due to the\npresence of the villi. In the inertial regime, the boundary layer shrinks due\nto dynamic flow confinement arising from increased oscillatory flow inertia. We\nidentify the Stokes to inertial transition, and find phenomenological scaling\nlaws for the boundary layer decay and axial and radial fluid fluxes.

Central to our approach is a\ndomain knowledge-informed, compressed representation of high-dimensional\nspatio-temporal wind fields.

By leveraging established substitution\nmatrices, evoBPE transcends traditional frequency-based tokenization\nstrategies. The method generates candidate token pairs through biologically\ninformed mutations, evaluating them based on pairwise alignment scores and\nfrequency thresholds.

We find strong spatial variations in OAM density, with the lattice acting\nas a source and sink of OAM. Moreover, we show that the OAM response depends\nsensitively on the angle between the charge current and the crystal axis. This\nenables the generation of a transverse OAM response in one current direction\nand solely a longitudinal response in another. We refer to this as an orbital\nsplitter effect, analogous to the spin splitter effect in altermagnets.",

Lastly, we\nextend the geometric mechanics principles to multi-jet propulsion systems with\nstability considerations and validate the theory through experiments on the\nLandSalp hardware.",

    "abstract": "Thin films of aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) were synthesized\nvia reactive magnetron sputtering for Hf contents up to $x$ = 0.13. X-ray\ndiffraction showed a single $c$-axis oriented wurtzite phase for all films.\nHard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated homogeneous Al:Hf\ndistribution through the thin films and confirmed their insulating character. A\ncollection of complementary tests showed unambiguous polarization inversion,\nand thus ferroelectricity in multiple samples. Current density vs. electric\nfield hysteresis measurements showed distinct ferroelectric switching current\npeaks, the piezoelectric coefficient d$_{33,f,meas}$ measured using a double\nbeam laser interferometer (DBLI) showed a reversal in sign with similar\nmagnitude, and anisotropic wet etching confirmed field-induced polarization\ninversion. This demonstrates the possibility of using tetravalent--and not just\ntrivalent--alloying elements to enable ferroelectricity in AlN-based thin\nfilms, highlighting the compositional flexibility of ferroelectricity in\nwurtzites and greatly expanding the chemistries that can be considered for\nfuture devices.",

Ten clinicians\nparticipated in eight sessions. The analysis identified five themes: (1) AI's\ncomputational utility, (2) workflow optimization, (3) effects on patient care,\n(4) technical considerations, and (5) implementation considerations. Clinicians\nvalued the CDS system's multi-modal continuous monitoring and AI's capacity to\nprocess large volumes of data in real-time to identify patient risk factors and\nsuggest action items.

H$\\alpha$ dominates the nebular spectra, and we detect a narrow\nP-Cygni absorption within the broader emission line with an expansion velocity\nof 1100 km s$^{-1}$. Photometrically, its light curve shows a re-brightening of\n$\\sim$ 0.6 mag in the $gri$ bands starting at 25$\\pm$2 days after discovery,\nwith a secondary peak at $\\sim 73$d, followed by an abrupt and nearly linear\ndecay of 0.09 mag d$^{-1}$ for the next 35 days.

We compare ASASSN-13dn with other LSNe\nII in the literature, finding no match to both light curve and spectroscopic\nproperties.

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has one of the highest rates of\nrecurrence cases among solid malignancies. Recurrence rates can be reduced by\nimproving positive margins localization. Frozen section analysis (FSA) of\nresected specimens is the gold standard for intraoperative margin assessment.\nHowever, because of the complex 3D anatomy and the significant shrinkage of\nresected specimens, accurate margin relocation from specimen back onto the\nresection site based on FSA results remains challenging. We propose a novel\ndeformable registration framework that uses both the pre-resection upper\nsurface and the post-resection site of the specimen to incorporate thickness\ninformation into the registration process. The proposed method significantly\nimproves target registration error (TRE), demonstrating enhanced adaptability\nto thicker specimens. In tongue specimens, the proposed framework improved TRE\nby up to 33% as compared to prior deformable registration. Notably, tongue\nspecimens exhibit complex 3D anatomies and hold the highest clinical\nsignificance compared to other head and neck specimens from the buccal and\nskin. We analyzed distinct deformation behaviors in different specimens,\nhighlighting the need for tailored deformation strategies. To further aid\nintraoperative visualization, we also integrated this framework with an\naugmented reality-based auto-alignment system. The combined system can\naccurately and automatically overlay the deformed 3D specimen mesh with\npositive margin annotation onto the resection site. With a pilot study of the\nAR guided framework involving two surgeons, the integrated system improved the\nsurgeons' average target relocation error from 9.8 cm to 4.8 cm.",

In mathematical logic, \"absoluteness\" refers to the\ninvariance of the truth value of certain statements in different mathematical\nuniverses. Leveraging this idea, we investigate the conditions under which the\nRiemann integral on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ remains absolute between transitive models\nof ZFC, the standard axiomatic system in which current mathematics is usually\nformalized. To this end, we develop a framework for integration on Boolean\nalgebras with respect to finitely additive measures and show that the classical\nRiemann integral is a particular case of this generalized approach. Our main\nresult establishes that the Riemann integral over rectangles in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is absolute in the following sense: if $M \\subseteq N$ are\ntransitive models of ZFC, $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\cap M$, and $f \\colon [a,\nb] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a bounded function in $M$, then $f$ is Riemann integrable\nin $M$ if, and only if, in $N$ there exists some Riemann integrable function $g\n\\colon [a, b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ extending $f$. In this case, the values of the\nintegrals computed in each model are the same. Furthermore, the function $g$ is\nunique except for a measure zero set.",

Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)\nallows the estimation of this signal from video recordings of a person's face.\nClassical rPPG methods make use of signal processing techniques, while recent\nrPPG methods utilize deep learning networks. Methods are typically evaluated on\ndatasets collected in well-lit environments with participants at resting heart\nrates. However, little investigation has been done on how well these methods\nadapt to variations in illumination and heart rate. In this work, we\nsystematically evaluate representative state-of-the-art methods for remote\nheart rate estimation. Specifically, we evaluate four classical methods and\nfour deep learning-based rPPG estimation methods in terms of their\ngeneralization ability to changing scenarios, including low lighting conditions\nand elevated heart rates. For a thorough evaluation of existing approaches, we\ncollected a novel dataset called CHILL, which systematically varies heart rate\nand lighting conditions. The dataset consists of recordings from 45\nparticipants in four different scenarios. The video data was collected under\ntwo different lighting conditions (high and low) and normal and elevated heart\nrates. In addition, we selected two public datasets to conduct within- and\ncross-dataset evaluations of the rPPG methods. Our experimental results\nindicate that classical methods are not significantly impacted by low-light\nconditions. Meanwhile, some deep learning methods were found to be more robust\nto changes in lighting conditions but encountered challenges in estimating high\nheart rates. The cross-dataset evaluation revealed that the selected deep\nlearning methods underperformed when influencing factors such as elevated heart\nrates and low lighting conditions were not present in the training set.",

This approach is naturally feasible in mobile\nmessaging environments where voice recordings are typically preceded by textual\ndialogue that can be leveraged implicitly.

Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) refers to\nthe AI-driven process of automatically recognizing hand gestures and lip\nmovements in CS, converting them into text. However, previous work often relies\non complex fusion modules and training techniques. Additionally, due to the\nlimited amount of data in CS, the extraction of hand features, as well as\nrecognition modeling, has consistently been subpar, significantly limiting the\neffectiveness of ACSR. To address this issue, we have innovatively explored the\ncapabilities of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in recognizing hand\nshapes and positions in CS.

Wu & Fuller (2022) identify a mass\nrange for helium-core stars in which they expand significantly during core\noxygen/neon burning, resulting in extreme late-stage mass loss in tight\nbinaries ($P\\sim1-100\\,{\\rm days}$). Here we explore the resulting light curves\nfrom a subset of models from Wu & Fuller (2022) and find that in some cases\nthey can exhibit two phases of shock cooling emission (SCE). The first SCE is\nattributed to the circumbinary material, and the second SCE is from the\nextended helium-burning envelope of the exploding star. Since SCE luminosity is\nroughly proportional to the initial radius of the emitting material, events\nthat exhibit both phases of SCE provide the exciting opportunity of measuring\nboth the extent of the CSM and the radius of the exploding star. These light\ncurves are explored with both analytic arguments and numerical modeling, and\nfrom this we identify the parameter space of CSM mass, helium envelope mass,\nand nickel mass, for which the helium envelope SCE will be visible. We provide\na qualitative comparison of these models to two fast-evolving, helium-rich\ntransients, SN2019kbj and SN2019dge. The similarity between these events and\nour models demonstrates that this extreme binary mass loss mechanism may\nexplain some SNe Ibn and USSNe.",

Due to the\nduality between graphical models and tensor networks, we adapt this approach to\nprobabilistic inference in graphical models. Furthermore, we incorporate\nstructure exploitation into the process of finding an optimal order. Currently,\nthe agent's cost function is formulated in terms of intermediate result sizes\nwhich are exponential in the number of indices (i.e., random variables). We\nshow that leveraging specific structures during inference allows for\nintroducing compact encodings of intermediate results which can be\nsignificantly smaller.

We find $\\langle\nf_{\\rm esc} \\rangle = 0.126_{-0.041}^{+0.034}$ and $0.224_{-0.108}^{+0.098}$ at\n$z=5$ and $6$, and $1\\sigma$ upper limits of $f_{\\rm esc}< 0.138$ and $0.096$\nat $z=2.5$ and $4$, respectively, for $M_{\\rm UV} < -11$. Our findings are\nconsistent with prior measurements of $f_{\\rm esc} \\lesssim 10\\%$ at $z \\leq\n4$, but indicate a factor of several increase between $z = 4$ and $6$. The\nsteepness of this evolution is sensitive to the highly uncertain mean free path\nand ionising background intensity at $z>5$. Lastly, we find\n$1.10^{+0.21}_{-0.39}$ photons per H atom are emitted into the IGM between\n$z=6$ and $=5.3$. This is $\\approx 4\\times$ more than needed to complete the\nlast $20\\%$ of reionisation absent recombinations, suggesting that\nreionisation's end was likely absorption-dominated.",

The COWLS\nsample has several notable properties: (i) magnified source galaxies spanning\nredshifts $z \\sim 0.1$ to $z \\sim 9$, which therefore extend into the epoch of\nreionisation; (ii) the highest-redshift lens galaxies known, pushing galaxy\ndensity profile evolution studies beyond $z \\sim 2$; (iii) all lenses are\ndistributed within a contiguous $0.54$\\,deg$^2$ region, allowing for joint\nstrong and weak lensing analyses; and (iv) a subset exhibits lensed source\nemission ray-traced near the lens galaxy centers, enabling studies of\nsupermassive black holes and dust absorption.

Superclusters offer a unique setting to study these\nlow density environments, where weak signals make detection challenging. The\nFaraday rotation measure (RM) of polarized sources along supercluster lines of\nsight helps constrain magnetic field properties in these regions. This study\naims to determine magnetic field intensity in low density environments within\nsuperclusters using RM measurements at different frequencies. We analyzed three\nnearby (z<0.1) superclusters, Corona Borealis, Hercules, and Leo, where\npolarization observations were available at 1.4 GHz and 144 MHz. Our catalogue\nincludes 4497 polarized background sources with RM values from literature and\nunpublished 144 MHz data. We constructed 3D density cubes for each supercluster\nto estimate density at RM measurement locations. By grouping RM values into\nthree density bins (outskirts, filaments, and nodes) we examined RM variance\nlinked to mean density. We found an RM variance excess of 2.5 \\pm 0.5 rad^2\nm^{-4} between the lowest-density regions outside the supercluster and the\nlow-density filamentary regions within. This suggests an intervening magnetic\nfield in the supercluster filaments. Modeling the RM variance with a single\nscale, randomly oriented magnetic field, we constrained the line of sight\nmagnetic field to B_{//} = 19^{+50}_{-8} nG after marginalizing over reversal\nscale and path length. Our findings align with previous studies of large scale\nstructure filaments, suggesting that adiabatic compression alone (B_{||} \\sim 2\nnG) cannot fully explain the observed field strengths.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in long video understanding typically mitigate visual\nredundancy through visual token pruning based on attention distribution.\nHowever, while existing methods employ post-hoc low-response token pruning in\ndecoder layers, they overlook the input-level semantic correlation between\nvisual tokens and instructions (query). In this paper, we propose QuoTA, an\nante-hoc training-free modular that extends existing large video-language\nmodels (LVLMs) for visual token assignment based on query-oriented frame-level\nimportance assessment. The query-oriented token selection is crucial as it\naligns visual processing with task-specific requirements, optimizing token\nbudget utilization while preserving semantically relevant content.\nSpecifically, (i) QuoTA strategically allocates frame-level importance scores\nbased on query relevance, enabling one-time visual token assignment before\ncross-modal interactions in decoder layers, (ii) we decouple the query through\nChain-of-Thoughts reasoning to facilitate more precise LVLM-based frame\nimportance scoring, and (iii) QuoTA offers a plug-and-play functionality that\nextends to existing LVLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that\nimplementing QuoTA with LLaVA-Video-7B yields an average performance\nimprovement of 3.2% across six benchmarks (including Video-MME and MLVU) while\noperating within an identical visual token budget as the baseline.

Current approaches to evaluating cultural alignment\nthrough survey-based assessments that borrow from social science methodologies\noften overlook systematic robustness checks. Here, we identify and test three\nassumptions behind current survey-based evaluation methods: (1) Stability: that\ncultural alignment is a property of LLMs rather than an artifact of evaluation\ndesign, (2) Extrapolability: that alignment with one culture on a narrow set of\nissues predicts alignment with that culture on others, and (3) Steerability:\nthat LLMs can be reliably prompted to represent specific cultural perspectives.\nThrough experiments examining both explicit and implicit preferences of leading\nLLMs, we find a high level of instability across presentation formats,\nincoherence between evaluated versus held-out cultural dimensions, and erratic\nbehavior under prompt steering. We show that these inconsistencies can cause\nthe results of an evaluation to be very sensitive to minor variations in\nmethodology. Finally, we demonstrate in a case study on evaluation design that\nnarrow experiments and a selective assessment of evidence can be used to paint\nan incomplete picture of LLMs' cultural alignment properties.

In this paper, we explain the process of\ninformation retrieval with a causal graph and discover that PLM-based\nretrievers learn perplexity features for relevance estimation, causing source\nbias by ranking the documents with low perplexity higher.

In this work, we introduce OmniPaint, a\nunified framework that re-conceptualizes object removal and insertion as\ninterdependent processes rather than isolated tasks. Leveraging a pre-trained\ndiffusion prior along with a progressive training pipeline comprising initial\npaired sample optimization and subsequent large-scale unpaired refinement via\nCycleFlow, OmniPaint achieves precise foreground elimination and seamless\nobject insertion while faithfully preserving scene geometry and intrinsic\nproperties.

    "abstract": "Depth-guided multimodal fusion combines depth information from visible and\ninfrared images, significantly enhancing the performance of 3D reconstruction\nand robotics applications. Existing thermal-visible image fusion mainly focuses\non detection tasks, ignoring other critical information such as depth. By\naddressing the limitations of single modalities in low-light and complex\nenvironments, the depth information from fused images not only generates more\naccurate point cloud data, improving the completeness and precision of 3D\nreconstruction, but also provides comprehensive scene understanding for robot\nnavigation, localization, and environmental perception. This supports precise\nrecognition and efficient operations in applications such as autonomous driving\nand rescue missions. We introduce a text-guided and depth-driven infrared and\nvisible image fusion network. The model consists of an image fusion branch for\nextracting multi-channel complementary information through a diffusion model,\nequipped with a text-guided module, and two auxiliary depth estimation\nbranches. The fusion branch uses CLIP to extract semantic information and\nparameters from depth-enriched image descriptions to guide the diffusion model\nin extracting multi-channel features and generating fused images. These fused\nimages are then input into the depth estimation branches to calculate\ndepth-driven loss, optimizing the image fusion network. This framework aims to\nintegrate vision-language and depth to directly generate color-fused images\nfrom multimodal inputs.",

    "abstract": "We consider an evolving random discrete tree model called Preferential\nAttachment with Vertex Death, as introduced by Deijfen. Initialised with an\nalive root labelled $1$, at each step $n\\geq1$ either a new vertex with label\n$n+1$ is introduced that attaches to an existing alive vertex selected\npreferentially according to a function $b$, or an alive vertex is selected\npreferentially according to a function $d$ and killed. We introduce a\ngeneralised concept of persistence for evolving random graph models. Let $O_n$\nbe the smallest label among all alive vertices (the oldest alive vertex), and\nlet $I_n$ be the label of the alive vertex with the largest degree (among all\nalive vertices). Persistence occurs when $I_n/O_n$ is tight; lack of\npersistence occurs when $I_n/O_n$ diverges with $n$. We study lack of\npersistence and identify two regimes: the old are rich and the rich die young\nregime. In the rich are old regime, though the oldest alive vertices in the\ntree typically have the largest degrees, lack of persistence can occur subject\nto the condition $\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty 1/(b(i)+d(i))^2=\\infty$, under which lucky\nvertices that are younger than the oldest vertices can attain the largest\ndegrees by step $n$, generalising results by Banerjee and Bhamidi. In contrast,\nlack of persistence always occurs in the rich die young regime. This regime is\nnovel and cannot be observed in models without death. Here, vertices can\nsurvive exceptionally long by obtaining a low degree, whereas vertices with a\nlarge degree die much faster, causing lack of persistence. A main technique is\nan embedding of the discrete tree process into a Crump-Mode-Jagers branching\nprocess and a higher-order analysis of the resulting birth-death mechanism\nbased on moderate deviation principles with exponential tilting.",

    "abstract": "Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to\nexpensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the\ndiversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating\nnew data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their\ntraining distributions. In order to characterize and better understand\ndistribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical\ndatasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for\nlarge foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations,\nwe hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize\nMLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of\nout-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps\nfor mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time\nrefinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use\nexpensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral\ngraph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures\nseen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for\nout-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an\nauxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement\nstrategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems,\nsuggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse\nchemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our\nexperiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization\ncapabilities of the next generation of MLFFs.

However, its efficacy during fine-tuning is limited by the\nconstraint of the compression format, where weight vectors assigned to the same\ncodeword are restricted to updates in the same direction. Consequently, many\nquantized weights are compelled to move in directions contrary to their local\ngradient information. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel VQ paradigm,\nSign-Splitting VQ (SSVQ), which decouples the sign bit of weights from the\ncodebook. Our approach involves extracting the sign bits of uncompressed\nweights and performing clustering and compression on all-positive weights. We\nthen introduce latent variables for the sign bit and jointly optimize both the\nsigns and the codebook. Additionally, we implement a progressive freezing\nstrategy for the learnable sign to ensure training stability. Extensive\nexperiments on various modern models and tasks demonstrate that SSVQ achieves a\nsignificantly superior compression-accuracy trade-off compared to conventional\nVQ.

Our contributions in\nthis paper are two fold: first, to address these emerging risks, we release the\nASIMOV Benchmark, a large-scale and comprehensive collection of datasets for\nevaluating and improving semantic safety of foundation models serving as robot\nbrains. Our data generation recipe is highly scalable: by leveraging text and\nimage generation techniques, we generate undesirable situations from real-world\nvisual scenes and human injury reports from hospitals. Secondly, we develop a\nframework to automatically generate robot constitutions from real-world data to\nsteer a robot's behavior using Constitutional AI mechanisms. We propose a novel\nauto-amending process that is able to introduce nuances in written rules of\nbehavior; this can lead to increased alignment with human preferences on\nbehavior desirability and safety. We explore trade-offs between generality and\nspecificity across a diverse set of constitutions of different lengths, and\ndemonstrate that a robot is able to effectively reject unconstitutional\nactions. We measure a top alignment rate of 84.3% on the ASIMOV Benchmark using\ngenerated constitutions, outperforming no-constitution baselines and\nhuman-written constitutions.

We extend a previous benchmark (XL-WSD) to\nre-design two subtasks suitable for LLM: 1) given a word in a sentence, the LLM\nmust generate the correct definition; 2) given a word in a sentence and a set\nof predefined meanings, the LLM must select the correct one. The extended\nbenchmark is built using the XL-WSD and BabelNet. The results indicate that\nLLMs perform well in zero-shot learning but cannot surpass current\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "The Plateau-Rayleigh instability shows that a cylindrical fluid flow can be\ndestabilized by surface tension. Similarly, capillary forces can make an\nelastic cylinder unstable when the elastocapillary length is comparable to the\ncylinder's radius. While existing models predict a single isolated bulge as the\nresult of an instability, experiments reveal a periodic sequence of bulges\nspaced out by thinned regions, a phenomenon known as beading instability. Most\nmodels assume that surface tension is independent of the deformation of the\nsolid, neglecting variations due to surface stretch.\n  In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of\nmaterial particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched\nelastic surface surrounding the body. Using the theoretical framework proposed\nby Gurtin and Murdoch, we show that a cylindrical solid can undergo a\nmechanical instability with a finite critical wavelength if the body is\nsufficiently soft or axially stretched. Post-buckling numerical simulations\nreveal a morphology in qualitative agreement with experimental observations.\nPeriod-halving secondary bifurcations are also observed. The results of this\nresearch have broad implications for soft materials, biomechanics, and\nmicrofabrication applications where surface tension plays a crucial role.",

Additionally, all four sources show silicate emission features\naround 10 and 18 $\\mu$m that are much stronger than the features seen in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). We suggest that the emitting dust is optically thin to\nits own emission and show that the MIR spectrum is consistent with emission\nfrom optically thin dust in the nucleus. All four sources show an excess at\nshort wavelengths ($\\lambda < 8\\, \\mu$m), which could arise from a late-time\nplateau in the intrinsic flare, akin to what is seen in late-time UV\nobservations of unobscured TDEs, although self-consistent dust modeling is\nrequired to fully assess the strength of this late-time plateau.",

We wish to study the structure of the nascent star-disk system, while\nfocusing on the innermost sub-AU region. We carry out high resolution 3D RMHD\nsimulations, describing the collapse of dense cloud cores to stellar densities.\nThe calculations reach $\\approx 2.3$ yr after protostellar birth. Our\nsimulations are also compared to their hydro counterpart to better isolate the\nrole of magnetic fields. When accounting for ambipolar diffusion, the\nefficiency of magnetic braking is drastically reduced and the nascent protostar\nreaches breakup velocity, thus forming a rotationally supported disk. The\ndiffusion of the magnetic field also allows for the implantation of a $\\sim\n\\mathrm{kG}$ field in the protostar, which is thereafter maintained. The\nmagnetic field is mainly toroidal in the star-disk system, although a notable\nvertical component threads it. We also show that the nascent disk is prone to\nthe MRI, although our resolution is inadequate to capture the mechanism. We\nnote a sensitivity of the disk's properties with regards to the angular\nmomentum inherited prior to the second collapse, as well as the magnetic field\nstrength. These calculations carry multiple implications on several issues in\nstellar formation theory, and offer perspectives for future modeling of the\nsystem. Should the fossil field hypothesis to explain the origins of magnetic\nfields in young stellar objects hold, we show that a $\\sim \\mathrm{kG}$ field\nstrength may be implanted and maintained in the protostar at birth.",

We define\nvalidation-based tuning for several unlearning methods from the recent\nliterature, and show how these methods perform differently depending on (i) the\nDNN parameterization level, (ii) the unlearning goal (unlearned data privacy or\nbias removal), (iii) whether the unlearning method explicitly uses the\nunlearned examples. Our results show that unlearning excels on\noverparameterized models, in terms of balancing between generalization and\nachieving the unlearning goal; although for bias removal this requires the\nunlearning method to use the unlearned examples. We further elucidate our\nerror-based analysis by measuring how much the unlearning changes the\nclassification decision regions in the proximity of the unlearned examples, and\navoids changing them elsewhere. By this we show that the unlearning success for\noverparameterized models stems from the ability to delicately change the model\nfunctionality in small regions in the input space while keeping much of the\nmodel functionality unchanged.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates secret-key generation for device authentication using\nphysical identifiers, such as responses from physical unclonable functions\n(PUFs). The system includes two legitimate terminals (encoder and decoder) and\nan eavesdropper (Eve), each with access to different measurements of the\nidentifier. From the device identifier, the encoder generates a secret key,\nwhich is securely stored in a private database, along with helper data that is\nsaved in a public database accessible by the decoder for key reconstruction.\nEve, who also has access to the public database, may use both her own\nmeasurements and the helper data to attempt to estimate the secret key and\nidentifier. Our setup focuses on authentication scenarios where channel\nstatistics are uncertain, with the involved parties employing multiple antennas\nto enhance signal reception. Our contributions include deriving inner and outer\nbounds on the optimal trade-off among secret-key, storage, and privacy-leakage\nrates for general discrete sources, and showing that these bounds are tight for\nGaussian sources.",

Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too\ncoarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though\nsegmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods\noften require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel\ndecoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially\ncompromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility,\nwhile failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding.\n  Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new\nparadigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation\ntools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT\nenables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving\nhigh-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through\nthis setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation\ntrajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation\nfiltering.\n  HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in\nMLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that\nfacilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations\nof policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance\nmodel robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future\nadvancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making\nfor MLLMs.",

We include\nprocesses of coupling of photons to individual nucleons (protons and neutrons)\nin addition to coherent coupling to the whole nuclei (called standard approach\nhere). Both elastic (nucleon in the ground state) and inelastic (nucleon in an\nexcited state) in the couplings of photons to nucleons are taken into account.\nThe inelastic nucleon fluxes are calculated using CT18qed photon in nucleon\nPDFs. The inelastic photon fluxes are shown and compared to standard photon\nfluxes in the nucleus. In addition, we show the ratio of the inelastic\ncorrections to the standard contribution as a function of diphoton invariant\nmass and photon rapidity difference.

In this paper, we introduce \\model, an\nefficient training paradigm for image generation models that uses knowledge\ndistillation (KD) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Drawing inspiration\nfrom the success of data KD techniques widely adopted in Multi-Modal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs), LightGen distills knowledge from state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) text-to-image models into a compact Masked Autoregressive (MAR)\narchitecture with only $0.7B$ parameters. Using a compact synthetic dataset of\njust $2M$ high-quality images generated from varied captions, we demonstrate\nthat data diversity significantly outweighs data volume in determining model\nperformance. This strategy dramatically reduces computational demands and\nreduces pre-training time from potentially thousands of GPU-days to merely 88\nGPU-days. Furthermore, to address the inherent shortcomings of synthetic data,\nparticularly poor high-frequency details and spatial inaccuracies, we integrate\nthe DPO technique that refines image fidelity and positional accuracy.\nComprehensive experiments confirm that LightGen achieves image generation\nquality comparable to SOTA models while significantly reducing computational\nresources and expanding accessibility for resource-constrained environments.\nCode is available at https://github.com/XianfengWu01/LightGen",

However, these methods primarily focus on ensuring smooth transitions\nbetween adjacent frames, often leading to content drift and a gradual loss of\nsemantic coherence over longer sequences. To tackle such an issue, we propose\nSynchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS), a novel inference framework that\nsynchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range\nconsistency across both adjacent and distant frames. Our approach combines two\ncomplementary sampling strategies: reverse and optimization-based sampling,\nwhich ensure seamless local transitions and enforce global coherence,\nrespectively. However, directly alternating between these samplings misaligns\ndenoising trajectories, disrupting prompt guidance and introducing unintended\ncontent changes as they operate independently. To resolve this, SynCoS\nsynchronizes them through a grounded timestep and a fixed baseline noise,\nensuring fully coupled sampling with aligned denoising paths.

    "abstract": "Cell microscopy data are abundant; however, corresponding segmentation\nannotations remain scarce. Moreover, variations in cell types, imaging devices,\nand staining techniques introduce significant domain gaps between datasets. As\na result, even large, pretrained segmentation models trained on diverse\ndatasets (source datasets) struggle to generalize to unseen datasets (target\ndatasets). To overcome this generalization problem, we propose CellStyle, which\nimproves the segmentation quality of such models without requiring labels for\nthe target dataset, thereby enabling zero-shot adaptation. CellStyle transfers\nthe attributes of an unannotated target dataset, such as texture, color, and\nnoise, to the annotated source dataset. This transfer is performed while\npreserving the cell shapes of the source images, ensuring that the existing\nsource annotations can still be used while maintaining the visual\ncharacteristics of the target dataset. The styled synthetic images with the\nexisting annotations enable the finetuning of a generalist segmentation model\nfor application to the unannotated target data. We demonstrate that CellStyle\nsignificantly improves zero-shot cell segmentation performance across diverse\ndatasets by finetuning multiple segmentation models on the style-transferred\ndata. The code will be made publicly available.",

In particular, the $R$-matrix defining the Yang-Baxter algebra\ncorresponds to the left Weyl group action. Most importantly, we use the\n`quantum=classical' statement for the quantum K-theory of Grassmannians to\nprove an explicit geometric interpretation of the action of generators of the\nYang-Baxter algebra. The diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix are given by\nquantum K-multiplications by explicitly defined classes, and the off-diagonal\nentries by certain push-pull convolutions. We use this to find a quantization\nof the classes of fixed points in the quantum K-rings, corresponding to the\nBethe vectors of the Yang-Baxter algebra. On each of the quantum K-rings, we\nprove that the two Frobenius structures (one from geometry, and the other from\nthe integrable system construction) coincide. We discuss several applications,\nincluding an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the quantum K-theory\nring (extending the Seidel action), a quantum version of the localization map\n(which is a ring homomorphism with respect to the quantum K-product), and a\ngraphical calculus to multiply by Hirzebruch $\\lambda_y$ classes of the dual of\nthe tautological quotient bundle. In an Appendix we illustrate our results in\nthe case when $n=2$.",

This\nis caused by the lack of large-scale annotated datasets on the one hand, and\nlack of methods that can robustly handle the sparse and often noisy LiDAR data\nin a reasonable time on the other hand. We address these limitations using a\ntraffic simulation engine and present LiSu, the first large-scale, synthetic\nLiDAR point cloud dataset with ground truth surface normal annotations,\neliminating the need for tedious manual labeling. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel method that exploits the spatiotemporal characteristics of autonomous\ndriving data to enhance surface normal estimation accuracy. By incorporating\ntwo regularization terms, we enforce spatial consistency among neighboring\npoints and temporal smoothness across consecutive LiDAR frames. These\nregularizers are particularly effective in self-training settings, where they\nmitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust real-world\ndeployment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on LiSu, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in LiDAR surface normal estimation.

    "abstract": "An open question posed by Fawzi and Ferme [Transactions on Information Theory\n2024], asks whether non-signaling (NS) assistance can increase the capacity of\na broadcast channel (BC). We answer this question in the affirmative, by\nshowing that for a certain K-receiver BC setting, called Coordinated Multipoint\n(CoMP) that arises naturally in wireless networks, NS-assistance provides\nmultiplicative gains in capacity and degrees of freedom (DoF), even achieving\nK-fold improvements in some cases. Somewhat surprisingly, this is shown to be\ntrue even for 2-receiver broadcast channels that are semi-deterministic and/or\ndegraded. In a CoMP BC, B single-antenna transmitters, supported by a backhaul\nthat allows them to share data, act as one B-antenna transmitter, to send\nindependent messages to K receivers, each equipped with a single receive\nantenna. A fixed and globally known connectivity matrix M, specifies for each\ntransmit antenna, the subset of receivers that are connected to (have a\nnon-zero channel coefficient to) that antenna. Besides the connectivity, there\nis no channel state information at the transmitter. The DoF region is fully\ncharacterized for a class of connectivity patterns associated with tree graphs.\nSum-capacity with NS-assistance for arbitrary connectivity patterns is bounded\nbelow and above by the triangle number and the min-rank of the connectivity\nmatrix, respectively. While translations to Gaussian settings are demonstrated,\nmost of our results are presented under noise-free, finite-field (Fq) models.\nConverse proofs for classical DoF adapt the Aligned Images bounds to the finite\nfield model. Converse bounds for NS-assisted capacity extend the same-marginals\nproperty to the BC with NS-assistance available to all parties. Even stronger\n(unbounded) gains are established for certain 'communication with\nside-information' settings, such as the fading dirty paper channel.",

To overcome these challenges, we introduce TinyLensGPU, a\nGPU-accelerated lens-modeling tool that employs XLA-based acceleration with JAX\nand a neural-network-enhanced nested sampling algorithm, nautilus-sampler.\nTests on 1,000 simulated galaxy-galaxy lenses demonstrate that on an RTX 4060\nTi GPU, TinyLensGPU achieves likelihood evaluations approximately 2,000 times\nfaster than traditional methods. Moreover, the nautilus-sampler reduces the\nnumber of likelihood evaluations by a factor of 3, decreasing the overall\nmodeling time per lens from several days to roughly 3 minutes. Application to\n63 SLACS lenses observed by the Hubble Space Telescope recovers Einstein radii\nconsistent with the literature values (within $\\lesssim 5\\%$ deviation), which\nis within known systematic uncertainties.

However,\nmost existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts\nfeatures using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these\nfeatures through MIL. This segmented training approach leads to insufficient\ncollaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL\nnetwork, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the\noverall performance of the model. Additionally, conventional methods typically\nextract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale\nobservation characteristics of pathologists. This not only results in\nsignificant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal\nproportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to\nsuboptimal solutions.\n  To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale\nWSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction\nwith multiple instance learning. Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a\nsemantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas;\n(2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information\nat different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global\nmodeling and feature integration.

We find that the model\nusing VIIRS as input and VNP14 as target achieves the best results.\nInterestingly, the model using MODIS as input and VNP14 as target performs\nsignificantly better than using VNP14 as input and MOD14 as target. Next, we\ndiscuss why MOD14 might be harder to use for predicting next-day fires. We find\nthat the MOD14 fire mask is highly stochastic and does not correlate with\nreasonable fire spread patterns. This is detrimental for machine learning\ntasks, as the model learns irrational patterns. Therefore, we conclude that\nMOD14 is unsuitable for next-day fire prediction and that VNP14 is a much\nbetter option. However, using MODIS input and VNP14 as target, we achieve a\nsignificant improvement in predictability. This indicates that an improved fire\ndetection model is possible for MODIS.

Two primary\napproaches have been utilized to address this issue: the vector autoregressive\nmodel with exogenous variables (VARX) and the matrix autoregression (MAR). The\nVARX model captures domestic dependencies, but treats variables exogenous to\nrepresent global factors driven by international trade. In contrast, the MAR\nmodel simultaneously considers variables from multiple countries but ignores\nthe trade network. In this paper, we propose an extension of the MAR model that\nachieves these two aims at once, i.e., studying both international dependencies\nand the impact of the trade network on the global economy.

Our micromagnetic simulations\naccurately reproduce the dependence of the mode frequencies on magnetic field\nand reveal the spatial profiles of the excitations in the FL and RL. The FL and\nRL modes generate rectified voltage signals of opposite polarity, which makes\nthis device a promising candidate for a tunable dual-frequency microwave signal\ndetector. The simulations show that weak interlayer exchange coupling within\nthe SAF enhances the mode amplitudes. We also calculate the response of the\ndetector as a function of in-plane magnetic field bias and find that its\nsensitivity significantly increases with increasing field. We experimentally\nconfirm this prediction via ST-FMR measurements as a function of in-plane\nmagnetic field.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) has emerged as a powerful approach\nfor signal representation by learning translation-invariant features through\nconvolution operations. While existing CDL methods are predominantly designed\nand used for fully supervised settings, many real-world classification tasks\noften rely on weakly labeled data, where only bag-level annotations are\navailable. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised convolutional\ndictionary learning framework that jointly learns shared and class-specific\ncomponents, for multi-instance multi-label (MIML) classification where each\nexample consists of multiple instances and may be associated with multiple\nlabels. Our approach decomposes signals into background patterns captured by a\nshared dictionary and discriminative features encoded in class-specific\ndictionaries, with nuclear norm constraints preventing feature dilution. A\nBlock Proximal Gradient method with Majorization (BPG-M) is developed to\nalternately update dictionary atoms and sparse coefficients, ensuring\nconvergence to local minima. Furthermore, we incorporate a projection mechanism\nthat aggregates instance-level predictions to bag-level labels through\nlearnable pooling operators.Experimental results on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing MIML\nmethods in terms of classification performance, particularly in low-label\nregimes. The learned dictionaries provide interpretable representations while\neffectively handling background noise and variable-length instances, making the\nmethod suitable for applications such as environmental sound classification and\nRF signal analysis.",

When Kramers nodal lines intersect the Fermi level,\nthey form exotic three-dimensional Fermi surfaces which is certain\nconfigurations can be fully described by two-dimensional massless Dirac\nfermions. These Fermi surfaces are predicted to realize a quantized optical\nconductivity with multiple quantized levels a large light- and field-induced\nanomalous Hall effect.

Here, we\nextend the search for Kramers nodal line metals beyond the previously\nconsidered case in which the Fermi surfaces enclose a single time-reversal\ninvariant momentum. Using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy\nmeasurements and ab-initio calculations, we present evidence that the 3R\npolytypes of TaS$_2$ and NbS$_2$ are Kramers nodal line metals with open\nOctdong and Spindle-torus Fermi surfaces, respectively. We show that by\nreducing the band filling, a transition between these two configurations can be\nobserved. Moreover, our data suggests a naturally occurring size quantization\neffect of inclusions of 3R-TaS$_2$ in commercially available 2H-TaS$_2$\ncrystals, which could enable the observation of quantized optical conductivity.\nFinally, since the open Fermi-surfaces encircle two time-reversal invariant\nmomenta each, we predict a phase transition from a Kramers nodal line metal to\na conventional metal by strain or uniaxial pressure. Our work establishes the\n3R phase of metallic transition metal dichalcogenides as a tunable platform to\nexplore new phenomena expected from exotic Fermi surfaces in Kramers nodal line\nmetals.",

In this\narticle, we provide a more detailed discussion of these methods and derive\nexpressions for density matrix elements of closed and open systems. At first,\nwe look at closed systems by discussing general solutions to the\nSchr\\\"odinger-like form of the quantum Liouville equations in TFD, showing that\nthe dynamical map is indeed divisible, deriving a path integral-based\nexpression for the density matrix elements in Fock space, and explaining why\nperturbation theory enables us to use the last even in situations where all\ninitial states in Fock space are occupied. Subsequently, we discuss open\nsystems in the same manner after tracing out environmental degrees of freedom\nfrom the solutions for closed systems. We find that, even in a general basis,\nthe dynamical map is not divisible, which renders the dynamics of open systems\nnon-Markovian.

    "abstract": "This essay examines how Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming design\npractices and how discourse often falls into over-simplified narratives that\nimpede meaningful research and practical progress. We identify and deconstruct\nfive prevalent \"semantic stopsigns\" -- reductive framings about GenAI in design\nthat halt deeper inquiry and limit productive engagement. Reflecting upon two\nexpert workshops at ACM conferences and semi-structured interviews with design\npractitioners, we analyze how these stopsigns manifest in research and\npractice. Our analysis develops mid-level knowledge that bridges theoretical\ndiscourse and practical implementation, helping designers and researchers\ninterrogate common assumptions about GenAI in their own contexts. By recasting\nthese stopsigns into more nuanced frameworks, we provide the design research\ncommunity with practical approaches for thinking about and working with these\nemerging technologies.",

Our construction starts from the gauge-theoretic viewpoint of\nPoincar\\'{e} (or de Sitter) gravity and introduces noncommutativity through the\nMoyal star product and the Seiberg-Witten map, retaining NC gauge invariance at\neach order in the deformation parameter $\\Theta$. Working systematically to\nsecond order in $\\Theta$, we obtain explicit NC corrections to the spin\nconnection, the vierbein, and various geometric objects such as the metric and\ncurvature scalars. Using these results, we compute NC modifications of\nfour-dimensional Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m solutions, including\nscenarios with a cosmological constant, as well as three-dimensional BTZ-type\nblack holes (both uncharged and charged). For each black hole solution, we\nexplore various possible Moyal twists, each of which generally breaks some\nsymmetries and modifies the horizon structure, surface gravity, and curvature\ninvariants. In particular, we show that while the radial location of horizons\nin Schwarzschild-like solutions remains unchanged for some twists, other twists\nintroduce important but finite deformations in curvature scalars and can\ndecouple the Killing horizon from the causal horizon. Similar patterns arise in\nthe charged and lower-dimensional cases. Beyond constructing explicit examples,\nour approach provides a blueprint for systematically incorporating\nshort-distance quantum corrections through noncommutativity in gravitational\nsettings.

As robot policy performance increases, so does the\ncomplexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and\ndiverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable\ntrustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable\nruntime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However,\nmost existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure\nmodes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant\nchallenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we\npresent FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in\nimitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures\nfrom successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs\ninto scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic\nuncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile\nframework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees.\nEmpirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal\ncandidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned\nsignals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel\nflow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more\naccurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines.\nThese results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and\nreliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward\nreal-world deployment.",

AIM\nimaging relies on active transmission of spatio-temporally incoherent signals\nto illuminate a scene, from which interferometric Fourier-domain imaging can be\nimplemented using a sparse receiving antenna array. One of the benefits of\nFourier domain imaging is the sparsity of the receiving array, which can form\nimages with equivalent resolution to traditional filled beamsteering arrays,\nbut with a small fraction of the elements. The hardware reduction afforded by\nthe sparse array often leads to an undersampled Fourier space, where even\nthough image formation is possible, the image reconstruction may be degraded\nwhen viewing complex objects. To address this challenge without requiring\nadditional receiver channels, we explore the use of frequency diversity in the\nilluminating and receiving systems. Fourier domain spatial frequency samples\nare determined by the electrical spacing and rotation of the receiving\nelements, thus by changing the frequency the sampled spatial frequencies also\nchange. We implement an additive technique where the spatial frequency samples\nare summed prior to Fourier transform image formation. Importantly, because the\nsystem is active, a consistent signal-to-noise ratio is maintained across all\nfrequencies, which may not be possible in traditional passive Fourier-domain\nimagers.",

An additional critical step for students is\nto identify the necessary prerequisite knowledge and learning paths. Although\nmany approaches based on large language models (LLMs) can summarize the content\nof papers and trace the development of a field through citations, these methods\noften overlook the prerequisite knowledge involved in the papers and the rich\nsemantic information embedded in the citation relationships between papers.\nSuch information reveals how methods are interrelated, built upon, extended, or\nchallenged. To address these limitations, we propose GoAI, a tool for\nconstructing educational knowledge graphs from AI research papers that\nleverages these graphs to plan personalized learning paths and support creative\nideation. The nodes in the knowledge graph we have built include papers and the\nprerequisite knowledge, such as concepts, skills, and tools, that they involve;\nthe edges record the semantic information of citations. When a student queries\na specific paper, a beam search-based path search method can trace the current\ndevelopment trends of the field from the queried paper and plan a learning path\ntoward cutting-edge objectives.

Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have demonstrated\nsignificant progress in directly mapping sinograms to PET images.

To achieve a robust\nperception-distortion tradeoff, we propose Posterior-Mean Denoising Diffusion\nModel (PMDM-PET), a novel approach that builds upon a recently established\nmathematical theory to explore the closed-form expression of\nperception-distortion function in diffusion model space for PET image\nreconstruction from sinograms. Specifically, PMDM-PET first obtained\nposterior-mean PET predictions under minimum mean square error (MSE), then\noptimally transports the distribution of them to the ground-truth PET images\ndistribution. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDM-PET not only generates\nrealistic PET images with possible minimum distortion and optimal perceptual\nquality but also outperforms five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL baselines\nin both qualitative visual inspection and quantitative pixel-wise metrics PSNR\n(dB)/SSIM/NRMSE.",

    "abstract": "School districts across the United States (US) play a pivotal role in shaping\naccess to quality education through their student assignment policies -- most\nprominently, school attendance boundaries. Community engagement processes for\nchanging such policies, however, are often opaque, cumbersome, and highly\npolarizing -- hampering equitable access to quality schools in ways that can\nperpetuate disparities in future life outcomes. In this paper, we describe a\ncollaboration with a large US public school district serving nearly 150,000\nstudents to design and evaluate a new sociotechnical system, \"BoundarEase\", for\nfostering more constructive community engagement around changing school\nattendance boundaries. Through a formative study with 16 community members, we\nfirst identify several frictions in existing community engagement processes,\nlike individualistic over collective thinking; a failure to understand and\nempathize with the different ways policies might impact other community\nmembers; and challenges in understanding the impacts of boundary changes. These\nfrictions inspire the design and development of BoundarEase, a web platform\nthat allows community members to explore and offer feedback on potential\nboundaries. A user study with 12 community members reveals that BoundarEase\nprompts reflection among community members on how policies might impact\nfamilies beyond their own, and increases transparency around the details of\npolicy proposals. Our paper offers education researchers insights into the\nchallenges and opportunities involved in community engagement for designing\nstudent assignment policies; human-computer interaction researchers a case\nstudy of how new sociotechnical systems might help mitigate polarization in\nlocal policymaking; and school districts a practical tool they might use to\nfacilitate community engagement to foster more equitable student assignment\npolicies.",

Typically, reasoning performance correlates with model size,\nwith the best results achieved by models exceeding 8 billion parameters.\nHowever, no prior work has explored enabling small audio-language models to\nperform reasoning tasks, despite the potential applications for edge devices.\nTo address this gap, we introduce Mellow, a small Audio-Language Model\nspecifically designed for reasoning. Mellow achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance among existing small audio-language models and surpasses several\nlarger models in reasoning capabilities. For instance, Mellow scores 52.11 on\nMMAU, comparable to SoTA Qwen2 Audio (which scores 52.5) while using 50 times\nfewer parameters and being trained on 60 times less data (audio hrs). To train\nMellow, we introduce ReasonAQA, a dataset designed to enhance audio-grounded\nreasoning in models. It consists of a mixture of existing datasets (30% of the\ndata) and synthetically generated data (70%). The synthetic dataset is derived\nfrom audio captioning datasets, where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate\ndetailed and multiple-choice questions focusing on audio events, objects,\nacoustic scenes, signal properties, semantics, and listener emotions. To\nevaluate Mellow's reasoning ability, we benchmark it on a diverse set of tasks,\nassessing on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, including audio\nunderstanding, deductive reasoning, and comparative reasoning. Finally, we\nconduct extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of projection layer\nchoices, synthetic data generation methods, and language model pretraining on\nreasoning performance.

The linear polarization of the CMB provides a crucial\nobservational tool for exploring new physics, including the inflationary\nparadigm and parity-violating phenomena. The spectral distortion of the CMB can\nbe used as a probe of the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters (GCs)\nand to infer cosmological parameters. However, precise measurements are limited\nby foreground contamination and instrumental systematics.\n  This work examines the non-thermal energy budget in GCs with the non-thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (ntSZ) effect. Using $Planck$ all-sky maps, we measure the\nntSZ effect in GCs hosting radio halos, enabling constraints on the\nvolume-averaged magnetic field strength within the ICM. We further assess how\nobservations from upcoming ground-based CMB experiments improve these\nconstraints.\n  The imprints of parity-violating physics on the polarization of the CMB are\npredicted theoretically and recently, several methods have been used to measure\nthe effect of cosmic birefringence from $Planck$ and $WMAP$ data. The\nmiscalibration of polarization-sensitive detectors is found to be one of the\nlimiting factors in this endeavour. We perform a relative and an absolute\npolarization angle calibration of the $Planck$ detectors using microwave and\nX-ray observations of the Crab nebula.\n  Additionally, we develop a simulation pipeline to generate time-ordered data\nfor an upcoming ground-based sub-mm telescope, analyzing the impact of\ncorrelated detector and atmospheric noise on CMB map reconstruction.

The analysis of the age-metallicity relationships (AMRs) of cluster\nlocated in outermost regions distributed around the SMC and in the SMC Main\nBody reveals that they have followed the overall galaxy chemical enrichment\nhistory.

Furthermore, metal rich clusters formed recently\nin some of these outermost regions from gas that was also dragged by tidal\neffects from the inner SMC.

    "abstract": "Remote sensing imagery from systems such as Sentinel provides full coverage\nof the Earth's surface at around 10-meter resolution. The remote sensing\ncommunity has transitioned to extensive use of deep learning models due to\ntheir high performance on benchmarks such as the UCMerced and ISPRS Vaihingen\ndatasets. Convolutional models such as UNet and ResNet variations are commonly\nemployed for remote sensing but typically only accept three channels, as they\nwere developed for RGB imagery, while satellite systems provide more than ten.\nRecently, several transformer architectures have been proposed for remote\nsensing, but they have not been extensively benchmarked and are typically used\non small datasets such as Salinas Valley. Meanwhile, it is becoming feasible to\nobtain dense spatial land-use labels for entire first-level administrative\ndivisions of some countries. Scaling law observations suggest that\nsubstantially larger multi-spectral transformer models could provide a\nsignificant leap in remote sensing performance in these settings.\n  In this work, we propose ChromaFormer, a family of multi-spectral transformer\nmodels, which we evaluate across orders of magnitude differences in model\nparameters to assess their performance and scaling effectiveness on a densely\nlabeled imagery dataset of Flanders, Belgium, covering more than 13,500 km^2\nand containing 15 classes. We propose a novel multi-spectral attention strategy\nand demonstrate its effectiveness through ablations. Furthermore, we show that\nmodels many orders of magnitude larger than conventional architectures, such as\nUNet, lead to substantial accuracy improvements: a UNet++ model with 23M\nparameters achieves less than 65% accuracy, while a multi-spectral transformer\nwith 655M parameters achieves over 95% accuracy on the Biological Valuation Map\nof Flanders.",

    "abstract": "Visual attention plays a critical role when our visual system executes active\nvisual tasks by interacting with the physical scene. However, how to encode the\nvisual object relationship in the psychological world of our brain deserves to\nbe explored. In the field of computer vision, predicting visual fixations or\nscanpaths is a usual way to explore the visual attention and behaviors of human\nobservers when viewing a scene. Most existing methods encode visual attention\nusing individual fixations or scanpaths based on the raw gaze shift data\ncollected from human observers. This may not capture the common attention\npattern well, because without considering the semantic information of the\nviewed scene, raw gaze shift data alone contain high inter- and intra-observer\nvariability. To address this issue, we propose a new attention representation,\ncalled Attention Graph, to simultaneously code the visual saliency and scanpath\nin a graph-based representation and better reveal the common attention behavior\nof human observers. In the attention graph, the semantic-based scanpath is\ndefined by the path on the graph, while saliency of objects can be obtained by\ncomputing fixation density on each node. Systemic experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed attention graph combined with our new evaluation metrics provides\na better benchmark for evaluating attention prediction methods. Meanwhile,\nextra experiments demonstrate the promising potentials of the proposed\nattention graph in assessing human cognitive states, such as autism spectrum\ndisorder screening and age classification.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce a scalable,\nself-supervised framework for sign representation learning. We leverage\nimportant inductive (sign) priors during the training of our RGB model. To do\nthis, we leverage simple but important cues based on skeletons while\npretraining a masked autoencoder.

    "abstract": "Solitons are predominantly observed in near-earth plasmas as well as\nplanetary magnetospheres; however, their existence in the solar corona remains\nlargely unexplored, despite theoretical investigations. This study aims to\naddress this gap by examining the presence and dynamics of solitons in the\nsolar corona, particularly in the context of coronal heating. Utilizing\nobservational data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory (SOHO) during the onset of a strong Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)\nevent, the analyses reveal a train of aperiodic solitons with increasing\namplitude preceding the eruption. A key finding of this study is that the\nobserved aperiodic soliton train serves as a potential candidate in\nfacilitating energy transfer through dissipation within the coronal plasma,\nhereby, influencing the initiation of solar eruptive events such as a CME. A\ndefining characteristic of this solitary train is its hypersonic and\nsuper-Alfvenic nature, evident from the presence of high Mach numbers that\nreinforces its role in plasma energy equilibration in the solar corona, thereby\ncontributing to plasma heating.",

To address these challenges, we construct a new\nhigh-quality dataset containing 227 sequences of digital human portraits\ncaptured from 96 different perspectives, totalling 21,792 frames, featuring\ndiverse expressions and accessories. To further improve performance, we\nintegrate identity and expression information into the multi-view diffusion\nprocess to enhance facial consistency across views.

    "abstract": "Accurate dose calculations in proton therapy rely on high-quality CT images.\nWhile planning CTs (pCTs) serve as a reference for dosimetric planning, Cone\nBeam CT (CBCT) is used throughout Adaptive Radiotherapy (ART) to generate sCTs\nfor improved dose calculations. Despite its lower cost and reduced radiation\nexposure advantages, CBCT suffers from severe artefacts and poor image quality,\nmaking it unsuitable for precise dosimetry. Deep learning-based CBCT-to-CT\ntranslation has emerged as a promising approach. Still, existing methods often\nintroduce anatomical inconsistencies and lack reliable uncertainty estimates,\nlimiting their clinical adoption. To bridge this gap, we propose STF-RUE, a\nnovel framework integrating two key components. First, STF, a\nsegmentation-guided CBCT-to-CT translation method that enhances anatomical\nconsistency by leveraging segmentation priors extracted from pCTs. Second, RUE,\na conformal prediction method that augments predicted CTs with pixel-wise\nconformal prediction intervals, providing clinicians with robust reliability\nindicator. Comprehensive experiments using UNet++ and Fast-DDPM on two\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that STF-RUE significantly improves translation\naccuracy, as measured by a novel soft-tissue-focused metric designed for\nprecise dose computation. Additionally, STF-RUE provides better-calibrated\nuncertainty sets for synthetic CT, reinforcing trust in synthetic CTs.

With the advancement of pre-training,\nleveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising\nstarting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual\nembeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed\nthrough language. For instance, the concept of ``cat'' can be decomposed into\nfeatures like tail, fur, and face for recognition. Besides, since the model is\ncontinually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring\nexternal knowledge for compensation. In this paper, we introduce ExterNal\nknowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer\nfrom outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework\nthat encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The\nvisual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features,\nwhile the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors.\nIn addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement\npost-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference.\nWith the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features\nfor downstream tasks as data evolves.

    "abstract": "In recent years, lightweight large language models (LLMs) have garnered\nsignificant attention in the robotics field due to their low computational\nresource requirements and suitability for edge deployment. However, in task\nplanning -- particularly for complex tasks that involve dynamic semantic logic\nreasoning -- lightweight LLMs have underperformed. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a novel task planner, LightPlanner, which enhances the performance\nof lightweight LLMs in complex task planning by fully leveraging their\nreasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional planners that use fixed skill\ntemplates, LightPlanner controls robot actions via parameterized function\ncalls, dynamically generating parameter values. This approach allows for\nfine-grained skill control and improves task planning success rates in complex\nscenarios. Furthermore, we introduce hierarchical deep reasoning. Before\ngenerating each action decision step, LightPlanner thoroughly considers three\nlevels: action execution (feedback verification), semantic parsing (goal\nconsistency verification), and parameter generation (parameter validity\nverification). This ensures the correctness of subsequent action controls.\nAdditionally, we incorporate a memory module to store historical actions,\nthereby reducing context length and enhancing planning efficiency for long-term\ntasks. We train the LightPlanner-1.5B model on our LightPlan-40k dataset, which\ncomprises 40,000 action controls across tasks with 2 to 13 action steps.\nExperiments demonstrate that our model achieves the highest task success rate\ndespite having the smallest number of parameters. In tasks involving spatial\nsemantic reasoning, the success rate exceeds that of ReAct by 14.9 percent.\nMoreover, we demonstrate LightPlanner's potential to operate on edge devices.",

However, adapting these models with\nlimited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, diminishing their performance\non new tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal\nRepresentation Learning (MMRL) framework that introduces a shared, learnable,\nand modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL projects the space tokens to\ntext and image representation tokens, facilitating more effective multi-modal\ninteractions. Unlike previous approaches that solely optimize class token\nfeatures, MMRL integrates representation tokens at higher layers of the\nencoders--where dataset-specific features are more prominent--while preserving\ngeneralized knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both representation\nand class features are optimized, with trainable projection layer applied to\nthe representation tokens, whereas the class token projection layer remains\nfrozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. Furthermore, a regularization term is\nintroduced to align the class features and text features with the zero-shot\nfeatures from the frozen VLM, thereby safeguarding the model's generalization\ncapacity. For inference, a decoupling strategy is employed, wherein both\nrepresentation and class features are utilized for base classes, while only the\nclass features, which retain more generalized knowledge, are used for new\ntasks.

Here, we tackle this challenge by\npredicting robust quantized spin-Hall conductivity in monolayer Fe$_2$Te$_2$O.\nThe underlying physics originates from the unrecognized mirror-spin coupling\n(MSC), which couples spin-up and spin-down states into two orthogonal mirror\neigenstates. We show that the MSC can naturally emerge in the two-dimensional\naltermagnets with out-of-plane N\\'eel vector and horizontal mirror. A\nremarkable consequence of the MSC is that it can dramatically weaken the spin\nhybridization of the altermagnetic materials when SOC is included. When SOC is\nneglected, Fe$_2$Te$_2$O is an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal with MSC. With SOC,\nit evolves into the first material candidate for magnetic mirror Chern\ninsulator. Remarkably, under the protection of MSC, the spin hybridization of\nboth bulk and topological edge states in Fe$_2$Te$_2$O with SOC at low energy\nis negligible. As a consequence, a quantized spin-Hall conductivity emerges\nwithin the bulk band gap of the system.

    "abstract": "Generating effective test inputs for a software system requires that these\ninputs be valid, as they will otherwise be rejected without reaching actual\nfunctionality. In the absence of a specification for the input language, common\ntest generation techniques rely on sample inputs, which are abstracted into\nmatching grammars and/or evolved guided by test coverage. However, if sample\ninputs miss features of the input language, the chances of generating these\nfeatures randomly are slim.\n  In this work, we present the first technique for symbolically and\nautomatically mining input grammars from the code of recursive descent parsers.\nSo far, the complexity of parsers has made such a symbolic analysis challenging\nto impossible. Our realization of the symbolic parsing technique overcomes\nthese challenges by (1) associating each parser function parse_ELEM() with a\nnonterminal <ELEM>; (2) limiting recursive calls and loop iterations, such that\na symbolic analysis of parse_ELEM() needs to consider only a finite number of\npaths; and (3) for each path, create an expansion alternative for <ELEM>. Being\npurely static, symbolic parsing does not require seed inputs; as it mitigates\npath explosion, it scales to complex parsers.\n  Our evaluation promises symbolic parsing to be highly accurate. Applied on\nparsers for complex languages such as TINY-C or JSON, our STALAGMITE\nimplementation extracts grammars with an accuracy of 99--100%, widely improving\nover the state of the art despite requiring only the program code and no input\nsamples.

While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) excel\nin environmental perception, they often generate inaccurate or impractical\nresponses in embodied visual reasoning tasks due to a lack of understanding of\nrobotic physical reachability. To address this issue, we propose a unified\nrepresentation of physical reachability across diverse robots, i.e.,\nSpace-Physical Reachability Map (S-P Map), and PhysVLM, a vision-language model\nthat integrates this reachability information into visual reasoning.\nSpecifically, the S-P Map abstracts a robot's physical reachability into a\ngeneralized spatial representation, independent of specific robot\nconfigurations, allowing the model to focus on reachability features rather\nthan robot-specific parameters. Subsequently, PhysVLM extends traditional VLM\narchitectures by incorporating an additional feature encoder to process the S-P\nMap, enabling the model to reason about physical reachability without\ncompromising its general vision-language capabilities. To train and evaluate\nPhysVLM, we constructed a large-scale multi-robot dataset, Phys100K, and a\nchallenging benchmark, EQA-phys, which includes tasks for six different robots\nin both simulated and real-world environments. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat PhysVLM outperforms existing models, achieving a 14\\% improvement over\nGPT-4o on EQA-phys and surpassing advanced embodied VLMs such as RoboMamba and\nSpatialVLM on the RoboVQA-val and OpenEQA benchmarks. Additionally, the S-P Map\nshows strong compatibility with various VLMs, and its integration into\nGPT-4o-mini yields a 7.1\\% performance improvement.",

    "abstract": "Motion planning failures during autonomous navigation often occur when safety\nconstraints are either too conservative, leading to deadlocks, or too liberal,\nresulting in collisions. To improve robustness, a robot must dynamically adapt\nits safety constraints to ensure it reaches its goal while balancing safety and\nperformance measures. To this end, we propose a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based\npolicy for adapting Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraint parameters at\nruntime, ensuring safe yet non-conservative motion. The proposed approach is\ndesigned for a general high-level motion planner, low-level controller, and\ntarget system model, and is trained in simulation only. Through extensive\nsimulations and physical experiments, we demonstrate that our framework\neffectively adapts CBF constraints, enabling the robot to reach its final goal\nwithout compromising safety.",

In this work, we introduce a training-free method for face\nanonymization that preserves key non-identity-related attributes. Our approach\nutilizes a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model without requiring\noptimization or training. It begins by inverting the input image to recover its\ninitial noise. The noise is then denoised through an identity-conditioned\ndiffusion process, where modified identity embeddings ensure the anonymized\nface is distinct from the original identity. Our approach also supports\nlocalized anonymization, giving users control over which facial regions are\nanonymized or kept intact. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art\nmethods show our approach excels in anonymization, attribute preservation, and\nimage quality. Its flexibility, robustness, and practicality make it\nwell-suited for real-world applications. Code and data can be found at\nhttps://github.com/hanweikung/nullface .",

Considering\na multi-stage decision framework helps to quantify the benefits of being able\nto adapt decisions to newly available information. The drawback is that\nmulti-stage stochastic optimization approaches lead to very challenging\nformulations. This is because they usually rely on scenario tree\nrepresentations of the uncertainty, which grow exponentially in the number of\ndecision stages. Thus, even for a moderate number of decision stages it becomes\ndifficult to solve the problem by means of a compact optimization model. To\naddress this issue, we propose a progressive hedging algorithm and we\ninvestigate and tune the crucial penalty parameter that influences the\nconflicting goals of fast convergence and solution quality. While low penalty\nparameters usually lead to high quality solutions, this comes at the cost of\nslow convergence. To tackle this problem, we adapt metaheuristic adjustment\nstrategies to guide the algorithm towards a consensus more efficiently.\nFurthermore, we consider several options to compute the consensus solution.\nWhile averaging the subproblem decisions is a common choice, we also apply a\nmajority voting procedure. We test different algorithm configurations and\ncompare the results of progressive hedging to the solutions obtained by solving\na compact optimization model on well-known benchmark instances. For several\nproblem instances the progressive hedging algorithm converges to solutions\nwithin 1% of the cost of the compact model's solution, while requiring shorter\nruntimes.",

We introduce MoEShard, an inference system that achieves perfect\nload balancing through tensor sharding of MoE experts. Unlike existing\napproaches that rely on heuristic capacity factors or drop tokens, MoEShard\nevenly distributes computation across GPUs and ensures full token retention,\nmaximizing utilization regardless of routing skewness. We achieve this through\na strategic row- and column-wise decomposition of expert matrices. This reduces\nidle time and avoids bottlenecks caused by imbalanced expert assignments.\nFurthermore, MoEShard minimizes kernel launches by fusing decomposed expert\ncomputations, significantly improving throughput. We evaluate MoEShard against\nDeepSpeed on encoder-based architectures, demonstrating speedups of up to\n6.4$\\times$ in time to first token (TTFT). Our results show that tensor\nsharding, when properly applied to experts, is a viable and effective strategy\nfor efficient MoE inference.",

Combining Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and massive\nMulti-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) enhances spectral efficiency, power efficiency,\nand device connectivity. However, deploying MIMO-NOMA in dense networks poses\nchallenges in managing interference and optimizing power allocation while\nensuring that the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) meets required\nthresholds. Unlike previous studies that analyze user clustering and power\nallocation techniques under simplified assumptions, this work provides a\ncomparative evaluation of multiple clustering and allocation strategies under\nidentical spatially correlated network conditions. We focus on maximizing the\nnumber of served users under a given Quality of Service (QoS) constraint rather\nthan the conventional sum-rate maximization approach. Additionally, we consider\nspatial correlation in user grouping, a factor often overlooked despite its\nimportance in mitigating intra-cluster interference. We evaluate clustering\nalgorithms, including user pairing, random clustering, Correlation Iterative\nClustering Algorithm (CIA), K-means++-based User Clustering (KUC), and Grey\nWolf Optimizer-based clustering (GWO), in a downlink spatially correlated\nMIMO-NOMA environment. Numerical results demonstrate that the GWO-based\nclustering algorithm achieves superior energy efficiency while maintaining\nscalability, whereas CIA effectively maximizes the number of served users.\nThese findings provide valuable insights for designing MIMO-NOMA systems that\noptimize resource allocation in next-generation wireless networks.",

The\ncoefficient matrix is assumed to be symmetric positive definite and spectrally\nequivalent to an average matrix for all parameters in a given set. We develop a\nRitz method for rapidly approximating the eigenvalues on the spectral interval\nof interest $(0,\\Lambda)$ for given parameter value. The Ritz subspace is the\nsame for all parameters and it is designed based on the observation that any\neigenvector can be split into two components. The first component belongs to a\nsubspace spanned by some eigenvectors of the average matrix. The second\ncomponent is defined by a correction operator that is a d + 1 dimensional\nanalytic function. We use this structure and build our Ritz subspace from\neigenvectors of the average matrix and samples of the correction operator. The\nsamples are evaluated at interpolation points related to a sparse polynomial\ninterpolation method. We show that the resulting Ritz subspace can approximate\neigenvectors of the original problem related to the spectral interval of\ninterest with the same accuracy as the sparse polynomial interpolation\napproximates the correction operator. Bound for Ritz eigenvalue error follows\nfrom this and known results. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerical\nexamples.

On\ndemagnetizing these nanomagnet arrays using a magnetic field protocol and\nsubsequently imaging the magnetic configuration using magnetic force\nmicroscopy, we observe different types of magnetic order. We compare our\nexperimental results with those predicted by Monte Carlo simulations to assign\nan effective temperature to each lattice.

This reflects the difficulty of obtaining system-spanning order in\nlattices with out-of-plane nanomagnets. We consider to what extent\nfurther-neighbor interactions affect the phase diagram and spin-spin\ncorrelations in each lattice, illustrating our results with four example\nlattices. We can divide the lattices into three main categories: bipartite\nlattices that admit a perfect antiferromagnetic ground state, frustrated\nlattices where ordering proceeds via a single step, and frustrated lattices\nwith two-step-ordering.

    "abstract": "The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is critical to achieving\nsustainable transportation, but challenges such as limited driving range and\ninsufficient charging infrastructure have hindered the widespread adoption of\nEVs, especially in time-sensitive logistics such as medical transportation.\nThis paper presents a new model to break through this barrier by combining\nwireless mobile charging technology with optimization. We propose the Wireless\nMobile Charging Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (WMC-EVRP), which enables\nMedical Transportation Electric Vehicles (MTEVs) to be charged while traveling\nvia Mobile Charging Carts (MCTs). This eliminates the time wastage of stopping\nfor charging and ensures uninterrupted operation of MTEVs for such\ntime-sensitive transportation problems. However, in this problem, the decisions\nof these two types of heterogeneous vehicles are coupled with each other, which\ngreatly increases the difficulty of vehicle routing optimizations. To address\nthis complex problem, we develop a mathematical model and a tailored\nmeta-heuristic algorithm that combines Bit Mask Dynamic Programming (BDP) and\nLarge Neighborhood Search (LNS). The BDP approach efficiently optimizes\ncharging strategies, while the LNS framework utilizes custom operators to\noptimize the MTEV routes under capacity and synchronization constraints.

    "abstract": "The growing use of generative models in daily life calls for efficient\nmechanisms to control their generation, to e.g., produce safe content or\nprovide users with tools to explore style changes. Ideally, such mechanisms\nshould be cheap, both at train and inference time, while preserving output\nquality. Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by\nintervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting\ndistributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a\nsource vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap,\nthese fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not\naccounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions\nthat cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work\nlinear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a\nglobal loss that accounts simultaneously for all layerwise distributional\nshifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be\nregularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron\nand layer selection. Empirically, LinEAS only requires a handful of samples to\nbe effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation, while\nperforming on par with far more involved finetuning approaches. We show that\nLinEAS interventions can be composed, study the impact of sparsity on their\nperformance, and showcase applications in text-to-image diffusions.",

TurboAE addressed this challenge by focusing on bit-sequence inputs\nrather than symbol-level representations, transforming the scalability issue\nassociated with large message sets into a sequence modeling problem. While\nrecurrent neural networks (RNNs) were a natural fit for sequence processing,\ntheir reliance on sequential computations made them computationally expensive\nand inefficient for long sequences. As a result, TurboAE adopted convolutional\nnetwork blocks, which were faster to train and more scalable, but lacked the\nsequential modeling advantages of RNNs. Recent advances in efficient RNN\narchitectures, such as minGRU and minLSTM, and structured state space models\n(SSMs) like S4 and S6, overcome these limitations by significantly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. These models enable scalable sequence\nprocessing, making RNNs competitive for long-sequence tasks.

This is an\nunavoidable limitation, for a switching signal whose future values may be\nunavailable, when no constraint is imposed on the values of delay and dwell\ntime (as it is the case here). We establish (uniform) stability of the\nclosed-loop system employing a Lyapunov functional. The key step in the\nstability proof is constructive derivation of an estimate of the mismatch\nbetween an exact predictor feedback and the average of predictor feedbacks\nconstructed. We illustrate the performance of the proposed predictor-based\ncontrol law in simulation, including comparisons with alternative,\npredictor-based control laws.",

    "abstract": "Robotics and automation are increasingly influential in logistics but remain\nlargely confined to traditional warehouses. In grocery retail, advancements\nsuch as cashier-less supermarkets exist, yet customers still manually pick and\npack groceries. While there has been a substantial focus in robotics on the bin\npicking problem, the task of packing objects and groceries has remained largely\nuntouched. However, packing grocery items in the right order is crucial for\npreventing product damage, e.g., heavy objects should not be placed on top of\nfragile ones. However, the exact criteria for the right packing order are hard\nto define, in particular given the huge variety of objects typically found in\nstores. In this paper, we introduce LLM-Pack, a novel approach for grocery\npacking. LLM-Pack leverages language and vision foundation models for\nidentifying groceries and generating a packing sequence that mimics human\npacking strategy. LLM-Pack does not require dedicated training to handle new\ngrocery items and its modularity allows easy upgrades of the underlying\nfoundation models. We extensively evaluate our approach to demonstrate its\nperformance. We will make the source code of LLMPack publicly available upon\nthe publication of this manuscript.",

    "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are increasingly being used for cosmological\napplications such as measuring the Hubble constant and baryon abundance. The\nincreasing number of localized FRBs and precise measurement of dispersion\nmeasure (DM) make them a suitable probe for such an approach. We use a sample\nof 110 localized FRBs as well as a small sub-sample of 24 FRBs with scattering\ntimescale measurements or limits. We infer the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the\nDM distribution of the host galaxies simultaneously by fitting our model to the\nFRB DM measurements. With current data, our results are in agreement with both\nhigh and low redshift measurements of $H_0$, obtained using Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae data respectively. We project that with\nabout 200 localized FRBs, we would be in a position to distinguish between the\ntwo scenarios at 4$\\sigma$ confidence. In addition, the host DM is expected to\nbe related to star formation in the host galaxy and the stellar age of the\nprogenitors. Using our inferred host galaxy DMs, we are able to rule out (at 95\npercent confidence) a majority of localized FRB progenitors originating from\nyoung sources with stellar ages less than 10 Myr. This might reflect a large\npopulation of old sources or an observational bias against detecting FRBs from\nyoung sources, which may be associated with long scatter broadening times and\nlarge DM from their source environments. Indeed, we find that scatter\nbroadening times of FRBs are inconsistent with the Milky Way ISM, but at the\nsame time, do not appear to be strongly correlated with the FRBs' redshift or\nwith the SFR or stellar mass of their host galaxies. This suggests that\nscattering is dominated by the immediate environment of the sources.",

One popular idea\ninvolves interactions between neutrinos and ultralight dark matter, described\nas fields or particles with masses $m_\\phi \\ll 10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Due to the\nlarge phase-space number density, this type of dark matter exists in coherent\nstates and can be effectively described by an oscillating classical field. As a\nresult, neutrino mass-squared differences undergo field-induced interference in\nspacetime, potentially generating detectable effects in oscillation\nexperiments. We demonstrate that if $m_\\phi\\gg 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, the\nmechanism becomes sensitive to dark matter density fluctuations, which\nsuppresses the oscillatory behavior of flavor-changing probabilities as a\nfunction of neutrino propagation distance in a model-independent way, thereby\nruling out this regime. Furthermore, by analyzing data from the Kamioka Liquid\nScintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND), a benchmark long-baseline reactor\nexperiment, we show that the hypothesis of a dark origin for the neutrino\nmasses is disfavored for $m_\\phi \\ll 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, compared to the\ncase of constant mass values in vacuum.

They generalize both deterministic parity (DPW) and minimized\nhistory-deterministic co-B\\\"uchi automata (with transition based acceptance,\nHdTbcBW) while combining their favorable properties. In particular, rerailing\nautomata can represent arbitrary $\\omega$-regular languages while allowing for\npolynomial-time minimization, just as HdTbcBW do. Since DPW are a special case\nof rerailing automata, a minimized rerailing automaton is never larger than the\nsmallest deterministic parity automaton for the same language. We also show\nthat rerailing automata can be used as a replacement for deterministic parity\nautomata for the realizability check of open systems.\n  The price to be paid to obtain the useful properties of rerailing automata is\nthat the acceptance condition in such automata refers to the dominating colors\nalong all runs for a given word, where just as in parity automata, the\ndominating color along a run is the lowest one occurring infinitely often along\nit. A rerailing automaton accepts those words for which the greatest of the\ndominating colors along the runs is even. Additionally, rerailing automata\nguarantee that every prefix of a run for a word can be extended to eventually\nreach a point from which all runs for the word extending the prefix have the\nsame dominating color, and it is even if and only if the word is in the\nlanguage of the automaton. We show that these properties together allow\ncharacterizing the role of each state in such an automaton in a way that\nrelates it to state combinations in a sequence of co-B\\\"uchi automata for the\nrepresented language.

The SVM-based RIP method showed the second-best\nperformance when using random sampling and SMOTE.

For finetuning in\nthe online environment, we exploit the knowledge from the pretrained model and\nintroduce a disentanglement constraint to the world model.

To overcome\nthe scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera\nsettings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild\nimages with synthetic blur augmentations, providing diverse scenes and subjects\nas well as supervision to learn the separation of image content from lens blur.\nCentral to our framework is our grounded self-attention mechanism, trained on\nimage pairs with different bokeh levels of the same scene, which enables blur\nstrength to be adjusted in both directions while preserving the underlying\nscene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables flexible,\nlens-like blur control, supports downstream applications such as real image\nediting via inversion, and generalizes effectively across both Stable Diffusion\nand FLUX architectures.",

Various experimental schemes\nto generate high-energy vortex particles have been proposed.

We recently proposed a novel experimental detection scheme\nbased on a mechanism called \"superkick\" that is free from many drawbacks of the\ntraditional methods and can reveal the vortex phase characteristics. In this\npaper, we present a complete theoretical framework for calculating the\nsuperkick effect in elastic electron scattering and systematically investigate\nthe impact of various factors on its visibility.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the receptivity of non-modal perturbations in\nhypersonic boundary layers over a blunt wedge subject to freestream vortical,\nentropy and acoustic perturbations. Due to the absence of the Mack-mode\ninstability and the rather weak entropy-layer instability, the non-modal\nperturbation is considered as the dominant factor triggering transition. This\nis a highly intricate problem, given the complexities arising from the presence\nof the bow shock, entropy layer, and their interactions with oncoming\ndisturbances. To tackle this challenge, we develop a novel numerical tool, the\nshock-fitting harmonic linearized Navier-Stokes (SF-HLNS) approach, which\noffers a comprehensive investigation on the dependence of the receptivity\nefficiency on the nose bluntness and properties of the freestream forcing. The\nnumerical findings suggest that the non-modal perturbations are more\nsusceptible to freestream acoustic and entropy perturbations compared to the\nvortical perturbations, with the optimal spanwise length scale being comparable\nwith the downstream boundary-layer thickness. Notably, as the nose bluntness\nincreases, the receptivity to the acoustic and entropy perturbations\nintensifies, reflecting the transition reversal phenomenon observed\nexperimentally in configurations with relatively large bluntness. In contrast,\nthe receptivity to freestream vortical perturbations weakens with increasing\nbluntness. Additionally, through the SF-HLNS calculations, we examine the\ncredibility of the optimal growth theory (OGT) on describing the evolution of\nnon-modal perturbations. Its accuracy in predicting the early-stage evolution\nand the energy amplification proves to be unreliable. Given its high-efficiency\nand high-accuracy nature, the SF-HLNS approach shows great potential as a\nvaluable tool for conducting future research on hypersonic blunt-body\nboundary-layer transition.",

The\nreconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge, so\nintroducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction\nquality. On the other hand, pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior\nknowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability, but\nit requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In\nthis paper, we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained\ndiffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps\nfor image CS. Specifically, we first design an iterative optimization algorithm\nnamed Diffusion Message Passing (DMP), which embeds a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel into each iteration process of DMP. Then, we deeply unfold the DMP\nalgorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use\nlightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the\nintermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate\nthe divergence of the diffusion model, thereby further improving reconstruction\nefficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DMP-DUN achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and requires at least only 2 steps to reconstruct\nthe image.

We find that the\nrank-size distribution of hourly inflows over the course of the day is stable\nacross cities. To uncover the microdynamics beneath the stable aggregate\ndistribution amidst shifting location inflows, we analyzed consecutive-hour\ninflow size and ranking variations. Our findings reveal a dichotomy: locations\nwith higher daily average inflow display a clear monotonic trend, with more\npronounced increases or decreases in consecutive-hour inflow. In contrast,\nranking variations exhibit a non-monotonic pattern, distinguished by the\nstability of not only the top and bottom rankings but also those in\nmoderately-inflowed locations. Finally, we compare ranking dynamics across\ncities using a ranking metric, the rank turnover. The results advance our\nunderstanding of urban mobility dynamics, providing a basis for applications in\nurban planning and traffic engineering.",

    "abstract": "In the domain of emotion recognition using body motion, the primary challenge\nlies in the scarcity of diverse and generalizable datasets. Automatic emotion\nrecognition uses machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to\nrecognize a person's emotional state from various data types, such as text,\nimages, sound, and body motion. Body motion poses unique challenges as many\nfactors, such as age, gender, ethnicity, personality, and illness, affect its\nappearance, leading to a lack of diverse and robust datasets specifically for\nemotion recognition. To address this, employing Synthetic Data Generation (SDG)\nmethods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto\nEncoders (VAEs), offers potential solutions, though these methods are often\ncomplex. This research introduces a novel application of the Neural Gas Network\n(NGN) algorithm for synthesizing body motion data and optimizing diversity and\ngeneration speed. By learning skeletal structure topology, the NGN fits the\nneurons or gas particles on body joints. Generated gas particles, which form\nthe skeletal structure later on, will be used to synthesize the new body\nposture. By attaching body postures over frames, the final synthetic body\nmotion appears. We compared our generated dataset against others generated by\nGANs, VAEs, and another benchmark algorithm, using benchmark metrics such as\nFr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID), Diversity, and a few more. Furthermore, we\ncontinued evaluation using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision,\nrecall, and a few others. Joint-related features or kinematic parameters were\nextracted, and the system assessed model performance against unseen data. Our\nfindings demonstrate that the NGN algorithm produces more realistic and\nemotionally distinct body motion data and does so with more synthesizing speed\nthan existing methods.",

We illustrate the effectiveness of\nthe method by studying dimensionality effects and size-dependence of thermal\nconduction, properties of crucial importance for understanding heat transfer at\nthe micro-nanoscale. We provide a sound numerical evidence that the simple MPC\nfluid displays the features previously predicted from hydrodynamics of lattice\nsystems: (1) in 1D, the thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ diverges with the system\nsize $L$ as $\\kappa\\sim L^{1/3}$ and its total heat current autocorrelation\nfunction $C(t)$ decays with the time $t$ as $C(t)\\sim t^{-2/3}$; (2) in 2D,\n$\\kappa$ diverges with $L$ as $\\kappa\\sim \\mathrm{ln} (L)$ and its $C(t)$\ndecays with $t$ as $C(t)\\sim t^{-1}$; (3) in 3D, its $\\kappa$ is independent\nwith $L$ and its $C(t)$ decays with $t$ as $C(t)\\sim t^{-3/2}$. For weak\ninteraction (the nearly integrable case) in 1D and 2D, there exists an\nintermediate regime of sizes where kinetic effects dominate and transport is\ndiffusive before crossing over to expected anomalous regime. The crossover can\nbe studied by decomposing the heat current in two contributions, which allows\nfor a very accurate test of the predictions. In addition, we also show that\nupon increasing the aspect ratio of the system, there exists a dimensional\ncrossover from 2D or 3D dimensional behavior to the 1D one.

Our analysis is conducted for three surrounding fields corresponding to\nthree different values of the parameter $\\omega$ of the equations of state,\neach representing a unique class of BH solutions. A universal method developed\nby V.~Bozza is employed for strong lensing analysis and the WKB approximation\nmethod to compute the QNMs of oscillation of the BHs.

For a specific values of $\\beta$ and $c_2$, BHs\nwith different field configurations exhibit substantial variations in their\nobservable properties. The variation of amplitude and damping of QNMs with\nrespect to the model parameter $\\beta$ and $c_2$ is analyzed for the BHs.

In this paper, we aim at providing numerical\nframeworks to extract optimal forcings and responses of the mean resolvent,\nalso known as mean resolvent modes. For periodic flows, we rewrite the mean\nresolvent operator in terms of a harmonic resolvent operator (Wereley & Hall\n1990; Padovan & Rowley 2022) to obtain reference mean resolvent modes.\nSuccessively, we propose a projection algorithm approximating those modes\nwithin a subspace of mean-flow resolvent modes. The projected problem is\ndirectly solved in the frequency domain, but we also discuss a time-stepper\nversion that can bypass the explicit construction of the operator without\nrecurring to direct-adjoint looping. We evaluate the algorithms on an\nincompressible axisymmetric laminar jet periodically forced at the inlet. For a\nweakly unsteady case, the mean-flow resolvent correctly approximates the main\nreceptivity peak of the mean resolvent, but completely fails to capture a\nsecondary receptivity peak. For a strongly unsteady case, even the main\nreceptivity peak of the mean resolvent is incorrectly captured by the mean-flow\nresolvent. Although the present algorithms are currently restricted to periodic\nflows, input projection may be a key ingredient to extend mean resolvent\nanalysis to more complex statistically steady flows.",

The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed\nand potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized,\ncontinuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as\nparametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task\nparameters to be ($\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_l$, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_u$), a novel\n($\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_l$, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_u$)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to\noperate in two complementary modes. In an offline optimization mode, a joint\nsearch over solution and task spaces is carried out with the creation of two\napproximation models: (1) for mapping points in a unified solution space to the\nobjective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting\nas a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically\nmapping tasks to their corresponding solutions, which facilitates evolutionary\nexploration of under-explored regions of the task space. In the online mode,\nthe derived models enable direct optimization of any task within the bounds\nwithout the need to search from scratch. This outcome is validated on both\nsynthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant\nreal-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot\ncontrollers under changing task conditions.

    "abstract": "Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the learned style onto an arbitrary\ncontent image. However, most existing style transfer methods can only render\nconsistent artistic stylized images, making it difficult for users to get\nenough stylized images to enjoy. To solve this issue, we propose a novel\nartistic style transfer framework called DyArtbank, which can generate diverse\nand highly realistic artistic stylized images. Specifically, we introduce a\nDynamic Style Prompt ArtBank (DSPA), a set of learnable parameters. It can\nlearn and store the style information from the collection of artworks,\ndynamically guiding pre-trained stable diffusion to generate diverse and highly\nrealistic artistic stylized images. DSPA can also generate random artistic\nimage samples with the learned style information, providing a new idea for data\naugmentation. Besides, a Key Content Feature Prompt (KCFP) module is proposed\nto provide sufficient content prompts for pre-trained stable diffusion to\npreserve the detailed structure of the input content image. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments verify the effectiveness of our\nproposed method. Code is available: https://github.com/Jamie-Cheung/DyArtbank",

A comprehensive\nevaluation includes an assessment of the agreement between the estimated risks\nand the observed outcomes, also known as calibration. Calibration is of utmost\nimportance for clinical decision making with prediction models and it may vary\nbetween clusters. We present three approaches to take clustering into account\nwhen evaluating calibration. (1) Clustered group calibration (CG-C), (2) two\nstage meta-analysis calibration (2MA-C) and (3) mixed model calibration (MIX-C)\ncan obtain flexible calibration plots with random effects modelling and\nproviding confidence and prediction intervals. As a case example, we externally\nvalidate a model to estimate the risk that an ovarian tumor is malignant in\nmultiple centers (N = 2489). We also conduct a simulation study and synthetic\ndata study generated from a true clustered dataset to evaluate the methods. In\nthe simulation and the synthetic data analysis MIX-C gave estimated curves\nclosest to the true overall and center specific curves. Prediction interval was\nbest for 2MA-C with splines. Standard flexible calibration worked likewise in\nterms of calibration error when sample size is limited. We recommend using\n2MA-C (splines) to estimate the curve with the average effect and the 95% PI\nand MIX-C for the cluster specific curves, specially when sample size per\ncluster is limited.

We performed spectral studies in the\nenergy range 0.6-10 keV by fitting X-ray spectra of the pointed observations\nwith power law (PL) and log parabolic (LP) models. We found at 99% confidence\nlevel that 31 of these X-ray spectra were best fitted with a range of LP models\nwith local photon indices (at 1.0 keV), alpha in the range of 1.75-2.66, and\nconvex curvature parameter beta in the range of 0.02-0.25. PL models with\nphoton index Gamma in the range of 1.78-2.68 best described the spectra of\nfourteen-pointed observations. Nine PN spectra resulted in negative curvature\nparameters in fitting an LP model, and eight among them were significant (beta\nis at least twice beta_err). We fitted broken power law (BPL) models to these\neight X-ray spectra and found spectral hardening (Delta_Gamma) in the range of\n0.06-0.54 for these observations. EPIC-MOS spectra were also studied for those\neight observations to search for similar trends, and we were able to find them\nin only two, one observation each of PKS 0548-322 and Mrk 501.

    "abstract": "The allocation of tasks to a large number of distributed satellites is a\ndifficult problem owing to dynamic changes in massive tasks and the complex\nmatching of tasks to satellites. To reduce the complexity of the problem, tasks\nthat are geographically close can be divided into a predefined grid with a\nspecific time window and processed together. The problem then becomes a dynamic\ngrid with time-window allocation problem (DGAP). To ensure consistent\nvisibility between satellites and grids, the timeline of the DGAP is\npartitioned into several decision-making stages that are determined by dynamic\nchanges in the time window. Subsequently, the DGAP can be resolved\nprogressively adopting the potential game approach in the single-stage DGAP\n(sDGAP). First, to solve the discontinuity in the goal of the sDGAP, we\napproximate the goal by a smooth exponential sum function that we regard as the\nglobal utility function. Second, a potential game theoretic framework is\nconstructed by decomposing this global utility function into the local utility\nfunctions of individuals. We prove that each Nash equilibrium of the proposed\npotential game is the optimal solution of the sDGAP. Third, to solve the\npotential game, a distributed algorithm, referred to as the selective\ntime-variant better reply process (SeTVBRP) algorithm, is proposed and its\nconvergence is proved. The SeTVBRP algorithm is an improved algorithm based on\nthe better reply process algorithm, where two improvement methods (i.e., the\nselective action method and time-variant parameter method) are introduced.\nThrough factor analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the two\nimprovement methods for the sDGAP. Last, numerical results show that the\nproposed algorithm outperforms existing learning algorithms and is effective in\nsolving the DGAP.",

In males, mental illness\noccurred along with upper gastrointestinal conditions (specifically reflux\ndisorders), while in females, mental illness presented alongside reflux\ndisorders, chronic pain, and endocrine conditions such as thyroid problems.\nAmong young males with intellectual disability, the combination of cerebral\npalsy with dysphagia, epilepsy, chronic constipation, and chronic pneumonia\nrepresents a distinctive pattern. In those aged 45-64, we observed early onset\nof lifestyle conditions like diabetes and hypertension, though notably these\nconditions co-occurred with mental illness and anaemia at rates exceeding those\nin the general population.

To resolve\nthis, we propose Latent Consistency Tokenizer (Layton) that bridges discrete\nvisual tokens with the compact latent space of pre-trained Latent Diffusion\nModels (LDMs), enabling efficient representation of 1024x1024 images using only\n256 tokens-a 16 times compression over VQGAN. Layton integrates a transformer\nencoder, a quantized codebook, and a latent consistency decoder. Direct\napplication of LDM as the decoder results in color and brightness\ndiscrepancies. Thus, we convert it to latent consistency decoder, reducing\nmulti-step sampling to 1-2 steps for direct pixel-level supervision.\nExperiments demonstrate Layton's superiority in high-fidelity reconstruction,\nwith 10.8 reconstruction Frechet Inception Distance on MSCOCO-2017 5K benchmark\nfor 1024x1024 image reconstruction. We also extend Layton to a text-to-image\ngeneration model, LaytonGen, working in autoregression. It achieves 0.73 score\non GenEval benchmark, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

Using fluorescence microscopy and\nthree-dimensional tracking, we observe that the swimming direction of C.\nreinhardtii is strongly influenced by the geometric constraints of the SPM. Our\nresults show that cells tend to aggregate at the bottom of the SPM rather than\nthe top, and exhibit a speed orientation tendency near the microstructure.

In the\ncommunity, various data-driven approaches have been developed to address this\nissue, yet their effectiveness is limited. This is mainly because most existing\ncrowd counting datasets on which the methods are trained are based on passive\ncameras, restricting their ability to fully sense the environment. Recently,\nembodied navigation methods have shown significant potential in precise object\ndetection in interactive scenes. These methods incorporate active camera\nsettings, holding promise in addressing the fundamental issues in crowd\ncounting. However, most existing methods are designed for indoor navigation,\nshowing unknown performance in analyzing complex object distribution in large\nscale scenes, such as crowds. Besides, most existing embodied navigation\ndatasets are indoor scenes with limited scale and object quantity, preventing\nthem from being introduced into dense crowd analysis. Based on this, a novel\ntask, Embodied Crowd Counting (ECC), is proposed. We first build up an\ninteractive simulator, Embodied Crowd Counting Dataset (ECCD), which enables\nlarge scale scenes and large object quantity. A prior probability distribution\nthat approximates realistic crowd distribution is introduced to generate\ncrowds. Then, a zero-shot navigation method (ZECC) is proposed. This method\ncontains a MLLM driven coarse-to-fine navigation mechanism, enabling active\nZ-axis exploration, and a normal-line-based crowd distribution analysis method\nfor fine counting.

    "abstract": "In this work, we revisit the phase diagram of the $t$-$t^\\prime$-$\\delta$\nFermi-Hubbard model on the square lattice to gain a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of this correlated model at half filling. This model has recently\nbecome a prominent topic of research because it hosts altermagnetic phases.\nUsing mean-field analysis, we identify four metallic phases and two insulating\nphases with nontrivial magnetic orders at an intermediate value of $\\delta =\n0.5$, presenting a rich ground-state phase diagram in the $U$-$t^\\prime$ plane.\nWe also highlight the distinct features of the Fermi surface topology for each\nmetallic phase. To go beyond the mean-field theory, we employ the\ndensity-matrix renormalization group method to simulate the ground state\nnumerically. The phase boundaries are determined from the discontinuities and\npeaks in the entanglement entropy and magnetizations. In addition to the phases\nidentified in the mean-field theory, we find a valence-bond solid state in a\nnarrow intermediate-$t'$ region. Our work offers a firm step forward in\nunderstanding the complex behaviors of correlated electrons in the\n$t$-$t^\\prime$-$\\delta$ Hubbard model over a large parameter space.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains are among the most powerful technologies to realize decentralized\ninformation systems. In order to safely enjoy all guarantees provided by a\nblockchain, one should maintain a full node, therefore maintaining an updated\nlocal copy of the ledger. This allows one to locally verify transactions,\nstates of smart contracts, and to compute any information over them.\n  Unfortunately, for obvious practical reasons, a very large part of\nblockchain-based information systems consists of users relying on clients that\naccess data stored in blockchains only through servers, without verifying what\nis received. In notable use cases, the user has application-specific queries\nthat can be answered only by very few servers, sometimes all belonging to the\nsame organization. This clearly re-introduces a single point of failure.\n  In this work we present an architecture allowing superlight clients (i.e.,\nclients that do not want to download the involved transactions) to outsource\nthe computation of a query to a (possibly untrusted) server, receiving a\ntrustworthy answer. Our architecture relies on the power of SNARKs and makes\nthem lighter to compute by using data obtained from full nodes and blockchain\nexplorers, possibly leveraging the existence of smart contracts.\n  The viability of our architecture is confirmed by an experimental evaluation\non concrete scenarios. Our work paves the road towards blockchain-based\ninformation systems that remain decentralized and reliable even when users rely\non common superlight clients (e.g., smartphones).",

In this case, the ADC in the receive path\nrequires considerable attention due its possibly overloaded operation outside\nthe intended range. Using neural-network-based architectures of the transmitter\nnonlinearity, we therefore describe and compare four system options for SIC\nmodel optimization with different treatment of the receiver ADC in the learning\nprocess.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the need to analyze continuously updated data sets in the\ncontext of time-to-event modeling, we propose a novel nonparametric approach to\nestimate the conditional hazard function given a set of continuous and discrete\npredictors. The method is based on a representation of the conditional hazard\nas a ratio between a joint density and a conditional expectation determined by\nthe distribution of the observed variables. It is shown that such ratio\nrepresentations are available for uni- and bivariate time-to-events, in the\npresence of common types of random censoring, truncation, and with possibly\ncured individuals, as well as for competing risks. This opens the door to\nnonparametric approaches in many time-to-event predictive models. To estimate\njoint densities and conditional expectations we propose the recursive kernel\nsmoothing, which is well suited for online estimation. Asymptotic results for\nsuch estimators are derived and it is shown that they achieve optimal\nconvergence rates. Simulation experiments show the good finite sample\nperformance of our recursive estimator with right censoring. The method is\napplied to a real dataset of primary breast cancer.",

More specifically, given a vector\nfield $ f:\\mathbb{R}^{D}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{D}$ governing a dynamical\nsystem defined by the autonomous ODE: $y' = f(y)$, we assume that the\nobservations are $\\tilde{y}_{X_{i}}(t_{j}) = y_{X_{i}}(t_{j}) +\n\\varepsilon_{i,j}$ where $y_{X_{i}}(t_{j})$ is the solution of the ODE at time\n$t_{j}$ with initial condition $y(0) = X_{i}$, $X_{i}$ is sampled from a\nprobability distribution $\\mu$, and $\\varepsilon_{i,j}$ some noise. In this\ncontext, we investigate, from a minimax perspective, the pointwise\nreconstruction of $f$ within the envelope of trajectories originating from the\nsupport of $\\mu$. We propose an estimation strategy based on preliminary flow\nreconstruction and techniques from derivative estimation in non-parametric\nregression. Under mild assumptions on $f$, we establish convergence rates that\ndepend on the temporal resolution, the number of sampled initial values and the\nmass concentration of $\\mu$. Importantly, we show that these rates are minimax\noptimal. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our results in a manifold\nlearning setting, providing insights into how our approach can mitigate the\ncurse of dimensionality.",

    "abstract": "Recent image generation schemes typically capture image distribution in a\npre-constructed latent space relying on a frozen image tokenizer. Though the\nperformance of tokenizer plays an essential role to the successful generation,\nits current evaluation metrics (e.g. rFID) fail to precisely assess the\ntokenizer and correlate its performance to the generation quality (e.g. gFID).\nIn this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for the discrepancy of\nreconstruction and generation qualities in a discrete latent space, and, from\nwhich, we propose a novel plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme to facilitate\nlatent space construction. Specifically, a latent perturbation approach is\nproposed to simulate sampling noises, i.e., the unexpected tokens sampled, from\nthe generative process. With the latent perturbation, we further propose (1) a\nnovel tokenizer evaluation metric, i.e., pFID, which successfully correlates\nthe tokenizer performance to generation quality and (2) a plug-and-play\ntokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of\ntokenizer thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed. Extensive\nbenchmarking are conducted with 11 advanced discrete image tokenizers with 2\nautoregressive generation models to validate our approach.

However, due to the discrete nature and the insufficient material\ndescription of point cloud representations, there are ambiguities in\ndistinguishing wire-like and flat surfaces, as well as transparent or\nreflective objects. To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Splatting (GS)\npoint cloud-based 3D classification. We find that the scale and rotation\ncoefficients in the GS point cloud help characterize surface types.\nSpecifically, wire-like surfaces consist of multiple slender Gaussian\nellipsoids, while flat surfaces are composed of a few flat Gaussian ellipsoids.\nAdditionally, the opacity in the GS point cloud represents the transparency\ncharacteristics of objects. As a result, ambiguities in point cloud-based 3D\nclassification can be mitigated utilizing GS point cloud as input. To verify\nthe effectiveness of GS point cloud input, we construct the first real-world GS\npoint cloud dataset in the community, which includes 20 categories with 200\nobjects in each category. Experiments not only validate the superiority of GS\npoint cloud input, especially in distinguishing ambiguous objects, but also\ndemonstrate the generalization ability across different classification methods.",

Leveraging the large-scale\nparallel computing capabilities of GPUs, contemporary humanoid robots can\nundergo extensive parallel training in simulated environments. A physical\nsimulation platform capable of large-scale parallel training is crucial for the\ndevelopment of humanoid robots. As one of the most complex robot forms,\nhumanoid robots typically possess intricate mechanical structures, encompassing\nnumerous series and parallel mechanisms. However, many reinforcement learning\nbased humanoid robot control algorithms currently employ open-loop topologies\nduring training, deferring the conversion to series-parallel structures until\nthe sim2real phase.

    "abstract": "Several planet formation models have been proposed to explain the gap in the\npopulation of planets between $1.8$ $R_\\oplus$ to $2.0$ $R_\\oplus$ known as the\nRadius Valley. To apply these models to confirmed exoplanets, accurate and\nprecise host star and planet parameters are required to ensure the observed\nmeasurements correctly match model predictions. Previous studies have\nemphasized the need for a larger, more precise sample to further confirm\ndominant formation processes. By enhancing standard SED (Spectral Energy\nDistribution) fitting using Bayesian methods we derived highly accurate and\nprecise host star and planet parameters. Specifically, we achieved median\nfractional uncertainties for stellar and planet radii of 2.4% and 3.4%,\nrespectively. We then produced the largest, most precise sample to date of 1923\nplanets when compared to previous studies. This full sample, as well as a\nsampled filtered for host stellar masses between $0.8$ and $1.2$ $M_\\odot$, are\nthen used to derive the slope and position of the radius valley as a function\nof orbital period, insolation flux and stellar mass to compare them to\npredictive models and previous observational results. Our results are\nconsistent with thermally-driven mass loss with a planet radius vs. orbital\nperiod slope of $-0.142$ $\\pm0.006$ for the full sample leaning toward\ncore-powered mass loss. The planet radius vs. insolation flux slope of $0.136$\n$\\pm0.014$ for the filtered sample leaned toward photoevaporation. Also, the\nslope as a function of stellar mass for both samples appear more consistent\nwith thermally driven processes when compared to models and previous studies.",

As such, they quantify uncertainties\narising from e.g. noisy or missing data, unknown PDE parameters or\ndiscretization error by design. Prior work has established connections to\nclassical PDE solvers and provided solid theoretical guarantees. However,\nscaling such methods to large-scale problems remains a fundamental challenge\nprimarily due to dense covariance matrices. Our approach addresses the\nscalability issues by leveraging the Markov property of many commonly used GP\npriors. It has been shown that such priors are solutions to stochastic PDEs\n(SPDEs) which when discretized allow for highly efficient GP regression through\nsparse linear algebra. In this work, we show how to leverage this prior class\nto make probabilistic PDE solvers practical, even for large-scale nonlinear\nPDEs, through greatly accelerated inference mechanisms.

Our approach is\nmotivated by the key observations that, MLLM's unreasonable attention\ndistribution causes features to be dominated by historical output tokens, which\nfurther contributes to hallucinated responses because of the distribution gap\nbetween different token types. Based on the observations, AttnReal recycles\nexcessive attention from output tokens and reallocates it to visual tokens,\nwhich reduces MLLM's reliance on language priors and ensures the decoding\nprocess depends more on the visual inputs.

A key challenge lies in uncovering the intrinsic\npatterns that govern predictability, beyond conventional designs, focusing on\nnetwork architectures to explore latent relationships or temporal dependencies.\nInspired by signal decomposition, this paper posits that time series\npredictability is derived from periodic characteristics at different\nfrequencies. Consequently, we propose a novel time series forecasting method\nbased on multi-frequency reference series correlation analysis. Through\nspectral analysis on long-term training data, we identify dominant spectral\ncomponents and their harmonics to design base-pattern reference series.

In this work, we analyze two\ncommon cases of MINT in machine translation-related tasks: filtering of\ntraining data, and decoding with quality signals.

    "abstract": "Superconductor-semiconductor hybrids are useful for realizing the Josephson\ndiode effect, where nonreciprocity in the supercurrents occurs due to the\ninterplay of the Josephson effect and applied magnetic fields. These junctions\ncan host Andreev and Majorana states with the same ingredients, though their\ninterplay with the Josephson diode effect is unclear. In this work, we consider\nshort Josephson junctions based on superconductor-semiconductor systems under\nhomogeneous Zeeman fields and investigate the Josephson diode effect in the\npresence of Andreev and Majorana states. Under generic conditions, the Zeeman\nfield component parallel to the spin-orbit axis promotes an asymmetric\nlow-energy energy spectrum as a function of the superconducting phase, which\npersists in the trivial and topological phases hosting Andreev and Majorana\nbound states, respectively. Interestingly, this asymmetry creates supercurrents\nthat are not odd functions of the phase difference, leading to a nonreciprocal\nbehaviour and the Josephson diode effect. We show that the Josephson diode\neffect is particularly promoted under the presence of both zero-energy Andreev\nand Majorana bound states, revealing that Josephson diodes can be realized in\nthe trivial and topological phases of superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. We\nthen demonstrate that the Zeeman field evolution of the diode's efficiencies\ncan map the topological phase transition and the formation of Majorana bound\nstates via an oscillatory behavior that becomes more visible in long\nsuperconductors. While Josephson diodes generally exist in the trivial and\ntopological phases of Josephson junctions, we discover that in the tunneling\nregime only a Josephson diode effect in the topological phase remains due to\nthe finite contribution of Majorana bound states. Our findings clarify the\nJosephson diode effect and aid in realizing Majorana-only Josephson diodes.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles necessitates comprehensive\nsimulation of multi-sensor data, encompassing inputs from both cameras and\nLiDAR sensors, across various dynamic driving scenarios. Neural rendering\ntechniques, which utilize collected raw sensor data to simulate these dynamic\nenvironments, have emerged as a leading methodology. While NeRF-based\napproaches can uniformly represent scenes for rendering data from both camera\nand LiDAR, they are hindered by slow rendering speeds due to dense sampling.\nConversely, Gaussian Splatting-based methods employ Gaussian primitives for\nscene representation and achieve rapid rendering through rasterization.\nHowever, these rasterization-based techniques struggle to accurately model\nnon-linear optical sensors. This limitation restricts their applicability to\nsensors beyond pinhole cameras. To address these challenges and enable unified\nrepresentation of dynamic driving scenarios using Gaussian primitives, this\nstudy proposes a novel hybrid approach. Our method utilizes rasterization for\nrendering image data while employing Gaussian ray-tracing for LiDAR data\nrendering. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

A collection of solutions of a single-player dynamical system\nsubject to a trimmed control set is used to characterise a viscosity\nsupersolution of a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation, which in turn yields an upper\nbound for the value function.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing offers a promising route for tackling hard optimization\nproblems by encoding them as Ising models. However, sparse qubit connectivity\nrequires the use of minor-embedding, mapping logical qubits onto chains of\nphysical qubits, which necessitates stronger intra-chain coupling to maintain\nconsistency. This elevated coupling strength forces a rescaling of the\nHamiltonian due to hardware-imposed limits on the allowable ranges of coupling\nstrengths, reducing the energy gaps between competing states, thus, degrading\nthe solver's performance. Here, we introduce a theoretical model that\nquantifies this degradation. We show that as the connectivity degree increases,\nthe effective temperature rises as a polynomial function, resulting in a\nsuccess probability that decays exponentially. Our analysis further establishes\nworst-case bounds on the energy scale degradation based on the inverse\nconductance of chain subgraphs, revealing two most important drivers of chain\nstrength, \\textit{chain volume} and \\textit{chain connectivity}. Our findings\nindicate that achieving quantum advantage is inherently challenging.\nExperiments on D-Wave quantum annealers validate these findings, highlighting\nthe need for hardware with improved connectivity and optimized scale-aware\nembedding algorithms.",

The LLM-based meta-surrogate treats fitness\nprediction as conditional probability estimation, employing a unified token\nsequence representation for task metadata, inputs, and outputs. This approach\nfacilitates efficient inter-task knowledge sharing through shared token\nembeddings and captures complex task dependencies via multi-task model\ntraining. Experimental results demonstrate the model's emergent generalization\nability, including zero-shot performance on problems with unseen dimensions.\nWhen integrated into evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO), our framework\nsupports dual-level knowledge transfer -- at both the surrogate and individual\nlevels -- enhancing optimization efficiency and robustness.

As a\ntypical BIP task, Burst Image Super-Resolution (BISR) has achieved notable\nprogress through deep learning in recent years. Existing BISR methods typically\ninvolve three key stages: alignment, upsampling, and fusion, often in varying\norders and implementations.

With the rapid advancement of reinforcement\nlearning, substantial progress has been made in the walking control of humanoid\nrobots. However, existing methods still face challenges when dealing with\ncomplex environments and irregular terrains. In the field of perceptive\nlocomotion, existing approaches are generally divided into two-stage methods\nand end-to-end methods. Two-stage methods first train a teacher policy in a\nsimulated environment and then use distillation techniques, such as DAgger, to\ntransfer the privileged information learned as latent features or actions to\nthe student policy. End-to-end methods, on the other hand, forgo the learning\nof privileged information and directly learn policies from a partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP) through reinforcement learning.\nHowever, due to the lack of supervision from a teacher policy, end-to-end\nmethods often face difficulties in training and exhibit unstable performance in\nreal-world applications. This paper proposes an innovative two-stage perceptive\nlocomotion framework that combines the advantages of teacher policies learned\nin a fully observable Markov decision process (MDP) to regularize and supervise\nthe student policy. At the same time, it leverages the characteristics of\nreinforcement learning to ensure that the student policy can continue to learn\nin a POMDP, thereby enhancing the model's upper bound.

Through a sequential Stackelberg-type game, brokers manage trading\ncosts and adverse selection with an informed trader. In particular, supplying\nliquidity to the informed traders allows the brokers to speculate based on the\nflow information. They simultaneously attempt to minimize inventory risk and\ntrading costs with the lit market based on the informed order flow, also known\nas the internalization-externalization strategy. We solve in closed form for\nthe trading strategy that the informed trader uses with each broker and propose\na system of equations which classify the equilibrium strategies of the brokers.\nBy solving these equations numerically we may study the resulting strategies in\nequilibrium. Finally, we formulate a competitive game between brokers in order\nto determine the liquidity prices subject to precommitment supplied to the\ninformed trader and provide a numerical example in which the resulting\nequilibrium is not Pareto efficient.",

Despite\ntheir benefits, the literature has demonstrated that invasive BCIs focused on\nneurostimulation present vulnerabilities allowing attackers to gain control. In\nthis context, neural cyberattacks emerged as threats able to disrupt\nspontaneous neural activity by performing neural overstimulation or inhibition.\nPrevious work validated these attacks in small-scale simulations with a reduced\nnumber of neurons, lacking real-world complexity. Thus, this work tackles this\nlimitation by analyzing the impact of two existing neural attacks, Neuronal\nFlooding (FLO) and Neuronal Jamming (JAM), on a complex neuronal topology of\nthe primary visual cortex of mice consisting of approximately 230,000 neurons,\ntested on three realistic visual stimuli: flash effect, movie, and drifting\ngratings. Each attack was evaluated over three relevant events per stimulus,\nalso testing the impact of attacking 25% and 50% of the neurons. The results,\nbased on the number of spikes and shift percentages metrics, showed that the\nattacks caused the greatest impact on the movie, while dark and static events\nexhibit highest resilience. Although both attacks can significantly affect\nneural activity, JAM was generally more damaging, producing longer temporal\ndelays, and had a larger prevalence. Finally, JAM did not require to alter many\nneurons to significantly affect neural activity, while the impact in FLO\nincreased with the number of neurons attacked.",

We present OminiControl2,\nan efficient framework that achieves efficient image-conditional image\ngeneration. OminiControl2 introduces two key innovations: (1) a dynamic\ncompression strategy that streamlines conditional inputs by preserving only the\nmost semantically relevant tokens during generation, and (2) a conditional\nfeature reuse mechanism that computes condition token features only once and\nreuses them across denoising steps. These architectural improvements preserve\nthe original framework's parameter efficiency and multi-modal versatility while\ndramatically reducing computational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that\nOminiControl2 reduces conditional processing overhead by over 90% compared to\nits predecessor, achieving an overall 5.9$\\times$ speedup in multi-conditional\ngeneration scenarios.

We study its possible\nbreaking scenarios in light of the large mixing angle (LMA) and Dark-LMA\nsolutions suggested by current neutrino oscillation data. The normal\nhierarchical neutrino mass spectrum is ruled out in all three possible breaking\npatterns. Also, one of the interesting features of these breaking scenarios is\nthe interplay between $\\theta_{23}$-octant and possible CP violation. We find\nthat the model allows maximal CP violation for $\\theta_{23}$ above $6\\%$ of its\nmaximal value which, interestingly, is close to its current best-fit value for\ninverted hierarchical neutrino masses. We have, also, investigated the\nimplications for effective Majorana neutrino mass parameter $|M_{ee}|$ for\nallowed breaking patterns.

In\nthis work, we propose to generate 3D human reactions from RGB videos, which\ninvolves a wider range of interaction categories and naturally provides\ninformation about expressions that may reflect the subject's emotions. To cope\nwith this task, we present HERO, a simple yet powerful framework for Human\nrEaction geneRation from videOs.

Besides, local visual representations are continuously injected into\nthe model to maximize the exploitation of the dynamic properties inherent in\nvideos. Furthermore, the ViMo dataset containing paired Video-Motion data is\ncollected to support the task. In addition to human-human interactions, these\nvideo-motion pairs also cover animal-human interactions and scene-human\ninteractions.

Although\nthese methods generate high-fidelity portraits, they fail to prevent the\ngenerated portraits from being tracked and misused by malicious face\nrecognition systems. To address this, this paper proposes a Customized Portrait\nGeneration framework with facial Adversarial attacks (Adv-CPG). Specifically,\nto achieve facial privacy protection, we devise a lightweight local ID\nencryptor and an encryption enhancer. They implement progressive double-layer\nencryption protection by directly injecting the target identity and adding\nadditional identity guidance, respectively. Furthermore, to accomplish\nfine-grained and personalized portrait generation, we develop a multi-modal\nimage customizer capable of generating controlled fine-grained facial features.\nTo the best of our knowledge, Adv-CPG is the first study that introduces facial\nadversarial attacks into CPG.

Then, the\nautoencoder is trained to directly produce RF beamforming vectors for hybrid\narchitectures, unconstrained by a predefined codebook, based on few projected\nreceived signal strength indicators (RSSIs). Finally, once the RF beamforming\nvectors for the multi-users are predicted, the baseband (BB) digital precoders\nare designed accounting for the multi-user interference.

We validate its\nreal-world applicability by deploying the learned policy - a compact two-layer\nnetwork with 24 neurons per layer - on a Pixhawk flight controller, achieving\n400 Hz control without extra computational resources.

At the core of confidential computing lies remote attestation\n-- a mechanism that enables workload owners to verify the initial state of\ntheir workload and furthermore authenticate the underlying hardware. hile this\nrepresents a significant advancement in cloud security, this SoK critically\nexamines the confidential computing offerings of market-leading cloud providers\nto assess whether they genuinely adhere to its core principles. We develop a\ntaxonomy based on carefully selected criteria to systematically evaluate these\nofferings, enabling us to analyse the components responsible for remote\nattestation, the evidence provided at each stage, the extent of cloud provider\ninfluence and whether this undermines the threat model of confidential\ncomputing. Specifically, we investigate how CVMs are deployed in the public\ncloud infrastructures, the extent to which customers can request and verify\nattestation evidence, and their ability to define and enforce configuration and\nattestation requirements. This analysis provides insight into whether\nconfidential computing guarantees -- namely confidentiality and integrity --\nare genuinely upheld. Our findings reveal that all major cloud providers retain\ncontrol over critical parts of the trusted software stack and, in some cases,\nintervene in the standard remote attestation process. This directly contradicts\ntheir claims of delivering confidential computing, as the model fundamentally\nexcludes the cloud provider from the set of trusted entities.",

The main difference\nwith the MEKF is the inclusion of curvature correction terms in both the filter\ngain and gain update equations. These terms ensure that the proposed filter,\nnamed the Generalized $SO(3)$-MEKF, renders the desired equilibrium of the\nestimation error system to be almost globally uniformly asymptotically stable\n(AGUAS). More precisely, the attitude and bias estimation errors converge\nuniformly asymptotically to zero for almost all initial conditions except those\nwhere the initial angular estimation error equals $\\pi$ radians. Moreover, in\nthe case of small estimation errors, the proposed generalized $SO(3)$-MEKF\nsimplifies to the standard $SO(3)$-MEKF with matrix measurements.

They are formed in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions\nunder the intense radiation field from the compact objects, thus radiative\ntransfer (RT) calculation is a requisite for proper interpretations. We present\nsuch a study for a low-mass X-ray binary, Circinus X-1, from which the P Cygni\nprofile was discovered using the X-ray grating spectrometer onboard Chandra. We\nobserved the source using the X-ray microcalorimeter onboard XRISM at an\norbital phase of 0.93-0.97 and revealed many spectral features unidentified\nbefore; the higher series transitions (n to 1; n > 2) of highly-ionized (H- and\nHe-like) S, Ca, Ar, and Fe in emission and absorption, the Fe K{\\alpha} and\nK\\b{eta} inner-shell excitation absorption of mildly-ionized (O- to Li-like)\nFe, and resolved fine-structure level transitions in the Fe Ly{\\alpha} and\nHe{\\alpha} complexes. They blend with each other at different velocity shifts\non top of apparently variable continuum emission that changed its flux by an\norder of magnitude within a 70 ks telescope time. Despite such complexity in\nthe observed spectra, most of them can be explained by a simple model\nconsisting of the photoionized plasma outflowing at ~300 km s-1 and the\nvariable blocking material in the line of sight of the incident continuum\nemission from the accretion disk. We demonstrate this with the aid of the RT\ncode cloudy for the line ratio diagnostics and spectral fitting. We further\nconstrain the physical parameters of the outflow and argue that the outflow is\nlaunched close to the outer edge of the accretion disk and can be driven\nradiatively by being assisted by the line force calculated using the RT\nsimulation.",

Orthogonal to these methods, we revisit the challenge from\nthe perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained\npopularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue\nthat conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on\npaired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching\nor flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation\nalignment.

This approach improves alignment with minimal\ncomputational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the\npretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method\nexplicitly increases the mutual information between text and image\nrepresentations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency.

To control atomic properties in an efficient\nway, it is necessary to vary the temporal shape of the pulses used. This has\nled to the problem of obtaining pulses of an unusual shape, such as a\nrectangular one. A number of new phenomena, not possible with conventional\nmulti-cycle pulses, were discovered by analyzing the interaction of such\nunipolar pulses with matter. These include the formation of dynamic\nmicrocavities at each resonant transition of a multilevel medium when such\npulses collide with the medium. In this work, we compare the behavior of\ndynamic microcavities in a two-level and a three-level medium when unipolar\npulses of unusual shape (rectangular) are collided with the medium. We do this\non the basis of the numerical solution of the system for the density matrix of\nthe medium and the wave equation for the electric field. Medium parameters\ncorrespond to atomic hydrogen. It is shown that for rectangular pulses in a\nthree-level medium, the dynamics of the cavities can be very different from the\ntwo-level model, as opposed to pulses of other shapes (e.g. Gaussian shape).\nWhen the third level of the medium is taken into account, the self-induced\ntransparency-like regime disappears.

The inclusion\nof counter-rotating terms into the theoretical description gives rise to two\nchallenges. Firstly, it becomes challenging to analytically calculate the time\nevolution as the Hamiltonian is no longer self-commuting. Moreover, the time\nevolution now depends on the carrier phase such that, in general, every\noperation in a sequence of gates is different. In this work, we derive and\nverify a correction to the drive pulses that minimizes the effect of these\ncounter-rotating terms in a two-level system. We then derive a second\ncorrection term that arises from non-computational levels for a strongly\nanharmonic system.

Recently, many deep learning based\nunmixing approaches have been proposed with the surge of machine learning\ntechniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, these\nmethods face two notable challenges: 1. They frequently yield results lacking\nphysical significance, such as signatures corresponding to unknown or\nnon-existent materials. 2. CNNs, as general-purpose network structures, are not\nexplicitly tailored for unmixing tasks. In response to these concerns, our work\ndraws inspiration from double deep image prior (DIP) techniques and algorithm\nunrolling, presenting a novel network structure that effectively addresses both\nissues. Specifically, we first propose a MatrixConv Unmixing (MCU) approach for\nendmember and abundance estimation, respectively, which can be solved via\ncertain iterative solvers. We then unroll these solvers to build two\nsub-networks, endmember estimation DIP (UEDIP) and abundance estimation DIP\n(UADIP), to generate the estimation of endmember and abundance, respectively.\nThe overall network is constructed by assembling these two sub-networks. In\norder to generate meaningful unmixing results, we also propose a composite loss\nfunction.

However, in addition to improving\naccuracy, new challenges must be addressed regarding the generalization and\ntransferability of DL-based systems. To tackle these issues, this paper\nintroduces a series of mathematically grounded and modularized models, referred\nto as bedrock models, specifically designed for integration into both\ncommunication and sensing systems.

To efficiently restore chest PPG\nwaveform, we propose a style transfer-assisted cycle-consistent generative\nadversarial network, called starGAN, whose performance is evaluated on a\nthree-channel PPG signal (red, green,and infrared) acquired by a chest-worn\nmulti-modal sensor, called Soundi. Two identical devices are adopted, one\nsensor to collect the PPG signal on the chest, considered to feature low\nquality and undergoing restoration, and another sensor to obtain a high-quality\nPPG signal measured on the finger, considered the reference signal. Extensive\nvalidation over some 8,000 5-second chunks collected from 40 subjects showed\nabout 90% correlation of the restored chest PPG with the reference finger PPG,\nwith a 30% improvement over raw chest PPG. Likewise, the signal-to-noise ratio\nimproved on average of about 125%, over the three channels. The agreement with\nheart-rate computed from concurrent ECG was extremely high, overcoming 84% on\naverage. These results demonstrate effective signal restoration, comparable\nwith findings in recent literature papers. Significance: PPG signals collected\nfrom wearable devices are highly susceptible to artifacts, making innovative\nAI-based techniques fundamental towards holistic health assessments in a single\ndevice.",

    "abstract": "3D human reconstruction from a single image is a challenging problem and has\nbeen exclusively studied in the literature. Recently, some methods have\nresorted to diffusion models for guidance, optimizing a 3D representation via\nScore Distillation Sampling(SDS) or generating one back-view image for\nfacilitating reconstruction. However, these methods tend to produce\nunsatisfactory artifacts (\\textit{e.g.} flattened human structure or\nover-smoothing results caused by inconsistent priors from multiple views) and\nstruggle with real-world generalization in the wild. In this work, we present\n\\emph{MVD-HuGaS}, enabling free-view 3D human rendering from a single image via\na multi-view human diffusion model. We first generate multi-view images from\nthe single reference image with an enhanced multi-view diffusion model, which\nis well fine-tuned on high-quality 3D human datasets to incorporate 3D geometry\npriors and human structure priors. To infer accurate camera poses from the\nsparse generated multi-view images for reconstruction, an alignment module is\nintroduced to facilitate joint optimization of 3D Gaussians and camera poses.\nFurthermore, we propose a depth-based Facial Distortion Mitigation module to\nrefine the generated facial regions, thereby improving the overall fidelity of\nthe reconstruction.Finally, leveraging the refined multi-view images, along\nwith their accurate camera poses, MVD-HuGaS optimizes the 3D Gaussians of the\ntarget human for high-fidelity free-view renderings. Extensive experiments on\nThuman2.0 and 2K2K datasets show that the proposed MVD-HuGaS achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on single-view 3D human rendering.",

However, when applied to large-scale street scenes, existing methods\nsuffer from rapidly escalating per-viewpoint reconstruction costs as scene size\nincreases, leading to significant computational overhead. After revisiting the\nconventional pipeline, we identify three key factors accounting for this issue:\nunnecessary local-to-global transformations, excessive 3D-to-2D projections,\nand inefficient rendering of distant content. To address these challenges, we\npropose S3R-GS, a 3DGS framework that Streamlines the pipeline for large-scale\nStreet Scene Reconstruction, effectively mitigating these limitations.\nMoreover, most existing street 3DGS methods rely on ground-truth 3D bounding\nboxes to separate dynamic and static components, but 3D bounding boxes are\ndifficult to obtain, limiting real-world applicability. To address this, we\npropose an alternative solution with 2D boxes, which are easier to annotate or\ncan be predicted by off-the-shelf vision foundation models. Such designs\ntogether make S3R-GS readily adapt to large, in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that S3R-GS enhances rendering quality and\nsignificantly accelerates reconstruction. Remarkably, when applied to videos\nfrom the challenging Argoverse2 dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and\nSSIM, reducing reconstruction time to below 50%--and even 20%--of competing\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Despite their success, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable\nto hallucinations. While existing studies attribute the cause of hallucinations\nto insufficient visual attention to image tokens, our findings indicate that\nhallucinations also arise from interference from instruction tokens during\ndecoding. Intuitively, certain instruction tokens continuously distort LVLMs'\nvisual perception during decoding, hijacking their visual attention toward less\ndiscriminative visual regions. This distortion prevents them integrating\nbroader contextual information from images, ultimately leading to\nhallucinations. We term this phenomenon 'Attention Hijacking', where disruptive\ninstruction tokens act as 'Attention Hijackers'. To address this, we propose a\nnovel, training-free strategy namely Attention HIjackers Detection and\nDisentanglement (AID), designed to isolate the influence of Hijackers, enabling\nLVLMs to rely on their context-aware intrinsic attention map. Specifically, AID\nconsists of three components: First, Attention Hijackers Detection identifies\nAttention Hijackers by calculating instruction-driven visual salience. Next,\nAttention Disentanglement mechanism is proposed to mask the visual attention of\nthese identified Hijackers, and thereby mitigate their disruptive influence on\nsubsequent tokens. Finally, Re-Disentanglement recalculates the balance between\ninstruction-driven and image-driven visual salience to avoid over-masking\neffects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AID significantly reduces\nhallucination across various LVLMs on several benchmarks.",

The modularity and flexibility with regard to the system\nconfigurability of the developed building model is evaluated on various real\nbuilding types. In addition, the applicability of the building model in a\nmulti-energy system is highlighted by implementing the model in a collaborative\nco-simulation setup and by coupling it to a district heating grid model in\nyearly co-simulations. The simulation results for the proposed\nmulti-physical/-modal building modeling concept show a very high level of\nagreement compared to published reference building data and can therefore be\nused individually as flexible and modular building models including both\nthermal and electrical systems for future sector-coupled energy system analyses\nin view of sustainability.",

Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as\npowerful tools for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, potentially offering\nquantum-mechanical accuracy with the efficiency of classical MD. This\nPerspective evaluates the viability of universal MLFFs for simulating complex\nmaterials systems from the standpoint of a potential practitioner. Using the\ntemperature-driven ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of PbTiO$_3$ as\na benchmark, we assess leading universal force fields, including CHGNet, MACE,\nM3GNet, and GPTFF, alongside specialized models like UniPero. While universal\nMLFFs trained on PBE-derived datasets perform well in predicting equilibrium\nproperties, they largely fail to capture realistic finite-temperature phase\ntransitions under constant-pressure MD, often exhibiting unphysical\ninstabilities. These shortcomings stem from inherited biases in\nexchange-correlation functionals and limited generalization to anharmonic\ninteractions governing dynamic behavior. However, fine-tuning universal models\nor employing system-specific MLFFs like UniPero successfully restores\npredictive accuracy. We advocates for hybrid approaches combining universal\npretraining with targeted optimization, improved error quantification\nframeworks, and community-driven benchmarks to advance MLFFs as robust tools\nfor computational materials discovery.",

    "abstract": "Hypergraph, which allows each hyperedge to encompass an arbitrary number of\nnodes, is a powerful tool for modeling multi-entity interactions. Hyperedge\nprediction is a fundamental task that aims to predict future hyperedges or\nidentify existent but unobserved hyperedges based on those observed. In link\nprediction for simple graphs, most observed links are treated as positive\nsamples, while all unobserved links are considered as negative samples.\nHowever, this full-sampling strategy is impractical for hyperedge prediction,\ndue to the number of unobserved hyperedges in a hypergraph significantly\nexceeds the number of observed ones. Therefore, one has to utilize some\nnegative sampling methods to generate negative samples, ensuring their quantity\nis comparable to that of positive samples. In current hyperedge prediction,\nrandomly selecting negative samples is a routine practice. But through\nexperimental analysis, we discover a critical limitation of random selecting\nthat the generated negative samples are too easily distinguishable from\npositive samples. This leads to premature convergence of the model and reduces\nthe accuracy of prediction. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel method\nto generate negative samples, named as hard negative sampling (HNS). Unlike\ntraditional methods that construct negative hyperedges by selecting node sets\nfrom the original hypergraph, HNS directly synthesizes negative samples in the\nhyperedge embedding space, thereby generating more challenging and informative\nnegative samples. Our results demonstrate that HNS significantly enhances both\naccuracy and robustness of the prediction. Moreover, as a plug-and-play\ntechnique, HNS can be easily applied in the training of various hyperedge\nprediction models based on representation learning.",

While chain-of-thought\nreasoning has shown importance in many tasks for LLMs, the internal thinking\nprocesses of RPLAs remain unexplored. Understanding characters' inner thoughts\nis crucial for developing advanced RPLAs. In this paper, we introduce\nROLETHINK, a novel benchmark constructed from literature for evaluating\ncharacter thought generation. We propose the task of inner thought reasoning,\nwhich includes two sets: the gold set that compares generated thoughts with\noriginal character monologues, and the silver set that uses expert synthesized\ncharacter analyses as references. To address this challenge, we propose MIRROR,\na chain-of-thought approach that generates character thoughts by retrieving\nmemories, predicting character reactions, and synthesizing motivations. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate the importance of inner thought reasoning\nfor RPLAs, and MIRROR consistently outperforms existing methods.

Our experiments evaluate these methods based on\nseveral factors, including mutation score, code coverage, success rate, and the\nability to identify equivalent mutants.

First, the algorithm can be applied to solve a multi-parametric\nversion of a special matroid interdiction problem, and second, it can be\nutilized to compute the weight set decomposition of the multi-objective\n(graphic) matroid problem. For the latter, we asymptotically improve the\ncurrent state-of-the-art algorithm by a factor that is almost proportional to\nthe number of edges of the graphic matroid.",

We finally bin these relevant maps into different\nmulti-year time periods to understand the role that climate change is having on\nthese precursors. The experiments are carried out on Indochina heatwaves, but\nthe methodology can be readily extended to other extreme weather events\nworldwide.",

While end-to-end models trained on large datasets perform well\nin standard driving scenarios, they struggle with complex low-frequency events.\nRecent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs)\nadvancements offer enhanced reasoning but suffer from computational\ninefficiency. Inspired by the dual-process cognitive model \"Thinking, Fast and\nSlow\", we propose $\\textbf{FASIONAD}$ -- a novel dual-system framework that\nsynergizes a fast end-to-end planner with a VLM-based reasoning module. The\nfast system leverages end-to-end learning to achieve real-time trajectory\ngeneration in common scenarios, while the slow system activates through\nuncertainty estimation to perform contextual analysis and complex scenario\nresolution. Our architecture introduces three key innovations: (1) A dynamic\nswitching mechanism enabling slow system intervention based on real-time\nuncertainty assessment; (2) An information bottleneck with high-level plan\nfeedback that optimizes the slow system's guidance capability; (3) A\nbidirectional knowledge exchange where visual prompts enhance the slow system's\nreasoning while its feedback refines the fast planner's decision-making. To\nstrengthen VLM reasoning, we develop a question-answering mechanism coupled\nwith reward-instruct training strategy.

    "abstract": "Current machine learning systems are brittle in the face of distribution\nshifts (DS), where the target distribution that the system is tested on differs\nfrom the source distribution used to train the system. This problem of\nrobustness to DS has been studied extensively in the field of domain\nadaptation. For deep neural networks, a popular framework for unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) is domain matching, in which algorithms\n  try to align the marginal distributions in the feature or output space.\n  The current theoretical understanding of these methods, however, is limited\nand existing theoretical results are not precise enough to characterize their\nperformance in practice.\n  In this paper, we derive new bounds based on optimal transport that analyze\nthe UDA problem. Our new bounds include a term which we dub as\n\\emph{entanglement}, consisting of an expectation of Wasserstein distance\nbetween conditionals with respect to changing data distributions. Analysis of\nthe entanglement term provides a novel perspective on the unoptimizable aspects\nof UDA. In various experiments with multiple models across several DS\nscenarios, we show that this term can be used to explain the varying\nperformance of UDA algorithms.",

To address the scarcity of video-based indiscernible\nobject counting datasets, we have developed a novel dataset comprising 50\nvideos, from which approximately 800 frames have been extracted and annotated\nwith around 40,800 point-wise object labels. This dataset accurately represents\nreal underwater environments where indiscernible marine objects are intricately\nintegrated with their surroundings, thereby comprehensively illustrating the\naforementioned challenges in object counting. To address these challenges, we\npropose a depth-assisted network with adaptive motion-differentiated feature\nencoding.

Depth-aware features extracted by the depth-assisting\nbranch are enhanced via a depth-enhanced encoder to improve object\nrepresentation.

    "abstract": "Recently, images that distort or fabricate facts using generative models have\nbecome a social concern. To cope with continuous evolution of generative\nartificial intelligence (AI) models, model attribution (MA) is necessary beyond\njust detection of synthetic images. However, current deep learning-based MA\nmethods must be trained from scratch with new data to recognize unseen models,\nwhich is time-consuming and data-intensive. This work proposes a new strategy\nto deal with persistently emerging generative models. We adapt few-shot\nclass-incremental learning (FSCIL) mechanisms for MA problem to uncover novel\ngenerative AI models. Unlike existing FSCIL approaches that focus on object\nclassification using high-level information, MA requires analyzing low-level\ndetails like color and texture in synthetic images.

However, due to the substantial differences between remote\nsensing images and conventional optical images, these models face considerable\nchallenges in comprehension, especially in detection tasks. Directly prompting\nVLMs with detection instructions often leads to unsatisfactory results. To\naddress this issue, this letter explores the application of VLMs for object\ndetection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we constructed supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) datasets using publicly available remote sensing object\ndetection datasets, including SSDD, HRSID, and NWPU-VHR-10. In these new\ndatasets, we converted annotation information into JSON-compliant natural\nlanguage descriptions, facilitating more effective understanding and training\nfor the VLM. We then evaluate the detection performance of various fine-tuning\nstrategies for VLMs and derive optimized model weights for object detection in\nremote sensing images. Finally, we evaluate the model's prior knowledge\ncapabilities using natural language queries. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat, without modifying the model architecture, remote sensing object detection\ncan be effectively achieved using natural language alone.

    "abstract": "With the continuous advancement and maturity of AMOLED (Active-Matrix Organic\nLight Emitting Diode) technology, smart wearable products such as watches and\nbracelets are increasingly incorporating related technologies as display screen\nimplementation solutions. Using standby time is the most critical product\nperformance measurement indicator at the moment, according to the power supply\nsystem design of smart wearable products and customer usage habits. AMOLED\ndisplays, as one of the major power-consuming components in smart wearable\nproducts, are also subject to extremely stringent power consumption\nrequirements. This paper divides an AMOLED display into five parts: the power\nchip, the driver chip, the array substrate, the light-emitting structure, and\nthe light-transmitting structure. In this paper, we propose targeted\npower-saving solutions for each component based on their respective operating\nprinciples, subject areas, and the most recent advances in related fields, and\nwe provide the best overall solution by combining the interactions between each\ncomponent and even the entire system. The relevant solutions have been\nvalidated in practice, and there is clear verification data to demonstrate\ntheir feasibility.",

    "abstract": "Flow matching is a recent state-of-the-art framework for generative modeling\nbased on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While closely related to\ndiffusion models, it provides a more general perspective on generative\nmodeling. Although inverse problem solving has been extensively explored using\ndiffusion models, it has not been rigorously examined within the broader\ncontext of flow models. Therefore, here we extend the diffusion inverse solvers\n(DIS) - which perform posterior sampling by combining a denoising diffusion\nprior with an likelihood gradient - into the flow framework. Specifically, by\ndriving the flow-version of Tweedie's formula, we decompose the flow ODE into\ntwo components: one for clean image estimation and the other for noise\nestimation. By integrating the likelihood gradient and stochastic noise into\neach component, respectively, we demonstrate that posterior sampling for\ninverse problem solving can be effectively achieved using flows. Our proposed\nsolver, Flow-Driven Posterior Sampling (FlowDPS), can also be seamlessly\nintegrated into a latent flow model with a transformer architecture. Across\nfour linear inverse problems, we confirm that FlowDPS outperforms\nstate-of-the-art alternatives, all without requiring additional training.",

Instead of relying on high-cost true time delayers, we propose in this\npaper an efficient three-dimensional (3D) rotatable antenna technology to\nmitigate the beam-squint effects, motivated by the fact that beam squint\ndisappears along the boresight direction. In particular, we focus on a wideband\nwide-beam coverage problem in this paper, aiming to maximize the minimum\nbeamforming gain within a given angle and frequency range by jointly optimizing\nthe analog beamforming vector and the 3D rotation angles of the antenna array.\nHowever, this problem is non-convex and difficult to be optimally solved due to\nthe coupling of the spatial and frequency domains and that of the antenna\nweights and rotation. To tackle this issue, we first reformulate the problem\ninto an equivalent form by merging the spatial and frequency domains into a\nsingle composite domain. Next, we combine alternating optimization (AO) and\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) algorithms to optimize the analog\nbeamforming and rotation angles within this composite domain.

However, the task of swiftly and\naccurately identifying star clusters from vast amounts of photometric images\npresents an immense challenge. To address these difficulties, we employ deep\nlearning models for image classification to identify young disk star clusters\nin M31 from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) images. For\ntraining, validation, and testing, we utilize the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda\nTreasury (PHAT) survey catalogs. We evaluate the performance of various deep\nlearning models, using different classification thresholds and limiting\nmagnitudes. Our findings indicate that the ResNet-50 model exhibits the highest\noverall accuracy. Moreover, using brighter limiting magnitudes and increasing\nthe classification thresholds can effectively enhance the accuracy and\nprecision of cluster identification. Through our experiments, we found that the\nmodel achieves optimal performance when the limiting magnitude is set to\nbrighter than 21 mag. Based on this, we constructed a training dataset with\nmagnitudes less than 21 mag and trained a second ResNet-50 model. This model\nachieved a purity of 89.30%, a recall of 73.55%, and an F1 score of 80.66% when\nthe classification threshold was set to 0.669. Applying the second model to all\nsources in the PAndAS fields within a projected radius of 30 kpc from the\ncenter of M31, we identified 2,228 new unique star cluster candidates.

Thirdly, we provide practical\nrecommendations towards more appropriate design, interpretation, and reporting\nof empirical methodological research in light of this distinction. In\nparticular, we argue that both modes of research are crucial to methodological\nprogress, but that most published studies -- even if sometimes disguised as\nconfirmatory -- are essentially exploratory in nature. We emphasize that it may\nbe adequate to consider empirical methodological research as a continuum\nbetween \"pure\" exploration and \"strict\" confirmation, recommend transparently\nreporting the mode of conducted research within the spectrum between\nexploratory and confirmatory, and stress the importance of study protocols\nwritten before conducting the study, especially in confirmatory methodological\nresearch.",

These risks are amplified in shared environments, where\nre-identification threats can compromise patient privacy. Existing deep\nlearning re-identification models prioritize accuracy but lack explainability,\nmaking it challenging to understand how the unique biometric characteristics\nencoded within ECG signals are recognized and utilized for identification.\nWithout these insights, despite high accuracy, developing secure and trustable\nECG data-sharing frameworks remains difficult, especially in diverse,\nmulti-source environments. In this work, we introduce TransECG, a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based method that uses attention mechanisms to pinpoint\ncritical ECG segments associated with re-identification tasks like gender, age,\nand participant ID.

However, previous GSL methods assume that graphs are\nhomogeneous and struggle to maintain their performance on heterogeneous graphs.\nTo address this problem, this paper proposes a Heterogeneous Graph Matching\nNetwork (HeGMN), which is an end-to-end graph similarity learning framework\ncomposed of a two-tier matching mechanism. Firstly, a heterogeneous graph\nisomorphism network is proposed as the encoder, which reinvents graph\nisomorphism network for heterogeneous graphs by perceiving different semantic\nrelationships during aggregation. Secondly, a graph-level and node-level\nmatching modules are designed, both employing type-aligned matching principles.\nThe former conducts graph-level matching by node type alignment, and the latter\ncomputes the interactions between the cross-graph nodes with the same type thus\nreducing noise interference and computational overhead. Finally, the\ngraph-level and node-level matching features are combined and fed into fully\nconnected layers for predicting graph similarity scores. In experiments, we\npropose a heterogeneous graph resampling method to construct heterogeneous\ngraph pairs and define the corresponding heterogeneous graph edit distance,\nfilling the gap in missing datasets.

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of synthetic data in training loops has raised\nconcerns about model collapse, where generative models degrade when trained on\ntheir own outputs. While prior work focuses on this self-consuming process, we\nstudy an underexplored yet prevalent phenomenon: co-evolving generative models\nthat shape each other's training through iterative feedback. This is common in\nmultimodal AI ecosystems, such as social media platforms, where text models\ngenerate captions that guide image models, and the resulting images influence\nthe future adaptation of the text model. We take a first step by analyzing such\na system, modeling the text model as a multinomial distribution and the image\nmodel as a conditional multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Our analysis\nuncovers three key results. First, when one model remains fixed, the other\ncollapses: a frozen image model causes the text model to lose diversity, while\na frozen text model leads to an exponential contraction of image diversity,\nthough fidelity remains bounded. Second, in fully interactive systems, mutual\nreinforcement accelerates collapse, with image contraction amplifying text\nhomogenization and vice versa, leading to a Matthew effect where dominant texts\nsustain higher image diversity while rarer texts collapse faster. Third, we\nanalyze stabilization strategies implicitly introduced by real-world external\ninfluences. Random corpus injections for text models and user-content\ninjections for image models prevent collapse while preserving both diversity\nand fidelity.

    "abstract": "The interaction between the accretion disc and its corona plays a critical\nrole in the energy balance and emission mechanisms in astrophysical systems\nsuch as active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. However, the detailed\nphysics of disc-corona interactions, including the mechanisms driving disc\nevaporation and the impact of accretion rate and viscosity, remain poorly\nunderstood. Our study aims to extend the well-known disc evaporation model to\ninvestigate the disc-corona interaction in a 2D axisymmetric, time-dependent\nhydrodynamic model, focusing on the effects of viscosity, accretion rate, and\ntheir influence on disc evaporation, luminosity, and corona formation. We\ndevelop a hydrodynamic model consisting of a thin accretion disc, a corona, and\na vacuum region. Our model is implemented in Athena++, with the gas-vacuum\ninterface tracking algorithm to handle the vacuum regions. We perform\nsimulations incorporating turbulent viscosity, thermal conduction,\nBremsstrahlung cooling, and artificial disc cooling, starting from an adiabatic\nstate to explore the disc-corona interaction. We demonstrate the presence of\nacoustic shock heating. We find that viscosity dominates the intensity of disc\nevaporation, that the accretion rate primarily determines the disc truncation\nradius and the disc luminosity, and that there may be a positive correlation\nbetween the corona luminosity and the evaporation intensity. We find the warm\ngas required by the warm corona model. We also compare our results with\nobservations and simulations, and estimate the $y$-parameters to explore the\npotential effects of Compton cooling as well as the potential effects of the\nwarm corona.",

A significant portion of this interaction is\nredundant, requiring users to repeatedly provide the same information across\ndifferent contexts. Existing solutions, such as browser-stored credentials,\nautofill mechanisms, and unified authentication systems, have aimed to mitigate\nthis redundancy by serving as intermediaries that store and retrieve commonly\nused user data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an\nopportunity to redefine memory management through an AI-native paradigm: SECOND\nME. SECOND ME acts as an intelligent, persistent memory offload system that\nretains, organizes, and dynamically utilizes user-specific knowledge. By\nserving as an intermediary in user interactions, it can autonomously generate\ncontext-aware responses, prefill required information, and facilitate seamless\ncommunication with external systems, significantly reducing cognitive load and\ninteraction friction. Unlike traditional memory storage solutions, SECOND ME\nextends beyond static data retention by leveraging LLM-based memory\nparameterization. This enables structured organization, contextual reasoning,\nand adaptive knowledge retrieval, facilitating a more systematic and\nintelligent approach to memory management. As AI-driven personal agents like\nSECOND ME become increasingly integrated into digital ecosystems, SECOND ME\nfurther represents a critical step toward augmenting human-world interaction\nwith persistent, contextually aware, and self-optimizing memory systems.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained significant attention for its\nhigh-quality rendering capabilities, ultra-fast training, and inference speeds.\nHowever, when we apply 3DGS to surface reconstruction tasks, especially in\nenvironments with dynamic objects and distractors, the method suffers from\nfloating artifacts and color errors due to inconsistency from different\nviewpoints. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistency\nGaussian Splatting for the domain of Robust Surface Reconstruction\n(\\textbf{MVGSR}), which takes advantage of lightweight Gaussian models and a\n{heuristics-guided distractor masking} strategy for robust surface\nreconstruction in non-static environments. Compared to existing methods that\nrely on MLPs for distractor segmentation strategies, our approach separates\ndistractors from static scene elements by comparing multi-view feature\nconsistency, allowing us to obtain precise distractor masks early in training.\nFurthermore, we introduce a pruning measure based on multi-view contributions\nto reset transmittance, effectively reducing floating artifacts. Finally, a\nmulti-view consistency loss is applied to achieve high-quality performance in\nsurface reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVGSR\nachieves competitive geometric accuracy and rendering fidelity compared to the\nstate-of-the-art surface reconstruction algorithms.

    "abstract": "Most previous 3D object detection methods that leverage the multi-modality of\nLiDAR and cameras utilize the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space for intermediate\nfeature representation. However, this space uses a low x, y-resolution and\nsacrifices z-axis information to reduce the overall feature resolution, which\nmay result in declined accuracy. To tackle the problem of using low-resolution\nfeatures, this paper focuses on the sparse nature of LiDAR point cloud data.\nFrom our observation, the number of occupied cells in the 3D voxels constructed\nfrom a LiDAR data can be even fewer than the number of total cells in the BEV\nmap, despite the voxels' significantly higher resolution. Based on this, we\nintroduce a novel sparse voxel-based transformer network for 3D object\ndetection, dubbed as SparseVoxFormer. Instead of performing BEV feature\nextraction, we directly leverage sparse voxel features as the input for a\ntransformer-based detector. Moreover, with regard to the camera modality, we\nintroduce an explicit modality fusion approach that involves projecting 3D\nvoxel coordinates onto 2D images and collecting the corresponding image\nfeatures. Thanks to these components, our approach can leverage geometrically\nricher multi-modal features while even reducing the computational cost. Beyond\nthe proof-of-concept level, we further focus on facilitating better multi-modal\nfusion and flexible control over the number of sparse features. Finally,\nthorough experimental results demonstrate that utilizing a significantly\nsmaller number of sparse features drastically reduces computational costs in a\n3D object detector while enhancing both overall and long-range performance.",

The key of our method is to search for an optimal stochastic\nbinary mask for a random network rather than updating the model weights,\nidentifying a sparse subnetwork with high generative performance; i.e., a\n``strong lottery ticket''.

We formulate a\nmulti-objective joint optimization problem of IGE and resource allocation,\npropose iterative solutions with proven convergence, and analyze the\ncomputational complexity. Our simulation results show that power-domain IGE can\naccurately estimate strong interference channel gains with low power overhead\nand is robust to carrier frequency and timing offsets.",

We report a new method that is able to simulate 4D millimeter wave\nradar signals including pitch, yaw, range, and Doppler velocity along with\nradar signal strength (RSS) using camera image, light detection and ranging\n(lidar) point cloud, and ego-velocity. The method is based on two new neural\nnetworks: 1) DIS-Net, which estimates the spatial distribution and number of\nradar signals, and 2) RSS-Net, which predicts the RSS of the signal based on\nappearance and geometric information. We have implemented and tested our method\nusing open datasets from 3 different models of commercial automotive radar. The\nexperimental results show that our method can successfully generate\nhigh-fidelity radar signals. Moreover, we have trained a popular object\ndetection neural network with data augmented by our synthesized radar.

Most existing\nRelative Positional Encoding (RPE) methods attempt to address this by\nintroducing either fixed linear biases or globally learned biases, which lack\nthe capacity to adapt to different input contexts. In this work, we propose an\nadditive RPE, Context-Aware Biases for Length Extrapolation (CABLE), a method\nthat learns token-specific, context-aware biases for each attention head in\ntransformers. By dynamically adjusting positional biases based on the input\nsequence, CABLE overcomes the rigidity of fixed RPEs. When evaluated on\nsequences longer than originally trained with, GPT-2 Medium (334M parameters)\nwith CABLE achieves lower perplexity than counterparts using other widely\nadopted positional encoding methods. Additionally, by applying CABLE to the\nBERT base model we improved performance in long-context retrieval tasks.

However, in this paper, we provide rigorous analysis to reveal that\nthe random data embedded in OFDM-ISAC signal can actually act as a free ``mask\"\nfor ISI, which makes ISI/ICI random and hence greatly attenuated after radar\nsignal processing. The derived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)\nin the range profile demonstrates that the maximum sensing range of OFDM-ISAC\ncan greatly exceed the ISI-free distance that is limited by the CP length,\nwhich is validated by simulation results. To further mitigate power degradation\nfor long-range targets, a novel sliding window sensing method is proposed,\nwhich iteratively detects and cancels short-range targets before shifting the\ndetection window.

The unmodeled GW burst analysis pipeline,\n\\textit{BayesWave}, offers two tensor-polarized signal models: the elliptical\npolarization model ($E$) and the relaxed polarization model ($R$). Future\nexpansion of the global GW detector network will enable more accurate studies\nof GW polarizations with GW bursts. Here a multi-detector analysis is conducted\nto compare the performance of $E$ and $R$ in characterizing elliptical and\nnonelliptical GW polarizations, using nonprecessing and precessing binary black\nholes (BBHs) respectively as representative synthetic sources. It is found that\nboth models reconstruct the elliptical nonprecessing BBH signals accurately,\nbut $E$ has a higher Bayesian evidence than $R$ as it is has fewer model\nparameters. The same is true for precessing BBHs that are reconstructed equally\nwell by both models. However, for some events with high precession and\nespecially with three or more detectors, the reconstruction accuracy and\nevidence of $R$ surpass $E$. The analysis is repeated for BBH events from the\nthird LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run, and the results show that $E$ is\npreferred over $R$ for existing detections. Although $E$ is generally preferred\nfor its simplicity, it insists on elliptical polarizations, whereas $R$ can\nmeasure generic GW polarization content in terms of Stokes parameters. The\naccuracy of $R$ in recovering polarization content improves as the detector\nnetwork expands, and the performance is independent of the GW signal\nmorphology.",

    "abstract": "Microscopy is an essential tool in scientific research, enabling the\nvisualization of structures at micro- and nanoscale resolutions. However, the\nfield of microscopy often encounters limitations in field-of-view (FOV),\nrestricting the amount of sample that can be imaged in a single capture. To\novercome this limitation, image stitching techniques have been developed to\nseamlessly merge multiple overlapping images into a single, high-resolution\ncomposite. The images collected from microscope need to be optimally stitched\nbefore accurate physical information can be extracted from post analysis.\nHowever, the existing stitching tools either struggle to stitch images together\nwhen the microscopy images are feature sparse or cannot address all the\ntransformations of images. To address these issues, we propose a bi-channel\naided feature-based image stitching method and demonstrate its use on AFM\ngenerated biofilm images. The topographical channel image of AFM data captures\nthe morphological details of the sample, and a stitched topographical image is\ndesired for researchers. We utilize the amplitude channel of AFM data to\nmaximize the matching features and to estimate the position of the original\ntopographical images and show that the proposed bi-channel aided stitching\nmethod outperforms the traditional stitching approach. Furthermore, we found\nthat the differentiation of the topographical images along the x-axis provides\nsimilar feature information to the amplitude channel image, which generalizes\nour approach when the amplitude images are not available. Here we demonstrated\nthe application on AFM, but similar approaches could be employed of optical\nmicroscopy with brightfield and fluorescence channels. We believe this proposed\nworkflow will benefit the experimentalist to avoid erroneous analysis and\ndiscovery due to incorrect stitching.",

In some cases the radio pulses have been\ninterpreted as coming from rotating neutron stars with extremely strong\nmagnetic fields, known as magnetars; the origin of other, occasionally periodic\nand less well-sampled radio transients, is still debated [3]. Coherent periodic\nradio emission is usually explained by rotating dipolar magnetic fields and\npair production mechanisms, but such models do not easily predict radio\nemission from such slowly-rotating neutron stars and maintain it for extended\ntimes. On the other hand, highly magnetic isolated white dwarfs would be\nexpected to have long spin periodicities, but periodic coherent radio emission\nhas not yet been directly detected from these sources. Here we report\nobservations of a long-period (21 minutes) radio transient, which we have\nlabeled GPMJ1839-10. The pulses vary in brightness by two orders of magnitude,\nlast between 30 and 300 seconds, and have quasi-periodic substructure. The\nobservations prompted a search of radio archives, and we found that the source\nhas been repeating since at least 1988. The archival data enabled constraint of\nthe period derivative to $<3.6\\times10^{-13}$s s$^{-1}$, which is at the very\nlimit of any classical theoretical model that predicts dipolar radio emission\nfrom an isolated neutron star.",

    "abstract": "Due to numerous hardware shortcomings, medical image acquisition devices are\nsusceptible to producing low-quality (i.e., low contrast, inappropriate\nbrightness, noisy, etc.) images. Regrettably, perceptually degraded images\ndirectly impact the diagnosis process and make the decision-making manoeuvre of\nmedical practitioners notably complicated. This study proposes to enhance such\nlow-quality images by incorporating end-to-end learning strategies for\naccelerating medical image analysis tasks. To the best concern, this is the\nfirst work in medical imaging which comprehensively tackles perceptual\nenhancement, including contrast correction, luminance correction, denoising,\netc., with a fully convolutional deep network. The proposed network leverages\nresidual blocks and a residual gating mechanism for diminishing visual\nartefacts and is guided by a multi-term objective function to perceive the\nperceptually plausible enhanced images. The practicability of the deep medical\nimage enhancement method has been extensively investigated with sophisticated\nexperiments. The experimental outcomes illustrate that the proposed method\ncould outperform the existing enhancement methods for different medical image\nmodalities by 5.00 to 7.00 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics and\n4.00 to 6.00 in DeltaE metrics. Additionally, the proposed method can\ndrastically improve the medical image analysis tasks' performance and reveal\nthe potentiality of such an enhancement method in real-world applications.

In this work, we propose\n\\textbf{AdaSCALE}, an adaptive scaling procedure that dynamically adjusts the\npercentile threshold based on a sample's estimated OOD likelihood. This\nestimation leverages our key observation: OOD samples exhibit significantly\nmore pronounced activation shifts at high-magnitude activations under minor\nperturbation compared to ID samples. AdaSCALE enables stronger scaling for\nlikely ID samples and weaker scaling for likely OOD samples, yielding highly\nseparable energy scores.

Our models are\npre-trained on our extensive dataset that contains more than 200 million 30s\nPPG samples. We explored different supervised fine-tuning techniques to adapt\nour model to downstream tasks, resulting in performance comparable to or\nsurpassing current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in tasks like atrial\nfibrillation detection. A standout feature of our GPT model is its inherent\ncapability to perform generative tasks such as signal denoising effectively,\nwithout the need for further fine-tuning. This success is attributed to the\ngenerative nature of the GPT framework.",

First,\nwe demonstrate that the system admits only steady-state solutions of the form\n$\\left(\\rho,\\mathbf{V},p\\right)=\\left(\\rho_{0},\\mathbf{0},P_{0}\\right)$, where\n$P_0$ and $\\rho_0$ satisfy the hydrostatic balance condition $\\nabla\nP_{0}=-\\rho_{0}\\nabla f$.

Our study\nsignficantly extends and generalizes the existing mathematical results, which\nhave predominantly focused on the scenarios involving a uniform gravitational\nfield characterized by $\\nabla f=(0,g)$. Finally, we show that these steady\nstates are linearly stable provided that $h\\left(x,y\\right)<0$ holds throughout\nthe domain. Moreover, they exhibit nonlinear stability when $h\\left(x,y\\right)$\nis a negative constant.",

    "abstract": "According to Faraday's law in classical physics, a varying magnetic field\nstimulates an electric eddy field. Intuitively, when a classical field is\nconstant and imposed on a lattice, the Wannier-Stark ladders (WSL) can be\nestablished, resulting in Bloch oscillations. In this work, we investigate the\ndynamics of an interacting system on a (generalized) ring lattice threaded by a\nvarying magnetic flux. Based on the rigorious results, we demonstrate that\nthere exist many invariant subspaces in which the dynamics is periodic when the\nflux varies linearly over time. Nevertheless, for a given initial state, the\nevolved state differs from that driven by a linear field. However, the\nprobability distributions of the two states are identical, referred to as the\nquantum analogue of Faraday's law. Our results are ubiquitous for a wide\nvariety of interacting systems. We demonstrate these results through numerical\nsimulations in an extended fermi-Hubbard model.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of density matrices from measurement data (quantum state\ntomography) is the most comprehensive method for assessing the accuracy and\nperformance of quantum devices. Existing methods to reconstruct two-photon\ndensity matrices require the detection of both photons unless a priori\ninformation is available. Based on the concept of quantum-induced coherence by\npath identity, we present an approach to quantum state tomography that\ncircumvents the requirement of detecting both photons. We show that an\narbitrary two-qubit density matrix, which can contain up to fifteen free\nparameters, can be fully reconstructed from single-photon measurement data\nwithout any postselection and a priori information. In addition to advancing an\nalternative approach to quantum state measurement problems, our results also\nhave notable practical implications. A practical challenge in quantum state\nmeasurement arises from the fact that effective single-photon detectors are not\nreadily accessible for a wide spectral range. Our method, which eliminates the\nneed for coincidence measurements, enables quantum state tomography in the case\nwhere one of the two photons is challenging or impossible to detect. It\ntherefore opens the door to measuring quantum states hitherto inaccessible.",

Dataset Distillation (DD) compresses the\noriginal dataset into a smaller but representative subset for high-quality data\nand efficient training strategies. Existing works for DD generate synthetic\nimages by treating each image as an independent entity, thereby overlooking the\ncommon features among data. This paper proposes a dataset distillation method\nbased on Matching Training Trajectories with Low-rank Space Sampling(MTT-LSS),\nwhich uses low-rank approximations to capture multiple low-dimensional manifold\nsubspaces of the original data. The synthetic data is represented by basis\nvectors and shared dimension mappers from these subspaces, reducing the cost of\ngenerating individual data points while effectively minimizing information\nredundancy. The proposed method is tested on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN\ndatasets, and outperforms the baseline methods by an average of 9.9%.",

This\nassumption is unrealistic if the locations of known objects change or have not\nyet been discovered by the robot. In this work, our key insight is that in many\nscenarios, robot end users possess more scene insight than the robot and need\nways to express it. Presently, there is a lack of research on how solutions for\ncollecting end-user scene insight should be designed. We thereby created an\nUncertainty Expression System (UES) to investigate how best to elicit end-user\nscene insight. The UES allows end users to convey their knowledge of object\nuncertainty using either: (1) a precision interface that allows meticulous\nexpression of scene insight; (2) a painting interface by which users create a\nheat map of possible object locations; and (3) a ranking interface by which end\nusers express object locations via an ordered list. We then conducted a user\nstudy to compare the effectiveness of these approaches based on the accuracy of\nscene insight conveyed to the robot, the efficiency at which end users are able\nto express this scene insight, and both usability and task load. Results\nindicate that the rank interface is more user friendly and efficient than the\nprecision interface, and that the paint interface is the least accurate.",

We deployed PhyE2E to five\napplications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers,\nsolar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions,\nnear-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical\nformulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the\nexperimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes.

By coadding the burst spectra at the maximum radius phase, we\ndetected a 1.034 keV emission line with significance of $14.2\\sigma$, and\nabsorption lines at 1.64 and 3 keV with significances of $10.8\\sigma$ and\n$11.7\\sigma$, respectively.

    "abstract": "Altermagnets, which exhibit the advantages of both antiferromagnets and\nferromagnets, have attracted significant attention recently. Among them,\nruthenium dioxide (RuO2), a prototypical altermagnet candidate, is under\nintensive debate on its magnetic order and altermagnetic characters. In this\nwork, we provide a comprehensive study of the spin-to-charge conversion in\nepitaxial RuO2 thin films with various orientations and fabrication methods. By\nutilizing thermal spin injections from a ferrimagnetic insulator, we\nunambiguously reveal a negative spin Hall angle for RuO2, which is opposite to\nall the previous reports using ferromagnetic metals. Most importantly, we\nobserve robust anisotropic spin-to-charge conversion in RuO2, with voltage\nratios of 30% for the (100)- and (110)-orientations and 40% for the\n(101)-orientations. The ratio remains consistent across RuO2 films fabricated\nby sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and molecular-beam epitaxy. These\nresults conclusively show a robust and anisotropic spin Hall effect in RuO2\nwith the absence of altermagnetic spin-splitting contributions. Our study\nprovides crucial insights and advances the understanding of spin-to-charge\nconversions in emerging materials with low crystal symmetries.",

    "abstract": "Grid edge resources refer to distributed energy resources (DERs) located on\nthe consumer side of the electrical grid, controlled by consumers rather than\nutility companies. Integrating DERs with real-time electricity pricing can\nbetter align distributed supply with system demand, improving grid efficiency\nand reliability. However, DER owners, known as prosumers, often lack the\nexpertise and resources to directly participate in wholesale energy markets,\nlimiting their ability to fully realize the economic potential of their assets.\nMeanwhile, as DER adoption grows, the number of prosumers participating in the\nenergy system is expected to increase significantly, creating additional\nchallenges in coordination and market participation.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a mean-field game framework that\nenables prosumers to autonomously learn optimal decision policies based on\ndynamic market prices and their variable solar generation. Our framework is\ndesigned to accommodate heterogeneous agents and demonstrates the existence of\na mean-field equilibrium (MFE) in a wholesale energy market with many\nprosumers. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm that automates prosumers'\nresource control, facilitating real-time decision-making for energy storage\nmanagement. Numerical experiments suggest that our approach converges towards\nan MFE and effectively reduces peak loads and price volatility, especially\nduring periods of external demand or supply shocks. This study highlights the\npotential of a fully decentralized approach to integrating DERs into wholesale\nmarkets while improving market efficiency.",

Unsupervised instance\nsegmentation (UIS) eliminates annotation requirements but struggles with\nadjacent instance merging and single-instance fragmentation, largely due to the\nlimitations of DINO-based backbones which lack strong instance separation cues.\nWeakly-supervised panoptic segmentation (WPS) reduces annotation costs using\nsparse labels (e.g., points, boxes), yet these annotations remain expensive and\nintroduce human bias and boundary errors. To address these challenges, we\npropose DiffEGG (Diffusion-Driven EdGe Generation), a fully annotation-free\nmethod that extracts instance-aware features from pretrained diffusion models\nto generate precise instance edge maps. Unlike DINO-based UIS methods,\ndiffusion models inherently capture fine-grained, instance-aware features,\nenabling more precise boundary delineation. For WPS, DiffEGG eliminates\nannotation costs and human bias by operating without any form of manual\nsupervision, addressing the key limitations of prior best methods.\nAdditionally, we introduce RIP, a post-processing technique that fuses\nDiffEGG's edge maps with segmentation masks in a task-agnostic manner.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant attention in\nrecent years for its potential to enhance natural language understanding and\ngeneration by combining large-scale retrieval systems with generative models.\nRAG leverages external knowledge sources, such as documents, databases, or\nstructured data, to improve model performance and generate more accurate and\ncontextually relevant outputs. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive\noverview of RAG by examining its fundamental components, including retrieval\nmechanisms, generation processes, and the integration between the two. We\ndiscuss the key characteristics of RAG, such as its ability to augment\ngenerative models with dynamic external knowledge, and the challenges\nassociated with aligning retrieved information with generative objectives. We\nalso present a taxonomy that categorizes RAG methods, ranging from basic\nretrieval-augmented approaches to more advanced models incorporating\nmulti-modal data and reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we review the\nevaluation benchmarks and datasets commonly used to assess RAG systems, along\nwith a detailed exploration of its applications in fields such as question\nanswering, summarization, and information retrieval. Finally, we highlight\nemerging research directions and opportunities for improving RAG systems, such\nas enhanced retrieval efficiency, model interpretability, and domain-specific\nadaptations. This paper concludes by outlining the prospects for RAG in\naddressing real-world challenges and its potential to drive further\nadvancements in natural language processing.",

In this paper, we present a curriculum\nlearning-based framework that initially trains the model on single-expression\ntasks and subsequently incorporates multi-expression data. This design ensures\nthat our model first masters the fundamental features of basic expressions\nbefore being exposed to the complexities of compound emotions. Specifically,\nour designs can be summarized as follows: 1) Single-Expression Pre-training:\nThe model is first trained on datasets containing single expressions to learn\nthe foundational facial features associated with basic emotions. 2) Dynamic\nCompound Expression Generation: Given the scarcity of annotated compound\nexpression datasets, we employ CutMix and Mixup techniques on the original\nsingle-expression images to create hybrid images exhibiting characteristics of\nmultiple basic emotions. 3) Incremental Multi-Expression Integration: After\nperforming well on single-expression tasks, the model is progressively exposed\nto multi-expression data, allowing the model to adapt to the complexity and\nvariability of compound expressions.

While prior work has demonstrated\nthat face recognition systems exhibit bias against some demographic groups,\nthere exists a substantial gap in our understanding regarding the fairness of\nface obfuscation methods. Providing fair face obfuscation methods can ensure\nequitable protection across diverse demographic groups, especially since they\ncan be used to preserve the privacy of vulnerable populations. To address these\ngaps, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework, named FairDeFace,\ndesigned to assess the adversarial robustness and fairness of face obfuscation\nmethods. The framework introduces a set of modules encompassing data\nbenchmarks, face detection and recognition algorithms, adversarial models,\nutility detection models, and fairness metrics. FairDeFace serves as a\nversatile platform where any face obfuscation method can be integrated,\nallowing for rigorous testing and comparison with other state-of-the-art\nmethods. In its current implementation, FairDeFace incorporates 6 attacks, and\nseveral privacy, utility and fairness metrics. Using FairDeFace, and by\nconducting more than 500 experiments, we evaluated and compared the adversarial\nrobustness of seven face obfuscation methods. This extensive analysis led to\nmany interesting findings both in terms of the degree of robustness of existing\nmethods and their biases against some gender or racial groups. FairDeFace also\nuses visualization of focused areas for both obfuscation and verification\nattacks to show not only which areas are mostly changed in the obfuscation\nprocess for some demographics, but also why they failed through focus area\ncomparison of obfuscation and verification.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the critical problem of representation similarity\nevolution during cross-domain transfer learning, with particular focus on\nunderstanding why pre-trained models maintain effectiveness when adapted to\nmedical imaging tasks despite significant domain gaps. The study establishes a\nrigorous problem definition centered on quantifying and analyzing\nrepresentation similarity trajectories throughout the fine-tuning process,\nwhile carefully delineating the scope to encompass both medical image analysis\nand broader cross-domain adaptation scenarios. Our empirical findings reveal\nthree critical discoveries: the potential existence of high-performance models\nthat preserve both task accuracy and representation similarity to their\npre-trained origins; a robust linear correlation between layer-wise similarity\nmetrics and representation quality indicators; and distinct adaptation patterns\nthat differentiate supervised versus self-supervised pre-training paradigms.\nThe proposed similarity space framework not only provides mechanistic insights\ninto knowledge transfer dynamics but also raises fundamental questions about\noptimal utilization of pre-trained models. These results advance our\nunderstanding of neural network adaptation processes while offering practical\nimplications for transfer learning strategies that extend beyond medical\nimaging applications.

While existing neural\nnetwork-based detectors perform well on benchmarks, they struggle with\ngeneralization due to distribution shifts across datasets and frequently\nproduce overconfident predictions for out-of-distribution accounts beyond the\ntraining data. To address this, we introduce a novel Uncertainty Estimation for\nSocial Bot Detection (UESBD) framework, which quantifies the predictive\nuncertainty of detectors beyond mere classification. For this task, we propose\nRobust Multi-modal Neural Processes (RMNP), which aims to enhance the\nrobustness of multi-modal neural processes to modality inconsistencies caused\nby social bot camouflage. RMNP first learns unimodal representations through\nmodality-specific encoders. Then, unimodal attentive neural processes are\nemployed to encode the Gaussian distribution of unimodal latent variables.\nFurthermore, to avoid social bots stealing human features to camouflage\nthemselves thus causing certain modalities to provide conflictive information,\nwe introduce an evidential gating network to explicitly model the reliability\nof modalities. The joint latent distribution is learned through the generalized\nproduct of experts, which takes the reliability of each modality into\nconsideration during fusion. The final prediction is obtained through Monte\nCarlo sampling of the joint latent distribution followed by a decoder.\nExperiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of RMNP in\nclassification and uncertainty estimation, as well as its robustness to\nmodality conflicts.",

Among these regions, two are\nionization-bounded, while the remaining eight are matter-bounded. The\nmatter-bounded HII regions exhibit shallower slopes in their radial flux\nprofiles compared to the ionization-bounded ones. In most cases, the [N II]/Ha\nand [S II]/Ha ratios increase with distance from the center of the HII regions,\nconsistent with model predictions that low-ionization emissions dominate the\nouter zones of these regions. The two ionization-bounded HII regions have\nkinematic ages (t) of 0.2 and 0.3 Myr, while the matter-bounded regions span\nages from 1 to 12 Myr. For the matter-bounded HII regions, the optical emission\nflux decreases continuously beyond the photodissociation region (PDR),\nextending to approximately 1-4 times the radius of the PDR (r_PDR). The escape\nfraction f_esc of ionizing photons, derived from 1D Ha radial flux profiles, is\n~ 0% for ionization-bounded HII regions, while it ranges from 50% to 90% for\nthe matter-bounded HII regions.

    "abstract": "Chiral materials exhibit a spin filtering effect, so-called chirality-induced\nspin selectivity (CISS). A recent observation of spin accumulation at the ends\nof a chiral-structured superconductor has opened up a new pathway for studying\nthe CISS effect in superconductors. In chiral-structured superconductors, the\nadmixture of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet order parameters significantly\ninfluences the properties of superconductivity. In this paper, we investigate\nthe interplay between the superconducting order parameter and\nsupercurrent-induced spin current, namely, the superconducting CISS effect. In\nweakly party-mixed superconductors, the spin current, which is predominantly\ntemperature-independent, is carried by spin-polarized Cooper pairs with finite\ncenter-of-mass momentum. In contrast, in strongly party-mixed superconductors\nthe temperature-dependent spin current is also carried by electrons with\nopposite momentum and antiparallel spins forming a Cooper pair.\nChiral-structured superconductors will offer a novel platform for exploring the\nCISS effect and may provide deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms\nrelated to the parity-mixed order parameter.",

In this study, we delve into how\nultralight dilaton clouds, formed via SMBH superradiance, impact the black hole\nphoton rings. Our focus is on the dilaton-electromagnetic coupling term of the\nform $f(\\phi)F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. By integrating geometric optics with plasma\nrefractive effects in accretion environments, we demonstrate that the dilaton\ncloud dynamically alters the plasma frequency. Through systematic ray-tracing\nsimulations covering a range of photon frequencies and dilaton coupling\nstrengths, we reveal a photon ring oscillation that follows the period of that\nof the dilaton field. As the dilaton mass increases, this oscillation becomes\nsuppressed due to the washout effect of the dilaton-induced correction term\nover the light path integration. We further evaluated the observability of such\ndilaton-induced photon ring oscillations with current radio interferometric\ncapabilities. Our estimates indicate that this effect could potentially\nconstrain the dilaton-photon coupling to $g_{\\phi\\gamma}\\lesssim\n10^{-11}\\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for dilaton masses $\\mu \\lesssim\n10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.",

This framework leverages a joint\nsource-channel coding architecture to achieve simultaneous sensing decoding and\ntransmission of sensing results. Specifically, SIMAC first introduces a\nmultimodal semantic fusion (MSF) network, which employs two extractors to\nextract semantic information from radar signals and images, respectively. MSF\nthen applies cross-attention mechanisms to fuse these unimodal features and\ngenerate multimodal semantic representations. Secondly, we present a large\nlanguage model (LLM)-based semantic encoder (LSE), where relevant communication\nparameters and multimodal semantics are mapped into a unified latent space and\ninput to the LLM, enabling channel-adaptive semantic encoding. Thirdly, a\ntask-oriented sensing semantic decoder (SSD) is proposed, in which different\ndecoded heads are designed according to the specific needs of tasks.\nSimultaneously, a multi-task learning strategy is introduced to train the SIMAC\nframework, achieving diverse sensing services.

The discovery of PSR J0311+1402 suggests the\nexistence of a previously undetected population within this intermediate period\nrange, presumably missed due to selection biases in traditional pulsar search\nmethods. Finding more such objects is important to fill the current gap in\nneutron star spin periods, improving our understanding of the relationships\namong rotation-powered pulsars and LPTs.",

The performance of such\nwireless networks can be improved by developing new navigation and wireless\nadaptation approaches in digital twins (DTs). However, challenges such as\ncomplex propagation conditions and hardware complexities in real-world\nscenarios introduce a realism gap with the DTs. Moreover, while using real-time\nfull-stack protocols in DTs enables subsequent deployment and testing in a\nreal-world environment, development in DTs requires high computational\ncomplexity and involves a long development time. In this paper, to accelerate\nthe development cycle, we develop a measurement-calibrated Matlab-based\nsimulation framework to replicate performance in a full-stack UAV wireless\nnetwork DT. In particular, we use the DT from the NSF AERPAW platform and\ncompare its reports with those generated by our developed simulation framework\nin wireless networks with similar settings. In both environments, we observe\ncomparable results in terms of RSRP measurement, hence motivating iterative use\nof the developed simulation environment with the DT.",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations indicate the smallest change in input that can\ntranslate to a different outcome for a machine learning model. Counterfactuals\nhave generated immense interest in high-stakes applications such as finance,\neducation, hiring, etc. In several use-cases, the decision-making process often\nrelies on an ensemble of models rather than just one. Despite significant\nresearch on counterfactuals for one model, the problem of generating a single\ncounterfactual explanation for an ensemble of models has received limited\ninterest. Each individual model might lead to a different counterfactual,\nwhereas trying to find a counterfactual accepted by all models might\nsignificantly increase cost (effort). We propose a novel strategy to find the\ncounterfactual for an ensemble of models using the perspective of entropic risk\nmeasure. Entropic risk is a convex risk measure that satisfies several\ndesirable properties. We incorporate our proposed risk measure into a novel\nconstrained optimization to generate counterfactuals for ensembles that stay\nvalid for several models. The main significance of our measure is that it\nprovides a knob that allows for the generation of counterfactuals that stay\nvalid under an adjustable fraction of the models. We also show that a limiting\ncase of our entropic-risk-based strategy yields a counterfactual valid for all\nmodels in the ensemble (worst-case min-max approach). We study the trade-off\nbetween the cost (effort) for the counterfactual and its validity for an\nensemble by varying degrees of risk aversion, as determined by our risk\nparameter knob. We validate our performance on real-world datasets.",

Identifying scatteredly-distributed and low-contrast LNs in 3D CT\nscans is highly challenging, even for experienced clinicians. Previous lesion\nand LN detection methods demonstrate effectiveness of 2.5D approaches (i.e,\nusing 2D network with multi-slice inputs), leveraging pretrained 2D model\nweights and showing improved accuracy as compared to separate 2D or 3D\ndetectors. However, slice-based 2.5D detectors do not explicitly model\ninter-slice consistency for LN as a 3D object, requiring heuristic post-merging\nsteps to generate final 3D LN instances, which can involve tuning a set of\nparameters for each dataset. In this work, we formulate 3D LN detection as a\ntracking task and propose LN-Tracker, a novel LN tracking transformer, for\njoint end-to-end detection and 3D instance association. Built upon DETR-based\ndetector, LN-Tracker decouples transformer decoder's query into the track and\ndetection groups, where the track query autoregressively follows previously\ntracked LN instances along the z-axis of a CT scan. We design a new transformer\ndecoder with masked attention module to align track query's content to the\ncontext of current slice, meanwhile preserving detection query's high accuracy\nin current slice. An inter-slice similarity loss is introduced to encourage\ncohesive LN association between slices. Extensive evaluation on four lymph node\ndatasets shows LN-Tracker's superior performance, with at least 2.7% gain in\naverage sensitivity when compared to other top 3D/2.5D detectors. Further\nvalidation on public lung nodule and prostate tumor detection tasks confirms\nthe generalizability of LN-Tracker as it achieves top performance on both\ntasks.",

The luminosity of HCN and HCO$^+$ $J = 1-0$ lines\nare converted to a dense gas mass by the conversion factor, $\\alpha_{Q}$.\nTraditionally, this $\\alpha_{Q}$ has been considered constant throughout the\nGalaxy and in other galaxies, regardless of the environment. We analyzed 17\nouter Galaxy clouds and 5 inner Galaxy clouds with metallicities ranging from\n0.38 Z$_{\\odot}$ to 1.29 Z$_{\\odot}$. Our analysis indicates that $\\alpha_{Q}$\nis not constant; instead, it varies with metallicity. The metallicity-corrected\n$\\alpha_{Q}$ derived from the HCN luminosity of the entire cloud is almost\nthree times higher in the outer Galaxy than in the inner galaxy. In contrast,\nHCO$^+$ seems less sensitive to metallicity. We recommend using the\nmetallicity-corrected dense gas conversion factors $\\alpha^{'}_{\\rm tot,\nGas}(\\rm HCN) = 19.5^{+5.6}_{-4.4} Z^{(-1.53 \\pm 0.59)}$ and $\\alpha^{'}_{\\rm\ntot, Gas}(\\rm HCO^{+}) = 21.4^{+5.5}_{-4.4} Z^{(-1.32\\pm0.55)}$ for\nextragalactic studies. Radiation from nearby stars has an effect on the\nconversion factor of similar magnitude as that of the metallicity. If we extend\nthe metallicity-corrected scaling relation for HCN to the Central Molecular\nZone, the value of $\\alpha(\\rm HCN)$ becomes $1/3$ to $1/2$ of the local\nvalues.

With this new mode, we find an optimal filter to\nsubtract the noise from the signal during read out. We also take advantage of\nthe MAS CCD's structure to tune the read time by independently changing\nintegration times for the signal and reference level. Together with optimal\nweighted averaging of the 16 outputs, these approaches enable us to reach a\nsub-electron noise of 0.9 e$^-$ rms pix$^{-1}$ at 19 $\\mu$s pix$^{-1}$ for a\nsingle charge measurement per pixel - simultaneously giving a 30% faster\nreadout time and 10% lower read noise compared to performance previously\nevaluated without these techniques.",

DFT+U calculations reveal that the A-type\nantiferromagnetic ground state of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ persists throughout the\nstudied pressure range. Electronic structure analysis shows that the\nNi-$d_{xy}$ and Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level in both the\n$Fmmm$ and $Amam$ phases of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Phonon dispersion calculations\nfor the $Fmmm$ phase reveal no imaginary modes from 12 to 29.5 GPa, confirming\nits dynamical stability in this pressure range.
