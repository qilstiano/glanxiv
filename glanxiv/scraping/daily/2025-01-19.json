    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient segmentation of brain tumors is critical for\ndiagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring in clinical practice. In this\nstudy, we present an enhanced ResUNet architecture for automatic brain tumor\nsegmentation, integrating an EfficientNetB0 encoder, a channel attention\nmechanism, and an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. The\nEfficientNetB0 encoder leverages pre-trained features to improve feature\nextraction efficiency, while the channel attention mechanism enhances the\nmodel's focus on tumor-relevant features. ASPP enables multiscale contextual\nlearning, crucial for handling tumors of varying sizes and shapes. The proposed\nmodel was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: TCGA LGG and BraTS 2020.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the\nbaseline ResUNet and its EfficientNet variant, achieving Dice coefficients of\n0.903 and 0.851 and HD95 scores of 9.43 and 3.54 for whole tumor and tumor core\nregions on the BraTS 2020 dataset, respectively. compared with state-of-the-art\nmethods, our approach shows competitive performance, particularly in whole\ntumor and tumor core segmentation. These results indicate that combining a\npowerful encoder with attention mechanisms and ASPP can significantly enhance\nbrain tumor segmentation performance. The proposed approach holds promise for\nfurther optimization and application in other medical image segmentation tasks.",

One common approach to tackle this challenge is the pinning of walls\nby point defects. The fundamental understanding on how different defects\ninfluence the wall dynamics is, however, incomplete. In particular, the\nimportant class of defect dipoles in acceptor-doped ferroelectrics is currently\nunderrepresented in theoretical work. In this study, we combine molecular\ndynamics simulations based on an \\textit{ab\\ initio}-derived effective\nHamiltonian and methods from materials informatics, and analyze the impact of\nthese defects on the motion of 180$^{\\circ}$ domain walls in tetragonal\nBaTiO$_3$. We show how these defects can act as local pinning centers and\nrestoring forces on the domain structure. Furthermore, we reveal how walls can\nflow around sparse defects by nucleation and growth of dipole clusters, and how\npinning, roughening and bending of walls depend on the defect distribution.\nSurprisingly, the interaction between acceptor dopants and walls is\nshort-ranged. We show that the limiting factor for the nucleation processes\nunderlying wall motion is the defect-free area in front of the wall.",

    "abstract": "As LLMs develop increasingly advanced capabilities, there is an increased\nneed to minimize the harm that could be caused to society by certain model\noutputs; hence, most LLMs have safety guardrails added, for example via\nfine-tuning. In this paper, we argue the position that current safety\nfine-tuning is very similar to a traditional cat-and-mouse game (or arms race)\nbetween attackers and defenders in cybersecurity. Model jailbreaks and attacks\nare patched with bandaids to target the specific attack mechanism, but many\nsimilar attack vectors might remain. When defenders are not proactively coming\nup with principled mechanisms, it becomes very easy for attackers to sidestep\nany new defenses. We show how current defenses are insufficient to prevent new\nadversarial jailbreak attacks, reward hacking, and loss of control problems. In\norder to learn from past mistakes in cybersecurity, we draw analogies with\nhistorical examples and develop lessons learned that can be applied to LLM\nsafety. These arguments support the need for new and more principled approaches\nto designing safe models, which are architected for security from the\nbeginning. We describe several such approaches from the AI literature.",

As a\nbiological model, we focus on the branching morphogenesis of the planarian gut,\nwhich is a highly branched organ responsible for the delivery of nutrients.\nPlanarians undergo massive body size changes requiring gut morphology to adapt\nto these size variations. Our experimental analysis shows that various gut\nproperties scale with organism size according to power laws. We introduce a\ntheoretical framework to understand the growth and scaling of branched organs.\nOur theory considers the dynamics of the interface between organ and\nsurrounding tissue to be controlled by a morphogen and illustrates how a shape\ninstability of this interface can give rise to the self-organized formation and\ngrowth of complex branched patterns. Considering the reaction-diffusion\ndynamics in a growing domain representative of organismal growth, we show that\na wide range of scaling behaviors of the branching pattern emerges from the\ninterplay between interface dynamics and organism growth. Our model can\nrecapitulate the scaling laws of planarian gut morphology that we quantified\nand also opens new directions for understanding allometric scaling laws in\nvarious other branching systems in organisms.",

In explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), conditional\nfeature importance assesses the impact of a feature on a prediction model's\nperformance given the information of other features. Model-agnostic post hoc\nmethods to do so typically evaluate changes in the predictive performance under\non-manifold feature value manipulations. Such procedures require creating\nfeature values that respect conditional feature distributions, which can be\nchallenging in practice. Recent advancements in generative modeling can\nfacilitate this. For tabular data, which may consist of both categorical and\ncontinuous features, the adversarial random forest (ARF) stands out as a\ngenerative model that can generate on-manifold data points without requiring\nintensive tuning efforts or computational resources, making it a promising\ncandidate model for subroutines in XAI methods. This paper proposes cARFi\n(conditional ARF feature importance), a method for measuring conditional\nfeature importance through feature values sampled from ARF-estimated\nconditional distributions. cARFi requires only little tuning to yield robust\nimportance scores that can flexibly adapt for conditional or marginal notions\nof feature importance, including straightforward extensions to condition on\nfeature subsets and allows for inferring the significance of feature\nimportances through statistical tests.",

    "abstract": "Synchrophasor technology or phasor measurement units (PMUs) are known to\ndetect multiple type of oscillations or faults better than Supervisory Control\nand Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, but the volume of Bigdata (e.g., 30-120\nsamples per second on a single PMU) generated by these sensors at the\naggregator level (e.g., several PMUs) requires special handling. Conventional\nmachine learning or data mining methods are not suitable to handle such larger\nstreaming realtime data. This is primarily due to latencies associated with\ncloud environments (e.g., at an aggregator or PDC level), and thus necessitates\nthe need for local computing to move the data on the edge (or locally at the\nPMU level) for processing. This requires faster real-time streaming algorithms\nto be processed at the local level (e.g., typically by a Field Programmable\nGate Array (FPGA) based controllers). This paper proposes a transfer\nlearning-based hoeffding tree with ADWIN (THAT) method to detect anomalous\nsynchrophasor signatures. The proposed algorithm is trained and tested with the\nOzaBag method. The preliminary results with transfer learning indicate that a\ncomputational time saving of 0.7ms is achieved with THAT algorithm (0.34ms)\nover Ozabag (1.04ms), while the accuracy of both methods in detecting fault\nevents remains at 94% for four signatures.",

    "abstract": "Attention can be used to inform choice selection in contextual bandit tasks\neven when context features have not been previously experienced. One example of\nthis is in dimensional shifts, where additional feature values are introduced\nand the relationship between features and outcomes can either be static or\nvariable. Attentional mechanisms have been extensively studied in contextual\nbandit tasks where the feedback of choices is provided immediately, but less\nresearch has been done on tasks where feedback is delayed or in counterfactual\nfeedback cases. Some methods have successfully modeled human attention with\nimmediate feedback based on reward prediction errors (RPEs), though recent\nresearch raises questions of the applicability of RPEs onto more general\nattentional mechanisms. Alternative models suggest that information theoretic\nmetrics can be used to model human attention, with broader applications to\nnovel stimuli. In this paper, we compare two different methods for modeling how\nhumans attend to specific features of decision making tasks, one that is based\non calculating an information theoretic metric using a memory of past\nexperiences, and another that is based on iteratively updating attention from\nreward prediction errors. We compare these models using simulations in a\ncontextual bandit task with both intradimensional and extradimensional domain\nshifts, as well as immediate, delayed, and counterfactual feedback. We find\nthat calculating an information theoretic metric over a history of experiences\nis best able to account for human-like behavior in tasks that shift dimensions\nand alter feedback presentation. These results indicate that information\ntheoretic metrics of attentional mechanisms may be better suited than RPEs to\npredict human attention in decision making, though further studies of human\nbehavior are necessary to support these results.",

    "abstract": "The interest in leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for surgical\nprocedures to automate analysis has witnessed a significant surge in recent\nyears. One of the primary tools for recording surgical procedures and\nconducting subsequent analyses, such as performance assessment, is through\nvideos. However, these operative videos tend to be notably lengthy compared to\nother fields, spanning from thirty minutes to several hours, which poses a\nchallenge for AI models to effectively learn from them. Despite this challenge,\nthe foreseeable increase in the volume of such videos in the near future\nnecessitates the development and implementation of innovative techniques to\ntackle this issue effectively. In this article, we propose a novel technique\ncalled Kinematics Adaptive Frame Recognition (KAFR) that can efficiently\neliminate redundant frames to reduce dataset size and computation time while\nretaining useful frames to improve accuracy. Specifically, we compute the\nsimilarity between consecutive frames by tracking the movement of surgical\ntools. Our approach follows these steps: $i)$ Tracking phase: a YOLOv8 model is\nutilized to detect tools presented in the scene, $ii)$ Similarity phase:\nSimilarities between consecutive frames are computed by estimating variation in\nthe spatial positions and velocities of the tools, $iii$) Classification phase:\nAn X3D CNN is trained to classify segmentation. We evaluate the effectiveness\nof our approach by analyzing datasets obtained through retrospective reviews of\ncases at two referral centers. The newly annotated Gastrojejunostomy (GJ)\ndataset covers procedures performed between 2017 and 2021, while the previously\nannotated Pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) dataset spans from 2011 to 2022 at the\nsame centers.",

In addition, the computational cost\nof the previous IMEX approach in comparison with the standard explicit methods\nis much higher. The MIRK methods are able to deal with stiff terms producing\nstable numerical evolutions, minimize the number of recoveries needed in\ncomparison with IMEX methods, their computational cost is similar to the\nstandard explicit methods and can actually be easily implemented in numerical\ncodes which previously used explicit schemes.

A significant challenge for these\nclassifiers emerges when they encounter images from generative models that are\nnot represented in their training data, usually resulting in diminished\nperformance. A typical approach is to periodically update the classifier's\ntraining data with images from the new generative models then retrain the\nclassifier on the updated dataset. However, in some real-life scenarios,\nstorage, computational, or privacy constraints render this approach\nimpractical. Additionally, models used in security applications may be required\nto rapidly adapt. In these circumstances, continual learning provides a\npromising alternative, as the classifier can be updated without retraining on\nthe entire dataset.

In\nthis work, we consider community detection in the Contextual Labeled Stochastic\nBlock Model (CLSBM), where the network follows an LSBM and node attributes\nfollow a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Our primary focus is the\nmisclassification rate, which measures the expected number of nodes\nmisclassified by community detection algorithms. We first establish a lower\nbound on the optimal misclassification rate that holds for any algorithm. When\nwe specialize our setting to the LSBM (which preserves only network\ninformation) or the GMM (which preserves only node attribute information), our\nlower bound recovers prior results. Moreover, we present an efficient\nspectral-based algorithm tailored for the CLSBM and derive an upper bound on\nits misclassification rate. Although the algorithm does not attain the lower\nbound, it serves as a reliable starting point for designing more accurate\ncommunity detection algorithms (as many algorithms use spectral method as an\ninitial step, followed by refinement procedures to enhance accuracy).",

In contrast, the sparse strategy minimizes\nthe number of multicast streams transmitted in parallel during each interval.\nThis approach simplifies both the decoding process and the beamforming design\nby decoupling the desired data terms for each user and reducing the number of\nSINR constraints, respectively. To further enhance the symmetric rate, a\nsuccessive projection algorithm is applied to exploit channel properties and\noptimize user ordering. With the coefficient matrix and optimized user ordering\nin place, multicast beamformers are devised to aggregate desired data from\nrelevant multicast streams. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of\nthe sparse strategy and user scheduling, demonstrating significant gains in\nsymmetric rate.",

To target these\nissues, we introduce a two-stage noisy label learning strategy to harness every\npotential useful signal in noisy labels. First, we propose a frame-level\npseudo-label generation model with a context-aware denoising algorithm to\nrefine the boundaries.

Among the sources with XMM-Newton observations, we found\ntwo sources, J0713+4349 and J1326+3154 to show clear evidence of variations in\nthe soft (0.3$-$2 keV), the hard (2$-$10 keV) and the total energy (0.3$-$10\nkeV) bands with the normalised excess variance (F$_{var}$) as large as\n1.17$\\pm$0.27. Also, the F$_{var}$ is found to be larger in the hard band\nrelative to the soft band for J1326+3154. From the analysis of the hardness\nratio (HR) with count rate, we found both sources to show a harder when\nbrighter (HWB) trend. Similarly, in the Chandra observations, we found one\nsource, J0131+5545, to show flux variations in the total energy band (0.5$-$7\nkeV). We discuss possible reasons for about 82 per cent of the CSOs being\nnon-variable. From spectral analysis, carried out in a homogeneous manner, we\nfound the existence of obscured as well as unobscured CSOs.

Wind speed is higher during the nighttime in Lausanne and during\nthe daytime in Geneva, due to the different interaction between the local\nlake-breeze circulation and the synoptic flow. Simulated performance of\ncase-study VAWTs is dominated by cut-in wind speed and power curve inflection\npoint.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made notable progress in mathematical\nreasoning, yet often rely on single-paradigm reasoning, limiting their\neffectiveness across diverse tasks. We introduce Chain-of-Reasoning (CoR), a\nnovel unified framework integrating multiple reasoning paradigms--Natural\nLanguage Reasoning (NLR), Algorithmic Reasoning (AR), and Symbolic Reasoning\n(SR)--to enable synergistic collaboration. CoR generates multiple potential\nanswers via different reasoning paradigms and synthesizes them into a coherent\nfinal solution. We propose a Progressive Paradigm Training (PPT) strategy for\nmodels to progressively master these paradigms, leading to CoR-Math-7B.\nExperimental results demonstrate that CoR-Math-7B significantly outperforms\ncurrent SOTA models, achieving up to a 41.0% absolute improvement over GPT-4o\nin theorem proving and a 15.0% improvement over RL-based methods on the MATH\nbenchmark in arithmetic tasks. These results show the enhanced mathematical\ncomprehension ability of our model, enabling zero-shot generalization across\ntasks.",

One-dimensional (1D) atomic defects in\nlow-dimensional systems are particularly intriguing due to their distinct\nquantum properties, such as 1D Rashba states that allow for the generation of\nnondissipative spin currents, making them ideal for spintronic devices. Using\ndensity-functional calculations and model-based symmetry analysis, we report\nthe emergence of 1D Rashba states in a two-dimensional Si$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$\nmonolayer (ML) with vacancy line defects (VLDs). We show that introducing VLDs\nin the Si$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ ML induces 1D confined defect states near the Fermi\nlevel, which are strongly localized along the extended defect line. Notably, we\nobserved 1D Rashba spin-split bands in these defect states with significant\nspin splitting originating mainly from the strong $p-p$ coupling orbitals\nbetween Si and Bi atoms near the defect sites. These spin-split defect states\nexhibit perfectly collinear spin polarization in momentum $\\vec{k}$-space,\nwhich is oriented perpendicularly to the VLD orientation. Moreover, using\n$\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{p}$ perturbation theory supplemented with symmetry analysis,\nwe show that the 1D Rashba states with collinear spin polarization are enforced\nby the lowering of symmetry of the VLDs into the $C_{s}$ point group, which\nretains the $M_{xz}$ mirror symmetry along with the 1D nature of the VLDs. The\nobserved 1D Rashba states in this system protect carriers against spin\ndecoherence and support an exceptionally long spin lifetime, which could be\npromising for developing highly efficient spintronic devices.",

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel stochastic simulation approach based on a Feynman-Kac-like\nrepresentation of the population dynamics. This method, named the\nFeynman-Kac-inspired Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (FKG-SSA),\nalways employs a fixed number of independently simulated cells for Monte Carlo\ncomputation of the system, resulting in a constant computational complexity\nregardless of the population size. Furthermore, we theoretically show the\nstatistical consistency of the proposed method, indicating its accuracy and\nreliability.

The effectiveness of this research highlights the\nfutility of attempting to impose linguistic uniformity and underscores the\nimportance of understanding local cultural dynamics in preserving linguistic\nheritage. This pure language understanding directly relates to translation\nknowledge where linguists and translators need to work and research to\neradicate misunderstanding.

While advanced\ntechniques like radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting achieve rendering\nquality and impressive efficiency with dense view inputs, they suffer from\nsignificant geometric reconstruction errors when applied to sparse input views.\nMoreover, although recent methods leverage monocular depth estimation to\nenhance geometric learning, their dependence on single-view estimated depth\noften leads to view inconsistency issues across different viewpoints.\nConsequently, this reliance on absolute depth can introduce inaccuracies in\ngeometric information, ultimately compromising the quality of scene\nreconstruction with Gaussian splats. In this paper, we present RDG-GS, a novel\nsparse-view 3D rendering framework with Relative Depth Guidance based on 3D\nGaussian Splatting. The core innovation lies in utilizing relative depth\nguidance to refine the Gaussian field, steering it towards view-consistent\nspatial geometric representations, thereby enabling the reconstruction of\naccurate geometric structures and capturing intricate textures. First, we\ndevise refined depth priors to rectify the coarse estimated depth and insert\nglobal and fine-grained scene information to regular Gaussians. Building on\nthis, to address spatial geometric inaccuracies from absolute depth, we propose\nrelative depth guidance by optimizing the similarity between spatially\ncorrelated patches of depth and images. Additionally, we also directly deal\nwith the sparse areas challenging to converge by the adaptive sampling for\nquick densification.

The latent encodings are extracted by a\ntrained network (URE-Net) from the input dense density map and other available\nsemantic maps.

Channel sounding is essential for developing accurate and\nrealistic channel models for the massive MIMO systems. However, channel\nsounding with large-scale antenna systems has faced significant challenges in\npractice. The real antenna array based (RAA) sounder suffers from high\ncomplexity and cost, while virtual antenna array (VAA) solutions are known for\nits long measurement time. Notably, these issues will become more pronounced as\nthe antenna array configuration gets larger for future radio systems. In this\npaper, we propose the concept of multiplicative array (MA) for channel sounding\napplications to achieve large antenna aperture size with reduced number of\nrequired antenna elements. The unique characteristics of the MA are exploited\nfor wideband spatial channel sounding purposes, supported by both one-path and\nmulti-path numerical simulations. To address the fake paths and distortion in\nthe angle delay profile issues inherent for MA in multipath channel sounding, a\nnovel channel parameter estimation algorithm for MA based on successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC) principle is proposed.

Building on this foundation, we reinterpret proof-of-work (PoW) as an\nentropy-compression mechanism that drives Bitcoin's temporal architecture. In\nthis framework, difficulty adjustment keeps block discovery near the\nentropy-maximizing regime, the longest-chain rule enforces entropy collapse\nonce a block is found, and recursive hash pointers embed each block within its\npredecessor, creating a cascading structure that renders reorganization\nexponentially improbable.

We\npropose a lasso penalized mixed model for continuous and binary longitudinal\ntraits that allows the inclusion of multiple random effects to account for\nrandom individual effects not attributable to the genetic similarity between\nindividuals. Through simulation studies, we show that replacing the estimated\ngenetic relatedness matrix (GRM) by a sparse matrix introduces bias in the\nvariance components estimates, but that the obtained computational gain is\nmajor while the impact on the performance of the penalized model to retrieve\nimportant predictors is negligible. We compare the performance of the proposed\npenalized mixed model to a standard lasso and to a univariate mixed model\nassociation test and show that the proposed model always identifies causal\npredictors with greater precision.

Analogously, functional Ward's\nlinkage defines the distance of two clusters as the increased width of the band\ndelimited by the merged clusters. To address the limitations of conventional\nWard's linkage in handling outliers and contamination, the proposed linkages\nfocus exclusively on the most central curves by leveraging magnitude-shape\noutlyingness measures and modified band depth, respectively.

Above the critical magnetic field, calculated by\nSchwinger in the lowest order perturbation in quantum electrodynamics (QED),\none reaches the threshold for electron-positron pair creation, which has\ninteresting consequences. Therefore, finding out whether one could encounter\nsome consequences of interest also for the values of the magnetic field below\nthe Schwinger critical point, we invoke the next higher-order effect in QED,\nwhich is emerging from the Quantum Vacuum Effect. The latter is equivalent to\nthe use of the Euler-Heisenberg effective theory in nonlinear electrodynamics,\nwhere the Lagrangian has a term with a higher power, $B^4$. In this case, in\nthe region $B<B_{\\rm crit}$, we show that interesting effects appear, among\nthem the Cherenkov radiation and the reduction in the speed of light. The\nlatter effects appear because of the quantum vacuum mimicking a medium. We also\npresent quantitative arguments for such a close analogy. As a rough estimate,\nwe show that the time delay $\\tau$ of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) having traveled\nthrough the entire cosmological distances in an average strong magnetic field\nsuch as $10^6~$Tesla, reaches an experimentally considerable value of $\\tau =\n2.4$ hours. In the vicinity of magnetars, the magnetic field is much stronger,\nof the order of $10^9-10^{11}$ Tesla. However, in this case the linear scale of\nGRB trajectory through such regions would be much smaller. For the latter, we\ngive an estimate for the number of the magnetars along the trajectory and also\nfor the delay.

Emotion recognition from physiological signals such as\nEEG, ECG, and GSR plays a pivotal role in enhancing human-computer interaction\nand understanding human affective states. Utilizing these signals, this study\nintroduces an innovative approach to synthetic data generation using a\nSupervised Neural Gas (SNG) network, which has demonstrated noteworthy speed\nadvantages over established models like Conditional VAE, Conditional GAN,\ndiffusion model, and Variational LSTM. The Neural Gas network, known for its\nadaptability in organizing data based on topological and feature-space\nproximity, provides a robust framework for generating real-world-like synthetic\ndatasets that preserve the intrinsic patterns of physiological emotion data.\nOur implementation of the SNG efficiently processes the input data, creating\nsynthetic instances that closely mimic the original data distributions, as\ndemonstrated through comparative accuracy assessments. In experiments, while\nour approach did not universally outperform all models, it achieved superior\nperformance against most of the evaluated models and offered significant\nimprovements in processing time.

Given the high energy demands in shadow regions where\nsolar energy is unavailable, MF-RIS is deployed in LEO to enhance signal\ncoverage and improve energy efficiency (EE). To address this, we formulate a\nlong-term EE optimization problem by determining the optimal parameters for\nMF-RIS configurations, including amplification and phase-shifts, energy\nharvesting ratios, and LEO transmit beamforming. To address the complex\nnon-convex and non-linear problem, a federated learning enhanced multi-agent\ndeep deterministic policy gradient (FEMAD) scheme is designed. Multi-agent DDPG\nof each agent can provide the optimal action policy from its interaction to\nenvironments, whereas federated learning enables the hidden information\nexchange among multi-agents. In numerical results, we can observe significant\nEE improvements compared to the other benchmarks, including centralized deep\nreinforcement learning as well as distributed multi-agent deep deterministic\npolicy gradient (DDPG). Additionally, the proposed LEO-MF-RIS architecture has\ndemonstrated its effectiveness, achieving the highest EE performance compared\nto the scenarios of fixed/no energy harvesting in MF-RIS, traditional\nreflection-only RIS, and deployment without RISs/MF-RISs.",

Thus, in\nthis paper we present two novel models that incorporate random edge deletions\ninto the duplication-divergence framework. As in protein-protein interaction\nnetworks, with proteins as vertices and interactions as edges, by design\nisolated vertices tend to be rare, our main focus is on the number of isolated\nvertices; our main result gives lower and upper bounds for the proportion of\nisolated vertices, when the network size is large. Using these bounds we\nidentify the parameter regimes for which almost all vertices are typically\nisolated; and also show that there are parameter regimes in which the\nproportion of isolated vertices can be bounded away from 0 and 1 with high\nprobability. In addition, we find regimes in which the proportion of isolated\nvertices tends to be small. The proof relies on a standard martingale argument,\nwhich in turn requires a careful analysis of the first two moments of the\nexpected degree distribution. The theoretical findings are illustrated by\nsimulations, indicating that as the network size tends to infinity, the\nproportion of isolated vertices can converge to a limit that is neither 0 or 1.",

Moreover, we define abelian extensions of Nijenhuis mock-Lie\nalgebras and show that equivalence classes of such extensions are linked to\ncohomology groups. The coboundary case leads to the introduction of an\nadmissible mock-Lie-Yang-Baxter equation (mLYBe) in Nijenhuis mock-Lie\nalgebras, for which the antisymmetric solutions give rise to Nijenhuis mock-Lie\nbialgebras. Furthermore, the notion of $\\mathcal O$-operator on Nijenhuis\nmock-Lie algebras is introduced and connected to mock-Lie-Yang-Baxter equation.",

    "abstract": "Parse graphs have been widely used in human pose estimation (HPE) to model\nthe hierarchical structure and context relations of the human body, which has\nbeen shown to effectively improve robustness and accuracy. But most methods\nrely on parse graphs built from predefined skeletons, causing two key issues:\npoor integratability with other models, and complex designs with redundant\nparameters for hierarchy and context relation modeling of body. To address\nthese issues, we propose a novel Refinement Module based on Parse Graph (RMPG).\nRMPG abandons skeleton connections and refines features by building implicit\nhierarchical structures and context relations between sub-feature maps, with\nstrong integratability. Furthermore, our hierarchical network design\ndemonstrates that RMPG can model the body's hierarchical structure and context\nrelations with a simpler architecture and fewer parameters. RMPG operates in\ntwo stages: the top-down decomposition recursively partitions the feature map\ninto a tree-structured hierarchy, where each node corresponds to a sub-feature\nmap; the bottom-up composition aggregates context information to progressively\nrefine the feature representation. Extensive experiments show that RMPG can be\nflexibly embedded into various methods, including our hierarchical networks,\nand consistently improves performance across multiple mainstream HPE\nbenchmarks. The code will be released.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming artificial intelligence,\nevolving into task-oriented systems capable of autonomous planning and\nexecution. One of the primary applications of LLMs is conversational AI\nsystems, which must navigate multi-turn dialogues, integrate domain-specific\nAPIs, and adhere to strict policy constraints. However, evaluating these agents\nremains a significant challenge, as traditional methods fail to capture the\ncomplexity and variability of real-world interactions. We introduce\nIntellAgent, a scalable, open-source multi-agent framework designed to evaluate\nconversational AI systems comprehensively. IntellAgent automates the creation\nof diverse, synthetic benchmarks by combining policy-driven graph modeling,\nrealistic event generation, and interactive user-agent simulations. This\ninnovative approach provides fine-grained diagnostics, addressing the\nlimitations of static and manually curated benchmarks with coarse-grained\nmetrics. IntellAgent represents a paradigm shift in evaluating conversational\nAI. By simulating realistic, multi-policy scenarios across varying levels of\ncomplexity, IntellAgent captures the nuanced interplay of agent capabilities\nand policy constraints. Unlike traditional methods, it employs a graph-based\npolicy model to represent relationships, likelihoods, and complexities of\npolicy interactions, enabling highly detailed diagnostics. IntellAgent also\nidentifies critical performance gaps, offering actionable insights for targeted\noptimization. Its modular, open-source design supports seamless integration of\nnew domains, policies, and APIs, fostering reproducibility and community\ncollaboration. Our findings demonstrate that IntellAgent serves as an effective\nframework for advancing conversational AI by addressing challenges in bridging\nresearch and deployment.

Importantly, the initial magnetic\nconfiguration identifies three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nulls and\nquasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), which nearly agree with the bright structures\nappeared in multi-wavelength observations. The Lorentz force associated with\nthe extrapolated field self-consistently generates the dynamics that leads to\nthe magnetic reconnections at the 3D nulls and the QSLs. These reconnections\nare found to contribute to the pre-flare activities and, ultimately, lead to\nthe development of the flare ribbons. Notably, the anchored spine of the 3D\nnull and the complete absence of flux rope in the flaring region are congruent\nwith the confined nature of the flare. Furthermore, the simulation also\nsuggests the role of reconnections at the 3D null with an open spine in the\nonset of a jet away from the flaring site.",

Although much research effort has been\ndevoted to improving the robustness towards noisy labels in classification\ntasks, the problem of noisy labels in deep metric learning (DML) remains\nunder-explored. Existing noisy label learning methods designed for DML mainly\ndiscard suspicious noisy samples, resulting in a waste of the training data. To\naddress this issue, we propose a noise-robust DML framework with SubGroup-based\nPositive-pair Selection (SGPS), which constructs reliable positive pairs for\nnoisy samples to enhance the sample utilization. Specifically, SGPS first\neffectively identifies clean and noisy samples by a probability-based clean\nsample selectionstrategy. To further utilize the remaining noisy samples, we\ndiscover their potential similar samples based on the subgroup information\ngiven by a subgroup generation module and then aggregate them into informative\npositive prototypes for each noisy sample via a positive prototype generation\nmodule. Afterward, a new contrastive loss is tailored for the noisy samples\nwith their selected positive pairs. SGPS can be easily integrated into the\ntraining process of existing pair-wise DML tasks, like image retrieval and face\nrecognition. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world\nlarge-scale label noise datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod. Without any bells and whistles, our SGPS framework outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art noisy label DML methods. Code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/smuelpeng/SGPS-NoiseFreeDML}.",

The ohmic contacts to the electron gas\nin these systems are accomplished by ion-implantation technique since the\nconventional Au/Sb alloyed contacts present a rough surface consisting of sharp\nislands and pits.

A clear understanding of the surface morphology, elemental,\ncompositional and electrical characterization of the alloyed region would\nenable one to engineer a smoother post alloyed surface.

The\nstructural, elemental, and chemical-state analysis show that the inverted\npyramidal pits are resulting from the enhanced Au/Si eutectic reaction at the\nthreading dislocations stemming from the heterostructure interface, while, the\nsharp protrusions causing accumulation gate-leakage are gold-rich\nprecipitations.

    "abstract": "Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) aims to improve the model generalization\nwhen facing data with noisy labels, and existing methods generally assume that\nnoisy labels come from known classes, called closed-set noise. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, noisy labels from similar unknown classes, i.e., open-set\nnoise, may occur during the training and inference stage. Such open-world noisy\nlabels may significantly impact the performance of LNL methods. In this study,\nwe propose a novel dual-space joint learning method to robustly handle the\nopen-world noise. To mitigate model overfitting on closed-set and open-set\nnoises, a dual representation space is constructed by two networks. One is a\nprojection network that learns shared representations in the prototype space,\nwhile the other is a One-Vs-All (OVA) network that makes predictions using\nunique semantic representations in the class-independent space. Then, bi-level\ncontrastive learning and consistency regularization are introduced in two\nspaces to enhance the detection capability for data with unknown classes. To\nbenefit from the memorization effects across different types of samples,\nclass-independent margin criteria are designed for sample identification, which\nselects clean samples, weights closed-set noise, and filters open-set noise\neffectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods and achieves an average accuracy improvement of 4.55\\%\nand an AUROC improvement of 6.17\\% on CIFAR80N.",

Verifiable Credential (VC) techniques are used to\nfacilitate decentralized DID-based access control across multiple entities.\nHowever, existing DID schemes generally rely on a distributed public key\ninfrastructure that also causes challenges, such as context information\ndeduction, key exposure, and issuer data leakage. To address the issues above,\nthis paper proposes a Permanent Issuer-Hiding (PIH)-based DID multi-party\nauthentication framework with a signature-less VC model, named SLVC-DIDA, for\nthe first time. Our proposed scheme avoids the dependence on signing keys by\nemploying hashing and issuer membership proofs, which supports universal\nzero-knowledge multi-party DID authentications, eliminating additional\ntechnical integrations. We adopt a zero-knowledge RSA accumulator to maintain\nthe anonymity of the issuer set, thereby enabling public verification while\nsafeguarding the privacy of identity attributes via a Merkle tree-based VC\nlist. By eliminating reliance on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), SLVC-DIDA\nenables fully decentralized issuance and verification of DIDs. Furthermore, our\nscheme ensures PIH through the implementation of the zero-knowledge Issuer set\nand VC list, so that the risks of key leakage and contextual inference attacks\nare effectively mitigated. Our experiments further evaluate the effectiveness\nand practicality of SLVC-DIDA.",

The results cover pure or mixed, separable, and entangled probe\nquantum states.

This paper\nprovides a set of security recommendations for 6G networks, with a particular\nfocus on access and handover procedures, which often lack encryption and\nintegrity protection, making them more vulnerable to exploitation. Since 6G is\nexpected to be a backward-compatible extension of 5G, and given that secure\nsystems cannot be effectively designed without a clear understanding of their\ngoals, it is imperative to first evaluate the limitations of the current\ngeneration. To this end, the paper begins by reviewing existing 5G access and\nauthentication mechanisms, highlighting several critical vulnerabilities in\nthese procedures. It then examines potential 6G challenges and concludes with\nactionable recommendations to enhance the security, resilience, and robustness\nof 6G access and handover mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models have revolutionized general-purpose problem-solving,\noffering rapid task adaptation through pretraining, meta-training, and\nfinetuning. Recent crucial advances in these paradigms reveal the importance of\nchallenging task prioritized sampling to enhance adaptation robustness under\ndistribution shifts. However, ranking task difficulties over iteration as a\npreliminary step typically requires exhaustive task evaluation, which is\npractically unaffordable in computation and data-annotation. This study\nprovides a novel perspective to illuminate the possibility of leveraging the\ndual importance of adaptation robustness and learning efficiency, particularly\nin scenarios where task evaluation is risky or costly, such as iterative\nagent-environment interactions for robotic policy evaluation or computationally\nintensive inference steps for finetuning foundation models. Firstly, we\nintroduce Model Predictive Task Sampling (MPTS), a framework that bridges the\ntask space and adaptation risk landscape, providing a theoretical foundation\nfor robust active task sampling. MPTS employs a generative model to\ncharacterize the episodic optimization process and predicts task-specific\nadaptation risk via posterior inference. The resulting risk learner amortizes\nthe costly evaluation of task adaptation performance and provably approximates\ntask difficulty rankings. MPTS seamlessly integrates into zero-shot, few-shot,\nand supervised finetuning settings. Empirically, we conduct extensive\nexperiments in pattern recognition using foundation models and sequential\ndecision-making. Our results demonstrate that MPTS significantly enhances\nadaptation robustness for tail or out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks and improves\nlearning efficiency compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Recently, activation\nsteering, a technique that modulates LLMs' behaviours by adjusting their latent\nrepresentations during inference time, has been explored to improve the\nsemantic consistency of LLMs. However, these methods typically operate at the\nmodel component level, such as layer hidden states or attention head outputs.\nThey face a challenge due to the ``polysemanticity issue'', where the model\ncomponents of LLMs typically encode multiple entangled features, making precise\nsteering difficult. To address this challenge, we drill down to feature-level\nrepresentations and propose LF-Steering, a novel activation steering approach\nto precisely identify latent feature representations responsible for semantic\ninconsistency. More specifically, our method maps the hidden states of the\nrelevant transformer layer into a sparsely activated, high-dimensional feature\nspace based on a sparse autoencoder (SAE), ensuring model steering based on\ndecoupled feature representations with minimal interference.

    "abstract": "In book search, relevant book information should be returned in response to a\nquery. Books contain complex, multi-faceted information such as metadata,\noutlines, and main text, where the outline provides hierarchical information\nbetween chapters and sections. Generative retrieval (GR) is a new retrieval\nparadigm that consolidates corpus information into a single model to generate\nidentifiers of documents that are relevant to a given query. How can GR be\napplied to book search? Directly applying GR to book search is a challenge due\nto the unique characteristics of book search: The model needs to retain the\ncomplex, multi-faceted information of the book, which increases the demand for\nlabeled data. Splitting book information and treating it as a collection of\nseparate segments for learning might result in a loss of hierarchical\ninformation. We propose an effective Generative retrieval framework for Book\nSearch (GBS) that features two main components: data augmentation and\noutline-oriented book encoding. For data augmentation, GBS constructs multiple\nquery-book pairs for training; it constructs multiple book identifiers based on\nthe outline, various forms of book contents, and simulates real book retrieval\nscenarios with varied pseudo-queries. This includes coverage-promoting book\nidentifier augmentation, allowing the model to learn to index effectively, and\ndiversity-enhanced query augmentation, allowing the model to learn to retrieve\neffectively. Outline-oriented book encoding improves length extrapolation\nthrough bi-level positional encoding and retentive attention mechanisms to\nmaintain context over long sequences.

    "abstract": "Automated log analysis is crucial to ensure high availability and reliability\nof complex systems. The advent of LLMs in NLP has ushered in a new era of\nlanguage model-driven automated log analysis, garnering significant interest.\nWithin this field, two primary paradigms based on language models for log\nanalysis have become prominent. Small Language Models (SLMs) follow the\npre-train and fine-tune paradigm, focusing on the specific log analysis task\nthrough fine-tuning on supervised datasets. On the other hand, LLMs following\nthe in-context learning paradigm, analyze logs by providing a few examples in\nprompt contexts without updating parameters. Despite their respective\nstrengths, we notice that SLMs are more cost-effective but less powerful,\nwhereas LLMs with large parameters are highly powerful but expensive and\ninefficient. To trade-off between the performance and inference costs of both\nmodels in automated log analysis, this paper introduces an adaptive log\nanalysis framework known as AdaptiveLog, which effectively reduces the costs\nassociated with LLM while ensuring superior results. This framework\ncollaborates an LLM and a small language model, strategically allocating the\nLLM to tackle complex logs while delegating simpler logs to the SLM.\nSpecifically, to efficiently query the LLM, we propose an adaptive selection\nstrategy based on the uncertainty estimation of the SLM, where the LLM is\ninvoked only when the SLM is uncertain. In addition, to enhance the reasoning\nability of the LLM in log analysis tasks, we propose a novel prompt strategy by\nretrieving similar error-prone cases as the reference, enabling the model to\nleverage past error experiences and learn solutions from these cases. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that AdaptiveLog achieves state-of-the-art results\nacross different tasks, elevating the overall accuracy of log analysis while\nmaintaining cost efficiency.",

Photography captures\nluminescent plasmas with submicrometer resolution, and bubble threshold and\nsize are determined via probe beam scattering. The energy dependence of\nmechanical effects is quantified through the maximum bubble radius Rmax. We\nfind three key scenarios depicting the interaction between multiphoton and\navalanche ionization, recombination, and thermal ionization from nanoeffects\nnear threshold to extreme energy densities. They include a previously unknown\nscenario that emerges with single-longitudinal-mode UV ns pulses from compact\nlasers. It enables cost-effective creation of nanoeffects, as demonstrated on\ncorneal tissue and glass. Plasma photography reveals new insights in the\nspatiotemporal dynamics of plasma formation, with an interplay of breakdown\nwaves, string formation by local instabilities of avalanche ionization, and\nradiative energy transport. Plasma volume data from photographs together with\nabsorption measurements show that the average energy density of luminescent fs\nand ns plasmas is similar, ranging between 10 and 40 kJ/cm^3. However, small\nhot regions with up to 400 kJ/cm^3 are formed in ns breakdown. From the hot\nregions, energy is spread out via X-ray bremsstrahlung, forming a luminescent\nhalo. Well above threshold, Rmax scales with EL^1/3 across all scenarios, with\n15% - 20% conversion of laser energy into bubble energy. With increasing plasma\nenergy density, an ever-larger energy fraction is converted into shock wave\nenergy (75% at 40 kJ/cm^3).

    "abstract": "In this work, we report the study of electronic structure, magnetism, and the\nexistence of Weyl nodes in a pristine bulk FeNi$_{3}$, a member of Fe-Ni inver\nalloy compounds, known as good metal catalysts with high activity and stability\nfor water splitting for a very long time. Our observation of Weyl points in the\nbulk FeNi$_{3}$ may lead to a new technology to design highly efficient\ntopological catalysts. While the previous literature \\cite{PhysRev.97.304}\nmainly focused on the thermal and catalytic properties of FeNi$_{3}$ we report\nthe interplay of Fe $d$-Ni $d$ hybridization and spin-orbit coupling give rise\nto the ferromagnetic Weyl nodes in the bulk FeNi$_{3}$. Our study shows that\nthe ground state of the bulk FeNi$_{3}$ is a Weyl metal with a large number of\nWeyl nodes at the Fermi energy away from high-symmetry $k$-points. Furthermore,\nwe predict a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of about $10000~S/m$\nat the ground state. In addition, we show the existence of Weyl nodes along the\nhigh symmetry $k$-points $~0.2eV$ above and $~0.05eV$ below self-consistent\nFermi level that may be achieved either by the electron or hole doping, or by\nexternal perturbation. In this article, FeNi$_{3}$ has been studied to explore\nthis scenario using first-principles density functional theory and subsequent\nWannier90-based tight-binding method. Furthermore, we report the existence of\ntwo types of Weyl cones, type-I and type-II, $~0.2eV$ above the Fermi level.\nOur report provides a realistic material to further explore the intrinsic\nproperties related to Weyl cones, and the spintronic applications.",

This paper introduces Laplacian Eigenvector\nCentrality (LEC), a novel framework for network analysis based on spectral\ngraph theory and the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix. A distinctive\nfeature of LEC is its adjustable parameter, the LEC order, which enables\nresearchers to control and assess the scope of centrality measurement using the\nLaplacian spectrum. Using random graph models, LEC demonstrates robustness and\nscalability across diverse network structures. We connect LEC to equilibrium\nresponses to external shocks in an economic model, showing how LEC quantifies\nagents' roles in attenuating shocks and facilitating coordinated responses\nthrough quadratic optimization.

This study investigates the effectiveness of\nLanguage-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (LAFT) to improve SA performance in Hausa. We\nfirst curate a diverse, unlabeled corpus to expand the model's linguistic\ncapabilities, followed by applying LAFT to adapt AfriBERTa specifically to the\nnuances of the Hausa language. The adapted model is then fine-tuned on the\nlabeled NaijaSenti sentiment dataset to evaluate its performance.

To overcome this, we assign a learnable geometry-specific opacity to\neach 2D Gaussian primitive, dedicated solely to rendering depth and normals.\nThird, we observe that reconstruction errors are most prominent when the camera\nview is nearly orthogonal to glass surfaces. To address this issue, we develop\na quality-aware supervision module that adaptively leverages normal priors from\na pre-trained large-scale normal model.Experimental results demonstrate that\nCar-GS achieves precise reconstruction of car surfaces and significantly\noutperforms prior methods.

However, one\nmajor limitation has been the need for tethering bioelectronics circuits to\nexternal power, or the use of rigid bulky batteries. This has motivated a\ngrowing interest in wireless energy transfer, which demands circuit\nminiaturization. However, miniaturization of LM circuits is challenging due to\nlow LM-substrate adhesion, LM smearing, and challenges on\nmicrochip-interfacing. In this article, we address these challenges by\nhigh-resolution laser-assisted micropatterning of biphasic LM composites and\nvapor-assisted LM microchip soldering. Through development of a search\nalgorithm for optimization of the biphasic ink coil performance, we designed\nand implemented micro coils with trace spacing of 50 {\\mu}m that can harvest a\nsignificant amount of energy (178 mW/cm2) through near field inductive\ncoupling.

We consider the\ntime-division-multiple-access (TDMA) service protocol among different BSs to\nfacilitate the cascaded communication and computation process, in which\ndifferent BSs implement the uplink data collection and downlink command\nbroadcasting over orthogonal time slots. We also employ the massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) at BSs, based on which each BS serves its\nassociated sensors or actuators over the same time-frequency resources via\nspatial multiplexing. Under this setup, we jointly design the association\nbetween BSs and sensors/actuators as well as the joint communication and\ncomputation resource allocation, with the objective of minimizing the\nclosed-loop control latency of the multiple subsystems while ensuring their\ncontrol stability. The optimization takes into account the transmission\nuncertainty caused by both the hyper reliable and low-latency communications\n(HRLLC) and the inter-user interference , as well as the communication and\ncomputation resource constraints at distributed nodes. To solve the challenging\nnon-convex joint optimization problem, we develop an efficient algorithm by\nemploying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex\napproximation (SCA).

Moreover, we investigate\nthe spectrum of a general Carrollian superstring in the flipped vacuum. As the\nstring can still have nonvanishing winding along the spatial direction in the\ninfinite radius limit, the spectrum of the Carrollian strings in the flat\nbackground is no longer truncated. We furthermore construct the vertex\noperators of gravitons and discuss their scattering amplitudes.

    "abstract": "Continuous variable quantum key distribution bears the promise of simple\nquantum key distribution directly compatible with commercial off the shelf\nequipment. However, for a long time its performance was hindered by the absence\nof good classical postprocessing capable of distilling secret-keys in the noisy\nregime. Advanced coding solutions in the past years have partially addressed\nthis problem enabling record transmission distances of up to 165 km, and 206 km\nover ultra-low loss fiber. In this paper, we show that a very simple coding\nsolution with a single code is sufficient to extract keys at all noise levels.\nThis solution has performance competitive with prior results for all levels of\nnoise, and we show that non-zero keys can be distilled up to a record distance\nof 192 km assuming the standard loss of a single-mode optical fiber, and 240 km\nover ultra-low loss fibers. Low-rate codes are constructed using\nmultiplicatively repeated non-binary low-density parity-check codes over a\nfinite field of characteristic two. This construction only makes use of a\n(2,k)-regular non-binary low-density parity-check code as mother code, such\nthat code design is in fact not required, thus trivializing the code\nconstruction procedure. The construction is also inherently rate-adaptive\nthereby allowing to easily create codes of any rate. Rate-adaptive codes are of\nspecial interest for the efficient reconciliation of errors over time or\narbitrary varying channels, as is the case with quantum key distribution. In\nshort, these codes are highly efficient when reconciling errors over a very\nnoisy communication channel, and perform well even for short block-length\ncodes. Finally, the proposed solution is known to be easily amenable to\nhardware implementations, thus addressing also the requirements for practical\nreconciliation in continuous variable quantum key distribution.",

Most of the\nresearches on action recognition methods focused on improving the performance\nvia various deep learning methods rather than the classification of skeleton\npoints. The topological modeling between skeleton points and body parts was\nseldom considered. Although some studies have used a data-driven approach to\nclassify the topology of the skeleton point, the nature of the skeleton point\nin terms of kinematics has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, in\nthis paper, we draw on the theory of kinematics to adapt the topological\nrelations of the skeleton point and propose a topological relation\nclassification based on body parts and distance from core of body. To\nsynthesize these topological relations for action recognition, we propose a\nnovel Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (HFGCN). In particular, the\nproposed model is able to focus on the human skeleton points and the different\nbody parts simultaneously, and thus construct the topology, which improves the\nrecognition accuracy obviously. We use a hypergraph to represent the\ncategorical relationships of these skeleton points and incorporate the\nhypergraph into a graph convolution network to model the higher-order\nrelationships among the skeleton points and enhance the feature representation\nof the network. In addition, our proposed hypergraph attention module and\nhypergraph graph convolution module optimize topology modeling in temporal and\nchannel dimensions, respectively, to further enhance the feature representation\nof the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely used\ndatasets.The results validate that our proposed method can achieve the best\nperformance when compared with the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.",

Our project, which lasted one year,\nemployed a selective crowd-sourcing methodology to collect text and speech data\nfrom native speakers of these languages.

Recently, hysteresis and reentrant superconductivity\nwere observed experimentally through magnetoresistance measurements in\nRbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, providing strong evidence of a spontaneous time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking superconducting state. The unconventional magnetic responses,\ncombined with crystalline symmetry, impose strong constraints on the possible\npairing symmetries of the superconducting state. In this work, we propose that\nRbV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an odd-parity superconductor characterized by spin-polarized\nCooper pairs. The hysteresis in magnetoresistance and the reentrant\nsuperconductivity can both be explained by the formation and evolution of\nsuperconducting domains composed of non-unitary pairing. Considering the nodal\nproperties of the kagome superconductor RbV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$, it is topological\nand characterized by Majorana zero modes at its boundary, which can be detected\nthrough tunneling experiments.",

With\nsuch a circuit version of the Rabi model, we reveal previously undefined\nquantum phase transitions in electrically driven lasing regimes, which do not\nrequire deep strong light-matter couplings. For one-photon interaction, the\nscaling analysis indicates that the system undergoes a continuous phase\ntransition from thermal to coherent photon emissions. Going beyond this, a\ndiscontinuous quantum phase transition from superbunched to coherent states in\ntwo-photon processes, accompanied by the bistability within a mean-field\ntheory, is predicted. Both the order of phase transitions and the critical\nelectron-photon coupling can be easily controlled by an electric field, while\nthe tunneling current can be used as a fingerprint of such transitions.

Citation bias, irresponsible citation, and citation\nmanipulation are widespread and have become a serious and growing problem.\nHowever, it has been difficult to assess the consequences of mixing societal\nfactors into the literature system because there was no observable literature\nsystem unmixed with societal factors for comparison. In this paper, we\nconstruct a mathematical theorem network, representing a logic-based and\nobjective knowledge system, to address this problem. By comparing the\nmathematical theorem network and the scientific citation networks, we find that\nthese two types of networks are significantly different in their structure and\nfunction. In particular, the reward function in citation networks is impaired:\nThe scientific citation network fails to provide more recognition for more\ndisruptive results, while the mathematical theorem network can achieve.

Such attacks pose\nsevere security and privacy threats to the training graph used in GNN models.\nIn this work, we propose a novel solution, called Graph Link Disguise (GRID),\nto defend against link stealing attacks with the formal guarantee of GNN model\nutility for retaining prediction accuracy. The key idea of GRID is to add\ncarefully crafted noises to the nodes' prediction vectors for disguising\nadjacent nodes as n-hop indirect neighboring nodes. We take into account the\ngraph topology and select only a subset of nodes (called core nodes) covering\nall links for adding noises, which can avert the noises offset and have the\nfurther advantages of reducing both the distortion loss and the computation\ncost. Our crafted noises can ensure 1) the noisy prediction vectors of any two\nadjacent nodes have their similarity level like that of two non-adjacent nodes\nand 2) the model prediction is unchanged to ensure zero utility loss. Extensive\nexperiments on five datasets are conducted to show the effectiveness of our\nproposed GRID solution against different representative link-stealing attacks\nunder transductive settings and inductive settings respectively, as well as two\ninfluence-based attacks.

    "abstract": "Previous schemes for designing secure branch prediction unit (SBPU) based on\nphysical isolation can only offer limited security and significantly affect\nBPU's prediction capability, leading to prominent performance degradation.\nMoreover, encryption-based SBPU schemes based on periodic key re-randomization\nhave the risk of being compromised by advanced attack algorithms, and the\nperformance overhead is also considerable. To this end, this paper proposes a\nconflict-invisible SBPU (CIBPU). CIBPU employs redundant storage design,\nload-aware indexing, and replacement design, as well as an encryption mechanism\nwithout requiring periodic key updates, to prevent attackers' perception of\nbranch conflicts. We provide a thorough security analysis, which shows that\nCIBPU achieves strong security throughout the BPU's lifecycle. We implement\nCIBPU in a RISC-V core model in gem5. The experimental results show that CIBPU\ncauses an average performance overhead of only 1.12%-2.20% with acceptable\nhardware storage overhead, which is the lowest among the state-of-the-art SBPU\nschemes. CIBPU has also been implemented in the open-source RISC-V core,\nSonicBOOM, which is then burned onto an FPGA board. The evaluation based on the\nboard shows an average performance degradation of 2.01%, which is approximately\nconsistent with the result obtained in gem5.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric propagation errors are a main constraint on the accuracy of Very\nLong Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry. For relative astrometry,\ndifferential techniques can mitigate these errors, but their effectiveness\ndiminishes with decreasing elevation and increasing angular separations between\ntarget and calibrator, among others. The MultiView technique addresses\natmospheric spatial-structure errors by observing multiple calibrators around\nthe target and interpolating at the target position, thereby reducing\natmospheric errors more effectively than phase-referencing with only one\ncalibrator. The first MultiView realisation at 1.6GHz involved cyclically\nobserving all calibrators and the target, fitting a phase plane from calibrator\nsolutions in each cycle, and is a well-established technique. This\nimplementation reduces on-target time and is constricted by the short\natmospheric coherence time at high frequencies. We propose a new realisation,\nserial MultiView, which rotates the phase plane iteratively based on the time\nseries of calibrator residual phases. This new strategy obviates the necessity\nof observing all calibrators within each cycle, thereby shortening the\nobserving cycle and offering considerable potential at higher frequencies where\nthe temporal structure is the dominant source of errors. Additionally, by\nincorporating time-domain information in the iterations, phase ambiguities can\nbe accurately and automatically identified. We verify the astrometric accuracy\nof serial MultiView at 5GHz by comparing it to conventional MultiView,\nachieving <10uas error in RA direction, and show the calibration overhead can\nbe reduced in both approaches. This approach enables efficient, high-accuracy\ndifferential astrometry and artifact-reduced imaging for astrophysical studies,\nand we provide a user-friendly tool for it.",

In this paper, we fill\nin some technical details in Hitchin's original proof by the following three\nsteps. First, we reduce the existence of a solution of class $L_1^2$ to\nminimizing the energy functional within a Higgs stable orbit of the $L_2^2$\ncomplex gauge group action. Second, using this transformation, we obtain a\nsolution of class $L_1^2$ in this orbit. These two steps primarily follow\nHitchin's original approach.

    "abstract": "Vision-language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in advancing\ngeneral artificial intelligence, yet the irrational encoding of visual\npositions persists in inhibiting the models' comprehensive perception\nperformance across different levels of granularity. In this work, we propose\nPyramid-descent Visual Position Encoding (PyPE), a novel approach designed to\nenhance the perception of visual tokens within VLMs. By assigning visual\nposition indexes from the periphery to the center and expanding the central\nreceptive field incrementally, PyPE addresses the limitations of traditional\nraster-scan methods and mitigates the long-term decay effects induced by Rotary\nPosition Embedding (RoPE). Our method reduces the relative distance between\ninterrelated visual elements and instruction tokens, promoting a more rational\nallocation of attention weights and allowing for a multi-granularity perception\nof visual elements and countering the over-reliance on anchor tokens. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations demonstrate that PyPE consistently improves the\ngeneral capabilities of VLMs across various sizes. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/SakuraTroyChen/PyPE.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete 3D shapes from partial 3D\npoint clouds. With advancements in deep learning techniques, various methods\nfor point cloud completion have been developed. Despite achieving encouraging\nresults, a significant issue remains: these methods often overlook the\nvariability in point clouds sampled from a single 3D object surface. This\nvariability can lead to ambiguity and hinder the achievement of more precise\ncompletion results. Therefore, in this study, we introduce a novel point cloud\ncompletion network, namely Dual-Codebook Point Completion Network (DC-PCN),\nfollowing an encder-decoder pipeline. The primary objective of DC-PCN is to\nformulate a singular representation of sampled point clouds originating from\nthe same 3D surface. DC-PCN introduces a dual-codebook design to quantize\npoint-cloud representations from a multilevel perspective. It consists of an\nencoder-codebook and a decoder-codebook, designed to capture distinct point\ncloud patterns at shallow and deep levels. Additionally, to enhance the\ninformation flow between these two codebooks, we devise an information exchange\nmechanism. This approach ensures that crucial features and patterns from both\nshallow and deep levels are effectively utilized for completion. Extensive\nexperiments on the PCN, ShapeNet\\_Part, and ShapeNet34 datasets demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of our method.",

This approach applies the general synthetic iterative scheme to\nstochastic simulations, removing the inherent restrictions on spatial grid size\nin DSMC and boosting the evolution of the particle distribution towards a\nsteady state. Firstly, the proposed method intermittently couples the standard\nDSMC solver with the solution of steady-state macroscopic synthetic equations\nderived from the kinetic equation for polyatomic gases. These synthetic\nequations, encompassing accurate constitutive relations and relaxation rates,\nensure applicability across the entire flow regime. Secondly, the particle\ndistribution within the DSMC framework is adjusted to align with the solution\nof the macroscopic equations, significantly accelerating convergence to the\nsteady-state solution. Finally, an adaptive treatment is implemented for the\nconstitutive relations. Higher-order terms extracted from DSMC are applied only\nin rarefied regions where the local Knudsen number exceeds a predefined\nthreshold.

We determined from the experimental results a cluster size\ncomprised between 30 and 80 pixels. To understand the physical process that\nproduces large cluster images and its energy dependence, we simulated the\ncharge carrier drifts in the sensor, assuming the incidence of a proton in the\ndetector. The cluster sizes estimated in the simulation were smaller than those\nobserved in the experiment, and remained constant across the entire energy\nrange, when thermal diffusion and charge carriers self-repulsion were\nconsidered as the factors of the cluster image formation. In addition, we\ndiscovered that the size of the cluster image and its energy dependence\nobserved in the experiment could be well explained when considering that the\nTimePix3 detector is sensitive to the transient induced charges, allowing even\npixels that do not collect the charge carriers to trigger.

We present\na multiscale modeling framework integrating Density Functional Theory (DFT),\nAb-Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD), classical Molecular Dynamics (MD), and\nFinite Element Analysis (FEA) to investigate atomic and cell-level properties.\nThe considered Li-CO$_2$ battery consists of a lithium metal anode, an ionic\nliquid electrolyte, and a carbon cloth cathode with\nSb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ catalyst. DFT and AIMD determined the electrical\nconductivities of Sb$_{0.67}$Bi$_{1.33}$Te$_3$ and Li$_2$CO$_3$ using the\nKubo-Greenwood formalism and studied the CO$_2$ reduction mechanism on the\ncathode catalyst. MD simulations calculated the CO$_2$ diffusion coefficient,\nLi$^+$ transference number, ionic conductivity, and Li$^+$ solvation structure.\nThe FEA model, parameterized with atomistic simulations data, reproduced the\navailable experimental voltage-capacity profile at 1 mA/cm$^2$ and revealed\nspatio-temporal variations in Li$_2$CO$_3$/C deposition, porosity, and CO$_2$\nconcentration dependence on discharge rates in the cathode. Accordingly,\nLi$_2$CO$_3$ can form large and thin film deposits, leading to dispersed and\nlocal porosity changes at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ and 1 mA/cm$^2$, respectively. The\ncapacity decreases exponentially from 81,570 mAh/g at 0.1 mA/cm$^2$ to 6,200\nmAh/g at 1 mA/cm$^2$, due to pore clogging from excessive discharge product\ndeposition that limits CO$_2$ transport to the cathode interior. Therefore, the\nperformance of Li-CO$_2$ batteries can be improved by enhancing CO$_2$\ntransport, regulating Li$_2$CO$_3$ deposition, and optimizing cathode\narchitecture.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG)\nalgorithm for molecular dynamics simulations of 3D Yukawa systems with periodic\nboundary conditions. We develop a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition of the\nYukawa kernel, dividing the interactions into near-field and far-field\ncomponents. The near-field component, singular but compactly supported in a\nlocal domain, is calculated directly. The far-field component, represented as a\nsum of smooth Gaussians, is treated using the random batch approximation in\nFourier space with an adaptive importance sampling strategy to reduce the\nvariance of force calculations. Unlike the traditional Ewald decomposition,\nwhich introduces discontinuities and significant truncation error at the\ncutoff, the SOG decomposition achieves high-order smoothness and accuracy near\nthe cutoff, allowing for efficient and energy-stable simulations. Additionally,\nby avoiding the use of the fast Fourier transform, our method achieves optimal\nO(N) complexity while maintaining high parallel scalability. Finally, unlike\nprevious random batch approaches, the proposed adaptive importance sampling\nstrategy achieves nearly optimal variance reduction across the regime of the\ncoupling parameters. Rigorous theoretical analyses are presented. We validate\nthe performance of RBSOG method through simulations of one-component plasma\nunder weak and strong coupling conditions, using up to 10^6 particles and 1024\nCPU cores.

Empirical studies are performed using real-life datasets, while\ncomparing IIWRS with existing benchmarks.",

The emergence of\nlarge language models (LLMs) has revolutionized dialogue generation by\nharnessing their powerful capabilities and shown its potential in multimodal\ndomains. Many studies have integrated speech with text-based LLMs to take\nspeech question as input and output text response.

Existing approaches implicitly assume that data pairs are\nwell-aligned and ignore the widely existing annotation noise, i.e., noisy\ncorrespondence (NC). Consequently, it inevitably causes performance\ndegradation. Despite attempts that employ the co-teaching paradigm with\nidentical architectures to provide distinct data perspectives, the differences\nbetween these architectures are primarily stemmed from random initialization.\nThus, the model becomes increasingly homogeneous along with the training\nprocess. Consequently, the additional information brought by this paradigm is\nseverely limited. In order to resolve this problem, we introduce a Tripartite\nlearning with Semantic Variation Consistency (TSVC) for robust image-text\nretrieval. We design a tripartite cooperative learning mechanism comprising a\nCoordinator, a Master, and an Assistant model. The Coordinator distributes\ndata, and the Assistant model supports the Master model's noisy label\nprediction with diverse data. Moreover, we introduce a soft label estimation\nmethod based on mutual information variation, which quantifies the noise in new\nsamples and assigns corresponding soft labels. We also present a new loss\nfunction to enhance robustness and optimize training effectiveness.

In this paper, we undertake this goal by developing a novel\ntask-similarity metric (BeST) and an associated method that consistently\nperforms well in identifying the most transferrable source(s) for a given task.\nIn particular, our design employs an innovative quantization-level optimization\nprocedure in the context of classification tasks that yields a measure of\nsimilarity between a source model and the given target data. The procedure uses\na concept similar to early stopping (usually implemented to train deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) to ensure generalization) to derive a function that\napproximates the transfer learning mapping without training. The advantage of\nour metric is that it can be quickly computed to identify the top candidate(s)\nfor a given target task before a computationally intensive transfer operation\n(typically using DNNs) can be implemented between the selected source and the\ntarget task. As such, our metric can provide significant computational savings\nfor transfer learning from a selection of a large number of possible source\nmodels.

To date, the IPHE has been\ndiscussed mainly for materials with low-symmetry crystal/magnetic point groups.\nHere, we show that even if symmetry forbids an inherent IPHE that arises from\nany mechanism, an apparent IPHE can be generated by selecting a low-symmetry\ncrystalline plane for measurement. For rutile RuO$_2$, although its high\nsymmetry forbids an inherent IPHE, films grown along the low-symmetry (1 1 1)\nand (1 0 1) orientations are found to exhibit a distinct IPHE. The in-plane\nHall coefficients are quantitatively reproduced by referring to the\nout-of-plane Hall coefficients measured for the high-symmetry (1 0 0) and (0 0\n1) planes, indicating that the observed IPHE is caused by a superposition of\ninequivalent out-of-plane Hall effects.

We assume data are collected and\nanalyzed sequentially, in batches. Since traditional or offline methods can be\nextremely slow, Ghosh et al.

Inspired by the literature on renewable estimation, they\ndeveloped an online Bayesian method for generalized linear models (GLMs) that\nreduces storage and computational demands dramatically compared to traditional\nmethods for BMA. The method of Ghosh et al. (2025) works very well when the\nnumber of models is small. It can also work reasonably well in moderately large\nmodel spaces. For the latter case, the method relies on a screening stage to\nidentify important models in the first several batches via offline methods.\nThereafter, the model space remains fixed in all subsequent batches. In the\npost-screening stage, online updates are made to the model specific parameters,\nfor models selected in the screening stage. For high-dimensional model spaces,\nthe chance of missing important models in the screening stage is more likely.\nThis necessitates the development of a method, which permits the model space to\nbe updated as new batches of data arrive. In this article, we develop an online\nBayesian model selection method for logistic regression, where the selected\nmodel can potentially change throughout the data collection process.

As a pioneering work in this\narea, the deep learning-enabled semantic communication (DeepSC) constitutes a\nnovel algorithmic framework based on the transformer--which is a deep learning\ntool widely used to process text numerically. The main goal of this work is to\nextend the DeepSC approach from the point-to-point link to the multi-user\nmultiple access channel (MAC).

In the classic information theory, the\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme is a common way to mitigate\ninterference and achieve the channel capacity. Our main contribution is to\nincorporate the SIC scheme into the DeepSC. As opposed to the traditional SIC\nthat removes interference in the digital symbol domain, the proposed semantic\nSIC works in the domain of the semantic word embedding vectors. Furthermore, to\nenhance the training efficiency, we propose a pretraining scheme and a partial\nretraining scheme that quickly adjust the neural network parameters when new\nusers are added to the MAC.

Existing approaches investigated the use of\nMulti-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to tackle target localization.\nNevertheless, these methods do not consider practical uncertainties, like false\nalarms when the target does not exist or when it is unreachable due to\nenvironmental complexities. To address these drawbacks, this work proposes a\nnovel MADRL-based method for target localization in uncertain environments. The\nproposed MADRL method employs Proximal Policy Optimization to optimize the\ndecision-making of sensing agents, which is represented in the form of an\nactor-critic structure using Convolutional Neural Networks. The observations of\nthe agents are designed in an optimized manner to capture essential information\nin the environment, and a team-based reward functions is proposed to produce\ncooperative agents. The MADRL method covers three action dimensionalities that\ncontrol the agents' mobility to search the area for the target, detect its\nexistence, and determine its reachability. Using the concept of Transfer\nLearning, a Deep Learning model builds on the knowledge from the MADRL model to\naccurately estimating the target location if it is unreachable, resulting in\nshared representations between the models for faster learning and lower\ncomputational complexity. Collectively, the final combined model is capable of\nsearching for the target, determining its existence and reachability, and\nestimating its location accurately. The proposed method is tested using a\nradioactive target localization environment and benchmarked against existing\nmethods, showing its efficacy.",

The fusion\nphase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and\nfusing their features at both the channel and variable levels.

In this Letter, we employ density\nfunctional theory calculations to unveil the intrinsic insulating\ncharacteristics of SeO2, highlighting substantial challenges in carrier doping.\nOur electronic structure analyses indicate that the Se 5s2 states are\nenergetically positioned too low to effectively interact with the O 2p\norbitals, resulting in a valence band maximum (VBM) primarily dominated by the\nO 2p orbitals. The deep and localized nature of the VBM in SeO2 limits its\npotential as a high-mobility p-type TOS. Defect calculations demonstrate that\nall intrinsic defects in SeO2 exhibit deep transition levels within the\nbandgap. The Fermi level consistently resides in the mid-gap region, regardless\nof synthesis conditions. Furthermore, deep intrinsic acceptors and donors\nexhibit negative formation energies in the n-type and p-type regions,\nrespectively, facilitating their spontaneous formation and impeding external\ndoping efforts.

The most\ncommonly used statistical and machine learning methods for missing value\nimputation may be ineffective when the missing rate is high and not random.\nThis paper explores row and column attention in tabular data as between-feature\nand between-sample attention in a novel framework to reconstruct missing\nvalues. The proposed method uses CutMix data augmentation within a contrastive\nlearning framework to improve the uncertainty of missing value estimation. The\nperformance and generalizability of trained imputation models are evaluated in\nset-aside test data folds with missing values. The proposed framework is\ncompared with 11 state-of-the-art statistical, machine learning, and deep\nimputation methods using 12 diverse tabular data sets. The average performance\nrank of our proposed method demonstrates its superiority over the\nstate-of-the-art methods for missing rates between 10% and 90% and three\nmissing value types, especially when the missing values are not random. The\nquality of the imputed data using our proposed method is compared in a\ndownstream patient classification task using real-world electronic health\nrecords. This paper highlights the heterogeneity of tabular data sets to\nrecommend imputation methods based on missing value types and data\ncharacteristics.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the rapid development of AI systems has brought about the\nbenefits of intelligent services but also concerns about security and\nreliability. By fostering appropriate user reliance on an AI system, both\ncomplementary team performance and reduced human workload can be achieved.\nPrevious empirical studies have extensively analyzed the impact of factors\nranging from task, system, and human behavior on user trust and appropriate\nreliance in the context of one-step decision making. However, user reliance on\nAI systems in tasks with complex semantics that require multi-step workflows\nremains under-explored. Inspired by recent work on task decomposition with\nlarge language models, we propose to investigate the impact of a novel\nMulti-Step Transparent (MST) decision workflow on user reliance behaviors. We\nconducted an empirical study (N = 233) of AI-assisted decision making in\ncomposite fact-checking tasks (i.e., fact-checking tasks that entail multiple\nsub-fact verification steps). Our findings demonstrate that human-AI\ncollaboration with an MST decision workflow can outperform one-step\ncollaboration in specific contexts (e.g., when advice from an AI system is\nmisleading). Further analysis of the appropriate reliance at fine-grained\nlevels indicates that an MST decision workflow can be effective when users\ndemonstrate a relatively high consideration of the intermediate steps. Our work\nhighlights that there is no one-size-fits-all decision workflow that can help\nobtain optimal human-AI collaboration. Our insights help deepen the\nunderstanding of the role of decision workflows in facilitating appropriate\nreliance. We synthesize important implications for designing effective means to\nfacilitate appropriate reliance on AI systems in composite tasks, positioning\nopportunities for the human-centered AI and broader HCI communities.",

Here, a simple\nmethod is developed to solve the main problem of the excited-state optimization\n-- the variational collapse of the excited states onto the ground state. In\nthis method, called variable-metric time-independent DFT (VM TIDFT), the\nelectronic states are allowed to be nonorthogonal during the optimization but\ntheir orthogonality is gradually enforced with a continuous penalty function.\nWith nonorthogonal electronic states, VM TIDFT can use molecular orbital\ncoefficients as independent variables, which results in a closed-form\nanalytical expression for the gradient and allows to employ any of the multiple\nunconstrained optimization algorithms that guarantees convergence of the\nexcited-state optimization. Numerical tests on multiple molecular systems show\nthat the variable-metric optimization of excited states performed with a\npreconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is robust and produces accurate\nenergies for well-behaved excitations and, unlike TDDFT, for more challenging\ncharge-transfer and double-electron excitations.",

In this paper, we introduce\ninstance-based adversarial attacks for multi-stage classifiers, leveraging\nLayer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which assigns relevance scores to\npixels based on their influence on classification outcomes. Our approach\ngenerates explainable adversarial perturbations by utilizing LRP to identify\nand target key features critical for both coarse and fine-grained\nclassifications.

    "abstract": "Change detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical technique for Earth\nobservation, primarily focusing on pixel-level segmentation of change regions\nbetween bi-temporal images. The essence of pixel-level change detection lies in\ndetermining whether corresponding pixels in bi-temporal images have changed. In\ndeep learning, the spatial and channel dimensions of feature maps represent\ndifferent information from the original images. In this study, we found that in\nchange detection tasks, difference information can be computed not only from\nthe spatial dimension of bi-temporal features but also from the channel\ndimension. Therefore, we designed the Channel-Spatial Difference Weighting\n(CSDW) module as an aggregation-distribution mechanism for bi-temporal features\nin change detection. This module enhances the sensitivity of the change\ndetection model to difference features. Additionally, bi-temporal images share\nthe same geographic location and exhibit strong inter-image correlations. To\nconstruct the correlation between bi-temporal images, we designed a decoding\nstructure based on the Layer-Exchange (LE) method to enhance the interaction of\nbi-temporal features. Comprehensive experiments on the CLCD, PX-CLCD, LEVIR-CD,\nand S2Looking datasets demonstrate that the proposed LENet model significantly\nimproves change detection performance.

    "abstract": "Christoph Scheiner was one of the most outstanding astronomers in the history\nof the sunspot observations. His book, Rosa Ursina, is the reference work\nregarding the study of the earliest sunspot records. The sunspot observations\ncompiled by Scheiner in Rosa Ursina and Prodomus, including records made by\nother observers, forms one of the main references of the observations known for\nthat period; particularly around the 1620s. Thus, his work is crucial to\ndetermine the solar activity level of the first solar cycles of the telescopic\nera. The number of sunspot groups recorded in Scheiner's documentary sources\nhas been included in the existing sunspot group number databases. However, we\nhave detected significant errors in the number of groups currently assigned to\nScheiner's records. In this work, we reanalyze the information in Scheiner's\nsource documents. Consequently, the standard 11-yr solar cycle shape for the\nsecond solar cycle of the telescopic era, which is not clear in previous\nstudies, now becomes evident. In addition, the highest daily number of groups\nrecorded during this cycle (8 groups) is 20% less than the one included in the\nexisting sunspot group number databases. Using the hypergeometrical probability\ndistribution, we find that solar minima in 2008-2009 and 2018-2019 are\ncomparable to the most probable solar activity level of the minimum around\n1632. In particular, the estimated lower limit for the solar activity in 1632\nis even comparable with the solar activity level in 2008 and 2018.",

    "abstract": "Cities are some of the most intricate and advanced creations of humanity.\nMost objects in cities are perfectly synchronised to coordinate activities like\njobs, education, transportation, entertainment or waste management. Although\neach city has its characteristics, some commonalities can be observed across\nmost cities, like issues related to noise, pollution, segregation and others.\nFurther, some of these issues might be accentuated in larger or smaller cities.\nFor example, with more people, a city might experience more competition for\nspace so rents would be higher. The urban scaling theory gives a framework to\nanalyse cities in the context of their size. New data for analysing urban\nscaling theory allow an understanding of how urban metrics change with their\npopulation size, whether they apply across most regions or if patterns\ncorrespond only to some country or region. Yet, reducing a city and all its\ncomplexity into a single indicator might simplify urban areas to an extent\nwhere their disparities and variations are overlooked. Often, the differences\nbetween the living conditions in different parts of the same city are bigger\nthan the degree of variation observed between cities. For example, in terms of\nrent or crime, within-city variations might be more significant than between\ncities. Here, we review some urban scaling principles and explore ways to\nanalyse variations within the same city.",
