    "abstract": "Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual\ninformation into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it\nremains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration\nconsistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across\na diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including\nhealth, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal\nforecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text\nrepresentations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large\nlanguage models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from\nmultimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and\nmodels, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest\nunimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we\ndisentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data\ncharacteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,\nincorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text\nmodels, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate\naligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when\n(4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary\npredictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone.\nOur empirical findings offer practical guidelines for when multimodality can be\nexpected to aid forecasting tasks, and when it does not.",

Inspired by cognitive theories of\nevent perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised\nframework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied\ncontrol through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and\nentropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and\nactively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or\nexternal rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an\naction-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with\nobservations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target\ncontinuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in\nsimulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve\nprivacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation\nfor embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.",

    "abstract": "Silicon has long been the foundational semiconductor material for a broad\nrange of electronic devices, owing to its numerous advantages: wide natural\navailability, ease of synthesis in both crystalline and amorphous forms, and\nrelatively low production cost. However, despite these benefits, silicon is\ninherently limited in the field of optoelectronics due to its indirect bandgap,\nwhich results in low quantum efficiency for light emission, typically in the\ninfrared region. One promising strategy to address this limitation is the\ndevelopment of nanocrystalline silicon, which consists of low-dimensional\nnanostructures such as quantum wires (QWs) and quantum dots (QDs). These\nstructures exhibit enhanced photoluminescence and electroluminescence,\nprimarily due to quantum confinement of excitons within the conduction and\nvalence bands, leading to significantly improved quantum efficiency. Although\nresearch into these processes has spanned several decades, a definitive\nconsensus on the mechanisms underlying photoluminescent emission in\nnanocrystalline silicon remains elusive. This work reviews two leading\ntheoretical models proposed to explain this phenomenon and introduces a new,\nmore comprehensive model that may provide a deeper and more accurate\nunderstanding of photoluminescence in nanocrystalline silicon. The new theory\nis applied in a case study.",

This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such\nsystems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red\nteaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks\nin complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,\nthey fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities\ncan be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with\neach other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic\nteaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that\ncan happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also\npresent a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of\nscenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety\nof agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,\nan agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has\naccess to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or\ncooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture\nexisting safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context\noptimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework\nto generate better scenarios for safety analysis.

We\naddress these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf\nswing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of\nprofessional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D\nkinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate\nsynthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment\nswing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete\nvocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and\nvisualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player\nidentity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body\nkinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion\nanalysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement\npatterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement\nsignatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled\nperformance.

Metric-based models typically operate by computing\nsimilarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric\nspace, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled\nsupport samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity\ncomparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space\nitself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a\nseries of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning\nmethods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning\n(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and\nAugmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo\nsupport-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for\nnon-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in\neach task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such\nfine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the\nmetric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With\nthe combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based\nmeta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly\nadapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding\noverfitting.

As an extension of Maximum Entropy modeling,\nMaximum Caliber models the probability of possible trajectories of a stochastic\nsystem, rather than focusing on system states. We demonstrate the ability of\nthe Maximum Caliber framework to capture ecological processes ranging from\nnear- to far- from-equilibrium, using an array of species interaction motifs\nincluding random interactions, apparent competition, intraguild competition,\nand non-transitive competition, along with dispersal among multiple patches.\nFor spatio-temporal data of species occurrence in a metacommunity, the\nparameters of a Maximum Caliber model can be estimated through a simple\nlogistic regression to reveal migration rates between patches, magnitudes of\ninteractions between species, and effects of intrinsic local environmental\nsuitabilities. We test the accuracy of the method over a range of system sizes\nand time periods, and find that these parameters can be estimated without bias.\nWe introduce entropy production as a system-level measure of disequilibrium,\nand use ``pseudo-$R^2$'' to characterize the predictability of the system.

A key detail for understanding the\nphysics of mergers is predicting the precise time when the amplitude of the\ngravitational wave strain peaks, which can differ significantly among the\ndifferent harmonic modes. We propose two semi-analytical methods to predict\nthese differences using the same three inputs from Numerical Relativity (NR):\nthe remnant mass and spin and the instantaneous frequency of each mode at its\npeak amplitude. The first method uses the frequency evolution predicted by the\nBackwards-One-Body model, while the second models the motion of an equatorial\ntimelike geodesic in the remnant black hole spacetime. We compare our models to\nthe SXS waveform catalog for quasi-circular, non-precessing systems and find\nexcellent agreement for $l = |m|$ modes up to $l=8$, with mean and median\ndifferences from NR below 1$M$ in nearly all cases across the parameter space.\nWe compare our results to the differences predicted by leading\nEffective-One-Body and NR surrogate waveform models and find that in cases\ncorresponding to the largest timing differences, our models can provide\nsignificant increases in accuracy.",

This variability\nis especially critical in the treatment of brain cancer, where fractionated or\nstaged stereotactic radiosurgery improves safety compared to single fraction\napproaches, but complicates the ability to predict treatment response. To\naddress this challenge, we employ Personalized Ultra-fractionated Stereotactic\nAdaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR), a strategy that dynamically adjusts treatment\nbased on how each tumor evolves over time. However, the success of PULSAR and\nother adaptive approaches depends on predictive tools that can guide early\ntreatment decisions and avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment. However,\ncurrent radiomics and dosiomics models offer limited insight into the evolving\nspatial and temporal patterns of tumor response. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a novel framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM),\nwhich learns data-driven mappings from pre to post treatment imaging. In this\nstudy, we developed single step and iterative denoising strategies and compared\ntheir performance. The results show that diffusion models can effectively\nsimulate patient specific tumor evolution and localize regions associated with\ntreatment response. The proposed strategy provides a promising foundation for\nmodeling heterogeneous treatment response and enabling early, adaptive\ninterventions, paving the way toward more personalized and biologically\ninformed radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "A variational framework for structural topology optimization is developed,\nintegrating quantum and classical latent encoding strategies within a\ncoordinate-based neural decoding architecture. In this approach, a\nlow-dimensional latent vector, generated either by a variational quantum\ncircuit or sampled from a Gaussian distribution, is mapped to a\nhigher-dimensional latent space via a learnable projection layer. This enriched\nrepresentation is then decoded into a high-resolution material distribution\nusing a neural network that takes both the latent vector and Fourier-mapped\nspatial coordinates as input. The optimization is performed directly on the\nlatent parameters, guided solely by physics-based objectives such as compliance\nminimization and volume constraints evaluated through finite element analysis,\nwithout requiring any precomputed datasets or supervised training. Quantum\nlatent vectors are constructed from the expectation values of Pauli observables\nmeasured on parameterized quantum circuits, providing a structured and\nentangled encoding of information. The classical baseline uses Gaussian-sampled\nlatent vectors projected in the same manner. The proposed variational\nformulation enables the generation of diverse and physically valid topologies\nby exploring the latent space through sampling or perturbation, in contrast to\ntraditional optimization methods that yield a single deterministic solution.\nNumerical experiments show that both classical and quantum encodings produce\nhigh-quality structural designs. However, quantum encodings demonstrate\nadvantages in several benchmark cases in terms of compliance and design\ndiversity.

    "abstract": "The silicon vacancy ($V_{Si}$) in 4H-SiC at its cubic site (V2-center) has\nshown significant promise for quantum technologies, due to coherent spin\nstates, the mature material system, and stable optical emission. In these\nSiC-based applications, doping plays a crucial role. It can be used to control\nthe charge state of $V_{Si}$ and formation of different types of defects.\nDespite its importance, there has been little research on the effects of\ndoping. In this work, we perform a study of the effects of nitrogen doping and\nannealing on the photoluminescence (PL), optically-detected magnetic resonance\n(ODMR) contrast, and dephasing times of ensembles of V2 in epilayers of 4H-SiC.\nThe results show an enhancement of PL that depends on the electron irradiation\ndose for a given electron concentration, supported by theoretical modeling of\nthe charge state of $V_{Si}$ in the presence of nitrogen. Nitrogen substituted\nfor carbon is shown to very efficiently donate one electron to $V_{Si}$. We\nalso observe that the ODMR contrast can be increased from 0.5% in low doped SiC\nto 1.5% by nitrogen doping of $10^{17}$ to $10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ and annealing at\n500-600 $^{\\circ}$C for 1 hour, with only a 20% decrease in PL compared to\nunannealed. Some of the improvement in contrast is offset by a reduction in\n$T_2^*$ at these doping levels, but the estimated cw ODMR shot-noise limited\nsensitivity is still 1.6 times higher than that of undoped, unannealed SiC.",

Current measurements suggest that many of these BHs\nexhibit higher BH-to-stellar mass ratios than local populations, opening a new\nwindow into the earliest stages of BH-galaxy coevolution and offering the\npotential to place tight constraints on BH seeding and growth in the early\nuniverse. In this work, we use the BRAHMA simulations to investigate the impact\nof BH seeding on the $\\mathrm{M_{\\bullet}}-\\sigma$ relation. These simulations\nadopt heavy $\\sim10^5~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ seeds and systematically varied BH\nseeding models, resulting in distinct predictions for seed abundances.

This paper introduces DiLQR, a framework that\nfacilitates differentiation through iLQR, allowing it to serve as a trainable\nand differentiable module, either as or within a neural network. A novel aspect\nof this framework is the analytical solution that it provides for the gradient\nof an iLQR controller through implicit differentiation, which ensures a\nconstant backward cost regardless of iteration, while producing an accurate\ngradient. We evaluate our framework on imitation tasks on famous control\nbenchmarks.

Our method also demonstrates superior learning\nperformance ($10^6$x) compared to traditional neural network policies and\nbetter model loss with differentiable controllers that lack exact analytical\ngradients.

Yet, prior LVLM-robot\nintegrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations,\nand myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation\nArchitecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an\nLVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools\navailable within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously\ndefines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic\nmodules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation\nactions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously\nunmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design.\nEvaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation,\nand embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed\ninput representations, or pre-existing maps.",

However, the inference from such a model may be\nmisleading if the population covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ is actually\nnon-separable, motivating the use of statistical tests of separability.\nLikelihood ratio tests have tractable null distributions and good power when\nthe sample size $n$ is larger than the number of variables $p$, but are not\nwell-defined otherwise. Other existing separability tests for the $p>n$ case\nhave low power for small sample sizes, and have null distributions that depend\non unknown parameters, preventing exact error rate control. To address these\nissues, we propose novel invariant tests leveraging the core covariance matrix,\na complementary notion to a separable covariance matrix. We show that testing\nseparability of $\\Sigma$ is equivalent to testing sphericity of its core\ncomponent. With this insight, we construct test statistics that are\nwell-defined in high-dimensional settings and have distributions that are\ninvariant under the null hypothesis of separability, allowing for exact\nsimulation of null distributions. We study asymptotic null distributions and\nprove consistency of our tests in a $p/n\\rightarrow\\gamma\\in(0,\\infty)$\nasymptotic regime.

No closed-form formulas for\nthe moments of the projected normal distribution are known, which can limit its\nuse in some applications. In this work, we derive analytic approximations to\nthe first and second moments of the projected normal distribution using Taylor\nexpansions and using results from the theory of quadratic forms of Gaussian\nrandom variables. Then, motivated by applications in systems neuroscience, we\npresent generalizations of the projected normal distribution that divide the\nvariable $\\mathbf{x}$ by a denominator of the form $\\sqrt{\\mathbf{x}^T\n\\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{x} + c}$, where $\\mathbf{B}$ is a symmetric positive\ndefinite matrix and $c$ is a non-negative number. We derive moment\napproximations as well as the density function for these other projected\ndistributions.

Traditional calibration techniques rely on external sensors or\ndedicated calibration procedures, which can be infeasible or risky in dynamic,\nspace-based operational scenarios.\n  This paper proposes a novel method for kinematic parameter estimation that\nonly requires encoder measurements and binary contact detection.

To construct these constitutional\nprinciples, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering\na balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency.\nEmpirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task\nsuccess, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3%\non PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode.

To address\nthis gap we first establish a comprehensive likelihood theory for the\nmisspecified Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model under serial dependence. Our\nresults include uniform convergence of the empirical log-likelihood process,\ncontraction rates for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and a local\nasymptotically Gaussian expansion. Building on this foundation, we develop the\nasymptotic theory of Bayesian inference for the GEV parameters, the extremal\nindex, $T$-time-horizon return levels, and extreme quantiles (Value at Risk).\nUnder general conditions on the prior, we prove posterior consistency,\n$\\sqrt{k}$-contraction rates, Bernstein-von Mises theorems, and asymptotic\ncoverage properties for credible intervals.

The X-ray surface brightness (XSB)\nmorphology of the hot CGM varies significantly across simulations. XSB-enhanced\noutflows and bubble-like structures are predicted in many galaxies simulated\nwith AGN feedback and in some stellar-feedback-only galaxies, while other\ngalaxies exhibit more isotropic XSB distributions at varying brightnesses.\nGalaxies simulated without cosmic ray physics exhibit radial XSB profiles with\nsimilar shapes ($\\propto r^{-3}$ within $20-200$ kpc), with scatter about this\nslope likely due to underlying feedback physics. The hot CGM kinematics also\ndiffer substantially: velocity maps reveal signatures of bulk CGM rotation and\nhigh-velocity biconical outflows, particularly in simulations incorporating AGN\nfeedback. Some stellar-feedback-only models also generate similar AGN-like\noutflows, which we postulate is due to centrally-concentrated star formation.\nSimulations featuring AGN feedback frequently produce extended temperature\nenhancements in large-scale galactic outflows, while simulations incorporating\ncosmic ray physics predict the coolest CGM due to pressure support being\nprovided by cosmic rays rather than hot CGM. Individually-resolved X-ray\nemission lines further distinguish hot CGM phases, with lower-energy lines\n(e.g., O VII) largely tracing volume-filling gas, and higher-energy lines\n(e.g., Fe XVII) highlighting high-velocity feedback-driven outflows.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data\nanalysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the\nnetwork depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,\ncausing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes\nthe mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization\nand introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.\nSpecifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after\nmultiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,\nsimilar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this\ncontext, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of\nlow-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of\nhigh-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we\nsystematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson\nlocalization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in\nGraph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed\nthe potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in\ninformation propagation.",

We aim to\ndetect positron in-flight annihilation emission, as it provides information on\nthe kinetic energy of the positrons that is key in determining the origin of\nGalactic positrons. We analysed archival data obtained by the COMPTEL\ninstrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory satellite to search for\npositron in-flight annihilation emission in the MeV energy range. Our analysis\nrevealed extended emission in the MeV energy range towards the bulge of the\nGalaxy, which we attribute to in-flight annihilation of positrons produced with\nkinetic energies of $\\sim$2 MeV. The observed spectrum suggests that positrons\nare produced quasi-mono-energetically, which could occur by the annihilation of\ndark matter particles with masses of $\\sim$3 MeV, or through bulk motion in the\njet of the microquasar 1E1740.7-2942. We furthermore detected a point-like\nemission component in the MeV energy range towards the Galactic centre that is\nthe plausible low-energy counterpart of the Fermi-LAT source 4FGLJ1745.6-2859.\nThe broad band spectrum of the source may be explained by the injection of pair\nplasma from the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^\\ast$ into the interstellar\nmedium, which would also explain the point-like 511 keV line emission component\nthat was discovered by INTEGRAL/SPI at the Galactic centre.

In this paper, we introduce a\nprincipled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential\ndecision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the\ncurrent decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic\nuncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty\nshould be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an\nefficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the\ndirect estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)\nover multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is\nevaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,\nAgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and\nDeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly\noutperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful\naggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,\nincluding sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate\nuncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness.

In this paper, we investigate whether these\ninference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs),\nparticularly those trained with RL.

Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with\nRL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains.

Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve\nthis process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While\nmost models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing\ninterest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in\nbreast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied\non two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple\ntime steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully\nharnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data.

Here, in hexagonal-stacked twisted double bilayer (H-tDB)\nCrI_3, we demonstrate clear symmetry evolution as the twist angle increases\nfrom 180^{\\circ} to 190^{\\circ}. While the net magnetization remains zero\nacross this twist angle range, the magnetic phase breaks only the three-fold\nrotational symmetry at 180^{\\circ}, but it breaks all of the rotational,\nmirror, and time-reversal symmetries at intermediate twist angles between\n181^{\\circ} and 185^{\\circ}, and all broken symmetries are recovered at\n190^{\\circ}. These pronounced symmetry breakings at intermediate twist angles\nare accompanied by metamagnetic behaviors, evidenced by symmetric double\nhysteresis loops around zero magnetic field. Together, these results reveal\nthat H-tDB CrI_3 at intermediate twist angles host a distinct moir\\'e magnetic\nphase, featuring periodic in-plane spin textures with broken rotational,\nmirror, and time-reversal symmetries, which is markedly different from the\nout-of-plane layered antiferromagnetism in bilayer CrI_3 and the predominantly\nout-of-plane moir\\'e magnetism in R-tDB CrI_3.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a provably convergent multiblock ADMM for nonconvex\noptimization with nonlinear dynamics constraints, overcoming the divergence\nissue in classical extensions. We consider a class of optimization problems\nthat arise from discretization of dynamics-constrained variational problems\nthat are optimization problems for a functional constrained by time-dependent\nODEs or PDEs. This is a family of $n$-sum nonconvex optimization problems with\nnonlinear constraints. We study the convergence properties of the proximal\nalternating direction method of multipliers (proximal ADMM) applied to those\nproblems. Taking the advantage of the special problem structure, we show that\nunder local Lipschitz and local $L$-smooth conditions, the sequence generated\nby the proximal ADMM is bounded and all accumulation points are KKT points.\nBased on our analysis, we also design a procedure to determine the penalty\nparameters $\\rho_i$ and the proximal parameters $\\eta_i$. We further prove that\namong all the subsequences that converge, the fast one converges at the rate of\n$o(1/k)$. The numerical experiments are performed on 4D variational data\nassimilation problems and as the solver of implicit schemes for stiff problems.\nThe proposed proximal ADMM has more stable performance than gradient-based\nmethods. We discuss the implementation to solve the subproblems, a new way to\nsolve the implicit schemes, and the advantages of the proposed algorithm.",

With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a\nstarting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden\nquenches. Using finite time path field theory (FTPFT) perturbative methods, we\nshow that the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with\nnon-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time,\napart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for.\nAs the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing\nthe discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation\nexpansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements\non functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time\n$t=0$ are as follows: (1) their Fourier transform $f(p)$ is a function that is\nanalytic everywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole\nat $p=0$ and possibly others with $\\Im (p) < 0$; and (2) $f(p)/p$ converges to\nzero at infinity in the lower complex semiplane.

The current few\ncandidates have been identified through the combination of a prominent HeII\nemission and the absence of metal lines, a well-known but extremely brief\nsignature of metal-free systems. Here, we accurately model the evolution of the\nemission from PopIII galaxies to increase the number of candidates in JWST\nobservations. To achieve this, we employ a locally calibrated galaxy-formation\nmodel that self-consistently follows the star formation and chemical evolution\ninitiated by the first stars. We find that PopIII galaxies can emit metal lines\nin their ``self-polluted'' phase, while galaxies host only metal-free stars but\nthe gas has been chemically-enriched by the first supernovae. In this phase,\nPopIII galaxies have $\\rm [OIII]/H\\beta \\approx 1$, which opens the pool of\ncandidates to more easily detectable sources. We predict that the high HeII\nemission of PopIII galaxies can last up to $\\rm \\approx 20 \\, Myrs$ and that it\nis partly maintained in the ``hybrid'' phase, when PopIII and PopII stars\nco-exist in the host galaxy. We propose novel diagnostics involving UV metal\nlines to select PopIII candidates in high-z JWST surveys. In JADES, we identify\n9 candidate galaxies with $>25\\%$ of their stellar mass in metal-free stars,\nshowcasing the effectiveness of our method.

We explore scenarios of chemical inheritance and reset under varying\nionisation conditions and for various dust grain sizes in the sub-mm regime. We\nsimulate disc evolution using a semi-analytical 1D model that integrates\nchemical kinetics with gas and dust transport, accounting for viscous heating,\nturbulent mixing, and refractory organic carbon erosion. We find that mass\ntransport plays a role in the chemical evolution of even sub-micron grains,\nespecially in discs that have experienced strong heating or are exposed to\nrelatively high levels of ionising radiation. The radial drift of relatively\nsmall icy grains can yield significant volatile enrichment in the gas phase\nwithin the snowlines, increasing the abundances of key species by up to an\norder of magnitude. Early planetesimal formation can lead to volatile depletion\nin the inner disc on timescales shorter than 0.5 Myr, while the erosion of\nrefractory organic carbon can lead to markedly superstellar gas-phase C/O and\nC/N ratios. Notably, none of the analysed scenarios reproduce the monotonic\nradial trend of the gas-phase C/O ratio predicted by early models. Our results\nalso show that a pairwise comparison of elemental ratios, in the context of the\nhost star's composition, is key to isolating signatures of different scenarios\nin specific regions of the disc.

However, a growing body of experiments on suspensions\nof atomically thin nanomaterials such as graphene contradicts this expectation.\nSome experiments indicate effective suspension viscosity values that fall below\nthat of pure solvent at high shear rates and low solid concentrations, i.e.,\nthe intrinsic viscosity is negative. To explain this puzzling phenomenon, we\ncombined molecular dynamics and boundary integral simulations to investigate\nthe shear viscosity of few-nanometer graphene sheets in water at high P\\'eclet\nnumbers (Pe $> 100$). Our results, covering geometric aspect ratios from 4.5 to\n12.0, show robustly that the intrinsic viscosity decreases with increasing\naspect ratio and becomes negative beyond a threshold aspect ratio $\\approx\n5.5$. We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from hydrodynamic\nslip at the liquid-solid interface, which suppresses particle rotation and\npromotes stable alignment with the flow direction, thereby reducing viscous\ndissipation relative to dissipation in pure solvent. This slip mechanism holds\nfor both fully 3D disc-like and quasi-2D particle geometries explored in the\nmolecular simulations. As the concentration of graphene particles increases in\nthe dilute regime, the viscosity initially decreases, falling below that of\npure water. At higher concentrations, however, particle aggregation becomes\nsignificant, leading to a rise in viscosity after a minimum is reached. These\nfindings confirm the occurrence of a negative intrinsic viscosity in a graphene\nsuspension due only to hydrodynamic effects.

Fitting such a model to the HI recombination line\nratios indicates fcov ~ 0.6-1.0. The normalizations of the nebular attenuation\ncurves, Rv, are driven primarily by fcov and the mix of optically-thick and\nthin OB associations. Thus, the diversity of nebular attenuation curves can be\naccommodated by assuming dust grain properties similar to that of Milky Way\nsightlines but with a subunity covering fraction of dust.

We present a\nnovel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a\nself-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice\nof bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert\nspace whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the\nHamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing\nthe ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable\nquantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a\ntensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding\nto the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space.\nUsing a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time\nevolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In\n(1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent\nentanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach\nestablishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium\nscalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and\ncontinuous-variable quantum computing implementations.",

Methods: We derive\nthe Lense-Thirring period $ P_{\\rm LT}=\\frac{\\pi G M}{a c^3}r^3 $ and solve\n$P_{\\rm LT}=44$ min for black-hole mass M and dimensionless radius $r=R/R_g$.\nWe estimate the equipartition field B at r, compute the Blandford-Znajek power\n$P_{\\rm BZ}$, and the power expected from a gap at the black hole\nmagnetosphere, and compare the resulting jet luminosity to the observed radio\nand X-ray fluxes at $D\\approx4.5$ kpc. We also evaluate expected high-frequency\nvariability and the angular size for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)\nobservations.

We aim to analytically characterize the dynamics of tidally\ninduced spiral arms, including their phase-space signatures. We ran idealized\ntest-particle simulations resembling impulsive satellite impacts, and used the\nSparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamics (SINDy) method to infer their\ngoverning Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We validated the method with\nanalytical derivations and a realistic $N$-body simulation of a MW-Sgr\nencounter analogue. For small perturbations, a linear system of equations was\nrecovered with SINDy, consistent with predictions from linearised collisionless\ndynamics.

For large impacts, we empirically discovered a non-linear\nsystem of equations, representing a novel formulation for the dynamics of\ntidally induced spiral arms.

We fit the Gaia $L_Z-V_R$ waves\nwith the linear model, providing a reasonable fit and plausible parameters for\nthe Sgr passage.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI,\nrequiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language\ninstructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on\ndiscrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node\nconnections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams\ninto continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by\nDeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego\ndataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling\nto balance historical and current observations. While large language models can\nsupervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level\ncontrol. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with\nexpert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced\nwith a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights\nmulti-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong\nperformance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied\nnavigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient,\nreward-driven post-training.",

While\nCGM properties have been widely studied, the influence of a galaxy's\nlarge-scale cosmic environment on the hot gas content remains less explored. We\ninvestigate how the large-scale cosmic web affects the X-ray surface brightness\n(XSB) profiles of galaxies in the context of cosmological simulations. We use\nour novel IllustrisTNG-based lightcone, spanning $0.03 \\leq z \\leq 0.3$, first\ndeveloped in our previous work, and generate self-consistent mock X-ray\nobservations, using intrinsic gas cell information. We apply the filament\nfinder DisPerSE on the galaxy distributions to identify the cosmic filaments\nwithin the lightcone. We classify central galaxies into five distinct\nlarge-scale environment (LSE) categories: clusters and massive groups, cluster\noutskirts, filaments, filament-void transition regions, and voids/walls. We\nfind that the X-ray surface brightness profiles (XSB) of central galaxies of\ndark matter halos in filaments with $M_{\\rm 200m} >10^{12}\\ M_\\odot$ are X-ray\nbrighter than those in voids and walls, with $20-45%$ deviations in the radial\nrange of $\\sim (0.3-0.5) R_{\\rm 200m}$. We investigate the source of this\nenhancement and find that the filament galaxies show higher average gas\ndensities, temperatures, and metallicities compared to voids/walls galaxies.\nOur results demonstrate that the impact of the large-scale cosmic environment\nis imprinted on the hot CGM's X-ray emission.

We investigate an alternative class of methods,\nReinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on\nintrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we\nleverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,\ntrajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty.

Experimental\nresults demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs\nat the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques\non these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even\nbelow the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little\nimprovement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of\nintrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze\nthis limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's\ntraining behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal\nfeedback signals into LLM training.

Pairing measurements of\nthe CMB temperature map obtained by DR5 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope\n(ACT) with the large-scale structure imaging survey conducted by the Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument, DECaLS DR9, we investigate two effects that\nare sensitive to the gas density $\\tau$: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) and\n`patchy screening' (also known as `anisotropic screening'). In particular, we\nmeasure the stacked profiles around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) at a mean\nredshift of $z \\approx 0.7$. We detect the kSZ signal at 7.2$\\sigma$, and we\nfind a signal at $\\sim 4.1\\sigma$ for the patchy screening estimator, which is\nin excess relative to the kSZ signal. We attribute this excess to contamination\nfrom CMB lensing. We demonstrate the effect of lensing using $N$-body\nsimulations, and we show that the screening signal is dominated by it.\nAccounting for lensing, our measurement places a 95\\% upper bound on the\noptical depth of the Extended DESI LRG sample of $\\tau <$ 2.5 $10^{-4}$ for a\nmean value of the sample of $\\tau \\approx$ 1.6 $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, via\nhydro simulations, we show that the underlying optical depth signal measured by\nboth effects (after removing the CMB lensing contribution) is in perfect\nagreement when adopting either a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter\nor a high-pass filter. Consistent with previous measurements, we see evidence\nfor excess baryonic feedback around DESI LRGs in the patchy screening\nmeasurement.

Inspired by the way humans reason with mental\nimagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we\ninvestigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories\nwithout producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental\nImagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent\nvisual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses\nto ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby\ncontinuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin\nby supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image\nembeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent\ntrajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement\nlearning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability.\nExperiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger\nmultimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.",

The\nstandard training approach combines a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, often\nto distill capabilities of a larger model, followed by a reinforcement learning\n(RL)stage such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we\ninvestigate the fundamental limitations of this SFT + RL paradigm and propose\nmethods to overcome them. Under a suitable theoretical model, we demonstrate\nthat the SFT + RL strategy can fail completely when (1) the expert's traces are\ntoo difficult for the small model to express, or (2) the small model's\ninitialization has exponentially small likelihood of success. To address these,\nwe introduce BREAD: a GRPO variant that unifies the SFT and RL stages via\npartial expert guidance and branched rollouts. When self-generated traces fail,\nBREAD adaptively inserts short expert prefixes/hints, allowing the small model\nto complete the rest of the reasoning path, and ensuring that each update\nincludes at least one successful trace. This mechanism both densifies the\nreward signal and induces a natural learning curriculum. BREAD requires fewer\nthan 40% of ground-truth traces, consistently outperforming standard GRPO while\nspeeding up the training by about 3 times. Importantly, we demonstrate that\nBREAD helps the model solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable by the SFT +\nRL strategy, highlighting how branched rollouts and expert guidance can\nsubstantially boost SLM reasoning.",

All of these bounds, however, are proved only over large (or\ncharacteristic $0$) fields, yet finite fields are the more natural setting for\npropositional proof complexity, especially for progress toward lower bounds for\nFrege systems such as $AC^0[p]$-Frege. This work establishes lower bounds\nagainst fragments of IPS over fixed finite fields. Specifically, we show that a\nvariant of the knapsack instance studied by Govindasamy, Hakoniemi, and\nTzameret (FOCS'22) has no polynomial-size IPS refutation over finite fields\nwhen the refutation is multilinear and written as a constant-depth circuit.

We also separate this\nproof system from the one studied by Govindasamy, Hakoniemi, and Tzameret.\n  In addition, we present new lower bounds for read-once algebraic branching\nprogram refutations, roABP-IPS, in finite fields, extending results of Forbes,\nShpilka, Tzameret, and Wigderson (Theor. of Comput.'21) and Hakoniemi, Limaye,\nand Tzameret (STOC'24).\n  Finally, we show that any lower bound against any proof system at least as\nstrong as (non-multilinear) constant-depth IPS over finite fields for any\ninstance, even a purely algebraic instance (i.e., not a translation of a\nBoolean formula or CNF), implies a hard CNF formula for the respective IPS\nfragment, and hence an $AC^0[p]$-Frege lower bound by known simulations over\nfinite fields (Grochow and Pitassi (J.

However,\nfine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even\nwhen the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider\nthis to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of\nfine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the \"attack\". Most\nwell-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM\nwith reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily\nexploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make\nany meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and\nreproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a\nsafety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and\nthe stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising\nvariance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly\ninconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup.

Our analysis reveals a crucial observation:\nunderstanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment\nacross network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better\ncomprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality\nalignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to\nrecover spatial details.

The question we\naddress in this paper is, ``What is the implicit bias that leads to the best\ngeneralization performance?\". To find the optimal implicit bias, we provide a\nprecise asymptotic analysis of the generalization performance of interpolators\nobtained from the minimization of convex functions/potentials for\nover-parameterized linear regression with non-isotropic Gaussian data. In\nparticular, we obtain a tight lower bound on the best generalization error\npossible among this class of interpolators in terms of the\nover-parameterization ratio, the variance of the noise in the labels, the\neigenspectrum of the data covariance, and the underlying distribution of the\nparameter to be estimated.

In this\nwork we show how Machine Learning, in particular Variational Autoencoders\n(VAE), can detect anomalies in a sample of approximately 200,000 DESI spectra\ncomprising galaxies, quasars and stars. We demonstrate that the VAE can\ncompress the dimensionality of a spectrum by a factor of 100, while still\nretaining enough information to accurately reconstruct spectral features. We\nthen detect anomalous spectra as those with high reconstruction error and those\nwhich are isolated in the VAE latent representation. The anomalies identified\nfall into two categories: spectra with artefacts and spectra with unique\nphysical features. Awareness of the former can help to improve the DESI\nspectroscopic pipeline; whilst the latter can lead to the identification of new\nand unusual objects. To further curate the list of outliers, we use the\nAstronomaly package which employs Active Learning to provide personalised\noutlier recommendations for visual inspection. In this work we also explore the\nVAE latent space, finding that different object classes and subclasses are\nseparated despite being unlabelled. We demonstrate the interpretability of this\nlatent space by identifying tracks within it that correspond to various\nspectral characteristics.

    "abstract": "A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and\noptimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often\nfail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a\nframework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by\nconstruction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of\nfault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic\ntransformations.\n  To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction\nproperties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered\nfault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding\nfault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on\nboth circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is\nalready implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state\npreparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an\nimplementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification.\n  To utilize fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt\nthe ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its\nrewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault\nequivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. Enabled by our\nframework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for\nsyndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We anticipate that fault\nequivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant\nquantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation\nframework.",

Through comprehensive evaluation of\n21 state-of-the-art language models (ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters), we\nidentify two fundamental findings. First, language models frequently confuse\nsemantic similarity with causality, relying on lexical and semantic overlap\ninstead of inferring actual causal explanatory relationships. Second, as\nparameter size increases, models tend to shift from being overly skeptical\nabout causal relationships to being excessively permissive in accepting them.\nDespite this shift, performance measured by the Matthews Correlation\nCoefficient plateaus at just 0.55, even for the best-performing models.Hence,\nCLEAR-3K provides a crucial benchmark for developing and evaluating genuine\ncausal reasoning in language models, which is an essential capability for\napplications that require accurate assessment of causal relationships.",

A DCGAN was used to create synthetic\nimages which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN.\nThe CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results\nindicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor\nclassification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a\nsmall portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN\nimages, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching\n95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the\nproportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined.\nThis study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets\nespecially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce\nartifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.",

We propose a novel architecture for downlink RSMA,\nnamely Codeword-Segmentation RSMA (CS-RSMA). Different from conventional RSMA\nwhich splits users' messages into common and private parts before encoding,\nCS-RSMA encodes the users' messages directly, segments the codewords into\ncommon and private parts, and transmits the codeword segments using common and\nprivate streams. In addition to the principle of CS-RSMA, a novel performance\nanalysis framework is proposed. This framework utilizes a recent discovery in\nmismatched decoding under finite-alphabet input and interference, and can\nbetter capture the receiver's complexity limits. Precoder optimization under\nfinite alphabets and suboptimal decoders for conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA to\nmaximize the Sum-Rate (SR) and the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) is also addressed.\nThe numerical results reveal the theoretical performance of conventional RSMA\nand CS-RSMA. We observe that CS-RSMA leads to better performance than\nconventional RSMA in SR, and similar performance in MMF. Furthermore, a\nphysical-layer implementation of CS-RSMA is proposed and evaluated through\nlink-level simulations. Aside performance benefits, we also demonstrate that\nCS-RSMA brings significant benefits on the encoding/decoding, control\nsignaling, and retransmission process compared to conventional RSMA.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering\ndrawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such\ninformation includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,\nmaterial specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and\nlabor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,\nengineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable\noutputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that\nintegrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a\ntransformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These\nare parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are\nlightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited\ncomputational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated\ndataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a\ncomparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four\nkey metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%\nrecall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a\ncase study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports\ndownstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing\nthe practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing\ninterpretation.",

We use MedPerturb in two case studies\nto reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect\ndiverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are\nmore sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are\nmore sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical\nsummaries.

    "abstract": "Context. AGNs are strong X-ray emitters shaped by disk-corona interactions.\nThe soft excess (0.5-2.0 keV) reveals key information about the \"warm corona\"\nbridging the disk and hot corona. Yet, how this feature evolves with accretion\nproperties remains poorly constrained, especially in large samples using\nspectral stacking. Aims. The eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS:5) provides an\nunprecedented sample. We investigate how the average AGN X-ray spectra evolve\nwith accretion parameters, and explore disk-corona connection by further\ncombining stacked UV data. Methods. We developed Xstack, a novel tool that\nstacks rest-frame X-ray spectra and responses while preserving spectral shape\nthrough optimized weighting. We stack 17929 AGNs (\"spec-z\" sample, 23 Ms) with\nsimilar X-ray loudness alpha_ox, UV luminosity L_UV, and 4159 AGNs (\"BH-mass\"\nsample, 3 Ms) with similar Eddington ratio lambda_Edd and black hole mass M_BH.\nThe resulting stacked X-ray spectra are analyzed with a phenomenological model.\nWe further fit the stacked optical-UV-Xray SED with AGNSED model. Results. Soft\nexcess strengthens strongly with alpha_ox and lambda_Edd (~5), while the hard\nX-ray spectral shape remains largely unchanged, supporting that soft excess is\ndominated by warm corona rather than reflection. AGNSED modeling reveals that\nwarm corona radius (R_g units) generally increases with lambda_Edd and\ndecreases with M_BH, or equivalently the disk-to-warm-corona transition\nconsistently occurs near 1e4 K. The hot corona contracts with lambda_Edd and is\nunaffected by M_BH, aligning with disk evaporation predictions. Conclusions.\nThe soft excess likely originates from a warm corona, with the disk to warm\ncorona transition tied to hydrogen ionization near 1e4 K - supporting earlier\neFEDS-HSC stacking results (Hagen et al. 2024). This study shows the strength\nof spectral stacking in probing AGN disk-corona physics.",

The classic view relates uncertainty in risk estimates for\nindividuals to sample size (estimation uncertainty) but uncertainty can also be\ncaused by model uncertainty (variability in modeling choices) and applicability\nuncertainty (variability in measurement procedures and between populations).\nMethods: We used real and synthetic data for ovarian cancer diagnosis to train\n59400 models with variations in estimation, model, and applicability\nuncertainty. We then used these models to estimate the probability of ovarian\ncancer in a fixed test set of 100 patients and evaluate the variability in\nindividual estimates. Findings: We show empirically that estimation uncertainty\ncan be strongly dominated by model uncertainty and applicability uncertainty,\neven for models that perform well at the population level. Estimation\nuncertainty decreased considerably with increasing training sample size,\nwhereas model and applicability uncertainty remained large. Interpretation:\nIndividual risk estimates are far more uncertain than often assumed. Model\nuncertainty and applicability uncertainty usually remain invisible when\nprediction models or algorithms are based on a single study. Predictive\nalgorithms should inform, not dictate, care and support personalization through\nclinician-patient interaction rather than through inherently uncertain model\noutputs.

There is a significant need to create an\neffective and reliable multi-modal learning strategy for leveraging unlabeled\ndata in semi-supervised segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel semi-supervised multi-modal medical image segmentation approach, which\nleverages complementary multi-modal information to enhance performance with\nlimited labeled data. Our approach employs a multi-stage multi-modal fusion and\nenhancement strategy to fully utilize complementary multi-modal information,\nwhile reducing feature discrepancies and enhancing feature sharing and\nalignment. Furthermore, we effectively introduce contrastive mutual learning to\nconstrain prediction consistency across modalities, thereby facilitating the\nrobustness of segmentation results in semi-supervised tasks. Experimental\nresults on two multi-modal datasets demonstrate the superior performance and\nrobustness of the proposed framework, establishing its valuable potential for\nsolving medical image segmentation tasks in complex scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Quantum arithmetic computation requires a substantial number of scratch\nqubits to stay reversible. These operations necessitate qubit and gate\nresources equivalent to those needed for the larger of the input or output\nregisters due to state encoding. Quantum Hamiltonian Computing (QHC) introduces\na novel approach by encoding input for logic operations within a single\nrotating quantum gate. This innovation reduces the required qubit register $ N\n$ to the size of the output states $ O $, where $ N = \\log_2 O $. Leveraging\nQHC principles, we present reversible half-adder and full-adder circuits that\ncompress the standard Toffoli + CNOT layout [Vedral et al., PRA, 54, 11,\n(1996)] from three-qubit and four-qubit formats for the Quantum half-adder\ncircuit and five sequential Fredkin gates using five qubits [Moutinho et al.,\nPRX Energy 2, 033002 (2023)] for full-adder circuit; into a two-qubit, 4$\\times\n$4 Hilbert space. This scheme, presented here, is optimized for classical logic\nevaluated on quantum hardware, which due to unitary evolution can bypass\nclassical CMOS energy limitations to certain degree. Although we avoid\nsuperposition of input and output states in this manuscript, this remains\nfeasible in principle.

However, due to the network dynamics and varying\ninformation gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and\ncollect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a\ncomprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust\nevaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of\nmisaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task\ncompletion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages\nbased on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion\nprocess, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant\nto that stage, leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By\nleveraging advanced in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning\ncapabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the\ncollected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices\ndeemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation.\nThe framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all\nstages.

To\nunderstand the nature of these events, we tune three factors that are known to\naffect brittleness of a glass.

However, rapidly and\ncontinuously evaluating the trustworthiness of collaborators during task\nexecution is a significant challenge due to distributed devices, complex\noperational environments, and dynamically changing resources. To tackle this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a Siamese-enabled rapid and continuous trust\nevaluation framework (SRCTE) to facilitate effective task collaboration. First,\nthe communication and computing resource attributes of the collaborator in a\ntrusted state, along with historical collaboration data, are collected and\nrepresented using an attributed control flow graph (ACFG) that captures\ntrust-related semantic information and serves as a reference for comparison\nwith data collected during task execution. At each time slot of task execution,\nthe collaborator's communication and computing resource attributes, as well as\ntask completion effectiveness, are collected in real time and represented with\nan ACFG to convey their trust-related semantic information. A Siamese model,\nconsisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to\nlearn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.\nFinally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is\ncalculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot. A\nreal system is built using two Dell EMC 5200 servers and a Google Pixel 8 to\ntest the effectiveness of the proposed SRCTE framework. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SRCTE converges rapidly with only a small amount of data and\nachieves a high anomaly trust detection rate compared to the baseline\nalgorithm.",

There is also an\nintermediate regime called semihard, in which the momentum transfer runs\ntypically from $~1$ to $~10$ GeV.

The emergence\nof \"thinking\" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither\nproduce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is\nmore likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent\nunderstanding of when model-free RL will lead to \"thinking\" as a strategy for\nreward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable\nthinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy\ndomain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought\nactions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.",

Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but\ntheir approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like\nhigh peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between\nmethods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified\nmetric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their\nlifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they\nattain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and\ngeneration, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the\nhigh peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --\n*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with\neviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs\nduring pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn\nto *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end\noptimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full\nKV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context\nperformance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while\nretaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the\ncomplex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future\ndevelopment to minimize the KV footprint.",

    "abstract": "The study of Code Stylometry, and in particular Code Authorship Attribution\n(CAA), aims to analyze coding styles to identify the authors of code samples.\nCAA is crucial in cybersecurity and software forensics for addressing,\ndetecting plagiarism, and supporting criminal prosecutions. However, CAA is a\ncomplex and error prone task, due to the need for recognizing nuanced\nrelationships between coding patterns. This challenge is compounded in large\nsoftware systems with numerous authors due to the subtle variability of\npatterns that signify the coding style of one author among many. Given the\nchallenges related to this task, researchers have proposed and studied\nautomated approaches that rely upon classical Machine Learning and Deep\nLearning techniques. However, such techniques have historically relied upon\nhand-crafted features, and due to the often intricate interaction of different\nfeatures (e.g., formatting, etc.), have key limitations in properly\ncharacterizing authorship, and are sensitive to adversarial code perturbations.\nRecently, transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have shown remarkable\nefficacy across a range of software engineering tasks, and in the authorship\nattribution on natural language in the NLP domain. However, their effectiveness\nin CAA is not well understood. As such, we conduct the first extensive\nempirical study applying two larger state-of-the-art code LMs, and five smaller\ncode LMs to the task of CAA to 6 diverse datasets that encompass 12k code\nsnippets written by 463 developers. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth\nanalysis of our studied models' performance on CAA using established machine\nlearning interpretability techniques. The results of our analysis illustrate\nimportant findings that illuminate the behavior of LMs in understanding\nstylometric code patterns during the task of CAA, and point towards important\ndirections for future work.",

This generalizes the large average\nsubmatrix problem, a key model closely related to biclustering and\nhigh-dimensional data analysis, to tensors. For the submatrix case, Bhamidi,\nDey, and Nobel~\\cite{bhamidi2017energy} explicitly highlight the regime\n$k=\\Theta(N)$ as an intriguing open question.\n  Addressing the regime $k=\\Theta(N)$ for tensors, we establish that the\nlargest average entry concentrates around an explicit value $E_{\\mathrm{max}}$,\nprovided that the tensor order $p$ is sufficiently large.

At\nthe heart of these challenges is the trustworthy, fair, and efficient\nallocation of scarce public resources, including renewable energy,\ntransportation, data, computation, etc.. Historical evidence suggests that\nmonetary control -- the prototypical mechanism for managing resource scarcity\n-- is not always well-accepted in socio-technical resource contexts. In this\nvision article, we advocate for karma economies as an emerging non-monetary\nmechanism for socio-technical control. Karma leverages the repetitive nature of\nmany socio-technical resources to jointly attain trustworthy, fair, and\nefficient allocations; by budgeting resource consumption over time and letting\nresource users ``play against their future selves.'' To motivate karma, we\nreview related concepts in economics through a control systems lens, and make a\ncase for a) shifting the viewpoint of resource allocations from single-shot and\nstatic to repeated and dynamic games; and b) adopting long-run Nash welfare as\nthe formalization of ``fairness and efficiency'' in socio-technical contexts.\nWe show that in many dynamic resource settings, karma Nash equilibria maximize\nlong-run Nash welfare. Moreover, we discuss implications for a future smart\ncity built on multi-karma economies: by choosing whether to combine different\nsocio-technical resources, e.g., electricity and transportation, in a single\nkarma economy, or separate into resource-specific economies, karma provides new\nflexibility to design the scope of fairness and efficiency.",

At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal\nstate), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state)\nor state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition\nbetween states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over\ntime. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of\nprocesses. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden\nstate, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal\ndistribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search\nstrategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error\nprobability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d.\nobservations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a\nhidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly\nDetection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the\nprobing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive\nbelief updates over hidden states. ADHM effectively leverages temporal\ncorrelations to focus sensing resources on the most informative processes. The\nalgorithm is supported by an asymptotic theoretical foundation, grounded in an\noracle analysis that characterizes the fundamental limits of detection under\nthe assumption of a known distribution of the hidden states. In addition, the\nalgorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance, consistently outperforming\nexisting methods in extensive simulations.",

We implement a single-mode confocal\nillumination and collection scheme, using a two-lens system to mode-match the\ninterfering beams to achieve background methane detection at a distance of 4.6\nmeters under a 60 dB loss. Our method is also extended to real-world surfaces,\nsuch as glass, brushed metal, and a leaf, showing robust background methane\nsensing with various target materials.",

This document provides a curated list of atomic physics\nreferences frequently used for plasma diagnostics in X-ray spectroscopy,\noutside of comprehensive plasma models that typically come with their own\nunderlying atomic databases. The list includes references to physical\nconstants, laboratory benchmarks, transition energies, position and line shapes\nof neutral fluorescence lines, radiative branching ratios, and commonly used\nnotation for prominent transitions. Quick-look tables for transition energies\nin H-, He-, and Li-like ions and line positions and shapes for fluorescence\nlines in neutrals. The main focus is on K-shell transitions. For the H- and\nHe-like tables, we cite state-of-the art calculations that we consider\ncurrently the best available reference energies, which are considered high\naccuracy and thus typically used for energy scale calibration in laboratory\nmeasurements. Omissions in these tables are due to the lack of availability in\nthe chosen references, and are not a statement about the relevance of these\nlines. Due to their complex and highly source-dependent line shape, the atomic\ndata for neutrals is of lower accuracy than that for the highly charged ions,\nand the best reference data for these line shapes typically consist of\nempirical models derived from very high-resolution laboratory measurements. The\ntable for neutrals provided here is consistent with the reference used for the\nenergy gain scale calibration of XRISM/Resolve. This document is meant to serve\nas a resource to help find relevant references and conveniently formatted\noverview tables.

Eccentric binaries can form in dense\nstellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or\nfrom triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently\nmeasuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric\nmergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to\ndisentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals.\nHere, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a\nrelatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\\sim20$ M$_\\odot$, its\ngravitational-wave signal spanned $\\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no\nindication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular\nbinaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies\nfound the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical\ndifferences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger\nevent from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We\npresent a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of\nGW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field\ntriples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if\nGW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field\ntriple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active\ngalactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a\nviable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of\neccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for\nconstraining the disk geometry.",

    "abstract": "Driving scene identification, which assigns multiple non-exclusive class\nlabels to a scene, provides the contextual awareness necessary for enhancing\nautonomous vehicles' ability to understand, reason about, and interact with the\ncomplex driving environment. As a multi-label classification problem, it is\nbetter tackled via multitasking learning. However, directly training a\nmulti-label classification model for driving scene identification through\nmultitask learning presents two main challenges: acquiring a balanced,\ncomprehensively annotated multi-label dataset and balancing learning across\ndifferent tasks. This paper introduces a novel learning system that synergizes\nknowledge acquisition and accumulation (KAA) with consistency-based active\nlearning (CAL) to address those challenges. KAA acquires and accumulates\nknowledge about scene identification from various single-label datasets via\nmonotask learning. Subsequently, CAL effectively resolves the knowledge gap\ncaused by the discrepancy between single-label and multi-label data. An\nablation study on our Driving Scene Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a\n56.1% performance increase over the baseline model pretrained on ImageNet. Of\nthis, KAA accounts for 31.3% of the gain, and CAL contributes 24.8%. Moreover,\nKAA-CAL stands out as the best performer when compared to state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) multi-label models on two public datasets, BDD100K and HSD, achieving\nthis while using 85% less data.

Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias\nscore of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting\nbiased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models.

    "abstract": "Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), an enhancement of 5G, processes data\ncloser to its generation point, reducing latency and network load. However, the\ndistributed and edge-based nature of 5G-MEC presents privacy and security\nchallenges, including data exposure risks. Ensuring efficient manipulation and\nsecurity of sensitive data at the edge is crucial. To address these challenges,\nwe investigate the usage of threshold secret sharing in 5G-MEC storage, an\napproach that enhances both security and dependability. A (k,n) threshold\nsecret sharing scheme splits and stores sensitive data among n nodes, requiring\nat least k nodes for reconstruction. The solution ensures confidentiality by\nprotecting data against fewer than k colluding nodes and enhances availability\nby tolerating up to n-k failing nodes. This approach mitigates threats such as\nunauthorized access and node failures, whether accidental or intentional. We\nfurther discuss a method for selecting the convenient MEHs to store the shares,\nconsidering the MEHs' trustworthiness level as a main criterion. Although we\ndefine our proposal in the context of secret-shared data storage, it can be\nseen as an independent, standalone selection process for 5G-MEC trustworthy\nnode selection in other scenarios too.",

It\nremains unclear what divides these super-Earth systems from those that form\nterrestrial planets, and what role wide-orbit gas giants play in this process.\nHere, we show that the key uncertainty is the degree of viscous heating in the\ninner disc, which regulates the pebble accretion efficiency. In this parameter\nstudy, we assume pebble sizes limited by fragmentation and radial drift. The\ninitial seed planetesimals for embryo growth are taken from the top of the\nstreaming instability mass distribution. We then evaluate the important role of\nthe pebble scale height and the assumed pebble fragmentation velocity. In\nsystems with maximally efficient viscous heating, where all the accretion\nheating is deposited in the disc midplane, pebble accretion in the terrestrial\nregion is suppressed. More realistic levels of viscous heating, at higher\nelevations, allow terrestrial embryo formation at Earth-like orbits. We also\nfind that the role of the water iceline is minor, unless it is paired with\nextreme volatile loss and a change in the pebble fragmentation velocity.\nFurthermore, we show that in systems with gas-giant formation, the role of\nmutual pebble filtering by outer pebble-accreting embryos is limited, unless\nsome mechanism of delaying inner disc growth, such as viscous heating or the\npresence of an iceline, is simultaneously employed. This latter point appears\nto be consistent with the fact that no strong suppression is seen in the\noccurrence rate of super-Earths in systems with known gas giants in wider\norbits. We conclude that the diversity in inner-disc systems may largely be\ndriven by complex, and as of yet poorly understood, disc accretion physics\ninside the water iceline.",

These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific\ncode-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step\nin constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing\ncode benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are\nprone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could\nresult in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations\nof model capabilities.\n  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental\ndesigns and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for\nreaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine\ntranslation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing\ngeneral-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and\ninstruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world\napplications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce\nTower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both\ntranslation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a\nPareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual\ngeneral-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds\non Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised\nfine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with\nverifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate\ndata to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks\ninvolving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general\ninstruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.\nOur smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and\nproprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers\nbest-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top\nresults in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we\nintroduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our\nfindings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general\ncapabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as\ntranslation and localization.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the attractors of complex nonlinear dynamical systems from\navailable measurements is key to analyse and predict their time evolution.\nExisting attractor reconstruction methods typically rely on topological\nembedding and may produce poor reconstructions, which differ significantly from\nthe actual attractor, because measurements are corrupted by noise and often\navailable only for some of the state variables and/or their combinations, and\nthe time series are often relatively short. Here, we propose the use of\nHomogeneous Differentiators (HD) to effectively de-noise measurements and more\nfaithfully reconstruct attractors of nonlinear systems. Homogeneous\nDifferentiators are supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees about their\nde-noising capabilities, and their results can be fruitfully combined with\ntime-delay embedding, differential embedding and functional observability. We\napply our proposed HD-based methodology to simulated dynamical models of\nincreasing complexity, from the Lorenz system to the Hindmarsh-Rose model and\nthe Epileptor model for neural dynamics, as well as to empirical data of EEG\nrecordings. In the presence of corrupting noise of various types, we obtain\ndrastically improved quality and resolution of the reconstructed attractors, as\nwell as significantly reduced computational time, which can be orders of\nmagnitude lower than that of alternative methods. Our tests show the\nflexibility and effectiveness of Homogeneous Differentiators and suggest that\nthey can become the tool of choice for preprocessing noisy signals and\nreconstructing attractors of highly nonlinear dynamical systems from both\ntheoretical models and real data.",

    "abstract": "Synchronization errors, such as insertions and deletions, present a\nfundamental challenge in DNA-based data storage systems, arising from both\nsynthesis and sequencing noise. These channels are often modeled as\ninsertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channels, for which designing\nmaximum-likelihood decoders is computationally expensive. In this work, we\npropose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design\nlow-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed\narchitecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN\nlog N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs\nrequire only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an\nexplicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI)\nestimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS\nchannels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal\ndecoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower\ncomplexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of\nthe channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to\nrealistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads\nand real-world Nanopore sequencing data. Our results show that NPDs match or\nsurpass the performance of existing methods while using significantly fewer\nparameters than the state-of-the-art.

We derive the motion\nequations for photons around the Kalb-Ramond black hole and constrain the\nLorentz symmetry breaking parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\gamma$ using observational\ndata released by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration. The results\nindicate that, under the static spherical accretion model, as $\\lambda$ or\n$\\gamma$ increase, the peak value of the observed intensity for Kalb-Ramond\nblack holes is enhanced and consistently exceeds that of the corresponding\nSchwarzschild black holes. In the presence of plasma, we find that as the\nplasma frequency increases, the photon sphere radius increases, whereas the\nblack hole shadow radius decreases. In addition, compared to inhomogeneous\nplasma, the effect of homogeneous plasma on these features is more significant.\nSpecifically, when the plasma is homogeneous, an increase in plasma frequency\nfurther enhances the observed intensity peaks. This suggests that the shadow of\nthe Kalb-Ramond black hole is brighter due to the presence of plasma.\nAdditionally, for the same Kalb-Ramond black hole model parameters and plasma\nfrequency, the shadow of the Kalb-Ramond black hole in inhomogeneous plasma is\nlarger than in the case of homogeneous plasma.

We can solve a Quantum k-SAT\ninstance in polynomial time if the derived hypergraph has a core of size n-m+a,\nwhere a is a constant, and the radius is at most logarithmic. If it exists, we\ncan find a core of size n-m+a with the best possible radius in polynomial time,\nwhereas finding a general minimum core with minimal radius is NP-hard.",

    "abstract": "Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is crucial in\nmany scenarios, such as those dealing with financial or neurological data. Many\nsuch time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments\nwith a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal\nstructure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for\nanalyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this\nsetting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have\nits own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,\nwhich may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery\napproaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity\nor Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified\nframework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with\nnon Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the\nnumber of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's\nDirected Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm\nthat maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood. On the\ntheoretical side, we prove, under mild assumptions, that temporal\nheteroscedastic causal models, introduced in FANTOM's formulation, are\nidentifiable in both stationary and non stationary settings. In addition,\nextensive experiments on synthetic and real data show that FANTOM outperforms\nexisting methods.",

We present latent diffusion for full\nprotein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom\nprotein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from\nmolecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural\nnetwork (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein\nconformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind,\nsequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent\nrepresentations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by\ndihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a\n2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor\nin a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy\nreproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT\nof approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone\nand side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of\nless than 0.03 compared to the MD data.

We quantify the scaling behavior of logical error rates\nunder circuit-level noise, comparing standard depolarizing (SD) and\nsuperconducting-inspired (SI) noise models with small and large rotations. Our\nfindings show that the rotated code scales as $0.68d_R (0.65d_R)$ for SD and\n$0.81d_R (0.77d_R)$ for SI, with small rotation angles leading to a steeper\ndecay of logical error rates.

The threshold error rates for rotated\nlogical states are compared with previous results, demonstrating improved\nresilience against noise.

Current attribution research primarily studies multi-layer\nperceptron neurons and addresses relatively simple concepts such as factual\nassociations (e.g., Paris is located in France). This focus tends to overlook\nthe impact of the attention mechanism and lacks a unified approach for\nanalyzing more complex concepts. To fill these gaps, we introduce Scalable\nAttention Module Discovery (SAMD), a concept-agnostic method for mapping\narbitrary, complex concepts to specific attention heads of general transformer\nmodels. We accomplish this by representing each concept as a vector,\ncalculating its cosine similarity with each attention head, and selecting the\nTopK-scoring heads to construct the concept-associated attention module. We\nthen propose Scalar Attention Module Intervention (SAMI), a simple strategy to\ndiminish or amplify the effects of a concept by adjusting the attention module\nusing only a single scalar parameter.

    "abstract": "Effective license plate recognition systems are required to be resilient to\nconstant change, as new license plates are released into traffic daily. While\nTransformer-based networks excel in their recognition at first sight, we\nobserve significant performance drop over time which proves them unsuitable for\ntense production environments. Indeed, such systems obtain state-of-the-art\nresults on plates whose syntax is seen during training. Yet, we show they\nperform similarly to random guessing on future plates where legible characters\nare wrongly recognized due to a shift in their syntax. After highlighting the\nflows of positional and contextual information in Transformer encoder-decoders,\nwe identify several causes for their over-reliance on past syntax. Following,\nwe devise architectural cut-offs and replacements which we integrate into SaLT,\nan attempt at a Syntax-Less Transformer for syntax-agnostic modeling of license\nplate representations. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets show\nthat our approach reaches top accuracy on past syntax and most importantly\nnearly maintains performance on future license plates. We further demonstrate\nthe robustness of our architecture enhancements by way of various ablations.",

    "abstract": "Neural network model extraction has emerged in recent years as an important\nsecurity concern, as adversaries attempt to recover a network's parameters via\nblack-box queries. A key step in this process is signature extraction, which\naims to recover the absolute values of the network's weights layer by layer.\nPrior work, notably by Carlini et al. (2020), introduced a technique inspired\nby differential cryptanalysis to extract neural network parameters. However,\ntheir method suffers from several limitations that restrict its applicability\nto networks with a few layers only. Later works focused on improving sign\nextraction, but largely relied on the assumption that signature extraction\nitself was feasible.\n  In this work, we revisit and refine the signature extraction process by\nsystematically identifying and addressing for the first time critical\nlimitations of Carlini et al.'s signature extraction method. These limitations\ninclude rank deficiency and noise propagation from deeper layers. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose efficient algorithmic solutions for each of the\nidentified issues, greatly improving the efficiency of signature extraction.\nOur approach permits the extraction of much deeper networks than was previously\npossible. We validate our method through extensive experiments on ReLU-based\nneural networks, demonstrating significant improvements in extraction depth and\naccuracy. For instance, our extracted network matches the target network on at\nleast 95% of the input space for each of the eight layers of a neural network\ntrained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, while previous works could barely extract the\nfirst three layers.

Existing multimodal\nbenchmarks typically overlook linguistic and visual ambiguities, relying mainly\non unimodal context for disambiguation and thus failing to exploit the mutual\nclarification potential between modalities.

Extensive\nevaluations involving 19 state-of-the-art multimodal models--encompassing both\nopen-source and proprietary architectures--reveal substantial gaps compared to\nhuman-level performance, highlighting the need for future research into more\nsophisticated cross-modal ambiguity comprehension methods, further pushing the\nboundaries of multimodal reasoning.",

Working with Markov kernels (conditional\ndistributions), we analyze the mass distributions of Archimax copulas $C \\in\n\\mathcal{C}_{am}$ and show that the support of $C$ is determined by some\nfunctions $f^0$, $g^L$ and $g^R$. Additionally, we prove that the discrete\ncomponent (if any) of $C$ concentrates its mass on the graphs of certain convex\nfunctions $f^s$ or non-decreasing functions $g^t$. Investigating the level sets\n$L^t$ of Archimax copulas $C \\in \\mathcal{C}_{am}$, we establish that these\nsets can also be characterized in terms of the afore-mentioned functions $f^s$\nand $g^t$. Furthermore, recognizing the close relationship between the level\nsets $L^t$ of a copula $C$ and its Kendall distribution function $F_C^K$, we\nprovide an alternative proof for the representation of $F_C^K$ for arbitrary\nArchimax copulas $C\\in \\mathcal{C}_{am}$ and derive simple expressions for the\nlevel set masses $\\mu_C(L^t)$. Building upon the fact that Archimax copulas $C\n\\in \\mathcal{C}_{am}$ can be represented via two univariate probability\nmeasures $\\gamma$ and $\\vartheta$ - so-called Williamson and Pickands\ndependence measures - we show that absolute continuity, discreteness and\nsingularity properties of these measures $\\gamma$ and $\\vartheta$ carry over to\nthe corresponding Archimax copula $C_{\\gamma, \\vartheta}$. Finally, we derive\nconditions on $\\gamma$ and $\\vartheta$ such that the support of the absolutely\ncontinuous, discrete or singular component of $C_{\\gamma, \\vartheta}$ coincides\nwith the support of $C_{\\gamma, \\vartheta}$.",

While\ntechniques like metadynamics (MetaD) and path-CV enable targeted free energy\nsurface (FES) reconstruction, they often struggle with confinement stability,\nhyperparameter sensitivity, and geometric flexibility. This work introduces the\nGreat Restraining Wall (GW) method, a robust framework for efficient FES\nsampling within predefined CV subspaces, addressing these limitations through a\nnovel kernel density estimation (KDE)-derived restraining potential. GW\noperates by constructing a bias potential that confines sampling to user\ndefined regions ranging from multidimensional masks to 1D pathways via\nasymptotically half-harmonic barriers. Unlike MetaD variants requiring\niterative bias deposition, GW potential is derived from a cumulative\ndistribution function, ensuring confinement without manual hyperparameter\ntuning. GW provides a versatile, stable, and efficient framework for targeted\nFES sampling, particularly beneficial for complex biomolecular systems with\nintricate CV landscapes. Its integration with existing enhanced sampling\nprotocols opens avenues for studying ligand binding, conformational\ntransitions, and other rare events with unprecedented precision.

The discovered invariant images differed dramatically\ndepending on the choice of image representation used for optimization:\npixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching\nmid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively.\nNotably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by\nhuman subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher\nfidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous\nartificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on\nbehalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their\nbehaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies\nhave assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.\nHowever, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards\nare at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this\npaper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple\nLLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and\npain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for\nscrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward\napplications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'\nbehalf.",

Extracting and\nmodeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only\nreal-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When\nsynthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on\ndegradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise\ncharacteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit\ndegradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone\ncannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the\nsignificant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two\nstrategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing\nthe domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs\ndomain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and\nlearn additional degradation patterns. The ThirdGAN is trained on pseudo-real\ndata generated by the FirstGAN and SecondGAN to reconstruct real-world LR\nimages. Extensive experiments on the RealSR and DRealSR datasets demonstrate\nthat our method exhibits clear advantages in quantitative metrics while\nmaintaining sharp reconstructions without over-smoothing artifacts.

    "abstract": "With advances in technology, there has been growing interest in developing\neffective mapping methods for 3-dimensional objects in recent years. Volumetric\nparameterization for 3D solid manifolds plays an important role in processing\n3D data. However, the conventional approaches cannot control the bijectivity\nand local geometric distortions of the result mappings due to the complex\nstructure of the solid manifolds. Moreover, prior methods mainly focus on one\nproperty instead of balancing different properties during the mapping process.\nIn this paper, we propose several novel methods for computing volumetric\nparameterizations for 3D simply-connected manifolds. Analogous to surface\nparameterization, our framework incorporates several models designed to\npreserve geometric structure, achieve density equalization, and optimally\nbalance geometric and density distortions. With these methods, various 3D\nmanifold parameterizations with different desired properties can be achieved.\nThese methods are tested on different examples and manifold remeshing\napplications, demonstrating their effectiveness and accuracy.",

These observations have revealed a variety of large-scale disk\nsubstructures, including rings, gaps, and spirals, spanning tens to hundreds of\nau, supporting the predictions of planet formation models. Recent instruments,\nsuch as MATISSE at the VLTI, allow one to resolve and investigate the inner few\nau of protoplanetary disks in nearby star formation regions, shedding light on\nthe traces of planet formation and evolution at these small scales. The aim of\nthis work is to assess the feasibility of interferometric observations of\nsmall-scale planet-induced substructures in protoplanetary disks in nearby\nstar-forming regions. We aim to characterize these substructures in\nmulti-wavelength and multi-epoch observations and subsequently differentiate\nbetween simulation parameters. On the basis of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of\nembedded planetary companions and subsequent 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nsimulations, we calculated and analyzed interferometric observables, assuming\nobservations with the VLTI in the K, L, M, and N bands. The hydrodynamic\nsimulations exhibit mass-dependent planet-induced density waves that create\nobservable substructures, most notably for the considered case of a 300\n$M_{\\oplus}$ planet. These substructures share similarities with observed\nlarge-scale structures and feature a prominent accretion region around the\nembedded planet. The visibilities show a detectable variability for multi-epoch\nVLTI/GRAVITY and VLTI/MATISSE observations, caused by the orbital motion of the\nplanet, that are distinguishable from other sources of variability due to their\nunique combination of timescale and amplitude.",

The explorations of symmetry breaking\neffects are therefore usually limited by the intrinsic properties of known,\nstable materials. In recent years, advances in focused ion beam (FIB)\nfabrication have enabled the nanostructuring of bulk crystals into ultraprecise\ntransport devices [1-4], facilitating the investigation of geometrical effects\non mesoscopic length scales. In this work, we expand such explorations into\nthree-dimensional (3D), curvilinear shapes, by sculpting helical nanostructure\ndevices from single crystals of the high-mobility, centrosymmetric magnetic\nWeyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ [5,6]. The combination of the imposed chiral\ngeometry and intrinsic ferromagnetism yields nonreciprocal electron transport\n[7-9]. The high coercivity results in an anomalous, reversable diode effect\nremnant under zero applied magnetic field, which is orders of magnitude larger\nthan can be explained by a classical self-field mechanism. We argue the\nenhancement originates from the high carrier mobility and the resulting\nquasi-ballistic transport: the conduction electron mean free path approaches\nthe length scale of the curvature, resulting in increased asymmetrical\nscattering at the boundaries. We further demonstrate the inverse effect of the\nnonreciprocal transport: the field-free, current-induced switching of the\nmagnetisation.

    "abstract": "The spin-boson model is a widely used model for understanding the properties\nof a two-level open quantum system. Accurately describing its dynamics often\nrequires going beyond the weak system-environment coupling approximation.\nHowever, calculating the higher-order generators of such a dynamics, with a\nsystem-environment coupling that is not too weak, has been known to be\nchallenging, both numerically and analytically. This work presents the\nanalytical derivation of the complete fourth-order time-convolutionless (TCL)\ngenerator for a generic spin-boson model, accurate up to 4th order in the\nsystem-environment coupling parameter, under the assumption that the\nenvironmental spectral density is an odd function of frequency. In the case of\na semiconductor double-quantum-dot system, our results reveal corrections to\nthe dynamics that may become physically significant in some parameter regimes.\nFurthermore, we report that the widely used second-order TCL master equation\ntends to overestimate the non-Markovianity of a dynamics over a large parameter\nregime. Within the regime of its applicability, our results provide a\ncomputational advantage over numerically exact techniques. The accuracy of the\nfourth-order TCL generator is rigorously benchmarked against specialized\nanalytical calculations done for the Ohmic spectral density with Drude cutoff\nand against the numerically exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion technique.",

However,\nexisting research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of\nthese models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their\nself-reflection pattern (also termed \"Aha moment\") and the interconnections\nacross diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the\nreasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,\nDeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge\nparadigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their\nfinal outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based\nquestions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step\nproblem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both\nthe coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research\nresults uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and\nexploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning\nprocess. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among\nthese models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the\nreliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their\nthinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1.

This study investigates how on-demand LLM-generated\nexplanatory feedback influences learning in seven scenario-based tutor training\nlessons. Analyzing over 2,600 lesson completions from 885 tutor learners, we\ncompare posttest performance among learners across three groups: learners who\nreceived feedback generated by gpt-3.5-turbo, those who declined it, and those\nwithout access. All groups received non-LLM corrective feedback. To address\npotential selection bias-where higher-performing learners may be more inclined\nto use LLM feedback-we applied propensity scoring. Learners with a higher\npredicted likelihood of engaging with LLM feedback scored significantly higher\nat posttest than those with lower propensity. After adjusting for this effect,\ntwo out of seven lessons showed statistically significant learning benefits\nfrom LLM feedback with standardized effect sizes of 0.28 and 0.33. These\nmoderate effects suggest that the effectiveness of LLM feedback depends on the\nlearners' tendency to seek support. Importantly, LLM feedback did not\nsignificantly increase completion time, and learners overwhelmingly rated it as\nhelpful. These findings highlight LLM feedback's potential as a low-cost and\nscalable way to improve learning on open-ended tasks, particularly in existing\nsystems already providing feedback without LLMs. This work contributes open\ndatasets, LLM prompts, and rubrics to support reproducibility.",

Extensive numerical simulations performed by considering\nvarious trajectories and multiple initial conditions demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the controller in maintaining tracking performance without\nviolating actuator constraints.

    "abstract": "Spatial dependence, referring to the correlation between variable values\nobserved at different geographic locations, is one of the most fundamental\ncharacteristics of spatial data. The presence of spatial dependence violates\nthe classical statistical assumption of independent and identically distributed\nobservations and implies a high degree of information redundancy within spatial\ndatasets. However, this redundancy can also be interpreted as structured\ninformation, which has been widely leveraged in spatial modeling, prediction,\nand explanation tasks. With the rise of geospatial big data and the rapid\nadvancement of deep learning and large models, effectively modeling and\ncharacterizing spatial dependence has become essential for enhancing the\nperformance of spatial analysis and uncovering latent spatial processes. From a\ndata-driven perspective, this study proposes a novel interpretation: spatial\ndependence can be understood as the contribution of geographic location --\nspecifically, latitude and longitude -- to the observed variation in target\nvariables. To validate this hypothesis, we conduct simulation experiments in\nwhich data are generated based on known spatial processes. We train machine\nlearning models to predict variable values using only coordinate information.\nSubsequently, XAI techniques are employed to quantify the contribution of\nspatial features. The resulting importance scores are then compared with local\nindicators of spatial association (LISA). Across a range of spatial process\nsettings, we observe consistently high correlations (greater than 0.94) between\ncoordinate-based contributions and LISA values. These findings offer a new\ndata-driven perspective on spatial dependence, bridging traditional spatial\nstatistical approaches with modern machine learning techniques.",

MPPO unifies loss objectives for\nboth online and offline samples and introduces an implicit constraint to\napproximate demonstrator policies by adjusting the empirical distribution of\nsamples. Empirical results across environments of varying scales demonstrate\nthat MPPO achieves proficiency levels comparable to, or even superior to, pure\nonline algorithms while preserving demonstrators' play styles. This work\npresents an effective approach for generating highly proficient and diverse\ngame agents, ultimately contributing to more engaging gameplay experiences.",

To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling\ncriteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts\nframework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores\nto surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization\nperformance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting\nthe appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current\noptimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms\nseveral state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases.

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: High-throughput multi-omics technologies have\nproven invaluable for elucidating disease mechanisms and enabling early\ndiagnosis. However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a\nsignificant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially\nleading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our\napproach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.\nIn three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a\nsingle omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our\nmethod maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and\npreserves essential biological insights.",

Existing prompt-driven UDA methods\ntypically rely on large vision-language models and require full access to\nsource-domain data during adaptation, limiting their applicability. In this\nwork, we propose Prmpt2Adpt, a lightweight and efficient zero-shot domain\nadaptation framework built around a teacher-student paradigm guided by\nprompt-based feature alignment. At the core of our method is a distilled and\nfine-tuned CLIP model, used as the frozen backbone of a Faster R-CNN teacher. A\nsmall set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain\nsemantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven\nInstance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to\nbriefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher\nthen generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly\nadaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset\ndemonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared\nto state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x\nfaster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and\nscalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains.",

This\nstudy compares multiple discrete choice model architectures, including\nmultinomial logit and mixed logit specifications, as well as models\nincorporating BoxCox and exponential utility transformations for the\ndeprivation time attribute. The analysis examines heterogeneity in deprivation\nvaluation through sociodemographic interactions, particularly across income\ngroups.

Unfortunately, existing methods of\nsemantic analysis based on audit logs have low granularity, only reaching the\nsystem call level, making it difficult to effectively classify highly covert\nbehaviors. Additionally, existing works mainly match audit log streams with\nrule knowledge bases describing behaviors, which heavily rely on expertise and\nlack the ability to detect unknown attacks and provide interpretive\ndescriptions. In this paper, we propose SmartGuard, an automated method that\ncombines abstracted behaviors from audit event semantics with large language\nmodels. SmartGuard extracts specific behaviors (function level) from incoming\nsystem logs and constructs a knowledge graph, divides events by threads, and\ncombines event summaries with graph embeddings to achieve information diagnosis\nand provide explanatory narratives through large language models. Our\nevaluation shows that SmartGuard achieves an average F1 score of 96\\% in\nassessing malicious behaviors and demonstrates good scalability across multiple\nmodels and unknown attacks. It also possesses excellent fine-tuning\ncapabilities, allowing experts to assist in timely system updates.",

This begs the question of\nwhether transformers represent latent structures as part of their computation\nor whether they take shortcuts to solve the problem. Prior mechanistic work on\nICL does not address this question because it does not sufficiently examine the\nrelationship between the learned representation and the latent concept, and the\nconsidered problem settings often involve only single-step reasoning. In this\nwork, we examine how transformers disentangle and use latent concepts. We show\nthat in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model\nsuccessfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept\ncomposition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find\nlow-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics\nthe underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our\nunderstanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide\nevidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent\nconcepts in ICL tasks.",

Among these\nresearch topics, Attack Graph Construction (AGC) is essential for visualizing\nand understanding the potential attack paths of threat events from CTI reports.\nExisting approaches primarily construct the attack graphs purely from the\ntextual data to reveal the logical threat relationships between entities within\nthe attack behavioral sequence. However, they typically overlook the specific\nthreat information inherent in visual modalities, which preserves the key\nthreat details from inherently-multimodal CTI report. Therefore, we enhance the\neffectiveness of attack graph construction by analyzing visual information\nthrough Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a\nnovel framework, MM-AttacKG, which can effectively extract key information from\nthreat images and integrate it into attack graph construction, thereby\nenhancing the comprehensiveness and accuracy of attack graphs. It first employs\na threat image parsing module to extract critical threat information from\nimages and generate descriptions using MLLMs. Subsequently, it builds an\niterative question-answering pipeline tailored for image parsing to refine the\nunderstanding of threat images. Finally, it achieves content-level integration\nbetween attack graphs and image-based answers through MLLMs, completing threat\ninformation enhancement.

    "abstract": "Traditional graph representations are insufficient for modelling real-world\nphenomena involving multi-entity interactions, such as collaborative projects\nor protein complexes, necessitating the use of hypergraphs. While hypergraphs\npreserve the intrinsic nature of such complex relationships, existing models\noften overlook temporal evolution in relational data. To address this, we\nintroduce a first-order autoregressive (i.e. AR(1)) model for dynamic\nnon-uniform hypergraphs. This is the first dynamic hypergraph model with\nprovable theoretical guarantees, explicitly defining the temporal evolution of\nhyperedge presence through transition probabilities that govern persistence and\nchange dynamics. This framework provides closed-form expressions for key\nprobabilistic properties and facilitates straightforward maximum-likelihood\ninference with uniform error bounds and asymptotic normality, along with a\npermutation-based diagnostic test. We also consider an AR(1) hypergraph\nstochastic block model (HSBM), where a novel Laplacian enables exact and\nefficient latent community recovery via a spectral clustering algorithm.\nFurthermore, we develop a likelihood-based change-point estimator for the HSBM\nto detect structural breaks within the time series. The efficacy and practical\nvalue of our methods are comprehensively demonstrated through extensive\nsimulation studies and compelling applications to a primary school interaction\ndata set and the Enron email corpus, revealing insightful community structures\nand significant temporal changes.",

    "abstract": "Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking\nused to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model.\nHowever, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal\ndiversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and\ncomputational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware\nrecursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking\nlevels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally\nprunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without\nexcessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian\nnoise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against\nstrict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions\nare explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE)\nfilter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class),\nlinear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and\nthe top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the\nstrongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild\nOOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the\nstrict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no\ncompression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached\n98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing\nruntime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression.\nThese findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and\nperiodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets\nin aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive\nensembling with tractable complexity.",

Constructing chain-of-thought (CoT)\ntraining data is essential for bolstering the reasoning abilities of medical\nMLLMs. However, existing approaches exhibit a deficiency in offering a\ncomprehensive framework for searching and evaluating effective reasoning paths\ntowards critical diagnosis. To address this challenge, we propose Mentor-Intern\nCollaborative Search (MICS), a novel reasoning-path searching scheme to\ngenerate rigorous and effective medical CoT data. MICS first leverages mentor\nmodels to initialize the reasoning, one step at a time, then prompts each\nintern model to continue the thinking along those initiated paths, and finally\nselects the optimal reasoning path according to the overall reasoning\nperformance of multiple intern models. The reasoning performance is determined\nby an MICS-Score, which assesses the quality of generated reasoning paths.\nEventually, we construct MMRP, a multi-task medical reasoning dataset with\nranked difficulty, and Chiron-o1, a new medical MLLM devised via a curriculum\nlearning strategy, with robust visual question-answering and generalizable\nreasoning capabilities.

In this work we present a search for $^{77}$Ge decays in the full\nGERDA Phase II data set. A delayed coincidence method was employed to identify\nthe decay of $^{77}$Ge via the isomeric state of $^{77}$As (9/2$^+$, 475 keV,\n${T_{1/2} = 114}\\,\\mu $s, $^{77\\mathrm{m}}$As). New digital signal processing\nmethods were employed to select and analyze pile-up signals. No signal was\nobserved, and an upper limit on the production rate of was set at $<0.216$\nnuc/(kg$\\cdot$yr) (90% CL). This corresponds to a total production rate of\n$^{77}$Ge and $^{77\\mathrm{m}}$Ge of $<0.38$ nuc/(kg$\\cdot$ yr) (90% CL),\nassuming equal production rates. A previous Monte Carlo study predicted a value\nfor in-situ $^{77}$Ge and $^{77\\mathrm{m}}$Ge production of (0.21$\\pm$0.07)\nnuc/(kg$\\cdot$yr), a prediction that is now further corroborated by our\nexperimental limit. Moreover, tagging the isomeric state of $^{77\\mathrm{m}}$As\ncan be utilised to further suppress the $^{77}$Ge background. Considering the\nsimilar experimental configurations of LEGEND-1000 and GERDA, the cosmogenic\nbackground in LEGEND-1000 at LNGS is estimated to remain at a sub-dominant\nlevel.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the structural complexity and semantic ambiguity in\nstakeholder interactions within the Education-Industry Integration (EII)\nsystem. The scarcity of real interview data, absence of structured variable\nmodeling, and lack of interpretability in inference mechanisms have limited the\nanalytical accuracy and policy responsiveness of EII research. To resolve these\nchallenges, we propose a structural modeling paradigm based on the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST) synthetic data quality framework,\nfocusing on consistency, authenticity, and traceability. We design a five-layer\narchitecture that includes prompt-driven synthetic dialogue generation, a\nstructured variable system covering skills, institutional, and emotional\ndimensions, dependency and causal path modeling, graph-based structure design,\nand an interactive inference engine. Empirical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the approach using a 15-segment synthetic corpus, with 41,597\ntokens, 127 annotated variables, and 820 semantic relationship triples. The\nmodel exhibits strong structural consistency (Krippendorff alpha = 0.83),\nconstruct validity (RMSEA = 0.048, CFI = 0.93), and semantic alignment (mean\ncosine similarity > 0.78 via BERT). A key causal loop is identified: system\nmismatch leads to emotional frustration, reduced participation, skill gaps, and\nrecurrence of mismatch, revealing a structural degradation cycle. This research\nintroduces the first NIST-compliant AI modeling framework for stakeholder\nsystems and provides a foundation for policy simulation, curriculum design, and\ncollaborative strategy modeling.",

Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from\nrobustness benchmarks to quantify progress.

Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited\nfor evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent\nmodels show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that\nit is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better\nat OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test\ndistortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a\nbenchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion\ntypes specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as\nLAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that\nthe LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models,\nincluding MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o.

Quantum theory, however, permits\nsuperpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which\ncan provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such\nphenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted\nto refuting local realism and confirming quantum entanglement. To date,\ndemonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called\nthe quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or\nsemi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced\na Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of\nindefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this\nverification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we\nmeasure a value of $1.8328 \\pm 0.0045$, which is 18 standard deviations above\nthe classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a\ndevice-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the\npresence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards\nthe device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides\na context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the\nverification of indefinite causal order.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear clustering, as a quantum phase transition phenomenon governed by\nstrong interactions, exhibits characteristics that are highly sensitive to the\nspecific features of nuclear forces. Here, we examine how nuclear deformation\nand tensor forces influence $\\alpha$-cluster formation in light nuclei. The\naxially deformed relativistic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov model is utilized to\ninvestigate the clustering structure of the $^{20}$Ne nucleus, at both the\nground state and the excited state with a superdeformed prolate. The nuclear\nbinding energies and the canonical single particle levels are obtained at\ndifferent quadruple deformation, and the role of tensor force embedded in the\nFock diagram of $\\pi$-pseudovector ($\\pi$-PV) coupling is revealed. It is shown\nthat the level branches from the degenerated spherical orbits at the deformed\nprolate case are enlarged due to the extra contribution from pion-exchanged\ntensor force. Correspondingly, the excitation energy in this superdeformed\nprolate state is reduced due to the noncentral tensor interaction, leading to a\npredicted value which is much closer to the referred threshold for the\n$2\\alpha$ decay mode of $^{20}$Ne. Possible $\\alpha$-clustering configurations\nin $^{20}$Ne are then characterized by examining the nucleonic localization\nfunction. Although the contribution to the ground state is relatively small,\nthe density profile and nucleonic localization are significantly changed by the\npion tensor force for the superdeformed prolate excited state, as further\nevidenced by characterising the level mixing in the spherical basis components.\nThe results reveal the extra role of the tensor force, correlated to the\nevolved single-particle levels with nuclear deformation, in the formation and\nstability of nuclear clustering.",

In this first\npaper, we investigate a base level model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes\naround this dead-active zone interface, using five three-dimensional global\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations in the zero-net flux regime. We employ\nphysically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion,\nalongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a hot disc and cool\ncorona. Our results show that, first, large-scale coherent poloidal magnetic\nfield loops form in the magnetorotational instability active region. These\nloops lead to the accumulation of tightly wound magnetic flux at the\ndisc-corona temperature transition, driving strong, localised accretion flows\nin the surface layers of the active region. Second, an axisymmetric pressure\nmaximum, that extends across multiple disc scale heights, develops as a result\nof outward mass transport from the active region. This triggers the Rossby wave\ninstability and leads to the development of anticyclonic vortices, though their\ncoherence is weakened due to the turbulent dynamics at the interface. Third,\nthe dead zone develops magnetic field with a distinct morphology, likely\nresulting from the outward diffusion of large-scale poloidal loops in the\nactive zone. This self-consistently generated field exhibits a vertical\nstructure consistent with that required to drive accretion in the inner dead\nzone under the weak magnetic wind paradigm. In the second paper in the series,\nwe extend this work to the vertical-net flux regime, where global magnetic flux\ntransport and magnetically driven outflows become dynamically significant.",

Furthermore, there are explicit relations connecting the quantum\nstates to their corresponding dual Euclidean AdS geometries, in line with the\nHartle-Hawking (HH) construction. The ground state therefore corresponds to the\ndominant saddle point under trivial conditions on the asymptotic boundary,\nwhich is the exact Euclidean AdS geometry. In contrast, the situation in de\nSitter spacetime differs significantly, as there is no natural region analogous\nto the AdS boundary. Thus, the Hartle Hawking approach precisely defines the\nground state as a path integral over smooth (Euclidean) geometries ending on a\nspatial Cauchy surface, with \\textit{no} additional boundary or past\nsingularity, known as the no boundary proposal.\n  In this work, we revisit the no boundary proposal to describe excited states\nwithin the framework of de Sitter Holography. Specifically, we investigate the\npossibility of defining a family of excited states by introducing an additional\nboundary in the Euclidean region and imposing arbitrary Dirichlet boundary\nconditions on it. As a result, we demonstrate that the computation of $n$ point\ncorrelation functions is consistent with the presence of excited states, and\nfurthermore, show that cosmological late-time observables in these states\nundergo non-trivial modifications. This study may have significant implications\nfor the development of the holographic dictionary for de Sitter spacetimes.",

Third, we propose Iterative Doppler Refinement to\nenhance the model's adaptability to density variations and ghosting effects.\nExtensive evaluations show that SDDiff significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by achieving 59% higher in EVE accuracy, 4X greater\nin valid generation density while boosting PCE effectiveness and reliability.",

Although multi-tracer PET imaging can provide\nsupplementary information of radiotracers that are sensitive to physiological\nfunction changes, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of\nphysiological and pathological states, the gamma-photon pairs generated by\npositron annihilation reactions of different tracers in PET imaging have the\nsame energy, making it difficult to distinguish the tracer signals. In this\nstudy, a multi-latent space guided texture conditional diffusion transformer\nmodel (MS-CDT) is proposed for PET tracer separation. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to use texture condition and multi-latent\nspace for tracer separation in PET imaging. The proposed model integrates\ndiffusion and transformer architectures into a unified optimization framework,\nwith the novel addition of texture masks as conditional inputs to enhance image\ndetails. By leveraging multi-latent space prior derived from different tracers,\nthe model captures multi-level feature representations, aiming to balance\ncomputational efficiency and detail preservation. The texture masks, serving as\nconditional guidance, help the model focus on salient structural patterns,\nthereby improving the extraction and utilization of fine-grained image\ntextures. When combined with the diffusion transformer backbone, this\nconditioning mechanism contributes to more accurate and robust tracer\nseparation. To evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed MS-CDT is compared with\nseveral advanced methods on two types of 3D PET datasets: brain and chest\nscans.

Worldwide data indicate that 26.693 babies out of 1,000\nbirths die, according to Macro Trades. To reduce this number, early prediction\nof endangered babies is crucial. Such prediction enables the opportunity to\ntake ample care of the child and mother so that early child death can be\navoided. In this context, machine learning was used to determine whether a\nnewborn baby is at risk. To train the predictive model, historical data of 1.4\nmillion newborns was used. Machine learning and deep learning techniques such\nas logical regression, K-nearest neighbor, random forest classifier, extreme\ngradient boosting (XGBoost), convolutional neural network, and long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) were implemented using the dataset to identify the most accurate\nmodel for predicting neonatal mortality. Among the machine learning algorithms,\nXGBoost and random forest classifier achieved the best accuracy with 94%, while\namong the deep learning models, LSTM delivered the highest accuracy with 99%.\nTherefore, using LSTM appears to be the most suitable approach to predict\nwhether precautionary measures for a child are necessary.",

Our method 'Lagom' is a cornerstone of\nLMQ-Sketch for low-latency global querying (<100 us), combining freshness,\ntimeliness, and accuracy with a low memory footprint and high throughput (>2B\nupdates/s). We analyze and evaluate the accuracy of Lagom, which builds on a\nsimple geometric argument and efficiently combines work distribution with\nsynchronization for proper concurrency semantics -- monotonicity of operations\nand intermediate value linearizability. Comparing with state-of-the-art methods\n(which, as mentioned, only cover either mixed queries or concurrency),\nLMQ-Sketch shows highly competitive throughput, with additional accuracy\nguarantees and concurrency semantics, while also reducing the required memory\nbudget by an order of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries of Ultra Faint dwarf galaxies (UFG's) infalling onto the\nMilky Way, namely Leo K \\& M at $r \\simeq 450$kpc, considerably strengthens the\ncase that UFG's constitute a distinct galaxy class that is inherently smaller,\nfainter and metal poor compared to the classical dwarf spheroidals (dSph). This\ndistinction is at odds with the inherent continuity of galaxy halo masses\nformed under scale-free gravity for any standard dark matter model. Here we\nshow that distinct galaxy classes do evolve in cosmological simulations of\nmultiple light bosons representing the 'Axiverse' proposal of String Theory,\nwhere a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many\ndecades in mass. In this context, the\n  observed UFG class we show corresponds to a relatively heavy boson of\n$3\\times 10^{-21}$eV, including Leo K \\& M, whereas a lighter axion of\n$10^{-22}$eV comprises the bulk of dark matter in all larger galaxies including\nthe dSph's. Although Leo M is larger in size than Leo K, we predict its\nvelocity dispersion to be smaller $\\simeq 1.7$km/s, compared to $\\simeq\n4.5$km/s for Leo K, since soliton cores are required by the Uncertainty\nPrinciple to be wider at lower momentum. This scenario can be definitively\ntested using millisecond pulsars close to the Galactic center, where the\nCompton frequencies of the heavy and light bosons imprint monotone timing\nresiduals that may be detected by SKA on timescales of approximately 1 week and\n4 months, respectively.",

Control of the\nshift involves both its magnitude and direction. Although resonance-enhanced GH\nshift under reflection has significantly expanded and facilitated its\nobservation and application, implementations in transmission scenarios remain\nscarce. More importantly, discussions on the direction of the GH shift are\nrare, and the associated degree of freedom for controlling directional\nasymmetry has not been fully explored. To address these issues, we discuss a\ncontrol framework for enhancing transmitted GH shifts from symmetric to\nasymmetric. A design with complete degrees of freedom from symmetric shift\nenhancement to unidirectional shift enhancement is demonstrated in transmission\nscenarios. The control dimension associated with directionality significantly\nenhances the flexibility of beam shift control, with broad application\nprospects in scenarios such as high-sensitivity sensing, precision measurement,\noptical isolators, and asymmetric optical switches.",

    "abstract": "Network Calculus (NC) is a versatile methodology based on min-plus algebra to\nderive worst-case per-flow performance bounds in networked systems with many\nconcurrent flows. In particular, NC can analyze many scheduling disciplines;\nyet, somewhat surprisingly, an aggregate FIFO server is a notoriously hard case\ndue to its min-plus non-linearity. A resort is to represent the FIFO residual\nservice by a family of functions with a free parameter instead of just a single\ncurve. For simple token-bucket arrival curves, literature provides optimal\nchoices for that free parameter to minimize delay and backlog bounds. In this\npaper, we tackle the challenge of more general arrival curves than just token\nbuckets. In particular, we derive residual service curves resulting in minimal\nbacklog bounds for general piecewise-linear arrival curves. To that end, we\nfirst show that a backlog bound can always be calculated at a breakpoint of\neither the arrival curve of the flow of interest or its residual service curve.\nFurther, we define a set of curves that characterize the backlog for a fixed\nbreakpoint, depending on the free parameter of the residual service curve. We\nshow that the backlog-minimizing residual service curve family parameter\ncorresponds to the largest intersection of those curves with the arrival curve.\nIn more complex scenarios finding this largest intersection can become\ninefficient as the search space grows in the number of flows. Therefore, we\npresent an efficient heuristic that finds, in many cases, the optimal parameter\nor at least a close conservative approximation. This heuristic is evaluated in\nterms of accuracy and execution time. Finally, we utilize these\nbacklog-minimizing residual service curves to enhance the DiscoDNC tool and\nobserve considerable reductions in the corresponding backlog bounds.",

We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of a joint state space and a joint language, in which the subjective\nstate spaces of each agent, and their individual languages, may be embedded.\nThis approach allows us to compare languages with respect to their\nexpressiveness and thus, with respect to the properties of the associated state\nspace.",

Crucially, these compressed patterns\nonly become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive\nfeedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately\ncatalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal\nfeatures--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we\ndemonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium\nfor preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference\nto goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human\nculture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.\nTherefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human\nintelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful\nhypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework\npositions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to\ngenerate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human\ninterpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics\nand norms.",

We show that increasing model width is\nonly beneficial when it reduces the amount of feature learning, yielding more\nlaziness. Using the framework of dynamical mean field theory, we then study the\ninfinite width dynamics of the model in the feature learning regime and\ncharacterize CF, extending prior theoretical results limited to the lazy\nregime. We study the intricate relationship between feature learning, task\nnon-stationarity, and forgetting, finding that high feature learning is only\nbeneficial with highly similar tasks. We identify a transition modulated by\ntask similarity where the model exits an effectively lazy regime with low\nforgetting to enter a rich regime with significant forgetting.

    "abstract": "Robot applications, comprising independent components that mutually\npublish/subscribe messages, are built on inter-process communication (IPC)\nmiddleware such as Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). In large-scale ROS 2\nsystems like autonomous driving platforms, true zero-copy communication --\neliminating serialization and deserialization -- is crucial for efficiency and\nreal-time performance. However, existing true zero-copy middleware solutions\nlack widespread adoption as they fail to meet three essential requirements: 1)\nSupport for all ROS 2 message types including unsized ones; 2) Minimal\nmodifications to existing application code; 3) Selective implementation of\nzero-copy communication between specific nodes while maintaining conventional\ncommunication mechanisms for other inter-node communications including\ninter-host node communications. This first requirement is critical, as\nproduction-grade ROS 2 projects like Autoware rely heavily on unsized message\ntypes throughout their codebase to handle diverse use cases (e.g., various\nsensors), and depend on the broader ROS 2 ecosystem, where unsized message\ntypes are pervasive in libraries. The remaining requirements facilitate\nseamless integration with existing projects. While IceOryx middleware, a\npractical true zero-copy solution, meets all but the first requirement, other\nstudies achieving the first requirement fail to satisfy the remaining criteria.\nThis paper presents Agnocast, a true zero-copy IPC framework applicable to ROS\n2 C++ on Linux that fulfills all these requirements. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that Agnocast maintains constant IPC overhead regardless of\nmessage size, even for unsized message types. In Autoware PointCloud\nPreprocessing, Agnocast achieves a 16% improvement in average response time and\na 25% improvement in worst-case response time.",

The\nsocio-economic structure of the municipalities is synthesized into\ninterpretable composite indices, which are further aggregated by means of\nPrincipal Components Analysis in order to reduce dimensionality and construct a\nunivariate external field compatible with the Ising framework. Monte Carlo\nsimulations via parallel computing are conducted adopting a Simulated Annealing\nvariant of the classic Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

Model consistency is assessed both in terms of energy\nstability and the likelihood of these configurations. The comparison between\nobserved configuration and simulated ones is crucial in the analysis of\nmultivariate phenomena, concomitantly accounting for territorial interactions.\nModel uncertainty in estimating the probability of each municipality being a\ncentral hub or peripheral area is quantified by adopting the model-agnostic\nConformal Prediction framework which yields adaptive intervals with guaranteed\ncoverage.

In this study, we\nincorporate experimental constraints from $\\Xi$ hypernuclear physics on top of\n$\\Lambda$ hyperons considered in \\citet{Sun2023APJ942.55}. Specifically, based\non updated measurements of hyperon separation energies from $\\Xi$ hypernuclear\nexperiments, sets of $\\Xi N$ effective interactions are constructed and a\nlinear correlation between their scalar ($\\sigma$) and vector ($\\omega$)\ncoupling strength ratios is proposed as a constraint derived from $\\Xi$\nhypernuclear physics. Together with experimental correlations and astronomical\nobservational data, four types of analyses are performed to constrain\nhyperon-nucleon interactions and the properties of hyperon stars. Compared to\nthe vector $\\omega$ meson-hyperon coupling, the introduction of linear\ncorrelations in hypernuclear physics imposes a more substantial constraint on\nthe scalar $\\sigma$ meson-hyperon coupling, significantly enhancing its\ncoupling strength and thereby ensuring the stiffness of the equation of state,\nhighlighting the crucial role of hypernuclear studies in solving the hyperon\npuzzle problem. Consequently, a maximum mass of around $2M_{\\odot}$ can be\nachieved with all five interactions considered in this study under the combined\nconstraints from astronomical observations and nuclear physics.

Floating-point computations are subject to small\nrounding errors, which can affect both the correctness of the result and the\neffectiveness of the DD's compression.

To generalize this\nconcept, we develop a continuous Frobenius norm of the difference (CFND) as a\ncontinuous analog of the FND and derive its analytical expression.

Although current deep learning\napproaches demonstrate reconstruction potential, they struggle to overcome\nerror accumulation caused by fiber mode drift and lack sufficient environmental\nadaptability. To address this, the present study proposes an adaptive\ntransmission framework named Residual Reed-Solomon Dynamic Network (RRSDN),\nwhich integrates Reed-Solomon (RS) error correction coding with deep residual\nlearning forming a closed-loop system that jointly optimizes encoding,\ntransmission, and reconstruction, to tackle the key challenges of mode\ninstability and error accumulation in dynamic scattering channels.\nExperimentally, high-fidelity real-time transmission of a 16*16 pixel video\nstream (H.265 compressed) with zero frame loss and 100% symbol accuracy was\nachieved under conditions of a 100-meter MMF with manually applied disturbances\nand no temperature control. This work proposes a solution for stable optical\ntransmission in complex channels. Plus, it integrates error correction coding\nwith neural network training, laying the foundation for adaptive optical\nsystems in longer-distance and more complex scenarios.",

The disappearance of this feature below 100 K signals orbital freezing\nand the onset of a glass-like orbital state. HAXPES measurements show multiplet\nsplitting and charge-transfer satellite features in the Co and Fe 2p core\nlevels, indicating mixed valence states and strong electron correlations. XANES\nanalysis reveals hybridized p-d states and local coordination distortions.\nTemperature-dependent EXAFS measurements indicate increasing local\ndisorder-particularly in Fe-O and Fe-Fe octahedral bonds as evidenced by\nenhanced Debye-Waller factors. These distortions, attributed to cation\nredistribution and oxygen vacancies, are static and asymmetric, primarily\naffecting the octahedral sublattice. Notably, signatures of cooperative\nJahn-Teller distortions emerge in the intermediate temperature range (200-100\nK) and disappear upon further cooling. Raman spectroscopy further supports\nthese findings, revealing phonon anomalies and enhanced spin-phonon coupling in\nthe same temperature range. Magnetic measurements indicate spin reorientation\nand exchange interaction anomalies that align with the orbital behaviour.\nTogether, these results hint at a frustrated orbital state in CoFe2O4 possibly\ninvolving cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions, disrupted long-range coherence,\nand orbital glass behaviour offering new insights into the coupling of orbital,\nspin, and lattice degrees of freedom in spinel systems.",

Learning similarities among\nmultiple time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for\ndownstream analysis. Due to the complex temporal dynamics of the\nevent-triggered time series, it often remains unclear which similarity metric\nis appropriate for security-related tasks, such as anomaly detection and\nclustering. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised\nlearning framework that is capable of learning similarities among a set of\nevent-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the\nproposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-resolution\nsequential autoencoders and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively\nlearn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the\nobtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for the explanation.

Our study is based on the\nnotion of \"ensemble of MCs\", introduced in our previous work. The MCs are\nmodeled by use of the \"ensemble abstract representative member\": a spherically\nsymmetric, isotropic and isothermal MC which accretes radially matter from its\nsurroundings. Applying the equations of hydrodynamics to a self-gravitating\nisothermal spherical gas cloud, we obtain a system of 2 first-order non-linear\npartial differential equations, which govern the evolution of two unknown\nfields: the exponent of density profile and the accretion velocity. Assuming a\nsteady-state flow, we get approximate solutions using the method of\nleading-order terms. Far from the cloud centre the obtained density profile is\n$\\varrho=\\ell^{-2}$ and the accretion velocity is constant, while near to the\ncentre $\\varrho=\\ell^{-3/2}$ and $v_{\\rm a}\\propto\\ell^{-1/2}$. Through our\ndynamical equations, the obtained solutions coincide completely with those\nfound using the equation of energy conservation of a fluid element (in our\nprevious work). Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid\nelement, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre\nare in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or\ntranssonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow)\nor unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the\naccretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally,\nunder the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with\n$\\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the\ndensity scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an\nattractor. Hence this value should be observable in dense MCs.",

Survival trees, which predict the\ntiming of singular events using censored historical data, are typically built\nthrough heuristic approaches.

We propose a new soft survival tree\nmodel (SST), with a soft splitting rule at each branch node, trained via a\nnonlinear optimization formulation amenable to decomposition. Since SSTs\nprovide for every input vector a specific survival function associated to a\nsingle leaf node, they satisfy the conditional computation property and inherit\nthe related benefits. SST and the training formulation combine flexibility with\ninterpretability: any smooth survival function (parametric, semiparametric, or\nnonparametric) estimated through maximum likelihood can be used, and each leaf\nnode of an SST yields a cluster of distinct survival functions which are\nassociated to the data points routed to it. Numerical experiments on 15\nwell-known datasets show that SSTs, with parametric and spline-based\nsemiparametric survival functions, trained using an adaptation of the\nnode-based decomposition algorithm proposed by Consolo et al.

In all established\nsynchronization phase transitions so far, a stable synchronous state is\nconnected to a stable incoherent state: For continuous transitions, stable\nsynchrony directly connects to stable incoherence at a critical point, whereas\nfor discontinuous transitions, stable synchrony is connected to stable\nincoherence via an additional unstable branch. Here we present a novel type of\ntransition between synchrony and incoherence where the synchronous state does\nnot connect to the state of incoherence. We uncover such transitions in the\ncomplexified Kuramoto model with their variables and coupling strength\nparameter analytically continued. Deriving a self-consistency equation for a\nquaternion order parameter that we propose helps to mathematically pin down the\nmechanisms underlying this transition type. Local numerical analysis suggests\nthat the transition is linked to a Hopf bifurcation destabilizing synchrony, in\ncontrast to branching point bifurcations established for the transition between\nsynchrony and incoherence so far.",

    "abstract": "Semiparametric Bayesian networks (SPBNs) integrate parametric and\nnon-parametric probabilistic models, offering flexibility in learning complex\ndata distributions from samples. In particular, kernel density estimators\n(KDEs) are employed for the non-parametric component. Under the assumption of\ndata normality, the normal rule is used to learn the bandwidth matrix for the\nKDEs in SPBNs. This matrix is the key hyperparameter that controls the\ntrade-off between bias and variance. However, real-world data often deviates\nfrom normality, potentially leading to suboptimal density estimation and\nreduced predictive performance. This paper first establishes the theoretical\nframework for the application of state-of-the-art bandwidth selectors and\nsubsequently evaluates their impact on SPBN performance. We explore the\napproaches of cross-validation and plug-in selectors, assessing their\neffectiveness in enhancing the learning capability and applicability of SPBNs.\nTo support this investigation, we have extended the open-source package\nPyBNesian for SPBNs with the additional bandwidth selection techniques and\nconducted extensive experimental analyses. Our results demonstrate that the\nproposed bandwidth selectors leverage increasing information more effectively\nthan the normal rule, which, despite its robustness, stagnates with more data.\nIn particular, unbiased cross-validation generally outperforms the normal rule,\nhighlighting its advantage in high sample size scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Camera calibration using planar targets has been widely favored, and two\ntypes of control points have been mainly considered as measurements: the\ncorners of the checkerboard and the centroid of circles. Since a centroid is\nderived from numerous pixels, the circular pattern provides more precise\nmeasurements than the checkerboard. However, the existing projection model of\ncircle centroids is biased under lens distortion, resulting in low performance.\nTo surmount this limitation, we propose an unbiased projection model of the\ncircular pattern and demonstrate its superior accuracy compared to the\ncheckerboard. Complementing this, we introduce uncertainty into circular\npatterns to enhance calibration robustness and completeness. Defining centroid\nuncertainty improves the performance of calibration components, including\npattern detection, optimization, and evaluation metrics. We also provide\nguidelines for performing good camera calibration based on the evaluation\nmetric. The core concept of this approach is to model the boundary points of a\ntwo-dimensional shape as a Markov random field, considering its connectivity.\nThe shape distribution is propagated to the centroid uncertainty through an\nappropriate shape representation based on the Green theorem. Consequently, the\nresulting framework achieves marked gains in calibration accuracy and\nrobustness.

Applying FL to FitTech\npresents unique challenges, such as data imbalance, lack of labelled data,\nheterogeneous user activity patterns, and trade-offs between personalization\nand generalization.

Previously, we used this information for a few observed systems\nto propose a new mass-transfer type, based on an angular momentum balance.\n  Our aim is to investigate if stable mass transfer instead of the angular\nmomentum prescription is consistent with the observed double helium white dwarf\nmasses.\n  We reconstruct the progenitor evolution of observed double helium white\ndwarfs using the core mass -- radius relation and evaluate if the periods at\nthe start of the second phases of mass transfer are consistent with the outcome\nof stable mass transfer. More generally, we calculate the mass distribution of\ndouble helium white dwarfs for three different progenitors scenarios: double\ncommon envelope (with parameter $\\alpha \\lambda$), angular momentum\nprescription (with parameter $\\gamma$) and stable mass transfer.\n  We find that the observed systems are generally not consistent with stable\nmass transfer. Stable mass transfer leads to a tight correlation between the\ntwo white dwarf masses in a binary that is not consistent with the observed\nmass distribution. Double common envelope evolution is a particularly poor fit\nto the observations. The angular momentum prescription can populate the\nobserved mass distribution, but not perfectly.\n  We conclude that the first phase of mass transfer initiated on the red giant\nbranch in low-mass systems does not generally proceed as stable mass transfer\nnor as common envelope, and thus is poorly understood.

    "abstract": "Many real-world multivariate time series are collected from a network of\nphysical objects embedded with software, electronics, and sensors. The\nquasi-periodic signals generated by these objects often follow a similar\nrepetitive and periodic pattern, but have variations in the period, and come in\ndifferent lengths caused by timing (synchronization) errors. Given a multitude\nof such quasi-periodic time series, can we build machine learning models to\nidentify those time series that behave differently from the majority of the\nobservations? In addition, can the models help human experts to understand how\nthe decision was made? We propose a sequence to Gaussian Mixture Model\n(seq2GMM) framework. The overarching goal of this framework is to identify\nunusual and interesting time series within a network time series database. We\nfurther develop a surrogate-based optimization algorithm that can efficiently\ntrain the seq2GMM model. Seq2GMM exhibits strong empirical performance on a\nplurality of public benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art anomaly\ndetection techniques by a significant margin. We also theoretically analyze the\nconvergence property of the proposed training algorithm and provide numerical\nresults to substantiate our theoretical claims.",

    "abstract": "Breaking the intrinsic chirality of quasiparticles in graphene enables the\nemergence of new and intriguing phases. One such paradigmatic example is the\nbond density wave, which leads to a Kekul\\'{e}-ordered structure and underpins\nexotic electronic states where electron-phonon interactions can play a\nfundamental role. Here, it is shown that the relevant physics of these\ncorrelations can be resolved locally, according to the behavior of interatomic\ncharacteristics. For this purpose a robust distance-dependent framework for\ndescribing electronic structure of graphene with Kekul\\'{e} bond order is\npresented. Given this insight, the strength of electron-phonon interactions is\nfound to scale linearly with the electronic coupling, contributing to a uniform\npicture of this relationship in distorted graphene structures. Moreover, it is\nshown that the introduced distortion yields a strongly non-uniform spatial\ndistribution of the pairing strength that eventually leads to the induction of\nperiodically distributed domains of enhanced electron-phonon coupling. These\nfindings help elucidate certain peculiar aspects of phonon-mediated phenomena\nin graphene, particularly the associated superconducting phase, and offer\npotential pathways for their further engineering.",

    "abstract": "Solar spectropolarimetric inversion -- inferring atmospheric conditions from\nthe Stokes vector -- is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar\nmagnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and\nsensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer\nfaster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral\nlines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning\n(ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified\nparameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward\nmodelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the\nchromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field\nstrength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\\sin2\\phi$, $\\cos2\\phi$), and\nline-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer\nincorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most\ninformative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses\npositional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it\nagainst a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess\ngeneralisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher\nlayers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more\nregularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a\nrange of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter\ninference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable.\nWe establish transformer architectures as a powerful tool for\nspectropolarimetric inversion.

A novel\ndual-constrained loss function strengthens the statistical consistency between\nthe target and reference regions through mean-variance alignment and histogram\nmatching based on Kullback-Leibler dispersion. The method works by dynamically\nfusing thermal radiation features and spatial context, and the model suppresses\nemissivity artifacts while recovering structural details. After validating the\nindustrial blower system under different conditions, the improved network\nrealizes the dynamic fusion of thermal radiation characteristics and spatial\nbackground, with accurate calibration results in various industrial conditions.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic video generation is progressing very rapidly. The latest models can\nproduce very realistic high-resolution videos that are virtually\nindistinguishable from real ones. Although several video forensic detectors\nhave been recently proposed, they often exhibit poor generalization, which\nlimits their applicability in a real-world scenario. Our key insight to\novercome this issue is to guide the detector towards seeing what really\nmatters. In fact, a well-designed forensic classifier should focus on\nidentifying intrinsic low-level artifacts introduced by a generative\narchitecture rather than relying on high-level semantic flaws that characterize\na specific model. In this work, first, we study different generative\narchitectures, searching and identifying discriminative features that are\nunbiased, robust to impairments, and shared across models. Then, we introduce a\nnovel forensic-oriented data augmentation strategy based on the wavelet\ndecomposition and replace specific frequency-related bands to drive the model\nto exploit more relevant forensic cues. Our novel training paradigm improves\nthe generalizability of AI-generated video detectors, without the need for\ncomplex algorithms and large datasets that include multiple synthetic\ngenerators. To evaluate our approach, we train the detector using data from a\nsingle generative model and test it against videos produced by a wide range of\nother models. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves a significant\naccuracy improvement over state-of-the-art detectors and obtains excellent\nresults even on very recent generative models, such as NOVA and FLUX. Code and\ndata will be made publicly available.",

In real-world scenarios, historical task\nrecords are usually available, which enables the training of a decision policy\non multiple instances consisting of historical records. Recently, reinforcement\nlearning has been applied to solve DMH. Due to the occurrence of dynamic events\nsuch as new tasks, adaptability is highly required. Solving DMH is challenging\nsince constraints including task delay should be satisfied. A feedback is\nreceived only when all tasks are served, which leads to sparse reward. Besides,\nmaking the best use of limited computational resources and historical records\nfor training a robust policy is crucial. The time allocated to different\nproblem instances would highly impact the learning process. To tackle those\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel adaptive constrained evolutionary\nreinforcement learning (ACERL) approach, which maintains a population of actors\nfor diverse exploration. ACERL accesses each actor for tackling sparse rewards\nand constraint violation to restrict the behaviour of the policy. Moreover,\nACERL adaptively selects the most beneficial training instances for improving\nthe policy. Extensive experiments on eight training and eight unseen test\ninstances demonstrate the outstanding performance of ACERL compared with\nseveral state-of-the-art algorithms. Policies trained by ACERL can schedule the\nvehicles while fully satisfying the constraints. Additional experiments on 40\nunseen noised instances show the robust performance of ACERL. Cross-validation\nfurther presents the overall effectiveness of ACREL. Besides, a rigorous\nablation study highlights the coordination and benefits of each ingredient of\nACERL.",

To this end, we study the ramifications of invoking optical phonons\nin such a system via two different coupling mechanisms, namely, a local and a\nnon-local one, which are distinct in their microscopic origin. In case of the\nlocal spin-phonon coupling, a single phonon mode affects the magnetic\ninteractions, whereas in the non-local case, two neighbouring phonon modes are\ninvolved in the energy renormalization, and it would be worthwhile to compare\nand contrast between the two. To tackle these phonons, we propose an analytic\napproach involving a canonical spin-Peierls transformation applied to magnons.\nThe formalism renders a hybridization between the magnons and the phonon modes,\nyielding magnon-polaron quasiparticles. In both the coupling regimes,\nvalidations for the topological signatures are systematically derived from the\nbulk and edge spectral properties of the magnon-polaron bands that are\ncharacterized by their corresponding Chern numbers. Thereafter, we investigate\ntransitions from one topological phase to another solely via tuning the\nspin-phonon coupling strength. Moreover, these transitions significantly impact\nthe behavior of the thermal Hall conductivity that aids in discerning distinct\ntopological phases. Additionally, the explicit dependencies on the temperature\nand the external magnetic field are explored in inducing topological phase\ntransitions associated with the magnon-polaron bands.

MnPtGa is a system with strongly\nlocalized magnetic moments at the Mn atoms as was demonstrated using\ncalculations for disordered local moments. The magnetic moments at the Mn sites\nstay at about 3.9 bohr even above the calculated magnetic transition\ntemperatures (TN = 220 K or TC = 285 K). In the present work, a special\nemphasis was focused on the possible non-collinear magnetic order using first\nprinciples calculations. The investigations included magnetic anisotropy,\nstatic noncollinear order in form of spin canting and dynamic non-collinearity\nin spin spirals. It is found that the energy differences between ferromagnetic,\nantiferromagnetic, canted, or spiral magnetic order are in the order of not\nmore than 30 meV, which is in the order of thermal energies at ambient\ntemperature. This hints that a particular magnetic state - including skyrmions,\nantiskyrmions or spin glass transitions - may be forced when an external field\nis applied at finite temperature.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of\nresearch. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML wrong? And why\nshould we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable benefits and goods,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism--the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal--requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong--why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups--and\nwhy ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also\noutlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the entire ML\npipeline.",

A key question is\nwhether such polar solitons can emerge in nonpolar systems, where intrinsic\npolarity is absent. Here, we demonstrate an unprecedented polar soliton with\nnematic order in a nonpolar and chiral liquid crystal system by applying an\nalternating electric field. The soliton is corn-kernel-shaped, displaying a\npair of oppositely charged topological defects at its two ends. While\nhead-to-head collision between the solitons leads to repulsion, head-to-tail\ncollision attracts the solitons into a single polar soliton. A rich variety of\nsolitonic kinetics, such as rectilinear translation and circulation motions,\ncan be activated by controlling the voltage and frequency of an electric field.\nSimulations reveal that the formation of the polar solitons is achieved through\nbalancing the electric and nematic elastic energies, while the flexoelectric\neffect drives their rotational behaviors.

    "abstract": "Infrared and visible light image fusion aims to combine the strengths of both\nmodalities to generate images that are rich in information and fulfill visual\nor computational requirements. This paper proposes an image fusion method based\non Implicit Neural Representations (INR), referred to as INRFuse. This method\nparameterizes a continuous function through a neural network to implicitly\nrepresent the multimodal information of the image, breaking through the\ntraditional reliance on discrete pixels or explicit features. The normalized\nspatial coordinates of the infrared and visible light images serve as inputs,\nand multi-layer perceptrons is utilized to adaptively fuse the features of both\nmodalities, resulting in the output of the fused image. By designing multiple\nloss functions, the method jointly optimizes the similarity between the fused\nimage and the original images, effectively preserving the thermal radiation\ninformation of the infrared image while maintaining the texture details of the\nvisible light image. Furthermore, the resolution-independent characteristic of\nINR allows for the direct fusion of images with varying resolutions and\nachieves super-resolution reconstruction through high-density coordinate\nqueries. Experimental results indicate that INRFuse outperforms existing\nmethods in both subjective visual quality and objective evaluation metrics,\nproducing fused images with clear structures, natural details, and rich\ninformation without the necessity for a training dataset.",

The Capon beamformer, also known as the minimum power\ndistortionless response (MPDR) or the minimum variance distortionless response\n(MVDR) beamformer, is a widely used method in array signal processing. A\ncurious feature of both the Capon and the MMSE beamformers is their tendency to\neither overestimate or underestimate the signal power.

To address\nthis issue, we propose to shrink the Capon beamformer by finding a scaling\nfactor that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) of the signal power\nestimate. The new beamformer, referred to as the Capon$^+$ beamformer, is\nevaluated against the Capon and MMSE beamformers in terms of bias, signal power\nMSE, and signal waveform MSE. The Capon$^+$ beamformer strikes a better balance\nbetween signal power and waveform estimation while also exhibiting minimal\nbias, which approaches zero as the sample size increases.",

However, the\neffectiveness of analytical models in understanding urban mobility patterns can\nbe significantly affected by the spatial scales employed in the analysis. This\npaper explores the impact of spatial scales on the performance of the gravity\nmodel in explaining urban mobility patterns using public transport flow data in\nSingapore. The model is evaluated across multiple spatial scales of origin and\ndestination locations, ranging from individual bus stops and train stations to\nbroader regional aggregations. Results indicate the existence of an optimal\nintermediate spatial scale at which the gravity model performs best. At the\nfinest scale, where individual transport nodes are considered, the model\nexhibits poor performance due to noisy and highly variable travel patterns.\nConversely, at larger scales, model performance also suffers as\nover-aggregation of transport nodes results in excessive generalisation which\nobscures the underlying mobility dynamics. Furthermore, distance-based spatial\naggregation of transport nodes proves to outperform administrative\nboundary-based aggregation, suggesting that actual urban organisation and\nmovement patterns may not necessarily align with imposed administrative\ndivisions. These insights highlight the importance of selecting appropriate\nspatial scales in mobility analysis and urban modelling in general, offering\nvaluable guidance for urban and transport planning efforts aimed at enhancing\nmobility in complex urban environments.",

Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate efficient electrical tunability via low-voltage (0.6 V)\nelectrothermal modulation of the PnC structure, enabling a reversible\ntransition between trapped and transmission states and yielding a high-contrast\namplitude modulation of 47.75 dB.

However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess\ndiverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding\nmodels rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively\ncapture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive\nLearning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture\ndiverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by\nlearning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex\nstructures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic\ninformation effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic\ninformation, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating\nthem to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning\napproach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath\nembeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the\ndistance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance\nbetween those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the\nseparability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL.

An novel input strain waveform provides a unifying\napproach that smoothly interpolates between exponential shear (ES) and\noscillatory shear (SAOS/MAOS/LAOS) as a flow type parameter is varied.\nAnalogous to cyclic tensile fatigue tests in solids, or the process of chewing\nin the oral cavity, this complex strain history is used to quantify the\nevolution of extensional material properties at large strains over sequential\ncycles of stretch. In the limit of large Hencky strain rates, the waveform\nlocally increases exponentially and generates a period of strong material\nstretching. This allows for the direct computation of a transient planar\nextensional viscosity within specific domains of the periodic function. We\ndemonstrate this technique on a set of model fluids, and then apply it to\ncomplex multiphase materials that mutate. These latter fluids exhibit\nprogressive evolution in their rheological properties over repeated cycles of\nextensional deformation. Here we focus on two examples: a delicate foodstuff\nmaterial (melted provolone cheese) which systematically decreases its\nextensional response over successive stretching cycles, mutating at a rate that\nis directly dependent on the effective Hencky strain rate. We contrast this\nwith a PVA-borax solution which exhibits precisely the opposite effect during\nsuccessive stretching cycles: increasing its planar extensional response over\nsuccessive cycles, as interchain associative interactions (controlled via\nstretching) build structure within the fluid. These results highlight a\npromising new approach to study bulk extensional properties during cyclical\nstretching of complex fluids.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of image generation technologies, especially the\nadvancement of Diffusion Models, the quality of synthesized images has\nsignificantly improved, raising concerns among researchers about information\nsecurity. To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models,\ndiffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective\ncountermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising\nto diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this\nproblem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different\ndiffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images.\nBuilding upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention\n(NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To\nimplement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer,\nforming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a\ncross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a\nchannel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in\nenhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images. When\nencountering unseen generation methods, our approach achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance.Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/WeinanGuan/NASA-Swin.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid progress of speech language models (SLMs), discrete speech\ntokens have emerged as a core interface between speech and text, enabling\nunified modeling across modalities. Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method\nthat introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching\nteacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from\nsemantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded\nrepresentations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a\nfrozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet\ndata-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are\nmore semantically aligned with language models. LM-SPT further incorporates\narchitectural improvements to the encoder and decoder for speech tokenization,\nand supports multiple frame rates, including 25Hz, 12.5Hz, and 6.25Hz.\nExperimental results show that LM-SPT achieves superior reconstruction fidelity\ncompared to baselines, and that SLMs trained with LM-SPT tokens achieve\ncompetitive performances on speech-to-text and consistently outperform\nbaselines on text-to-speech tasks.",

In this paper, we propose Cross-modal\nOffset-guided Dynamic Alignment and Fusion (CoDAF), a unified framework that\njointly tackles both challenges in weakly aligned UAV-based object detection.\nCoDAF comprises two novel modules: the Offset-guided Semantic Alignment (OSA),\nwhich estimates attention-based spatial offsets and uses deformable convolution\nguided by a shared semantic space to align features more precisely; and the\nDynamic Attention-guided Fusion Module (DAFM), which adaptively balances\nmodality contributions through gating and refines fused features via\nspatial-channel dual attention. By integrating alignment and fusion in a\nunified design, CoDAF enables robust UAV object detection.

Building on\nthis, we propose Textual Semantic Guidance for infrared and visible image\nfusion, termed TeSG, which guides the image synthesis process in a way that is\noptimized for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation.\nSpecifically, TeSG consists of three core components: a Semantic Information\nGenerator (SIG), a Mask-Guided Cross-Attention (MGCA) module, and a Text-Driven\nAttentional Fusion (TDAF) module. The SIG generates mask and text semantics\nbased on textual descriptions. The MGCA module performs initial attention-based\nfusion of visual features from both infrared and visible images, guided by mask\nsemantics. Finally, the TDAF module refines the fusion process with gated\nattention driven by text semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\ncompetitiveness of our approach, particularly in terms of performance on\ndownstream tasks, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we\nintroduce the task of Few-shot Generalized Category Discovery (FSGCD), aiming\nto achieve competitive performance in GCD tasks under conditions of known\ninformation scarcity. To tackle this challenge, we propose a decision boundary\nenhancement framework with affinity-based retrieval. Our framework is designed\nto learn the decision boundaries of known categories and transfer these\nboundaries to unknown categories. First, we use a decision boundary\npre-training module to mitigate the overfitting of pre-trained information on\nknown category boundaries and improve the learning of these decision boundaries\nusing labeled samples. Second, we implement a two-stage retrieval-guided\ndecision boundary optimization strategy. Specifically, this strategy further\nenhances the severely limited known boundaries by using affinity-retrieved\npseudo-labeled samples. Then, these refined boundaries are applied to unknown\nclusters via guidance from affinity-based feature retrieval. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods on\nsix public GCD benchmarks under the FSGCD setting.

These disasters often\noriginate from failures at critical points in the network, where single-node\ndisruptions can propagate rapidly due to structural dependencies and\nhigh-impact linkages. Such vulnerabilities are exacerbated in systems that have\nbeen highly optimized for efficiency or have self-organized into fragile\nconfigurations over time. The U.S. air transportation system, built on a\nhub-and-spoke model, exemplifies this type of critical infrastructure. Its\nreliance on a small number of high-throughput hubs means that even localized\ndisruptions--especially those triggered by increasingly frequent and extreme\nweather events--can initiate cascades with nationwide impact. We introduce a\nnovel application of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) theory to model and\nanalyze cascading failures in such systems. Through a detailed case study of\nU.S. airline operations, we show how the SOC model captures the power-law\ndistribution of disruptions and the long-tail risk of systemic failures,\nreflecting the interplay between structural fragility and climate shocks. Our\napproach enables quantitative assessment of network vulnerability,\nidentification of critical nodes, and evaluation of proactive strategies for\ndisaster risk reduction.

However,\nquantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the\npresence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.\nWhile bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may\nalso reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we\nconduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that\nmitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in\nGPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information\nwhen model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect\nmeasured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free\nconfidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases\ninduce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is\nlower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater\nunderestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,\nwhereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric\nuncertainty estimation.

To investigate this\nsymmetry-breaking mechanism in broader contexts, we propose and analyze the\ndynamics of an active hinge moving through a crowded two-dimensional channel.\nThrough extensive numerical simulations, we find that the lifetime of the\nhinge's motile state varies nonmonotonically with both the packing fraction of\nthe granular medium and the strength of self-propulsion.

While some\ndata-driven planning systems attempt to directly utilize these disengagement\ncases for policy improvement, the inherent scarcity of disengagement data\n(often occurring as a single instances) restricts training effectiveness.\nFurthermore, some disengagement data should be excluded since the disengagement\nmay not always come from the failure of driving policies, e.g. the driver may\ncasually intervene for a while. To this end, this work proposes\ndisengagement-reason-augmented reinforcement learning (DRARL), which enhances\ndriving policy improvement process according to the reason of disengagement\ncases. Specifically, the reason of disengagement is identified by a\nout-of-distribution (OOD) state estimation model. When the reason doesn't\nexist, the case will be identified as a casual disengagement case, which\ndoesn't require additional policy adjustment. Otherwise, the policy can be\nupdated under a reason-augmented imagination environment, improving the policy\nperformance of disengagement cases with similar reasons. The method is\nevaluated using real-world disengagement cases collected by autonomous driving\nrobotaxi. Experimental results demonstrate that the method accurately\nidentifies policy-related disengagement reasons, allowing the agent to handle\nboth original and semantically similar cases through reason-augmented training.\nFurthermore, the approach prevents the agent from becoming overly conservative\nafter policy adjustments.

We use concepts\nfrom statistical mechanics to understand how a changing finite size of models\naffects the cognition ability under the presence or corrupted data.

This often results in incomplete or\noverly speculative reasoning paths, leading to hallucinations or missing key\ninformation in complex tasks.

In the first stage, Zero-RL\nis used to generate concise, outcome-directed reasoning paths that reduce the\nlikelihood of critical omissions. In the second stage, we introduce a novel\nevaluation metric, $R^\\star$, which scores reasoning paths based on their\ngeneration likelihood. This favors paths that reach correct answers with\nminimal exploration, helping to reduce hallucination-prone data during\ntraining. In the final stage, the model is further refined through\nreinforcement learning on challenging examples to enhance its preference\ndiscrimination capabilities. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that\nReasonGRM achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nprevious best GRMs by 1.8\\% on average and surpassing proprietary models such\nas GPT-4o by up to 5.6\\%.

    "abstract": "Signal source localization has been a problem of interest in the multi-robot\nsystems domain given its applications in search & rescue and hazard\nlocalization in various industrial and outdoor settings. A variety of\nmulti-robot search algorithms exist that usually formulate and solve the\nassociated autonomous motion planning problem as a heuristic model-free or\nbelief model-based optimization process. Most of these algorithms however\nremains tested only in simulation, thereby losing the opportunity to generate\nknowledge about how such algorithms would compare/contrast in a real physical\nsetting in terms of search performance and real-time computing performance. To\naddress this gap, this paper presents a new lab-scale physical setup and\nassociated open-source software pipeline to evaluate and benchmark multi-robot\nsearch algorithms. The presented physical setup innovatively uses an acoustic\nsource (that is safe and inexpensive) and small ground robots (e-pucks)\noperating in a standard motion-capture environment. This setup can be easily\nrecreated and used by most robotics researchers. The acoustic source also\npresents interesting uncertainty in terms of its noise-to-signal ratio, which\nis useful to assess sim-to-real gaps. The overall software pipeline is designed\nto readily interface with any multi-robot search algorithm with minimal effort\nand is executable in parallel asynchronous form. This pipeline includes a\nframework for distributed implementation of multi-robot or swarm search\nalgorithms, integrated with a ROS (Robotics Operating System)-based software\nstack for motion capture supported localization. The utility of this novel\nsetup is demonstrated by using it to evaluate two state-of-the-art multi-robot\nsearch algorithms, based on swarm optimization and batch-Bayesian Optimization\n(called Bayes-Swarm), as well as a random walk baseline.",

This Lagrangian\ncomes in both non-chiral (real) and chiral (complex) versions. The chiral\nversion makes it easy to isolate the self-dual sector. The latter lends itself\nto a higher-spin (HS) generalization, which combines the HS Self-Dual GR and HS\nSelf-Dual Yang-Mills of Krasnov, Skvortsov and Tran. We then descend from the\ncovariant formulation to lightcone gauge, and construct a cubic-exact lightcone\naction. For HS Self-Dual Yang-Mills, we solve the lightcone field equations to\nall orders in perturbation theory. Finally, we discuss the relation between\nlightcone foliations that share a lightray -- a setup relevant for the\nscattering problem in the de Sitter static patch.

The brightness and narrow\nlinewidth of [C II] allow us to measure PDR expansion. Bubble-shaped regions\noften exhibit expansion, while irregular-shaped ones are less likely to. Of the\n35 HII regions, 12 (~34%) exhibit clear expansion in position-velocity (PV)\ndiagrams, making them expansion candidates (ECs), with an average expansion\nvelocity of ~12.2 km/s. The remaining 23 regions show no clear expansion\nsignatures, though they may still be expanding below detection limits.\nBlueshifted expansion is more common (eight ECs solely blueshifted; one\nredshifted; three both), with mean velocities of ~10.9 km/s (blueshifted) and\n~13.2 km/s (redshifted). A comparison of our observations to spherical\nexpansion models supports expansion in eight of 12 ECs. Estimated dynamical\nages are 10 to 100 times shorter than the ionizing star lifetimes, in agreement\nwith the results of previous studies. Of the 35 regions, 14 (~40%) appear as\n[CII] bubbles; nine of the 12 ECs are bubble-shaped. Thermal pressure likely\ndrives expansion in M43, while stellar winds dominate in M17, M42, RCW 120, and\nRCW 79. For other ECs, available data do not allow a definitive conclusion.\nLarger samples and more information about ionizing sources are needed to refine\nour understanding of HII region feedback and evolution.",

In this Perspective, we argue that\nbuilding a robust science of AI psychology requires integrating two of our\nfield's foundational pillars: the principles of reliable measurement and the\nstandards for sound causal inference. We present a dual-validity framework to\nguide this integration, which clarifies how the evidence needed to support a\nclaim scales with its scientific ambition.

In this paper, we rethink\nmultimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and\nefficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token\nconcatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a\nlightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by\ninjecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of\nlayer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states\nbased on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while\npreserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational\ncosts. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate\nthat LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also\ndramatically enhances efficiency.

The\nphase-resolved spectral properties of the pulsar are presented, such as the SED\npeak energy E$_p$, the width of the SED at its peak, d$_p$, and the asymptotic\n(low-energy) spectral index, $\\Gamma_0$, are presented. The best-fit spectral\nmodels for each LAT pulse peak (Peak 1 and Peak 2) are extrapolated to UV\nenergies and compared to archival, phase-resolved spectra at UV, X-ray, soft\n\\gamma-ray and TeV energies. We also discuss the physical implications of our\nmodeling and the data comparisons.",

To overcome these limitations, recent research has explored the use of\nsemantic tokens as an alternative to ID tokens, which typically leveraged\nreconstruction-based strategies, like RQ-VAE, to quantize content embeddings\nand significantly reduce the embedding size. However, reconstructive\nquantization aims for the precise reconstruction of each item embedding\nindependently, which conflicts with the goal of generative retrieval tasks\nfocusing more on differentiating among items. Moreover, multi-modal side\ninformation of items, such as descriptive text and images, geographical\nknowledge in location-based recommendation services, has been shown to be\neffective in improving recommendations by providing richer contexts for\ninteractions. Nevertheless, effectively integrating such complementary\nknowledge into existing generative recommendation frameworks remains\nchallenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised deep\nquantization exclusively based on contrastive learning, named SimCIT (a Simple\nContrastive Item Tokenization framework). Specifically, different from existing\nreconstruction-based strategies, SimCIT propose to use a learnable residual\nquantization module to align with the signals from different modalities of the\nitems, which combines multi-modal knowledge alignment and semantic tokenization\nin a mutually beneficial contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments\nacross public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset from various\ndomains demonstrate SimCIT's effectiveness in LLM-based generative\nrecommendation.",

In this study, we propose that it is necessary to\nmeasure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing\nresearch on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant\nto its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been\npredominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we\nanalyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results\nindicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory\nof mind capabilities have not shown comparable development.

Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed\nas learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models\nwith it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable\nknowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of\nutilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge,\nwhich inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework\ndesigned to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP.\nSpecifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the\nmultimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner.\nSubsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant\nmodels of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nMM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene\napproaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and\ncomparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm\n(e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG\nrequires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8\ntimes pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training\nand fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient\ndeployment across diverse downstream tasks.",

To achieve this, we derive an analytical,\nframe-invariant continuum solution for the exponential shear material function,\nvalid over all Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, we amend the original\nframework of Doshi and Dealy proposed in 1987 to explicitly address the effect\nof rotation of material elements, due to the presence of vorticity. Modern\nstrain-controlled rheometers can access a wide range of effective Hencky strain\nrates in exponential shear (approximately within a range of 0.01 to 7 s^-1) and\nup to an effective Hencky strain of approximately 6 -- sufficient range to\nobserve finite extensibility for many polymeric fluids. We quantify the\nkinematic, transducer-based, and instability-related experimental limitations\nof the method, establishing firm windows of data validity.\n  The new material function is tested on a number of different example fluids.\nWe show that these exponentially increasing strain histories are capable of\nproducing \"strong flow\" -- generating stress-growth dynamics consistent with\ncoil-stretch conformational changes in polymer solutions exhibited in\nextensional flows (Wi > 0.5). We then demonstrate that the method can reach\nfinite extensibility for a 0.3 % wt. PIB solution. The method is then\nquantitatively validated (with no fitted parameters) against a traditional\nextensional technique, Capillary Break-Up Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) using\nthe same PIB solution.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have emerged as a critical security threat against deep\nneural networks in recent years. The majority of existing backdoor attacks\nfocus on targeted backdoor attacks, where trigger is strongly associated to\nspecific malicious behavior. Various backdoor detection methods depend on this\ninherent property and shows effective results in identifying and mitigating\nsuch targeted attacks. However, a purely untargeted attack in backdoor\nscenarios is, in some sense, self-weakening, since the target nature is what\nmakes backdoor attacks so powerful. In light of this, we introduce a novel\nConstrained Untargeted Backdoor Attack (CUBA), which combines the flexibility\nof untargeted attacks with the intentionality of targeted attacks. The\ncompromised model, when presented with backdoor images, will classify them into\nrandom classes within a constrained range of target classes selected by the\nattacker. This combination of randomness and determinedness enables the\nproposed untargeted backdoor attack to natively circumvent existing backdoor\ndefense methods. To implement the untargeted backdoor attack under controlled\nflexibility, we propose to apply logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with\nflipped one-hot labels. By constraining the logit during training, the\ncompromised model will show a uniform distribution across selected target\nclasses, resulting in controlled untargeted attack.

While recent works such as\nGaLore, Fira, and APOLLO have proposed state-compressed variants to reduce\nmemory consumption, a fundamental question remains: What is the minimal amount\nof optimizer state that is truly necessary to retain state-of-the-art\nperformance in LLM pretraining? In this work, we systematically investigate\nthis question using a bottom-up approach. We find that two memory- and\ncompute-efficient optimization techniques are particularly effective: (1)\ncolumn-wise gradient normalization significantly boosts the performance of\nplain SGD without requiring momentum; and (2) adding first-order momentum only\nto the output layer - where gradient variance is highest - yields performance\ncompetitive with fully adaptive methods such as Muon. Based on these insights,\nwe propose SCALE (Stochastic Column-normalized Last-layer Momentum), a new\noptimizer that combines column-normalized SGD with last-layer momentum, where\ncolumn normalization refers to normalizing the gradient along the output\ndimension. Across multiple LLaMA models (60M-1B), SCALE matches or exceeds the\nperformance of Adam while using only 35-45% of the total memory. It also\nconsistently outperforms memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore, Fira, and\nAPOLLO, making it a strong candidate for large-scale pretraining under memory\nconstraints.

    "abstract": "Multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a widely adopted framework for sequential\ndecision-making under uncertainty. Traditional bandit algorithms rely solely on\nonline data, which tends to be scarce as it must be gathered during the online\nphase when the arms are actively pulled. However, in many practical settings,\nrich auxiliary data, such as covariates of past users, is available prior to\ndeploying any arms. We introduce a new setting for MAB where pre-trained\nmachine learning (ML) models are applied to convert side information and\nhistorical data into \\emph{surrogate rewards}. A prominent feature of this\nsetting is that the surrogate rewards may exhibit substantial bias, as true\nreward data is typically unavailable in the offline phase, forcing ML\npredictions to heavily rely on extrapolation. To address the issue, we propose\nthe Machine Learning-Assisted Upper Confidence Bound (MLA-UCB) algorithm, which\ncan be applied to any reward prediction model and any form of auxiliary data.\nWhen the predicted and true rewards are jointly Gaussian, it provably improves\nthe cumulative regret, provided that the correlation is non-zero -- even in\ncases where the mean surrogate reward completely misaligns with the true mean\nrewards. Notably, our method requires no prior knowledge of the covariance\nmatrix between true and surrogate rewards. We compare MLA-UCB with the standard\nUCB on a range of numerical studies and show a sizable efficiency gain even\nwhen the size of the offline data and the correlation between predicted and\ntrue rewards are moderate.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a crossed module of piecewise linear surfaces and study the\nsignature homomorphism, defined as the surface holonomy of a universal\ntranslation invariant $2$-connection. This provides a transform whereby\nsurfaces are represented by formal series of tensors. Our main result is that\nthe signature uniquely characterizes a surface up to translation and thin\nhomotopy, also known as tree-like equivalence in the case of paths. This\ngeneralizes a result of Chen and positively answers a question of Kapranov in\nthe setting of piecewise linear surfaces. As part of this work, we provide\nseveral equivalent definitions of thin homotopy, generalizing the plethora of\ndefinitions which exist in the case of paths. Furthermore, we develop methods\nfor explicitly and efficiently computing the surface signature.",

    "abstract": "Generative models in function spaces, situated at the intersection of\ngenerative modeling and operator learning, are attracting increasing attention\ndue to their immense potential in diverse scientific and engineering\napplications. While functional generative models are theoretically domain- and\ndiscretization-agnostic, current implementations heavily rely on the Fourier\nNeural Operator (FNO), limiting their applicability to regular grids and\nrectangular domains. To overcome these critical limitations, we introduce the\nMesh-Informed Neural Operator (MINO). By leveraging graph neural operators and\ncross-attention mechanisms, MINO offers a principled, domain- and\ndiscretization-agnostic backbone for generative modeling in function spaces.\nThis advancement significantly expands the scope of such models to more diverse\napplications in generative, inverse, and regression tasks. Furthermore, MINO\nprovides a unified perspective on integrating neural operators with general\nadvanced deep learning architectures. Finally, we introduce a suite of\nstandardized evaluation metrics that enable objective comparison of functional\ngenerative models, addressing another critical gap in the field.",
