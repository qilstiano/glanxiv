The main difficulty in the hyperbolic setting is that the\ninner parallel bodies of a convex body are not necessarily convex. To overcome\nthis difficulty, we introduce an extra assumption of thickness $\\kappa \\geq\n1/\\lambda$.

In\nparticular, we require exact expression of the various wave curves and avoid\nthe use of Taylor expansions.

For the $p$-system, modeling isentropic gas dynamics in a Lagrangian\nframe, we show that there is no finite accumulation of interaction times.

We also investigate the specific intensity of the HR\nfrom non-evaporating PBHs and compare it with the critical radiation needed for\ndirect collapse black holes (DCBHs).

    "abstract": "There has been a recent surge of powerful tools to show rapid mixing of\nMarkov chains, via functional inequalities such as Poincar\\'e inequalities. In\nmany situations, Markov chains fail to mix rapidly from a worst-case\ninitialization, yet are expected to approximately sample from a random\ninitialization. For example, this occurs if the target distribution has\nmetastable states, small clusters accounting for a vanishing fraction of the\nmass that are essentially disconnected from the bulk of the measure. Under such\nconditions, a Poincar\\'e inequality cannot hold, necessitating new tools to\nprove sampling guarantees.\n  We develop a framework to analyze simulated annealing, based on establishing\nso-called weak Poincar\\'e inequalities. These inequalities imply mixing from a\nsuitably warm start, and simulated annealing provides a way to chain such warm\nstarts together into a sampling algorithm. We further identify a\nlocal-to-global principle to prove weak Poincar\\'e inequalities, mirroring the\nspectral independence and localization schemes frameworks for analyzing mixing\ntimes of Markov chains.\n  As our main application, we prove that simulated annealing samples from the\nGibbs measure of a spherical spin glass for inverse temperatures up to a\nnatural threshold, matching recent algorithms based on algorithmic stochastic\nlocalization. This provides the first Markov chain sampling guarantee that\nholds beyond the uniqueness threshold for spherical spin glasses, where mixing\nfrom a worst-case initialization is provably slow due to the presence of\nmetastable states. As an ingredient in our proof, we prove bounds on the\noperator norm of the covariance matrix of spherical spin glasses in the full\nreplica-symmetric regime.\n  Additionally, we resolve a question related to sampling using data-based\ninitializations.",

In this paper we develop methods to sidestep this problem using a\nrecently introduced structure called the subsplit directed acyclic graph\n(sDAG).

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious NLP tasks but struggle with code-mixed (or code-switched) language\nunderstanding. For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of\nmultilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current\nstate-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed\nlanguages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of\nmultilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention\nto date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel\ngeneral-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to\nhandle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in\nthis paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate\nannotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability\nof LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation\ntasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI\nfeedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks.\nThird, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world\ndatasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform\nstate-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated\nby human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks.

    "abstract": "Photorealistic avatars are human avatars that look, move, and talk like real\npeople. The performance of photorealistic avatars has significantly improved\nrecently based on objective metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, and FVD.\nHowever, recent photorealistic avatar publications do not provide subjective\ntests of the avatars to measure human usability factors. We provide an open\nsource test framework to subjectively measure photorealistic avatar performance\nin ten dimensions: realism, trust, comfortableness using, comfortableness\ninteracting with, appropriateness for work, creepiness, formality, affinity,\nresemblance to the person, and emotion accuracy. Using telecommunication\nscenarios, we show that the correlation of nine of these subjective metrics\nwith PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, and FVD is weak, and moderate for emotion\naccuracy. The crowdsourced subjective test framework is highly reproducible and\naccurate when compared to a panel of experts. We analyze a wide range of\navatars from photorealistic to cartoon-like and show that some photorealistic\navatars are approaching real video performance based on these dimensions. We\nalso find that for avatars above a certain level of realism, eight of these\nmeasured dimensions are strongly correlated. This means that avatars that are\nnot as realistic as real video will have lower trust, comfortableness using,\ncomfortableness interacting with, appropriateness for work, formality, and\naffinity, and higher creepiness compared to real video. In addition, because\nthere is a strong linear relationship between avatar affinity and realism,\nthere is no uncanny valley effect for photorealistic avatars in the\ntelecommunication scenario. We suggest several extensions of this test\nframework for future work and discuss design implications for telecommunication\nsystems.

    "abstract": "The growth of recommender systems (RecSys) is driven by digitization and the\nneed for personalized content in areas such as e-commerce and video streaming.\nThe content in these systems often changes rapidly and therefore they\nconstantly face the ongoing cold-start problem, where new items lack\ninteraction data and are hard to value. Existing solutions for the cold-start\nproblem, such as content-based recommenders and hybrid methods, leverage item\nmetadata to determine item similarities. The main challenge with these methods\nis their reliance on structured and informative metadata to capture detailed\nitem similarities, which may not always be available. This paper introduces a\nnovel approach for cold-start item recommendation that utilizes the language\nmodel (LM) to estimate item similarities, which are further integrated as a\nBayesian prior with classic recommender systems. This approach is generic and\nable to boost the performance of various recommenders.

    "abstract": "Manufacturing requires reliable object detection methods for precise picking\nand handling of diverse types of manufacturing parts and components.\nTraditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras\nor 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors\nhave weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D\nsensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can\nundermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems.\nTo address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining\nan red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are\ncalibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two\nhardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to\nprocess both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster\nR-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The\nresults show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only\nand RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More\nspecifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean\nPrecision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the\ndepth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%.\nHence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in\nservice to smart manufacturing applications.",

Additionally,\na dynamic saliency map-based aggregation strategy is designed to adapt based on\nthe severity of the detected data poisoning scenario. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that SAFELOC achieves improvements of up to 5.9x in mean\nlocalization error, 7.8x in worst-case localization error, and a 2.1x reduction\nin model inference latency compared to state-of-the-art indoor localization\nframeworks, across diverse building floorplans, mobile devices, and ML data\npoisoning attack scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative emission of photons from an ensemble of quantum dots (QDs) as\nsuperradiance can arise from the electronically coupled QDs with a coherent\nemitting excited state. This contrasts with superfluorescence (Dicke\nsuperradiance), where the cooperative photon emission occurs via a spontaneous\nbuildup of coherence in an ensemble of incoherently excited QDs via their\ncoupling to a common radiation mode. While superfluorescence has been observed\nin perovskite QD systems, reports of superradiance from the electronically\ncoupled ensemble of perovskite QDs are rare. Here, we demonstrate the\ngeneration of polarized superradiance with a very narrow linewidth (<5 meV) and\na large redshift (~200 meV) from the electronically coupled CsPbBr3 QD\nsuperlattice achieved through a combination of strong quantum confinement and\nligand engineering. In addition to photon bunching at low excitation densities,\nthe superradiance is polarized in contrast to the uncoupled exciton emission\nfrom the same superlattice. This finding suggests the potential for obtaining\npolarized cooperative photon emission via anisotropic electronic coupling in QD\nsuperlattices even when the intrinsic anisotropy of exciton transition in\nindividual QDs is weak.",

Although the involved cellular\nprocesses are mechanically driven, the quantification of haemodynamic forces in\nin-vivo settings remains extremely difficult and uncertain. In this work, we\npropose a novel computational framework for evaluating the blood flow dynamics\nacross networks of myogenically active cerebral arteries, which can modulate\ntheir muscular tone to stabilize flow (and perfusion pressure) as well as to\nlimit vascular intramural stress. The introduced framework is built on\ncontractile (myogenically active) vascular wall mechanics and blood flow\ndynamics models, which can be numerically coupled in either a weak or strong\nway. We investigate the time dependency of the vascular wall response to\npressure changes at both single vessel and network levels. The robustness of\nthe model was assessed by considering different types of inlet signals and\nnumerical settings in an idealized vascular network formed by a middle cerebral\nartery and its three generations. For the vessel size and boundary conditions\nconsidered, weak coupling ensured accurate results with a lower computational\ncost. To complete the analysis, we evaluated the effect of an upstream pressure\nsurge on the haemodynamics of the vascular network. This provided a clear\nquantitative picture of how pressure and flow are redistributed across each\nvessel generation upon inlet pressure changes.

Q-FEM keeps the structure of the\nfinite element discretization intact allowing for the use of variable element\nlengths and material coefficients in FEM discretization. The proposed method is\ntested on a steady-state heat equation discretized using linear and quadratic\nshape functions. Numerical verification studies are performed on the IBM QISKIT\nsimulator and it is demonstrated that Q-FEM is effective in converging to the\ncorrect solution for a variety of problems and model discretizations, including\nwith different element lengths, variable coefficients, and different boundary\nconditions. The formalism developed herein is general and can be extended to\nproblems with higher dimensions. However, numerical examples also demonstrate\nthat the number of parameters for the variational ansatz scale exponentially\nwith the number of qubits, and increases the odds of convergence. Moreover, the\ndeterioration of system conditioning with problem size results in barren\nplateaus and convergence difficulties.",

Using broadband extreme ultraviolet\ncore-level transient absorption, we measure simultaneously the coherently\ncoupled photo-induced carrier and lattice dynamics at the Te N$_{4,5}$ edge\ninitiated by a few-cycle NIR pulse. Ultrafast excitation of carriers leads to a\ncoherently excited A$_{\\rm{1}}$ phonon oscillation and the generation of a hot\ncarrier population distribution that oscillates in temperature, and the phonon\nexcursion and hot carrier temperature are $\\pi$ out of phase with respect to\neach other. The depths of modulation suggest a significant coupling between the\nelectronic and lattice degrees of freedom in Te. A long-lived shift of the\nabsorption edge suggests an excited state of Te in a new equilibrium potential\nenergy surface that lives on the order of the carrier recombination timescale.\nThe observed phonon-induced oscillations of the hot carriers are supportive of\na change in the metallicity, whereby Te becomes more metallic with increasing\nphonon-induced displacement. Additionally, near the Fermi level we observe an\nenergy-dependent phase of the displacive excitation of the A$_{\\rm{1}}$ phonon\nmode. The discovery of coherent coupling between the lattice and hot carriers\nin Te provides the basis to investigate coherent interactions between spin and\norbital degrees of freedom. The results spectrally and temporally resolve the\ncorrelation between photo-excited hot carriers and coherent lattice\nexcitations, providing insight on the optical manipulation of the Te electronic\nstructure at high carrier densities exceeding $10^{21}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.",

While a considerable fraction of galaxies at z~5 are consistent\nwith rotating disks, current studies indicate that the dominant galaxy assembly\nmechanism corresponds to mergers. Despite the important progress, the dynamical\nclassification of galaxies at these epochs is still limited by observations'\nresolution. We present a detailed morphological and kinematic analysis of the\nfar-infrared bright main sequence galaxy HZ10 at z=5.65, making use of new\nhigh-resolution ($\\lesssim0.3$\") [CII] 158$\\mu$m ALMA and rest-frame optical\nJWST/NIRSpec observations. These observations reveal a previously unresolved\ncomplex morphology and kinematics of the HZ10. We confirm that HZ10 is not a\nsingle galaxy but consists of at least three components in close projected\nseparation along the east-to-west direction. We find a [CII] bright central\ncomponent (C), separated by 1.5 and 4 kpc from the east (E) and west (W)\ncomponents, respectively. Our [CII] observations resolve the HZ10-C component\nresulting in a velocity gradient, produced by either rotation or a close-in\nmerger. We test the rotating disk possibility using DysmalPy kinematic modeling\nand propose three dynamical scenarios for the HZ10 system: (i) a double merger,\nin which the companion galaxy HZ10-W merges with the disturbed clumpy rotation\ndisk formed by the HZ10-C and E components; (ii) a triple merger, where the\ncompanion galaxies, HZ10-W and HZ10-E, merge with the rotation disk HZ10-C; and\n(iii) a quadruple merger, in which the companion galaxies HZ10-W and HZ10-E\nmerge with the close double merger HZ10-C. Comparing [CII] with JWST/NIRSpec\ndata, we find that [CII] emission closely resembles the broad [OIII] 5007{\\AA}\nemission.

Within the\nempirical dynamic modeling approach, multivariate S-map infers the interaction\nJacobian from time series data without assuming specific dynamical models. This\napproach enables the non-parametric statistical inference of interspecific\ninteractions through state space reconstruction. However, deviations in the\nbiological interpretation and numerical implementation of the interaction\nJacobian from its mathematical definition pose challenges. We mathematically\nreintroduce the interaction Jacobian using differential quotients, uncovering\ntwo problems: (1) the mismatch between the interaction Jacobian and its\nbiological meaning complicates comparisons between interspecific and\nintraspecific interactions; (2) the interaction Jacobian is not fully\nimplemented in the parametric Jacobian numerically derived from given\nparametric models, especially using ordinary differential equations. As a\nresult, model-based evaluations of S-map methods become inappropriate. To\naddress these problems, (1) we propose adjusting the diagonal elements of the\ninteraction Jacobian by subtracting 1 to resolve the comparability problem\nbetween inter- and intraspecific interaction strengths. Simulations of\npopulation dynamics showed that this adjustment prevents overestimation of\nintraspecific interaction strengths. (2) We introduce an alternative parametric\nJacobian and then cumulative interaction strength (CIS), providing a more\nrigorous benchmark for evaluating S-map methods. Furthermore, we demonstrated\nthat the numerical gap between CIS and the existing parametric Jacobian is\nsubstantial in realistic scenarios, suggesting CIS as preferred benchmark.\nThese solutions offer a clearer framework for developing non-parametric\napproaches in ecological time series analysis.",

Consequently, they are\nthe only functions for which the hazard-derivative approach of Ikenmeyer et al.\n(J.

Prior to this, no better upper\nbound than $O(3^n)$ was known. Notably, unlike in the general case of Boolean\ncircuits and formulas, where the typical complexity is derived from that of the\nmultiplexer function with $n$-bit selector, the hazard-free formula complexity\nof a random function is smaller than the optimal hazard-free formula for the\nmultiplexer by an exponential factor in $n$.\n  We provide two proofs of this fact. The first is direct, bounding the number\nof prime implicants of a random Boolean function and using this bound to\nconstruct a DNF of the claimed size. The second introduces a new and\nindependently interesting result: a weak converse to the hazard-derivative\nlower bound method, which gives an upper bound on the hazard-free complexity of\na function in terms of the monotone complexity of a subset of its\nhazard-derivatives.\n  Additionally, we explore the hazard-free formula complexity of block\ncomposition of Boolean functions and obtain a result in the hazard-free setting\nthat is analogous to a result of Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson (Computational\nComplexity, 1995) in the monotone setting.

The effect is cumulative\nover the long path lengths of light propagation and might be appreciable if the\ninteraction initially takes place close to the source of gravitational waves,\nwhere the strain amplitude can be large. This situation can be modeled\neffectively using spherical gravitational waves (i.e., transverse-traceless\nradially propagating waves), with the strain amplitude varying with the\ndistance from the source to a field point where the two wavefronts of light and\ngravitational waves meet each other. Our analysis employs geometrical-optics\nmethods in curved spacetime, where the curvature is due to gravitational waves\npropagating in a flat spacetime background.

    "abstract": "Improving hyperspectral image (HSI) semantic segmentation by exploiting\ncomplementary information from a supplementary data type (referred to\nX-modality) is promising but challenging due to differences in imaging sensors,\nimage content, and resolution. Current techniques struggle to enhance\nmodality-specific and modality-shared information, as well as to capture\ndynamic interaction and fusion between different modalities. In response, this\nstudy proposes CoMiX, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with\ndeformable convolutions (DCNs) for HSI-X semantic segmentation. CoMiX is\ndesigned to extract, calibrate, and fuse information from HSI and X data. Its\npipeline includes an encoder with two parallel and interacting backbones and a\nlightweight all-multilayer perceptron (ALL-MLP) decoder. The encoder consists\nof four stages, each incorporating 2D DCN blocks for the X model to accommodate\ngeometric variations and 3D DCN blocks for HSIs to adaptively aggregate\nspatial-spectral features. Additionally, each stage includes a Cross-Modality\nFeature enhancement and eXchange (CMFeX) module and a feature fusion module\n(FFM). CMFeX is designed to exploit spatial-spectral correlations from\ndifferent modalities to recalibrate and enhance modality-specific and\nmodality-shared features while adaptively exchanging complementary information\nbetween them. Outputs from CMFeX are fed into the FFM for fusion and passed to\nthe next stage for further information learning. Finally, the outputs from each\nFFM are integrated by the ALL-MLP decoder for final prediction. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our CoMiX achieves superior performance and\ngeneralizes well to various multimodal recognition tasks. The CoMiX code will\nbe released.",

This quasi-acoustic assumption accounts for the\ncompressibility of the medium surrounding the bubble and its finite speed of\nsound, whereby the potential of the acoustic wave emitted by the bubble\npropagates along outgoing characteristics. With these ingredients, a consistent\nset of equations describing the radial bubble dynamics as well as the resulting\nacoustic emissions and bubble-bubble interactions is obtained, which is\naccurate to the first order of the Mach number. This model is tested by\nconsidering several representative test cases, including the resonance behavior\nof multiple interacting bubbles and the response of dense mono- and\npolydisperse bubble clusters to a change in ambient pressure. The results are\nshown to be in excellent agreement with results reported in the literature.

We\nvalidate this approach across several small-scale VLMs (up to 7B parameters)\nand dense caption datasets, demonstrating that KnowAda effectively balances\nhallucination reduction and descriptiveness.

    "abstract": "As language models grow ever larger, so do their vocabularies. This has\nshifted the memory footprint of LLMs during training disproportionately to one\nsingle layer: the cross-entropy in the loss computation. Cross-entropy builds\nup a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary\nitems and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than\nthe rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that\ncomputes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens\ninto global memory. Rather, CCE only computes the logit for the correct token\nand evaluates the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly. We implement a custom\nkernel that performs the matrix multiplications and the log-sum-exp reduction\nover the vocabulary in flash memory, making global memory consumption for the\ncross-entropy computation negligible. This has a dramatic effect. Taking the\nGemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss\ncomputation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption\nof the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB. To improve the throughput of CCE, we\nleverage the inherent sparsity of softmax and propose to skip elements of the\ngradient computation that have a negligible (i.e., below numerical precision)\ncontribution to the gradient. Experiments demonstrate that the dramatic\nreduction in memory consumption is accomplished without sacrificing training\nspeed or convergence.",

    "abstract": "Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) serves as a fundamental task in\ncomputer vision, yet it often fails to consistently align with human subjective\nperception. Recent advances show that multi-scale evaluation strategies are\npromising due to their ability to replicate the hierarchical structure of human\nvision. However, the effectiveness of these strategies is limited by a lack of\nunderstanding of how different image scales influence perceived quality. This\npaper addresses two primary challenges: the significant redundancy of\ninformation across different scales, and the confusion caused by combining\nfeatures from these scales, which may vary widely in quality. To this end, a\nnew multi-scale BIQA framework is proposed, namely Contrast-Constrained\nScale-Focused IQA Framework (CSFIQA). CSFIQA features a selective focus\nattention mechanism to minimize information redundancy and highlight critical\nquality-related information. Additionally, CSFIQA includes a scale-level\ncontrastive learning module equipped with a noise sample matching mechanism to\nidentify quality discrepancies across the same image content at different\nscales. By exploring the intrinsic relationship between image scales and the\nperceived quality, the proposed CSFIQA achieves leading performance on eight\nbenchmark datasets, e.g., achieving SRCC values of 0.967 (versus 0.947 in CSIQ)\nand 0.905 (versus 0.876 in LIVEC).",

In effective field theory (EFT),\nintegrating out heavy fields should lead to Hamiltonian time evolution, which\npreserves the purity of low-energy states. This is consistent with the fact\nthat we never observe isolated quantum states spontaneously decohering in the\nvacuum due to unknown high-energy physics. However, when a heavy scalar of mass\n$M$ is traced out, the resulting purity of a light scalar with mass $m$\ntypically appears to scale as a power of $1/M$ (when $m\\ll M$), an effect that\ncannot be captured by a local effective Hamiltonian. We resolve this apparent\nparadox by showing that the purity depends on the resolution scale of the EFT\nand how the environment is traced out.

    "abstract": "We propose a learning-based Control Barrier Function (CBF) to reduce\nconservatism in collision avoidance of car-like robots. Traditional CBFs often\nuse Euclidean distance between robots' centers as safety margin, neglecting\nheadings and simplifying geometries to circles. While this ensures smooth,\ndifferentiable safety functions required by CBFs, it can be overly conservative\nin tight environments. To address this limitation, we design a heading-aware\nsafety margin that accounts for the robots' orientations, enabling a less\nconservative and more accurate estimation of safe regions. Since the function\ncomputing this safety margin is non-differentiable, we approximate it with a\nneural network to ensure differentiability and facilitate integration with\nCBFs. We describe how we achieve bounded learning error and incorporate the\nupper bound into the CBF to provide formal safety guarantees through forward\ninvariance. We show that our CBF is a high-order CBF with relative degree two\nfor a system with two robots whose dynamics are modeled by the nonlinear\nkinematic bicycle model. Experimental results in overtaking and bypassing\nscenarios reveal a 33.5 % reduction in conservatism compared to traditional\nmethods, while maintaining safety.

The data were collected as part of\nan ongoing study investigating the potential of electrical stimulation to\nmodulate stem cell differentiation and possible applications for neural repair.\nCompared to existing publicly available datasets, our dataset has more images\nof cells stained with more variety of antibodies (protein components of immune\nresponses against invaders) typically used for cell analysis. The experimental\nresults on this dataset indicate that none of the five existing models under\nthis study are able to achieve sufficiently accurate count to replace the\nmanual methods.

    "abstract": "As globular clusters (GCs) orbit the Milky Way, their stars are tidally\nstripped forming tidal tails that follow the orbit of the clusters around the\nGalaxy. The morphology of these tails is complex and shows correlations with\nthe phase of the orbit and the orbital angular velocity, especially for GCs on\neccentric orbits. Here, we focus on two GCs, NGC 1261 and NGC 1904, that have\npotentially been accreted alongside Gaia-Enceladus and that have shown\nsignatures of having, in addition of tidal tails, structures formed by\ndistributions of extra-tidal stars that are misaligned with the general\ndirection of the clusters' respective orbits. To provide an explanation for the\nformation of these structures, we make use of spectroscopic measurements from\nthe Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($S^5$) as well as proper\nmotion measurements from Gaia's third data release (DR3), and apply a Bayesian\nmixture modeling approach to isolate high-probability member stars. We recover\nextra-tidal features similar to those found in Shipp et al. (2018) surrounding\neach cluster. We conduct N-body simulations and compare the expected\ndistribution and variation in the dynamical parameters along the orbit with\nthose of our potential member sample. Furthermore, we use Dark Energy Camera\n(DECam) photometry to inspect the distribution of the member stars in the\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD). We find that the potential members agree\nreasonably with the N-body simulations and that the majority of them follow a\nsimple stellar population-like distribution in the CMD which is characteristic\nof GCs. In the case of NGC 1904, we clearly detect the tidal debris escaping\nthe inner and outer Lagrange points which are expected to be prominent when at\nor close to the apocenter of its orbit. Our analysis allows for further\nexploration of other GCs in the Milky Way that exhibit similar extra-tidal\nfeatures.",

    "abstract": "The absorption and emission spectrum arising from the vibrational motion of a\nmolecule is mostly in the infrared region.

However, the mode mismatch between the atomic-scale dimensions of\nthe chemical bonds and the resonance wavelength limits the direct detection of\ntiny amounts of samples such as self-assembled monolayers or biological\nmembranes. To overcome this limitation, surface-enhanced infrared absorption\nspectroscopy (SEIRA) has been proposed to enhance infrared absorption directly\nvia local field enhancement. Here, we report on the perfect absorption of\nmolecular vibration enabled by critical coupling in the metamaterials. Our\nmolecular metamaterial design consists of a thin polymer layer sandwiched\nbetween a structured metal layer on top and a continuous metal layer at the\nbottom that supports the gap plasmon mode. The measured and simulated infrared\nspectra of the molecular metamaterial show broad and narrow absorption bands\ncorresponding to the metamaterial and molecular vibration modes. We show that\nby tuning the structure's molecular film thickness and periodicity, vibrational\nabsorption can be enhanced to near unity. We also show that for a particular\nperiodicity of the array, metamaterial resonance can be completely suppressed,\nand only molecular vibrational absorption is excited, giving rise to an\nextremely narrow absorption band.",

We prove an upper bound of\n$O(n^{2/3}/\\epsilon^{4/3})$ on the query complexity for this problem. Our\nalgorithm is simple, but the analysis requires great care in bounding the\nvariance on the number of violating triangles in a sample. When $\\epsilon$ is a\nslowly decreasing function of $n$ (rather than a constant, as is standard), we\nprove a lower bound of matching dependence on $n$ of $\\Omega (n^{2/3})$, ruling\nout any property testers with $o(n^{2/3})$ query complexity unless their\ndependence on $1/\\epsilon$ is super-polynomial.\n  Next, we turn to tree metrics and ultrametrics.

    "abstract": "Single-file diffusion (SFD) is a key mechanism underlying transport phenomena\nin confined physical and biological systems. In a typical SFD process,\nmicroscopic particles are restricted to moving in a narrow channel where they\ncannot pass one another, resulting in constrained motion and anomalous\nlong-time diffusion. In this study, we use Brownian dynamics simulations and\nanalytical theory to investigate the SFD of athermal active Brownian particles\n(ABPs), a minimal model of active colloids. Building on prior work (Phys. Rev.\nE 108, 064601 (2023)), where the kinetic temperature, pressure, and\ncompressibility of the single-file ABP system were derived, we develop an\naccurate analytical expression for the mean square displacement (MSD) of a\ntagged particle. We find that the MSD exhibits ballistic behavior at short\ntimes, governed by the reduced kinetic temperature of the system. At long\ntimes, the characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD, $\\langle (\\Delta x)^2\n\\rangle \\sim t^{1/2}$, is preserved. However, self-propulsion introduces\nsignificant changes to the 1D mobility, which we directly relate to the\nsystem's compressibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized 1D\nmobility, originally proposed by Kollmann for equilibrium systems (Phys. Rev.\nLett. 90, 180602 (2003)), can be extended to active systems with minimal\nmodification. These findings provide a framework for understanding particle\ntransport in active systems and for tuning transport properties at the\nmicroscale, particularly in geometries where motion is highly restricted.",

Additionally, the\nestimation of the mean CFB does not use all longitudinal data points. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a class of estimands called Principal\nProgression Rate (PPR).

Current methods often require multiple diagnostics to capture the\nfull range of galactic activity. Furthermore, overlapping excitation sources\nwith similar observational signatures complicate the analysis of a galaxy's\nactivity. Aims. This study aims to create an activity diagnostic tool that\novercomes the limitations of current emission line diagnostics by identifying\nthe underlying excitation mechanisms in mixed-activity galaxies (e.g., star\nformation, active nucleus, or old stellar populations) and determining the\ndominant ones. Methods. We use the random forest machine-learning algorithm,\ntrained on three main activity classes -- star-forming, AGN, and passive --\nthat represent key gas excitation mechanisms. This diagnostic employs four\ndistinguishing features: the equivalent widths of [O iii] ${\\lambda}$5007, [N\nii] ${\\lambda}$6584, H${\\alpha}$, and the D4000 continuum break index. Results.\nThe classifier achieves near-perfect performance, with an overall accuracy of ~\n99% and recall scores of ~ 100% for star-forming, ~ 98% for AGN, and ~ 99% for\npassive galaxies. These exceptional scores allow for confident decomposition of\nmixed activity classes into the primary gas excitation mechanisms, overcoming\nthe limitations of current classification methods. Additionally, the classifier\ncan be simplified to a two-dimensional diagnostic using the D4000 index and\nlog$_{10}$(EW([O iii])$^{2}$) without significant loss of diagnostic power.\nConclusions. We present a diagnostic for classifying galaxies by their primary\ngas excitation mechanisms and deconstructing the activity of mixed-activity\ngalaxies into these components.

This is the clearest observed example of an HVC altering the\nlarge-scale magnetic field at the disk-halo interface and is the first image of\nmagnetic field effects in an HVC. These results demonstrate the possibility of\nfuture three-dimensional reconstruction of the Galactic magnetic field and\nshowcase the versatility of the Synthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio\nAstrophysical Observatory as one of the few existing telescopes which can\nexploit this new method of probing Galactic magnetism.",

At the\nforefront of this development are Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),\nwhich offer a promising approach by incorporating physical laws directly into\nthe learning process, thereby reducing the need for extensive datasets.\nHowever, when data is limited or the system becomes more complex, PINNs can\nface challenges, such as instability and difficulty in accurately fitting the\ntraining data. In this article, we explore the capabilities and limitations of\nthe DeepXDE framework, a tool specifically designed for implementing PINNs, in\naddressing both forward and inverse problems related to dielectric properties.\nUsing RC circuit models to represent dielectric materials in HVDC systems, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in analyzing and improving system\nperformance. Additionally, we show that applying a logarithmic transformation\nto the current (ln(I)) significantly enhances the stability and accuracy of\nPINN predictions, especially in challenging scenarios with sparse data or\ncomplex models. In inverse mode, however, we faced challenges in estimating key\nsystem parameters, such as resistance and capacitance, in more complex\nscenarios with longer time domains.

This paper presents the\ndesign, development, and evaluation of the aRD820, a low-power, rail-to-rail\noperational amplifier, as a cost-effective alternative to the industry-standard\nAD820. The aRD820 is optimized for operation on a single supply voltage ranging\nfrom 5 to 30 V or a dual supply of +-2.5 V to +-15 V. Key design objectives\nincluded achieving low voltage noise (< 4 uV peak-to-peak from 0.1 to 10 Hz),\nultra-low input bias current (< 15 pA), and a low offset voltage (< 500 uV),\nmaking it suitable for high-sensitivity applications. In adapting the AD820\ndesign, RD Alfa Microelectronics addressed specific production constraints by\nmodifying key circuit elements to meet the specifics of available production\nfacilities. The modified input stage reduced noise by incorporating source\nfollowers, enhancing the allowable input signal range. Adjustments to the\nsecond and output stages improved phase stability and gain characteristics.\nExtensive testing of the aRD820 in both wafer form and TO-5 packaged chips\nconfirmed that the amplifier meets or exceeds planned specifications.\nComparative results demonstrate that the aRD820 provides open-loop gain, offset\nvoltage stability, and output saturation voltages comparable to those of the\nAD820. Noise measurements yielded values within the planned range, with an\ninput noise density of approximately 13.5 - 18.1 nV/Sqrt(Hz), suitable for\napplications requiring precision signal processing.

However, it remains unclear whether self-reports of\nemotion-related bodily sensations (i.e., 'lump in my throat') are related to\nneural simulations of bodily action and sensation or whether they can be\nexplained by cognitive appraisals or the visual features of socioemotional\nsignals. To investigate this, participants (N = 21) were shown arousing\nemotional images that varied in valence, complexity, and content while\nundergoing fMRI scans. Participants then rated the images on a set of emotion\nappraisal scales and indicated where, on a body map, they experienced sensation\nin response to the image. To derive normative models of responses on these\nscales, a separate larger online sample online (N = 56 - 128) also rated these\nimages. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to compare the\nemotional content in the body maps with appraisals and visual features. A\npairwise distance matrix between the body maps generated for each stimulus was\nthen used in a whole brain voxel-wise searchlight analysis to identify brain\nregions which reflect the representational geometry of embodied emotion. This\nanalysis revealed a network including bilateral primary somatosensory and motor\ncortices, precuneus, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex.

    "abstract": "Dust polarization, which comes from the alignment of aspherical grains to\nmagnetic fields, has been widely employed to study the interstellar medium\n(ISM) dust properties. The wavelength dependence of the degree of optical\npolarization, known as the Serkowski relation, was a key observational\ndiscovery that advanced grain modeling and alignment theories. However, it was\nrecently shown that line-of-sight (LOS) variations in the structure of the ISM\nor the magnetic field morphology contaminate the constraints extracted from\nfits to the Serkowski relation. These cases can be identified by the\nwavelength-dependent variability in the polarization angles. We aim to\ninvestigate the extent to which we can constrain the intrinsic dust properties\nand alignment efficiency from dust polarization data, by accounting for LOS\nvariations of the magnetic field morphology. We employed archival data to fit\nthe Serkowski relation and constrain its free parameter. We explored potential\nimprints of LOS variations of the magnetic field morphology in these\nconstraints. We found that these LOS integration effects contaminate the\nmajority of the existing dataset, thus biasing the obtained Serkowski\nparameters by approximately 10%. The constancy of the polarization angles with\nwavelength does not necessarily guarantee the absence of 3D averaging effects.\nWe examined the efficiency of dust grains in polarizing starlight, as probed by\nthe ratio of the degree of polarization to dust reddening, E(B-V). We found\nthat all measurements respect the limit established by polarized dust emission\ndata. A suppression in polarization efficiencies occurs at E(B-V) close to 0.5\nmag, which we attribute to projection effects and may be unrelated to the\nintrinsic alignment of dust grains.",

Our findings provide new routes for interrogating\nand harnessing cavity-embedded quantum materials as quantum light sources, as a\nresource for photon-based computation and quantum sensing.",

Two\nsuch nearby systems are the infalling Milky Way (MW) dwarfs Leo~T and Phoenix\nlocated near the MW virial radius at $414 {\\rm kpc}\\,(1.4 R_{\\rm vir})$, both\nof which present intriguing offsets between their gaseous and stellar\ndistributions. Here we present hydrodynamic simulations with {\\sc ramses} to\nreproduce the observed dynamics of Leo~T: its $80{\\rm pc}$ stellar-HI offset\nand the 35{\\rm pc} offset between its older ($\\gtrsim 5{\\rm Gyr}$) and younger\n($\\sim\\!200\\!-\\!1000{\\rm Myr}$) stellar population. We considered internal and\nenvironmental properties such as stellar winds, two HI components, cored and\ncuspy dark matter profiles, and different satellite orbits considering the MW\ncircumgalactic medium. We find that the models that best match the observed\nmorphology of the gas and stars include mild stellar winds that interact with\nthe HI generating the observed offset, and dark matter profiles with extended\ncores. The latter allow long oscillations of the off-centred younger stellar\ncomponent, due to long mixing timescales ($\\gtrsim200 {\\rm Myr}$), and the slow\nprecession of near-closed orbits in the cored potentials; instead, cuspy and\ncompact cored dark matter models result in the rapid mixing of the material\n($\\lesssim 200{\\rm Myr}$). These models predict that non-equilibrium\nsubstructures, such as spatial and kinematic offsets, are likely to persist in\ncored low-mass dwarfs and to remain detectable on long timescales in systems\nwith recent star formation.",

While numerical\ncalculations using lattice quantum chromodynamics offer the most promising\napproach for this pursuit, practical implementation is arduous, especially due\nto the uncontrollable growth of quark-combinatorics, the so-called\nWick-contraction problem of nuclei. We present here two novel methods providing\na state-of-the-art solution to this problem. In the first, we exploit\nrandomized algorithms inspired from computational number theory to detect and\neliminate redundancies that arise in Wick contraction computations. Our second\nmethod explores facilities for automation of tensor computations -- in terms of\nefficient utilization of specialized hardware, algorithmic optimizations, as\nwell as ease of programming and the potential for automatic code generation --\nthat are offered by new programming models inspired by applications in machine\nlearning (e.g., TensorFlow). We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by\ncomputing two-point correlation functions for Deuteron, Helium-3, Helium-4 and\nLithium-7, achieving at least an order of magnitude improvement over existing\nalgorithms with efficient implementation on GPU-accelerators. Additionally, we\ndiscover an intriguing characteristic shared by all the nuclei we study:\nspecific spin-color combinations dominate the correlation functions, hinting at\na potential connection to an as-yet-unidentified symmetry in nuclei.

    "abstract": "In the last few decades planet search surveys have been focusing on solar\ntype stars, and only recently the high-mass regimes. This is mostly due to\nchallenges arising from the lack of instrumental precision, and more\nimportantly, the inherent active nature of fast rotating massive stars. Here we\nreport NGTS-33b (TOI-6442b), a super-Jupiter planet with mass, radius and\norbital period of 3.6 $\\pm$ 0.3 M$_{\\rm jup}$, 1.64 $\\pm$ 0.07 R$_{\\rm jup}$\nand $2.827972 \\pm 0.000001$ days, respectively.

Planet structure and Gyrochronology models shows\nthat NGTS-33 is also very young with age limits of 10-50 Myr. In addition,\nmembership analysis points towards the star being part of the Vela OB2\nassociation, which has an age of $\\sim$ 20-35 Myr, thus providing further\nevidences about the young nature of NGTS-33. Its low bulk density of\n0.19$\\pm$0.03 g cm$^{-3}$ is 13$\\%$ smaller than expected when compared to\ntransiting hot Jupiters with similar masses. Such cannot be solely explained by\nits age, where an up to 15$\\%$ inflated atmosphere is expected from planet\nstructure models. Finally, we found that its emission spectroscopy metric is\nsimilar to JWST community targets, making the planet an interesting target for\natmospheric follow-up. Therefore, NGTS-33b's discovery will not only add to the\nscarce population of young, massive and hot Jupiters, but will also help place\nfurther strong constraints on current formation and evolution models for such\nplanetary systems.",

Obtaining a complete inventory of these disks will\ntherefore give insights into giant planet formation. However, until now no\ncomplete disk survey has been done on Herbig disks in a single star-forming\nregion. Orion is the only nearby region with a significant number of Herbig\ndisks (N=35) to carry out such a survey. Using new NOEMA observations of 25\nHerbig disks, in combination with ALMA archival data of 10 Herbig disks,\nresults in a complete sample of all know Herbig disks in Orion. Using uv-plane\nanalysis for the NOEMA observed disks, and literature values of the ALMA\nobserved disks, we obtain the dust masses of all Herbig disks and obtain a\ncumulative dust mass distribution. Additionally, six disks with new CO\nisotopologues detections are presented, one of which is detected in C17O. We\ncalculate the external ultraviolet (UV) irradiance on each disk and compare the\ndust mass to it. We find a median disk dust mass of 11.7 M_\\oplus for the\nHerbig disks. Comparing the Herbig disks in Orion to previous surveys for\nmainly T Tauri disks in Orion, we find that while ~50% of the Herbig disks have\na mass higher than 10 M_\\oplus, this is at most 25% for the T~Tauri disks. This\ndifference is especially striking when considering that the Herbig disks are\naround a factor of two older than the T Tauri disks. Comparing to the Herbig\ndisks observed with ALMA from a previous study, no significant difference is\nfound between the distributions. We find a steeper (slope of -7.6) relationship\nbetween the dust mass and external UV irradation compared to that of the\nT~Tauri disks (slope of -1.3). This work shows the importance of complete\nsamples, giving rise to the need of a complete survey of the Herbig disk\npopulation.",

Recent comparisons between simulations and observations\nhave suggested a systematic difference of the c-M relation, with higher\nconcentrations in the latter. In this work, we undertake detailed comparisons\nbetween simulated galaxies and observations of a sample of strong-lensing\ngalaxies. We explore several factors of the comparison with strong\ngravitational lensing constraints, including the choice of the generic dark\nmatter density profile, the effect of radial resolution, the reconstruction\nlimits of observed versus simulated mass profiles, and the role of the initial\nmass function in the derivation of the dark matter parameters. Furthermore, we\nshow the dependence of the c-M relation on reconstruction and model errors\nthrough a detailed comparison of real and simulated gravitational lensing\nsystems. An effective reconciliation of simulated and observed c-M relations\ncan be achieved if one considers less strict assumptions on the dark matter\nprofile, for example, by changing the slope of a generic NFW profile or\nfocusing on rather extreme combinations of stellar-to-dark matter\ndistributions.

We introduce fermionic fault-tolerant\nquantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using\nnative fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects\nphase errors only. Within a fermionic color code, which corrects for both phase\nand loss errors, we then realize a universal fermionic gate set, including\ntransversal fermionic Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we\nintroduce qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for\nqubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in\nstate-of-the-art quantum algorithms.

ALMA Band 6 and 7 archival data are obtained for 34 IMTT disks with\ncontinuum observations, 32 of which have at least 12CO, 13CO, or C18O\nobservations although most of them at quite shallow integrations. The disk\nintegrated flux together with a stellar luminosity scaled disk temperature are\nused to obtain a total disk dust mass by assuming optically thin emission.\nUsing thermochemical Dust And LInes (DALI) models from previous work, we\nadditionally obtain gas masses of 10/35 of the IMTT disks based on the CO\nisotopologues. The IMTT disks in this study have the same dust mass and radius\ndistributions as Herbig disks. The dust mass of the IMTT disks is higher\ncompared to that of the T Tauri disks, as is also found for the Herbig disks.\nNo differences in dust mass are found for group I versus group II disks, in\ncontrast to Herbig disks. The disks for which a gas mass could be determined\nshow similar high mass disks as for the Herbig disks. Comparing the disk dust\nand gas mass distributions to the mass distribution of exoplanets shows that\nthere also is not enough dust mass in disks around intermediate mass stars to\nform the massive exoplanets. On the other hand there is more than enough gas to\nform the atmospheres of exoplanets. We conclude that the sampled IMTT disk\npopulation is almost indistinguishable compared to Herbig disks, as their disk\nmasses are the same, even though these are younger objects. Based on this, we\nconclude that planet formation is already well on its way in these objects, and\nthus planet formation should start early on in the lifetime of Herbig disks.",

    "abstract": "The growth of ionized hydrogen bubbles in the intergalactic medium around\nearly luminous objects is a fundamental process during the Epoch of\nReionization (EoR). In this study, we analyze bubble sizes and their evolution\nusing the state-of-the-art THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulation suite,\nwhich self-consistently models radiation transport and realistic galaxy\nformation throughout a large (95.5 cMpc)^3 volume of the Universe. Analogous to\nthe accretion and merger tree histories employed in galaxy formation\nsimulations, we characterize the growth and merger rates of ionized bubbles by\nfocusing on the spatially-resolved redshift of reionization. By tracing the\nchronological expansion of bubbles, we partition the simulation volume and\nconstruct a natural ionization history. We identify three distinct stages of\nionized bubble growth: (1) initial slow expansion around the earliest ionizing\nsources seeding formation sites, (2) accelerated growth through percolation as\nbubbles begin to merge, and (3) rapid expansion dominated by the largest\nbubble. Notably, we find that the largest bubble emerges by z=9-10, well before\nthe midpoint of reionization. This bubble becomes dominant during the second\ngrowth stage, and defines the third stage by rapidly expanding to eventually\nencompass the remainder of the simulation volume and becoming one of the few\nbubbles actively growing. Additionally, we observe a sharp decline in the\nnumber of bubbles with radii around ~10 cMpc compared to smaller sizes,\nindicating a characteristic scale in the final segmented bubble size\ndistribution. Overall, these chronologically sequenced spatial reconstructions\noffer crucial insights into the physical mechanisms driving ionized bubble\ngrowth during the EoR and provide a framework for interpreting the structure\nand evolution of reionization itself.",

    "abstract": "The bulk of old stars in the Galactic disk have migrated radially by up to\nseveral kpc in their lifetimes, yet the disk has remained relatively cool,\ni.e., the ratio of radial heating to migration has been small. Here, we\ndemonstrate that this small ratio places very strong constraints on which\nmechanisms could have been responsible for orbital transport in our Galaxy. For\ninstance, Sellwood & Binney's mechanism of nonlinear horseshoe transport by\nspirals tends to produce too high a ratio of heating to migration, unless the\nspirals' amplitudes are heavily suppressed away from their corotation\nresonances, or their pitch angles are significantly larger than is observed.\nThis problem is only made worse if one includes the effect of the Galactic bar,\ndiffusion due to disk or halo substructure, etc. Resonant (but non-horseshoe)\nscattering by spirals can drive transport consistent with the data, but even\nthis requires some fine-tuning. In short, reproducing both the observed radial\nmigration and the small ratio of heating to migration is a highly nontrivial\nrequirement, and poses a significant challenge to models of the Milky Way's\ndynamical history, theories of spiral structure, and the identification of\n'Milky Way analogues' in cosmological simulations.",

We build upon previous work by Sharbaf et al. that\nstudied the covariance of high quality SDSS continuum-subtracted spectra in a\nrelatively narrow range of velocity dispersion ($\\sigma\\in\n[100,150]$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$). Here the same analysis is applied to synthetic data\nfrom the EAGLE and Illustris TNG100 simulations, to assess the ability of these\nruns to mimic real galaxies. The real and simulated spectra are consistent\nregarding spectral covariance, although with subtle differences that can inform\nthe implementation of subgrid physics. Spectral fitting done a posteriori on\nstacks segregated with respect to latent space reveals that the first principal\ncomponent (PC1) is predominantly influenced by the stellar age distribution,\nwith an underlying age-metallicity degeneracy. Good agreement is found\nregarding star formation prescriptions but there is disagreement with AGN\nfeedback, that also affects the subset of quiescent galaxies. We show a\nsubstantial difference in the implementation of the AGN subgrid prescriptions,\nregarding central black hole seeding, that could lead to the mismatch.\nDifferences are manifest between these two simulations in the star formation\nhistories stacked with respect to latent space.

The aim of the\npresent study is to disentangle the nature of the transient AT 2021hdr, whose\noptical light curve used to be consistent with a classic Seyfert 1 nucleus,\nwhich was also confirmed by its optical spectrum and high-energy properties.\nFrom late 2021, AT 2021hdr started to present sudden brightening episodes in\nthe form of oscillating peaks in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert\nstream, and the same shape is observed in X-rays and UV from Swift data. The\noscillations occur every about 60-90 days with amplitudes of around 0.2 mag in\nthe g and r bands. Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations show no radio\nemission at milliarcseconds scale. It is argued that these findings are\ninconsistent with a standard tidal disruption event (TDE), a binary\nsupermassive black hole (BSMBH), or a changing-look active galactic nucleus\n(AGN); neither does this object resemble previous observed AGN flares, and disk\nor jet instabilities are an unlikely scenario. Here, we propose that the\nbehavior of AT 2021hdr might be due to the tidal disruption of a gas cloud by a\nBSMBH. In this scenario, we estimate that the putative binary has a separation\nof about 0.83 mpc and would merge in about 70000 years.

    "abstract": "Protein language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in\nprotein modeling and design, yet their internal mechanisms for predicting\nstructure and function remain poorly understood. Here we present a systematic\napproach to extract and analyze interpretable features from PLMs using sparse\nautoencoders (SAEs). By training SAEs on embeddings from the PLM ESM-2, we\nidentify up to 2,548 human-interpretable latent features per layer that\nstrongly correlate with up to 143 known biological concepts such as binding\nsites, structural motifs, and functional domains. In contrast, examining\nindividual neurons in ESM-2 reveals up to 46 neurons per layer with clear\nconceptual alignment across 15 known concepts, suggesting that PLMs represent\nmost concepts in superposition. Beyond capturing known annotations, we show\nthat ESM-2 learns coherent concepts that do not map onto existing annotations\nand propose a pipeline using language models to automatically interpret novel\nlatent features learned by the SAEs. As practical applications, we demonstrate\nhow these latent features can fill in missing annotations in protein databases\nand enable targeted steering of protein sequence generation. Our results\ndemonstrate that PLMs encode rich, interpretable representations of protein\nbiology and we propose a systematic framework to extract and analyze these\nlatent features.

Therefore,\nunsupervised methods are crucial to detect outliers if there is limited or no\ninformation about them. Global-Local Outlier Scores based on Hierarchies\n(GLOSH) is an unsupervised outlier detection method within HDBSCAN*, a\nstate-of-the-art hierarchical clustering method. GLOSH estimates outlier scores\nfor each data point by comparing its density to the highest density of the\nregion they reside in the HDBSCAN* hierarchy. GLOSH may be sensitive to\nHDBSCAN*'s minpts parameter that influences density estimation. With limited\nknowledge about the data, choosing an appropriate minpts value beforehand is\nchallenging as one or some minpts values may better represent the underlying\ncluster structure than others. Additionally, in the process of searching for\n``potential outliers'', one has to define the number of outliers n a dataset\nhas, which may be impractical and is often unknown. In this paper, we propose\nan unsupervised strategy to find the ``best'' minpts value, leveraging the\nrange of GLOSH scores across minpts values to identify the value for which\nGLOSH scores can best identify outliers from the rest of the dataset. Moreover,\nwe propose an unsupervised strategy to estimate a threshold for classifying\npoints into inliers and (potential) outliers without the need to pre-define any\nvalue. Our experiments show that our strategies can automatically find the\nminpts value and threshold that yield the best or near best outlier detection\nresults using GLOSH.",

The automorphism is described by a formally unitary intertwiner\nmapping the exact BRS operator associated to the gauge symmetry into its\nquadratic part.\n  The existence of an automorphism between local operators and the physical\nones, describing charged states, allows to retain many of the results derived\nin local operator algebras and extend them to the physical-but-nonlocal algebra\nof charged operators as we discuss in some simple applications of our\nconstruction.

The effect of the structure on\nfeasible values for the common correlation of returns and on the \"effective\ndegrees of freedom\" within the equity cross-section are discussed, as well as\nthe impact of this constraint on the asymptotic Normality of portfolio returns.\nAn eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix is presented and used to\npartition variance into that from a common \"market\" factor and\n\"non-diversifiable\" idiosyncratic risk. A empirical analysis of the recent\nhistory of the returns of S&P 500 Index members is presented and compared to\nthe expectations from both this model and linear factor models. This analysis\nsupports the isotropic covariance model and does not seem to provide evidence\nin support of linear factor models. Analysis of portfolio selection under\nisotropic correlation is presented using mean-variance optimization for both\nheteroskedastic and homoskedastic cases. Portfolio selection for negative\nexponential utility maximizers is also discussed for the general case of\ndistributions of returns with elliptical symmetry. The fact that idiosyncratic\nrisk may not be removed by diversification in a model that the data supports\nundermines the basic premises of structures such as the C.A.P.M. and A.P.T.

    "abstract": "Relationships of cause and effect are of prime importance for explaining\nscientific phenomena. Often, rather than just understanding the effects of\ncauses, researchers also wish to understand how a cause $X$ affects an outcome\n$Y$ mechanistically -- i.e., what are the causal pathways that are activated\nbetween $X$ and $Y$. For analyzing such questions, a range of methods has been\ndeveloped over decades under the rubric of causal mediation analysis.\nTraditional mediation analysis focuses on decomposing the average treatment\neffect (ATE) into direct and indirect effects, and therefore focuses on the ATE\nas the central quantity. This corresponds to providing explanations for\nassociations in the interventional regime, such as when the treatment $X$ is\nrandomized. Commonly, however, it is of interest to explain associations in the\nobservational regime, and not just in the interventional regime. In this paper,\nwe introduce \\text{variation analysis}, an extension of mediation analysis that\nfocuses on the total variation (TV) measure between $X$ and $Y$, written as\n$\\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid X=x_1] - \\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid X=x_0]$. The TV measure\nencompasses both causal and confounded effects, as opposed to the ATE which\nonly encompasses causal (direct and mediated) variations. In this way, the TV\nmeasure is suitable for providing explanations in the natural regime and\nanswering questions such as ``why is $X$ associated with $Y$?''. Our focus is\non decomposing the TV measure, in a way that explicitly includes direct,\nindirect, and confounded variations. Furthermore, we also decompose the TV\nmeasure to include interaction terms between these different pathways.\nSubsequently, interaction testing is introduced, involving hypothesis tests to\ndetermine if interaction terms are significantly different from zero. If\ninteractions are not significant, more parsimonious decompositions of the TV\nmeasure can be used.",

They\nare: (1) Don't claim superior performance without mentioning runtimes; (2)\nDon't report optimized results without mentioning the tuning time needed to\noptimize those results; (3) Don't claim faster runtimes for (or in comparison\nto) solvers running on imaginary platforms; and (4) No cherry-picking (without\njustification and qualification).

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that quantum mechanics cannot exhibit chaos, since\nunitarity of time evolution ensures that distances between quantum states are\npreserved. However, a parallel argument can be constructed in classical\nmechanics that would seem to deny the existence of classical chaos too. The\nargument works by describing classical states as probability distributions in\nphase space and showing that the inner product between distributions on phase\nspace is preserved under Liouvillian dynamics. Thus, the more faithful\nclassical analogy of a quantum state is not a single phase space trajectory but\nis instead a phase space distribution, and chaos in such states must be\nidentified by some statistical signatures instead of exponential separation of\nnearby states. The search for these signatures is the primary goal in quantum\nchaos research. However, this perspective also naturally motivates the search\nfor classical analogues of these signatures, to reveal the inner machinery of\nchaos in quantum systems. One widely recognized signature of chaos in quantum\nsystems is the dynamical generation of entanglement. Chaos in the classical\nsystem is correlated with a greater entanglement production in the\ncorresponding quantum system. One of the most well-studied examples of this is\nthe kicked top model. In this paper, we construct a classical analogue of\nbipartite entanglement in terms of the mutual information between phase space\ndistributions of subsystems and find completely analogous signatures of chaos\nas those found in entanglement for the kicked top Hamiltonian.",

However, making accurate\nabundance predictions for $^{205}$Pb has so far been impossible because the\nweak decay rates of $^{205}$Pb and $^{205}$Tl are very uncertain at stellar\ntemperatures. To constrain these decay rates, we measured for the first time\nthe bound-state $\\beta^-$ decay of fully ionized $^{205}$Tl$^{81+}$, an exotic\ndecay mode that only occurs in highly charged ions. The measured half-life is\n4.7 times longer than the previous theoretical estimate and our 10%\nexperimental uncertainty has eliminated the main nuclear-physics limitation.\nWith new, experimentally backed decay rates, we used AGB stellar models to\ncalculate $^{205}$Pb yields. Propagating those yields with basic galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) and comparing with the $^{205}$Pb/$^{204}$Pb ratio\nfrom meteorites, we determined the isolation time of solar material inside its\nparent molecular cloud. We find positive isolation times that are consistent\nwith the other s-process short-lived radioactive nuclei found in the early\nSolar System.

This\ncrystal determination approach does not rely on Fourier inversion but rather\nconsiders all structure parameter combinations consistent with available\ndiffraction data in a parameter space of dimension $m$. The method utilizes $m$\nstructure factor amplitudes or intensities represented by piece-wise analytic\nhyper-surfaces, to define the acceptable parameter regions. By employing the\nisosurfaces, the coordinates of the point scatterers are obtained through the\nintersection of multiple isosurfaces. This approach allows for the detection of\nall possible solutions for the given structure factor amplitudes in a single\nderivation. Taking the resonant contrast into account, the spatial resolution\nachieved by the presented method may exceed that of traditional Fourier\ninversion, and the algorithms can be significantly optimized by exploiting the\nsymmetry properties of the isosurfaces. The applied 1-dimensional projection\ndemonstrates the efficiency of the PSC linearization approach based on fewer\nreflections than Fourier sums. The Monte-Carlo simulations, using the\nprojections of various random two- and three-atom structure examples, are\npresented to illustrate the universal applicability of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, ongoing efforts aim to enhance the efficiency of data handling and\nto overcome current constraints, promising further advancements in the\ncapabilities and accuracy of the PSC framework.",

    "abstract": "Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with\ntrapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key\nlimitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in\ntypically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband\ntransitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light\nprofiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive;\nmotivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude\nstability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide\naddressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG)\nmodes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke\nregime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers\nsignificant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency\nbandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is\nsignificantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such\nconfigurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on\nlevel structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free\nconfigurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify\nperformance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to\nexperimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple\nstructured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for\nscalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "While machine-learned models are now routinely employed to facilitate\nastronomical inquiry, model inputs tend to be limited to a primary data source\n(namely images or time series) and, in the more advanced approaches, some\nmetadata. Yet with the growing use of wide-field, multiplexed observational\nresources, individual sources of interest often have a broad range of\nobservational modes available. Here we construct an astronomical multimodal\ndataset and propose AstroM$^3$, a self-supervised pre-training approach that\nenables a model to learn from multiple modalities simultaneously. Specifically,\nwe extend the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model to a trimodal\nsetting, allowing the integration of time-series photometry data, spectra, and\nastrophysical metadata. In a fine-tuning supervised setting, our results\ndemonstrate that CLIP pre-training improves classification performance for\ntime-series photometry, where accuracy increases from 84.6% to 91.5%.\nFurthermore, CLIP boosts classification accuracy by up to 12.6% when the\navailability of labeled data is limited, showing the effectiveness of\nleveraging larger corpora of unlabeled data. In addition to fine-tuned\nclassification, we can use the trained model in other downstream tasks that are\nnot explicitly contemplated during the construction of the self-supervised\nmodel. In particular we show the efficacy of using the learned embeddings for\nmisclassifications identification, similarity search, and anomaly detection.\nOne surprising highlight is the \"rediscovery\" of Mira subtypes and two\nRotational variable subclasses using manifold learning and dimension reduction\nalgorithm.

The rise in image resolution and frame rate substantially increases\ncomputational demands due to the increased number of input tokens. This\nchallenge is further exacerbated by the quadratic complexity with respect to\nsequence length of the self-attention mechanism. Most prior works either\npre-train models with long contexts, overlooking the efficiency problem, or\nattempt to reduce the context length via downsampling (e.g., identify the key\nimage patches or frames) to decrease the context length, which may result in\ninformation loss. To circumvent this issue while keeping the remarkable\neffectiveness of MLLMs, we propose a novel approach using a hybrid\ntransformer-MAMBA model to efficiently handle long contexts in multimodal\napplications. Our multimodal model can effectively process long context input\nexceeding 100k tokens, outperforming existing models across various benchmarks.\nRemarkably, our model enhances inference efficiency for high-resolution images\nand high-frame-rate videos by about 4 times compared to current models, with\nefficiency gains increasing as image resolution or video frames rise.\nFurthermore, our model is the first to be trained on low-resolution images or\nlow-frame-rate videos while being capable of inference on high-resolution\nimages and high-frame-rate videos, offering flexibility for inference in\ndiverse scenarios.",

[Gol23]\nderives these HDXs by sparsifying the complete Grassmann poset of subspaces.\nThe novelty in our construction is the ability to sparsify any expanding\nGrassmannian posets, leading to iterated sparsification and much smaller\ndegrees. The sparse Grassmannian (which is of independent interest in the\ntheory of HDXs) serves as the generating set of the Cayley graph.\n  Our second construction gives a 2-dimensional HDXs of any polynomial degree\n$\\exp(\\epsilon n$) for any constant $\\epsilon > 0$, which is simultaneously a\nspectral expander and a coboundary expander.

We name it the Johnson complex, as\nit is derived from the classical Johnson scheme, whose vertices serve as the\ngenerating set of this Cayley graph. This construction may be viewed as a\nderandomization of the recent random geometric complexes of [LMSY23].\nEstablishing coboundary expansion through Gromov's \"cone method\" and the\nassociated isoperimetric inequalities is the most intricate aspect of this\nconstruction.\n  While these two constructions are quite different, we show that they both\nshare a common structure, resembling the intersection patterns of vectors in\nthe Hadamard code.

This is the first framework to apply classifier-free guided\ndiffusion to quadruped locomotion and demonstrate its efficacy by extracting\ngoal-conditioned behaviour from an originally unlabelled dataset. We show that\nthese capabilities are compatible with a multi-skill policy and can be applied\nwith little modification and minimal compute overhead, i.e., running entirely\non the robots onboard CPU.

    "abstract": "The effect of replacing individual contributions to an empirical energy\nfunction are assessed for halogenated benzenes (X-Bz, X = H, F, Cl, Br) and\nchlorinated phenols (Cl-PhOH). Introducing electrostatic models based on\ndistributed charges (MDCM) instead of usual atom-centered point charges yields\noverestimated hydration free energies unless the van der Waals parameters are\nreparametrized. Scaling van der Waals ranges by 10 \\% to 20 \\% for three\nCl-PhOH and most X-Bz yield results within experimental error bars, which is\nencouraging, whereas for benzene (H-Bz) point charge-based models are\nsufficient. Replacing the bonded terms by a neural network-trained energy\nfunction with either fluctuating charges or MDCM electrostatics also yields\nqualitatively correct hydration free energies which still require adaptation of\nthe van der Waals parameters. The infrared spectroscopy of Cl-PhOH is rather\nwell predicted by all models although the ML-based energy function performs\nsomewhat better in the region of the framework modes. It is concluded that\nrefinements of empirical energy functions for targeted applications is a\nmeaningful way towards more quantitative simulations.",

We characterize the jet and outflow kinematics of the\nALMASOP sample in four representative sources (HOPS 10, 315, 358, and\nG203.21-11.20W2) through channel maps and position-velocity diagrams (PVDs)\nparallel and transverse to the outflow axes. The combined CO and SiO emission\nexhibits the coexistence of the conventional extremely-high-velocity (EHV) jets\nand shell-like low-velocity (LV) cavity walls and new features. More complex,\nnested bubble-like and filamentary structures in the images and channel maps,\ntriangle-shaped regions near the base of the parallel PVDs, and regions\ncomposed of rhombus/oval shapes in the transverse PVDs, are also evident. Such\nfeatures find natural explanations within the bubble structure of the unified\nmodel of jet, wind, and ambient medium. The reverse shock cavity is revealed on\nthe PVD base regions, and other features naturally arise within the dynamic\npostshock region of magnetic interaction. The finer nested shells observed\nwithin the compressed wind region reveal previously unnoticed shocked emission\nbetween the jet and the conventional large cavity walls. These\npseudopulse-produced filamentary features connect to the jet-like knotty blobs,\ncreating an impression of episodicity in mass ejection. SiO emission is\nenhanced downstream of the reverse shock boundary, with jet-like excitation\nconditions. Combined, these observed features reveal the extended structures\ninduced by the magnetic interplay between a jet-bearing magnetized wide-angle\nwind and its ambient magnetized surrounding medium.",

In this work, we present a probabilistic\nreduced-order modeling (ROM) framework to dramatically reduce the computational\neffort of such models while providing a credibility interval. In the online\nstage, a fast-to-evaluate generalized one-fiber model is considered. This\ngeneralized one-fiber model incorporates correction factors to emulate\npatient-specific attributes, such as local geometry variations. In the offline\nstage, Bayesian inference is used to calibrate these correction factors on\ntraining data generated using a full-order isogeometric cardiac model (FOM). A\nGaussian process is used in the online stage to predict the correction factors\nfor geometries that are not in the training data. The proposed framework is\ndemonstrated using two examples. The first example considers idealized\nleft-ventricle geometries, for which the behavior of the ROM framework can be\nstudied in detail. In the second example, the ROM framework is applied to\nscan-based geometries, based on which the application of the ROM framework in\nthe clinical setting is discussed. The results for the two examples convey that\nthe ROM framework can provide accurate online predictions, provided that\nadequate FOM training data is available.

Such CSs\nwhich are one-dimensional topological defects may be formed during various\nsymmetry-breaking and phase transition scenarios and can interact with the\nneutron stars.

Here we report the\ndiscovery of a Kondo-interacting topological antiferromagnet in the vdW 5$f$\nelectron system UOTe. It has a high antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition\ntemperature of 150 K, with a unique AFM configuration that breaks the combined\nparity and time reversal ($PT$) symmetry in an even number of layers while\nmaintaining zero net magnetic moment. Our angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal Dirac bands near the Fermi level,\nwhich combined with our theoretical calculations demonstrate UOTe as an AFM\nDirac semimetal. Within the AFM order, we observed the presence of the Kondo\ninteraction, as evidenced by the emergence of a 5$f$ flat band near the Fermi\nlevel below 100 K and hybridization between the Kondo band and the Dirac band.\nOur density functional theory calculations in its bilayer form predict UOTe as\na rare example of a fully-compensated AFM Chern insulator.",

The existing techniques\nfor learning DROCA rely on observing the behaviour of the DROCA up to\nexponentially large counter-values. Our algorithm eliminates this need and\nrequires only a polynomial number of queries. Additionally, our method differs\nfrom existing techniques as we learn a minimal counter-synchronous DROCA,\nresulting in much smaller counter-examples on equivalence queries. Learning a\nminimal counter-synchronous DROCA cannot be done in polynomial time unless P =\nNP, even in the case of visibly one-counter automata. We use a SAT solver to\novercome this difficulty. The solver is used to compute a minimal separating\nDFA from a given set of positive and negative samples.\n  We prove that the equivalence of two counter-synchronous DROCAs can be\nchecked significantly faster than that of general DROCAs. For visibly\none-counter automata, we have discovered an even faster algorithm for\nequivalence checking. We implemented the proposed learning algorithm and tested\nit on randomly generated DROCAs.

    "abstract": "The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been\nlargely improved by the introduction of novel non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).\nFurther improvements in PCE require a more comprehensive understanding of the\nfree charge generation process. Recently, the small PCE of donor-acceptor\nblends with low offsets between the relevant frontier orbitals was attributed\nto inefficient exciton dissociation. However, another source of photocurrent\nloss is the competition between exciton diffusion and decay, which is\nparticularly relevant for bilayers or bulk heterojunction blends with phase\nseparated morphology. Here, we present an analytical model that combines\nexciton diffusion with a set of rate equations based on Marcus theory of charge\ntransfer. An expression for the charge generation efficiency is derived from\nthe steady-state solution of the model. Thereby, the intrinsic exciton lifetime\nis identified as a pivotal parameter to facilitate efficient charge generation\nin spite of a vanishing driving force for exciton dissociation. The dynamic\nformulation of the model is used to elucidate the characteristic time scales of\ncharge generation. It is found that for low-offset systems, the pure diffusive\ntimes are considerably shorter than those associated with charge generation. It\ncan therefore be concluded that when estimating domain sizes via exciton\ndiffusion measurements, the assumption that excitons are instantaneously\nquenched at the donor-acceptor interface is only valid when a high driving\nforce for exciton dissociation is present. The model is applied to the\ntransient absorption dynamics of a PM6:Y6 blend. It is demonstrated that the\ncharge generation dynamics are determined by the interplay between exciton\ndiffusion and hole transfer kinetics, with an estimated Y6 domain size of 25nm,\nwhile interfacial charge transfer (CT) states separate rapidly into free\ncharges.",

Social\nvalue orientation is a framework from psychology, that posits that each player\nincorporates the other player's cost into their own objective function, based\non an individually pre-determined degree of cooperation. The degree of\ncooperation determines the weighting that a player puts on their own cost\nrelative to the other player's cost. We characterize the Nash equilibria of two\nplayer quadratic games under social value orientation by creating expansions\nthat elucidate the relative difference between this new equilibria (which we\nterm the SVO-Nash equilibria) and more typical equilibria, such as the\ncompetitive Nash equilibria, individually optimal solutions, and the fully\ncooperative solution. Specifically, each expansion parametrizes the space of\ncooperative Nash equilibria as a family of one-dimensional curves where each\ncurve is computed by solving an eigenvalue problem. We show that both bounded\nand unbounded equilibria may exist. For equilibria that are bounded, we can\nidentify bounds as the intersection of various ellipses; for equilibria that\nare unbounded, we characterize conditions under which unboundedness will occur,\nand also compute the asymptotes that the unbounded solutions follow.

Given a graph $G=(V, E)$,\nan unknown subgraph $G_p = (V, E_p)$ is realized where $E_p$ includes every\nedge of $E$ independently with some probability $p \\in (0, 1]$. The goal is to\nquery a sparse subgraph $H$ of $G$, such that the realized edges in $H$ include\nan approximate maximum matching of $G_p$.\n  This problem has been studied extensively over the last decade due to its\nnumerous applications in kidney exchange, online dating, and online labor\nmarkets. For any fixed $\\epsilon > 0$, [BDH STOC'20] showed that any graph $G$\nhas a subgraph $H$ with $\\text{quasipoly}(1/p) =\n(1/p)^{\\text{poly}(\\log(1/p))}$ maximum degree, achieving a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation. A major open question is the best approximation\nachievable with $\\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraphs. A long line of work has\nprogressively improved the approximation in the $\\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree\nregime from .5 [BDH+ EC'15] to .501 [AKL EC'17], .656 [BHFR SODA'19], .666 [AB\nSOSA'19], .731 [BBD SODA'22] (bipartite graphs), and most recently to .68 [DS\n'24]. In this work, we show that a $\\text{poly}(1/p)$-degree subgraph can\nobtain a $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation for any desirably small fixed $\\epsilon >\n0$, achieving the best of both worlds.\n  Beyond its quantitative improvement, a key conceptual contribution of our\nwork is to connect local computation algorithms (LCAs) to the stochastic\nmatching problem for the first time. While prior work on LCAs mainly focuses on\ntheir out-queries (the number of vertices probed to produce the output of a\ngiven vertex), our analysis also bounds the in-queries (the number of vertices\nthat probe a given vertex). We prove that the outputs of LCAs with bounded in-\nand out-queries (in-n-out LCAs for short) have limited correlation, a property\nthat our analysis crucially relies on and might find applications beyond\nstochastic matchings.",

This research proposes a definition with numerical limits\nfor how spicules appear in Mg II wavelengths, tunes an algorithm for\nautomatically detecting spicules in Mg II spectral observations, and uses K\nMeans Clustering to identify and display the full range of spicule spectrum\nshapes. This work will help allow statistical studies on spicules in the upper\nchromosphere to be as thorough as those of the lower chromosphere, allowing\nresearchers to better understand the physical nature of spicules and their role\nin energy transfer and deposition in the solar atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "This work focuses on the gradient flow dynamics of a neural network model\nthat uses correlation loss to approximate a multi-index function on\nhigh-dimensional standard Gaussian data. Specifically, the multi-index function\nwe consider is a sum of neurons $f^*(x) \\!=\\! \\sum_{j=1}^k \\! \\sigma^*(v_j^T\nx)$ where $v_1, \\dots, v_k$ are unit vectors, and $\\sigma^*$ lacks the first\nand second Hermite polynomials in its Hermite expansion. It is known that, for\nthe single-index case ($k\\!=\\!1$), overcoming the search phase requires\npolynomial time complexity. We first generalize this result to multi-index\nfunctions characterized by vectors in arbitrary directions. After the search\nphase, it is not clear whether the network neurons converge to the index\nvectors, or get stuck at a sub-optimal solution. When the index vectors are\northogonal, we give a complete characterization of the fixed points and prove\nthat neurons converge to the nearest index vectors. Therefore, using $n \\!\n\\asymp \\! k \\log k$ neurons ensures finding the full set of index vectors with\ngradient flow with high probability over random initialization. When $ v_i^T\nv_j \\!=\\! \\beta \\! \\geq \\! 0$ for all $i \\neq j$, we prove the existence of a\nsharp threshold $\\beta_c \\!=\\! c/(c+k)$ at which the fixed point that computes\nthe average of the index vectors transitions from a saddle point to a minimum.\nNumerical simulations show that using a correlation loss and a mild\noverparameterization suffices to learn all of the index vectors when they are\nnearly orthogonal, however, the correlation loss fails when the dot product\nbetween the index vectors exceeds a certain threshold.",

LLMs also serve as the\nworld model for deliberative reasoning in Reasoning via Planning (RAP) and Tree\nof Thought (ToT). However, the world models are either evaluated as a general\nworld simulator, or as a functional module of the agent, i.e., predicting the\ntransitions to assist the planning. In this work, we propose a comprehensive\nevaluation of the world models with LLMs from the decision making perspective.\nSpecifically, we leverage the 31 diverse environments from (Wang et al.,\n2023;2024) and curate the rule-based policy of each environment for the diverse\nevaluation. Then, we design three main tasks, i.e., policy verification, action\nproposal, and policy planning, where the world models can be used for decision\nmaking solely. Finally, we conduct the comprehensive evaluation of the advanced\nLLMs, i.e., GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, on the environments for the three main\ntasks under various settings. The key observations include: i) GPT-4o\nsignificantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini on the three main tasks, especially for\nthe tasks which require the domain knowledge, ii) the performance of the world\nmodel with LLM will be decreased for long-term decision-making tasks, and iii)\nthe combination of different functionalities of the world model will brings\nadditional unstabilities of the performance.",

To address this limitation, we propose a locally\nprivate sampling framework that leverages both the private and public datasets\nof each user. Specifically, we assume each user has two distributions: $p$ and\n$q$ that represent their private dataset and the public dataset, respectively.\nThe objective is to design a mechanism that generates a private sample\napproximating $p$ while simultaneously preserving $q$. We frame this objective\nas a minimax optimization problem using $f$-divergence as the utility measure.\nWe fully characterize the minimax optimal mechanisms for general\n$f$-divergences provided that $p$ and $q$ are discrete distributions.\nRemarkably, we demonstrate that this optimal mechanism is universal across all\n$f$-divergences.

Our study aims to fill this gap by providing a detailed analysis\non Cross-Lingual Multi-Transferability (many-to-many transfer learning), for\nthe recent IE corpora that cover a diverse set of languages. Specifically, we\nfirst determine the correlation between single-transfer performance and a wide\nrange of linguistic-based distances.

    "abstract": "We consider a stylized formal model of public transportation, where a set of\nagents need to travel along a given road, and there is a bus that runs the\nlength of this road. Each agent has a left terminal and a right terminal\nbetween which they wish to travel; they can walk all the way, or walk to/from\nthe nearest stop and use the bus for the rest of their journey. The bus can\nmake a fixed number of stops, and the planner needs to select locations for\nthese stops. We study notions of efficiency and fairness for this setting.\nFirst, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a solution that\nminimizes the total travel time; our approach can capture further extensions of\nthe base model, such as more general cost functions or existing infrastructure.\nSecond, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that outputs solutions with\nprovable fairness guarantees (such as a variant of the justified representation\naxiom or $2$-approximate core) as long as the agents' costs only depend on the\ndistance they need to walk. Our simulations indicate that our algorithm almost\nalways outputs fair solutions, even for parameter regimes that do not admit\ntheoretical guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Radiotherapy commonly relies on CT, but there is growing interest in\nusing hybrid PET/MR. Therefore, dedicated hardware setups have been proposed\nfor PET/MR systems which enable imaging in radiotherapy treatment position.\nThese radiotherapy setups typically include a flat tabletop, positioning tools\nand coil holders specifically tailored to the devices. However, reduced MR\nimage quality has been reported. Especially in neck and upper thorax,\nconventional radiotherapy setups are not optimal as they consist of head-only\ncoil configurations. The purpose was to develop a novel PET/MR radiotherapy\nsetup for improved MR image quality in head, neck and thorax and to test\ncompliance in a multicenter setting. Methods: A novel radiotherapy setup was\ndesigned, prototyped and tested on a 3T PET/MR system in three different\ncenters. Imaging experiments were conducted in phantoms and healthy volunteers\nto compare against a standard radiotherapy setup. Imaging protocols included\nT1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted MR (DWI). Finally, compliance with American\nCollege of Radiology (ACR) and the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance\n(QIBA) acceptance criteria was evaluated. Results: SNR in neck/thorax was\nincreased by a factor of 1.6 in phantom (p = 0.031) and volunteer images alike.\nThe new setup passed ACR detectability and QIBA SNR tests, which the standard\nsetup failed. The new setup passed all but two ACR test criteria in the three\ncenters, presented repeatability and reproducibility variations of 4.9% and\n7.8% and met all QIBA criteria for DWI except ADC precision. Conclusion: The\nproposed setup yielded significantly higher SNR, better detectability, and\ncomplied with nearly all ACR and QIBA image quality criteria. It may thus\nadvance the usage of PET/MR for radiotherapy purposes.",

    "abstract": "In broad terms, accessibility measures opportunities reachable (such as\nshops, residents, etc.) within a given time frame. Urban Rail Transit (URT)\nplays a crucial role in providing accessibility, but it is susceptible to\ndisruptions. In city centers with dense public transport (PT) networks,\ntravelers can often find alternative lines. However, in suburbs where PT is\nsparse, disruptions have a more significant impact on accessibility. The\ntraditional approach consists in deploying bridge and replacement buses to\nmitigate URT disruptions without specific care to accessibility. Yet, the\nquestion arises: is this approach the most effective way to restore\naccessibility? To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to propose\na bus re-routing method with the objective of restoring accessibility during\nURT disruptions. We formulate an integer program and develop a two-stage\nheuristic algorithm to maximize restored accessibility. The efficacy of our\nmethod is always the present assessed in \\'Evry-Courcouronnes and\nChoisy-le-Roi, France. The results show that, compared to conventional\nreplacement methods, our strategy improves accessibility in particular in the\nareas most affected by the disruption. Such results are observed even when no\nadditional vehicles are deployed, and at the same time, achieving a reduction\nin the kilometers traveled. Despite it is well understood that accessibility is\nthe most relevant benefit a transportation system can produce, this aspect is\nreflected by the traditional approaches in remediation to disruption. With this\nwork, we show instead how to make accessibility the main guiding principle in\nremediation.",

Adapting the splitting criterion of DRF, we show\nhow one forest fit can be used to obtain a consistent and asymptotically normal\nestimator of the CKTE, as well as an approximation of its sampling\ndistribution. This allows to study the difference in distribution between\ncontrol and treatment group and thus yields a more comprehensive understanding\nof the treatment effect.

In\nthis paper (part II), we present an extended case study based around a\ntwo-stage group sequential trial, including a comprehensive simulation study of\nthe proposed CIs for this setting. This facilitates an expanded description of\nconsiderations around what makes for an effective CI procedure following an\nadaptive trial. We show that the CIs can have notably different properties.\nFinally, we propose a set of guidelines for researchers around the choice of\nCIs and the reporting of CIs following an adaptive design.",

Initial analyses revealed significant correlations with\nmethane concentrations, leading to the application of Variance Inflation Factor\n(VIF) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to address multicollinearity and\nenhance model stability. Subsequently, machine learning models - specifically\nRandom Forest and Neural Networks - were employed to evaluate feature\nimportance and predict methane emissions.

    "abstract": "In view of the fact that semi- and self-supervised learning share a\nfundamental principle, effectively modeling knowledge from unlabeled data,\nvarious semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods have integrated\nrepresentative self-supervised learning paradigms for further regularization.\nHowever, the potential of the state-of-the-art generative self-supervised\nparadigm, masked image modeling, has been scarcely studied. This paradigm\nlearns the knowledge through establishing connections between the masked and\nvisible parts of masked image, during the pixel reconstruction process. By\ninheriting and extending this insight, we successfully leverage masked image\nmodeling to boost semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel class-wise masked image modeling that independently\nreconstructs different image regions according to their respective classes. In\nthis way, the mask-induced connections are established within each class,\nmitigating the semantic confusion that arises from plainly reconstructing\nimages in basic masked image modeling. To strengthen these intra-class\nconnections, we further develop a feature aggregation strategy that minimizes\nthe distances between features corresponding to the masked and visible parts\nwithin the same class. Additionally, in semantic space, we explore the\napplication of masked image modeling to enhance regularization. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on well-known benchmarks demonstrate that our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/haoxt/S4MIM.",

    "abstract": "The widespread implementation of urban surveillance systems has necessitated\nmore sophisticated techniques for anomaly detection to ensure enhanced public\nsafety. This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of anomaly\ndetection through the application of Two-Stream Inflated 3D (I3D) Convolutional\nNetworks. These networks substantially outperform traditional 3D Convolutional\nNetworks (C3D) by more effectively extracting spatial and temporal features\nfrom surveillance videos, thus improving the precision of anomaly detection.\nOur research advances the field by implementing a weakly supervised learning\nframework based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uniquely\nconceptualizes surveillance videos as collections of 'bags' that contain\ninstances (video clips). Each instance is innovatively processed through a\nranking mechanism that prioritizes clips based on their potential to display\nanomalies. This novel strategy not only enhances the accuracy and precision of\nanomaly detection but also significantly diminishes the dependency on extensive\nmanual annotations. Moreover, through meticulous optimization of model\nsettings, including the choice of optimizer, our approach not only establishes\nnew benchmarks in the performance of anomaly detection systems but also offers\na scalable and efficient solution for real-world surveillance applications.\nThis paper contributes significantly to the field of computer vision by\ndelivering a more adaptable, efficient, and context-aware anomaly detection\nsystem, which is poised to redefine practices in urban surveillance.",

Our key hypothesis is that the more accurately an individual view\ncan predict a view-agnostic text summary, the more informative it is. To put\nthis into action, we propose LangView, a framework that uses the relative\naccuracy of view-dependent caption predictions as a proxy for best view\npseudo-labels. Then, those pseudo-labels are used to train a view selector,\ntogether with an auxiliary camera pose predictor that enhances\nview-sensitivity. During inference, our model takes as input only a multi-view\nvideo--no language or camera poses--and returns the best viewpoint to watch at\neach timestep.

The adhesive\nresponse is strongly influenced by the morphology of these pillars. In typical\nexisting models, perfect bonding conditions are assumed between the pillar and\nthe countersurface, and solely the detachment process of the pillar from the\ncountersurface is investigated.\n  The proposed model, based on the assumption that interactions at the\ninterface are governed by van der Waals forces modeled by the Lennard-Jones\npotential law, enables the examination of the entire approach and retraction\ncycle, tracking the movement of the pillar towards and away from the\ncountersurface.\n  Our findings reveal that adhesive contact mechanics is primarily influenced\nby the geometry of the pillar and the potential presence of interfacial\n'defects', which in turn affect the distribution of contact pressure.\nFurthermore, we show that the detachment process may simultaneously involve\nvarious modes of separation, such as crack propagation from outer edge, crack\npropagation from inner defects, and uniform decohesion. This suggests that\nexisting theoretical models alone cannot fully elucidate the complexity of\ndetachment phenomena. Additionally, we anticipate the occurrence of hysteretic\nlosses during the approach-retraction cycle, attributed to pull-in and pull-off\ncontact jumps. Adhesive hysteresis is a phenomenon consistently observed in\nexperiments but frequently overlooked in existing models.",

Compared to most studies that focus on continuous\nspeech features, although discrete-token based LLMs have shown promising\nresults on certain tasks, the performance gap between these two paradigms is\nrarely explored. In this paper, we present a fair and thorough comparison\nbetween discrete and continuous features across a variety of semantic-related\ntasks using a light-weight LLM (Qwen1.5-0.5B). Our findings reveal that\ncontinuous features generally outperform discrete tokens, particularly in tasks\nrequiring fine-grained semantic understanding. Moreover, this study goes beyond\nsurface-level comparison by identifying key factors behind the\nunder-performance of discrete tokens, such as limited token granularity and\ninefficient information retention.

    "abstract": "Which neural networks are similar is a fundamental question for both machine\nlearning and neuroscience. Here, it is proposed to base comparisons on the\npredictive distributions of linear readouts from intermediate representations.\nIn Bayesian statistics, the prior predictive distribution is a full description\nof the inductive bias and generalization of a model, making it a great basis\nfor comparisons. This distribution directly gives the evidence a dataset would\nprovide in favor of the model. If we want to compare multiple models to each\nother, we can use a metric for probability distributions like the\nJensen-Shannon distance or the total variation distance. As these are metrics,\nthis induces pseudo-metrics for representations, which measure how well two\nrepresentations could be distinguished based on a linear read out. For a linear\nreadout with a Gaussian prior on the read-out weights and Gaussian noise, we\ncan analytically compute the (prior and posterior) predictive distributions\nwithout approximations. These distributions depend only on the linear kernel\nmatrix of the representations in the model. Thus, the Bayesian metrics connect\nto both linear read-out based comparisons and kernel based metrics like\ncentered kernel alignment and representational similarity analysis. The new\nmethods are demonstrated with deep neural networks trained on ImageNet-1k\ncomparing them to each other and a small subset of the Natural Scenes Dataset.\nThe Bayesian comparisons are correlated to but distinct from existing metrics.\nEvaluations vary slightly less across random image samples and yield\ninformative results with full uncertainty information. Thus the proposed\nBayesian metrics nicely extend our toolkit for comparing representations.",

The obtained construction\nhas a minimal interior dimension of $1$, independent of input and output\ndimensions, which allows us to show that autoencoders with leaky ReLU\nactivations are universal approximators of $L^p$ functions.

    "abstract": "Understanding the interplay of non-Hermiticity and topology is crucial given\nthe intrinsic openness of most natural and engineered systems and it has\nimportant ramifications in topological lasers and sensors. Intense efforts have\nbeen devoted to unveiling how non-Hermiticity may impact the most significant\nfeatures of topological systems, but only recently it has been theoretically\nproposed that topological features could originate solely from the system's\nnon-Hermiticity in photonic systems. In this work, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the appearance of non-Hermitian topology exclusively from loss\nmodulation in a photonic system that is topologically trivial in the absence of\nloss. We do this by implementing a non-Hermitian generalization of an\nAubry-Andre-Harper model with purely imaginary potential in a programmable\nintegrated photonics platform, which allows us to investigate different\nperiodic and quasi-periodic configurations of the model. In both cases, we show\nthe emergence of topological edge modes and explore their resilience to\ndifferent kinds of disorder. Our work highlights loss engineering as a\nmechanism to generate topological properties.",

To\naccelerate researchers' knowledge acquisition and intelligent decision-making\nsupport in materials science research, this paper proposes a large language\nmodel Polymetis model for a variety of materials fields, aiming to provide\nhighly professional knowledge answers in the field of materials, covering\nenergy materials, functional materials, alloy materials, physical chemistry,\nbiology, and other material directions.

We inject this data into the GLM4-9B model for learning\nto enhance its inference capabilities in a variety of material domains.

    "abstract": "Robots in human-centered environments require accurate scene understanding to\nperform high-level tasks effectively. This understanding can be achieved\nthrough instance-aware semantic mapping, which involves reconstructing elements\nat the level of individual instances. Neural networks, the de facto solution\nfor scene understanding, still face limitations such as overconfident incorrect\npredictions with out-of-distribution objects or generating inaccurate\nmasks.Placing excessive reliance on these predictions makes the reconstruction\nsusceptible to errors, reducing the robustness of the resulting maps and\nhampering robot operation. In this work, we propose Voxeland, a probabilistic\nframework for incrementally building instance-aware semantic maps. Inspired by\nthe Theory of Evidence, Voxeland treats neural network predictions as\nsubjective opinions regarding map instances at both geometric and semantic\nlevels. These opinions are aggregated over time to form evidences, which are\nformalized through a probabilistic model. This enables us to quantify\nuncertainty in the reconstruction process, facilitating the identification of\nmap areas requiring improvement (e.g. reobservation or reclassification). As\none strategy to exploit this, we incorporate a Large Vision-Language Model\n(LVLM) to perform semantic level disambiguation for instances with high\nuncertainty. Results from the standard benchmarking on the publicly available\nSceneNN dataset demonstrate that Voxeland outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nhighlighting the benefits of incorporating and leveraging both instance- and\nsemantic-level uncertainties to enhance reconstruction robustness. This is\nfurther validated through qualitative experiments conducted on the real-world\nScanNet dataset.",

Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs), which have achieved\nnotable success across a variety of vision and language tasks, shed light to\ngenerating both ingredients and instructions directly from images.\nNevertheless, LMMs still face the common issue of hallucinations during recipe\ngeneration, leading to suboptimal performance.

We first\nintroduce Stochastic Diversified Retrieval Augmentation (SDRA) to retrieve\nrecipes semantically related to the image from an existing datastore as a\nsupplement, integrating them into the prompt to add diverse and rich context to\nthe input image. Additionally, Self-Consistency Ensemble Voting mechanism is\nproposed to determine the most confident prediction recipes as the final\noutput. It calculates the consistency among generated recipe candidates, which\nuse different retrieval recipes as context for generation.

The\navailable rovibrational rate coefficients for water have been calculated using\na number of approximations. We present a numerically exact calculation for the\nrovibrational quenching for all water vibrational modes due to collisions with\natomic hydrogen. The scattering theory implements a quantum close-coupling (CC)\nmethod on a high level ab initio six-dimensional (6D) potential energy surface\n(PES). Total rovibrational quenching cross sections for excited bending levels\nwere compared with earlier results on a 4D PES with the rigid-bender\nclose-coupling (RBCC) approximation. General agreement between 6D-CC and\n4D-RBCC calculations are found, but differences are evident including the\nenergy and amplitude of low-energy orbiting resonances. Quenching cross\nsections from the symmetric and asymmetric stretch modes are provided for the\nfirst time. The current 6D-CC calculation provides accurate inelastic data\nneeded for astrophysical modeling.",

    "abstract": "Most existing work on event extraction has focused on sentence-level texts\nand presumes the identification of a trigger-span -- a word or phrase in the\ninput that evokes the occurrence of an event of interest. Event arguments are\nthen extracted with respect to the trigger. Indeed, triggers are treated as\nintegral to, and trigger detection as an essential component of, event\nextraction. In this paper, we provide the first investigation of the role of\ntriggers for the more difficult and much less studied task of document-level\nevent extraction. We analyze their usefulness in multiple end-to-end and\npipelined transformer-based event extraction models for three document-level\nevent extraction datasets, measuring performance using triggers of varying\nquality (human-annotated, LLM-generated, keyword-based, and random). We find\nthat whether or not systems benefit from explicitly extracting triggers depends\nboth on dataset characteristics (i.e. the typical number of events per\ndocument) and task-specific information available during extraction (i.e.\nnatural language event schemas). Perhaps surprisingly, we also observe that the\nmere existence of triggers in the input, even random ones, is important for\nprompt-based in-context learning approaches to the task.",

Although program synthesis\napproaches have strong generalization power, they face scaling issues due to\nlarge combinatorial spaces that quickly make them impractical and require\nhuman-generated DSLs or pre-trained priors to narrow this search space. On the\nother hand, deep learning methods have had high successes, but they lack\nstructured test-time adaptation and rely on heavy stochastic sampling or\nexpensive gradient updates for fine-tuning. In this work, we propose the Latent\nProgram Network (LPN), a new architecture that builds in test-time search\ndirectly into neural models. LPN learns a latent space of implicit\nprograms--neurally mapping inputs to outputs--through which it can search using\ngradients at test time. LPN combines the adaptability of symbolic approaches\nand the scalability of neural methods. It searches through a compact latent\nspace at test time and bypasses the need for pre-defined domain-specific\nlanguages. On a range of programming-by-examples tasks, LPN either outperforms\nor matches performance compared to in-context learning and test-time training\nmethods. Tested on the ARC-AGI benchmark, we demonstrate that LPN can both\nlearn a compact program space and search through it at test time to adapt to\nnovel tasks. LPN doubles its performance on out-of-distribution tasks when\ntest-time search is switched on.",

Galactic winds contain a hot and diffuse phase detected\nin X-rays, and a cold and dense phase detected via emission and absorption\nlines from the ions populating the outflow. The ion production within galactic\nwinds largely depends on the background UV radiation field produced by star\nformation, and this in turn depends on the age of the starburst, the gas\nmetallicity, the proximity of the outflowing gas to the central star-forming\nregions. Our study probes the influence of the proximity of wind-cloud systems\nto the UV background source, and the effects of magnetic fields on the N V ion\nproduction through the analysis of synthetic column densities and spectral\nlines. We utilise magnetohydrodynamical simulations to study weakly-magnetised\nwind-cloud systems, and extract synthetic spectral lines with Trident and yt.\nOur simulations indicate that magnetic fields transverse to the wind have a\nshielding effect on dense gas, producing broader N V absorption lines. Also, a\nweak (distant) UV background produces N V only in the outer cloud layers with\nno spectral signature, while a strong (nearby) UV background produces it in the\ncloud core with a narrow spectral line. Overall, transverse magnetic fields and\na UV radiation at 50 kpc produce the stronger N V spectral lines.",

In this\npaper, we propose FedSub, a novel federated approach designed to enhance\npersonalization through the use of class-aware prototypes and model\nsubnetworks. Prototypes serve as compact representations of user data,\nclustered on the server to identify similarities based on specific label\npatterns. Concurrently, subnetworks -- model components necessary to process\neach class -- are extracted locally and fused by the server according to these\nclusters, producing highly tailored model updates for each user. This\nfine-grained, class-specific aggregation of clients' models allows FedSub to\ncapture the unique characteristics of individual user data patterns. The\neffectiveness of FedSub is validated in three real-world scenarios\ncharacterized by high data heterogeneity, derived from human activity\nrecognition and mobile health applications.

    "abstract": "The inherent complexity of biological agents often leads to motility behavior\nthat appears to have random components. Robust stochastic inference methods are\ntherefore required to understand and predict the motion patterns from time\ndiscrete trajectory data provided by experiments. In many cases second order\nLangevin models are needed to adequately capture the motility. Additionally,\npopulation heterogeneity needs to be taken into account when analyzing data\nfrom several individual organisms. In this work, we describe a maximum\nlikelihood approach to infer dynamical, stochastic models and, simultaneously,\nestimate the heterogeneity in a population of motile active particles from\ndiscretely sampled, stochastic trajectories. To this end we propose a new\nmethod to approximate the likelihood for non-linear second order Langevin\nmodels. We show that this maximum likelihood ansatz outperforms alternative\napproaches especially for short trajectories. Additionally, we demonstrate how\na measure of uncertainty for the heterogeneity estimate can be derived. We\nthereby pave the way for the systematic, data-driven inference of dynamical\nmodels for actively driven entities based on trajectory data, deciphering\ntemporal fluctuations and inter-particle variability.",

The solver is tested on three benchmark cases to\nassess the performance of different numerical configurations.

Often these representations are\npaired, enabling experiments with analogies (pairs within the same domain) and\ncross-modality (pairs across domains). These experiments are based on specific\nassumptions about the geometry of embedding spaces, which allow finding paired\nitems by extrapolating the positional relationships between embedding pairs in\nthe training dataset, allowing for tasks such as finding new analogies, and\nmultimodal zero-shot classification. In this work, we propose a metric to\nevaluate the similarity between paired item representations. Our proposal is\nbuilt from the structural similarity between the nearest-neighbors induced\ngraphs of each representation, and can be configured to compare spaces based on\ndifferent distance metrics and on different neighborhood sizes. We demonstrate\nthat our proposal can be used to identify similar structures at different\nscales, which is hard to achieve with kernel methods such as Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). We further illustrate our method with two case studies: an\nanalogy task using GloVe embeddings, and zero-shot classification in the\nCIFAR-100 dataset using CLIP embeddings. Our results show that accuracy in both\nanalogy and zero-shot classification tasks correlates with the embedding\nsimilarity.

It would be due\nto the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is\ndescribed by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital\nprecessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object,\ncalculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully\nreproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\\ast$. In\nparticular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of\nthe accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular\norbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring\nprecessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\\pm\n0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically\nmeaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the\neffective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii.\nRelying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the\nangle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the\nyears amounting to $1.16^\\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of\n$1.25^\\circ\\pm 0.18^\\circ$.

This is an exponential\nimprovement over a result of Galvin, Rival, and Sands (1982) and comes close to\na recent upper bound of order $O((\\log \\log n)^2)$.\n  Another way to approach this problem is by viewing $G$ as an ordered graph\n(where the vertices are ordered according to their position on the path $P$).\nFrom this point of view it is most natural to consider which ordered subgraphs\nneed to be forbidden in order to force the existence of a long induced path.\nFocusing on the exclusion of ordered matchings, we improve or recover a number\nof existing results with much simpler proofs, in a unified way.

In this paper, we\nchallenge that convention by introducing a finite-alphabet-aware framework for\njoint trajectory and precoder optimization in UAV-assisted relay systems. We\nformulate a non-convex design problem that directly accounts for discrete\nsignal structures and propose an efficient solution based on alternating\noptimization and successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal\nthat strategies optimized under Gaussian assumptions can waste energy and\ndegrade throughput in real deployments. In contrast, our approach adapts both\nthe UAV's trajectory and transmission strategy to the underlying modulation\nformat, delivering consistent performance gains under practical system\nconstraints.

This is due to an increasing number of distributed energy\nresources, such as photovoltaic generators, battery storage systems, heat pumps\nand electric vehicles, as well as a shift towards active distribution grids.\nObtaining physically-based models for simulation and control synthesis can\ntherefore become challenging. Differential equations, where the right-hand side\nis represented by a neural network, i.e., neural ordinary differential\nequations (NODEs), have a great potential to serve as a data-driven black-box\nmodel to overcome this challenge. This paper explores their use in identifying\nthe dynamics of droop-controlled grid-forming units based on inputs and state\nmeasurements. In numerical studies, various NODE structures used with different\nnumerical solvers are trained and evaluated. Moreover, they are compared to the\nsparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method. The results\ndemonstrate that even though SINDy yields more accurate models, NODEs achieve\ngood prediction performance without prior knowledge about the system's\nnonlinearities which SINDy requires to work best.",

However, we find that, the more realistic\nthe generated images, the more they deviate from the ground truth, making them\ninappropriate for training and evaluation. Enhancements of realistic details,\nsuch as clothing and facial expressions, can lead to subtle yet significant\ndeviations from the ground truth, potentially misleading training models. We\nempirically verify that this misalignment causes the accuracy of HPS networks\nto decline when trained with generated images. To address this, we design a\ncontrollable synthesis method that effectively balances image realism with\nprecise ground truth. We use this to create the Generative BEDLAM (Gen-B)\ndataset, which improves the realism of the existing synthetic BEDLAM dataset\nwhile preserving ground truth accuracy. We perform extensive experiments, with\nvarious noise-conditioning strategies, to evaluate the tradeoff between visual\nrealism and HPS accuracy. We show, for the first time, that generative image\nmodels can be controlled by traditional graphics methods to produce training\ndata that increases the accuracy of HPS methods.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and complete aerodynamic data sets are the basis for comprehensive\nand accurate evaluation of the overall performance of aircraft. However, the\nsampling cost of full-state aerodynamic data is extremely high, and there are\noften differences between wind tunnel conditions and actual flight conditions.\nConventional scaling parameter extraction methods can solve the problem of\naerodynamic state extrapolation, but hard to achieve data migration and shape\ngeneralization. In order to realize the low-cost construction of a full-state\nnonlinear aerodynamic database, this research proposes the Scaling Function\nLearning (SFL) method. In SFL method, symbolic regression is used to mine the\ncomposite function expression of aerodynamic force coefficient for a relatively\ncomplete aerodynamic data set of typical aircraft. The inner layer of the\nfunction represents a scaling function. The SFL method was validated on the\nHB-2 by extracting scaling parameters for axial force coefficients and\ngeneralizing the scaling function by releasing its constants. The effectiveness\nand accuracy of the scaling function are verified using different hypersonic\naircraft configurations, such as HBS, double ellipsoid, sharp cone, and double\ncone missile. The results show that the extracted scaling function has the\nability to generalize across states and configurations. With only 3-4 state\nsamples, the aerodynamic database construction of variable Mach number, angle\nof attack and Reynolds number can be realized, which shows great state\nextrapolation ability with a relative error of about 1-5%. This research also\nlays a methodological foundation for parameter space dimensionality reduction\nand small sample modeling of other complex high-dimensional engineering\nproblems.",

    "abstract": "Advanced Air Mobility aircraft require energy efficient flight plans to be\neconomically viable. This paper defines minimum energy direct trajectories\nbetween waypoints for Lift+Cruise electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing\n(eVTOL) aircraft. Energy consumption is optimized over accelerated and cruise\nflight profiles with consideration of mode transitions. Because eVTOL\noperations start and end in hover for vertical take-off and landing, hover\nwaypoints are utilized. Energy consumption is modeled as a function of airspeed\nfor each flight mode, providing the basis to prove energy optimality for\nmulti-mode traversal. Wind magnitude and direction dictate feasibility of\nstraight-line traversal because Lift+Cruise aircraft point into the relative\nwind direction while hovering but also have a maximum heading rate constraint.\nEnergy and power use for an experimentally validated QuadPlane small eVTOL\naircraft are characterized with respect to airspeed and acceleration in all\nflight modes. Optimal QuadPlane traversals are presented. Constraints on\nacceleration and wind are derived for straight-line QuadPlane traversal.\nResults show an optimal QuadPlane $500m$ traversal between hover waypoints\nsaves $71\\%$ energy compared to pure vertical flight traversal for a\nrepresentative case study with a direct $4m/s$ crosswind.

The\ntransverse momentum distributions of these strange particles have been\nprocessed using two statistical models, the Tsallis and the modified Hagedorn\nmodel. Both models fit the experimental data well. We extracted different\nfreezeout parameters from the fit procedure using the abovementioned functions.\nWe found that with increasing the collision energy, the effective temperature\n(T), in the case of the Tsallis model, and kinetic/thermal freeze-out\ntemperature (T0) and transverse flow velocity, in the case of the modified\nHagedorn model, increase because of greater energy transfer among the\nparticipants at higher colliding energies. Both T and T0 are observed to\nincrease with the increase in the rest masses of the outgoing particles\nrevealing the multi-freeze-out scenario. Furthermore, the multiplicity\nparameter (N0) decreases with the increase in the particle mass, confirming the\nmass differential freeze-out scenario. An inverse relationship between the\nnon-extensivity parameter (q) and the masses of the produced particles has been\nnoticed. Similarly, an inverse correlation between q and T has been found.

Turbulent fluctuations are introduced\nsynthetically into a mean flow, and the droplet is inserted when the air-phase\nturbulence reaches a statistically stationary state. The morphological\nevolution of the droplet under different turbulence configurations is retrieved\nand analysed in comparison with laminar aerobreakup results. While the detailed\nevolution history of individual droplets varies widely between different\nrealisations of the turbulent flow, common dynamic and morphological evolution\npatterns are observed. The presence of turbulence is found to enhance the drag\ncoefficient of the droplet as it flattens. At late times, the droplet becomes\ntilted and increasingly corrugated under strong turbulence intensity. We\nquantify these phenomena and discuss their possible governing mechanisms\nassociated with turbulence intermittency. Lastly, the influences of liquid-gas\nviscosity ratio are examined and the implications of air-phase turbulence on\nthe later bag film breakup process are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A method for measuring the electrical connectivity between parts of a\nrectangular superconductor was developed for weak links making an arbitrary\nangle with the long side of the sample. The method is based on magneto-optical\nobservation of characteristic lines where the critical current makes\ndiscontinuous deviations in the flow direction to adapt to the non-uniform\ncondition created by the presence of the weak link. Assuming the Bean critical\nstate model in the full penetration regime for a sample submitted to a\nperpendicular magnetic field, the complete flow pattern of screening currents\nis reconstructed, from which the transparency of the weak link, i.e., the ratio\nbetween its critical current and that of the pristine sample, $\\tau =\n\\frac{J_i}{J_c}$, is then related to the angle $\\theta$ formed by two\ncharacteristic discontinuity lines which, in turn, are intimately associated to\nthe presence of the weak link. The streamline distribution is compared with\nmagneto-optical observations of the flux penetration in Nb superconducting\nfilms, where a weak link was created using focused ion beam milling. The\npresent work generalizes previous analyses in which the weak link was\nperpendicular to the long sides of the rectangular sample. Equations and\nmeasurements demonstrate that the relationship between the transparency and the\nangle $\\theta$ is not affected by the tilting of the weak link. Noticeably, in\norder to attain optimum connectivity, the weak link critical current can be\nless than that of the pristine sample, namely, $\\tau _{max}=\\sin \\Phi$, where\n$\\Phi$ is the tilt angle of the weak link. This expression generalizes the\nprevious result of $\\tau _{max}=1$ for $\\Phi=$ 90$^\\circ$.",

To address these issues, we developed a conceptual model\nto detect refactoring dangers, and created an Eclipse plugin based upon this\nmodel, called ReFD.\n  Every refactoring can be partitioned in microsteps, each of which carries\npotential risks. ReFD evaluates a given code context to identify if these\npotential risks are present, making them actual risks, and employs a verdict\nmechanism to reduce false positives. To facilitate the risk detection, several\ncomponents called detectors and subdetectors are defined, which can be reused\nfor multiple refactorings. The tool was validated by implementing the detection\nfor multiple refactorings, which produce the expected information about the\nrisks detected. This information leads a developer to actively think about\nsolutions to the problems a refactoring might cause within an actual codebase.",

To that end, the Galactica central web application\ncommunicates with a high-scalability ecosystem of data-processing servers\ncalled Terminus by means of an industry-proven asynchronous task management\nsystem. Each Terminus node, hosted in a research institute, a regional or\nnational supercomputing facility, contributes to the ecosystem by providing\nboth the storage and the computational resources required to store the massive\nsimulation datasets and post-process them to create the data products requested\non Galactica, hence guaranteeing fine-grained sovereignty over data and\nresources. This distributed architecture is very versatile, it can be\ninterfaced with any kind of data-processing software, written in any language,\nhandling raw data produced by every type of simulation code used in the field\nof computational astrophysics.

In this work, we investigate the cosmological\nimplications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark\nenergy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the\ncombined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the\nparameter $c > 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$\nat the $1\\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally\nfalls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the\nHDE model, the parameter $c < 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond\n$10\\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$\nis considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction\nwithin the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip\nconundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are\nstatistically as viable as the $\\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian\nevidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to a\nweighted coverage path planning (WCPP) problem. The problem appears in a wide\nrange of practical applications, such as search and rescue (SAR) missions. The\nbasic setup is that one (or multiple) agents can move around a given search\nspace and collect rewards from a given spatial distribution. Unlike an\nartificial potential field, each reward can only be collected once. In contrast\nto a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the agent moves in a continuous space.\nMoreover, he is not obliged to cover all locations and/or may return to\npreviously visited locations. The WCPP problem is tackled by a new Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) formulation with so-called Coverage Constraints (CCs).\nIt is shown that the solution becomes more effective if the solver is\ninitialized with a TSP-based heuristic. With and without this initialization,\nthe proposed MPC approach clearly outperforms a naive MPC formulation, as\ndemonstrated in a small simulation study.",

    "abstract": "Many fluid-dynamical systems met in nature are quasi-two-dimensional: they\nare constrained to evolve in approximately two dimensions with little or no\nvariation along the third direction. This has a drastic effect in the flow\nevolution because the properties of three dimensional turbulence are\nfundamentally different from those of two dimensional turbulence. In\nthree-dimensions energy is transferred on average towards small scales, while\nin two dimensions energy is transferred towards large scales.\nQuasi-two-dimensional flows thus stand in a crossroad, with two-dimensional\nmotions attempting to self-organize and generate large scales while three\ndimensional perturbations cause disorder, disrupting any large scale\norganization. Where is energy transferred in such systems? It has been realized\nrecently that in fact the two behaviors can coexist with a simultaneous\ntransfer of energy both to large and to small scales. How the cascade\nproperties change as the variations along the third direction are suppressed\nhas lead to discovery of different regimes or phases of turbulence of\nunexpected richness in behavior. Here, recent discoveries on such systems are\nreviewed. It is described how the transition from three-dimensional to\ntwo-dimensional flows takes place, the different phases of turbulence met and\nthe nature of the transitions from one phase to the other. Finally, the\nimplications these new discoveries have on different physical systems are\ndiscussed.",

If, as\nimplied, a population of early void-penetrating outflows existed, then black\nhole jets could have overwritten the fields from primordial magnetogenesis.\nThis outflow shows that energy transport from supermassive black holes operates\non scales of the Cosmic Web and raises the possibility that cosmic rays and\nmagnetism in the intergalactic medium have a non-local, cross-void origin.",

    "abstract": "In power systems, unpredictable events like extreme weather, equipment\nfailures, and cyberattacks present significant challenges to ensuring safety\nand reliability. Ensuring resilience in the face of these uncertainties is\ncrucial for reliable and efficient operations. This paper presents a tri-level\noptimization approach for robust power system operations that effectively\naddress worst-case attacks. The first stage focuses on optimizing economic\ndispatch under normal operating conditions, aiming to minimize generation costs\nwhile maintaining the supply-demand balance. The second stage introduces an\nadversarial attack model, identifying worst-case scenarios that maximize the\nsystem's vulnerability by targeting distributed generation (DG). In the third\nstage, mitigation strategies are developed using fast-response energy storage\nsystems (ESS) to minimize disruptions caused by these attacks. By integrating\neconomic dispatch, vulnerability assessment, and mitigation into a unified\nframework, this approach provides a robust solution for enhancing power system\nresilience and safety against evolving adversarial threats. The approach is\nvalidated using the IEEE-33 node distribution system to demonstrate its\neffectiveness in achieving both cost efficiency and system resilience.",

    "abstract": "$F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity,\nwhich can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a\nunified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions.\nHowever, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable\nover certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or\nsecond derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the\npost-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum\nstate after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new\nmodel-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second\nderivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from\nAppleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by\nimposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape.\nAs examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye\nmodel. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains\nthe acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.",

To ensure that the remote entanglement generation rates\nsurpass the bond-failure tolerance threshold of the RHG lattice, we employ\nspatial and temporal multiplexing. For realistic system timing parameters, we\nestimate the code cycle time of the RHG lattice and the ion resources required\nin a bi-layered implementation, where the number of modules matches the number\nof sites in two lattice layers, and qubits are reinitialized after measurement.\nFor large distances between modules, we incorporate quantum repeaters between\nsites and analyze the benefits in terms of cumulative resource requirements.\nFinally, we derive and analyze a qubit noise-tolerance threshold inequality for\nthe RHG lattice generation in the proposed architecture that accounts for noise\nfrom various sources.

Nonlinear electrohydrodynamic flows also occur in\nnon-polar fluids, driven by the electric field acting on space charge induced\nby conductivity gradients. Here, we analyze the flows about a charge-neutral\nspherical solid particle in an applied uniform electric field that arise from\nconductivity dependence on local field intensity. The flow pattern varies with\nparticle conductivity: while the flow about a conducting particle has a\nquadrupolar pattern similar to induced-charge electro-osmosis albeit with\nopposite direction, the flow about an insulating particle has a more complex\nstructure. We find that this flow induces a force on a particle near an\nelectrode that varies non-trivially with particle conductivity: while it is\nrepulsive for perfectly insulating particle and particles more conductive than\nthe suspending medium, there exists a range of particle conductivities where\nthe force is attractive. The force decays as inverse square of the distance to\nthe electrode and thus can dominate the dielectrophoretic attraction due to the\nimage dipole, which falls off with the fourth power with the distance.

Rather than amplifying electron\nsignals in gas pockets within their holes, their holes will be filled with LAr\nand a low biasing voltage, so that incident drifting electrons are drawn into\nthe holes but not amplified. Instead, amplification will occur in the gas phase\nabove the structures. Its core element is a GEM-like structure machined from\npolyethylene naphthalate(PEN). Since PEN scintillates in the visible spectrum,\nthe risk of increased radioactivity due to the larger mass compared to\ntraditional wire grids is negated by the potential to veto its own\nradioactivity. As such, these structures may also be a useful alternative to\nwire grids. In this work, we report the newest developments on the production\nof GEM-like structures using laser-based techniques, namely the manufacture of\nthe first batch PEN and PMMA-based GEM-like structures. This process allows\nlow-cost, reproducible fabrication of a high volume of such structures. In\naddition to being a low radioactive technique, we expect that it will allow the\nscaling up of the production of these structures at a reduced cost. First tests\nindicate good electrical stability, while the performance assessment is still\nongoing.",

Therefore,\nit is of practical importance to have methods by which we can determine the\ndamping that is in some sense optimal for all initial conditions, or for a\ngiven set of initial conditions. For a single and multi degree of freedom\nsystems, we determine the optimal damping coefficients adapted to different\nsets of initial conditions using the known method of minimizing the (zero to\ninfinity) time integral of the energy of the system, averaged over a set of\ninitial conditions, and using two new methods that we introduce.

We show that the two new methods\ngive results for optimal damping that are in excellent agreement with each\nother, but are significantly different from the results given by the\nminimization of the average energy integral. More precisely, for considered\nmulti degree of freedom systems and sets of initial conditions, the two new\nmethods give optimal damping coefficients that converge to the critical damping\nof the first mode as the target energy threshold decreases.

By utilizing Tsallis and\nnorm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable\nsparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins,\nsparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this\nframework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation,\nallowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern.\nOur framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and\nprovides an energy minimization perspective for widely used\npost-transformations like $\\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all\nthrough suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis\nas a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks\non diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall.\nExperiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and\ntext rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

In this work, we identified how\ndesigners coordinate vagueness in their design process and applied key\ncomponents of the process to the design of CLAY, an interactive system that\nbalances vagueness through iterative prompt refinement by integrating the\nstrengths of text-to-image generative AI.

Other\nfrequently discussed topics include model capabilities and enhancement\ntechniques (e.g., fine-tuning, prompt engineering), infrastructure and tooling,\nand risks and ethical challenges. Implications: Our results highlight current\ndiscussions and challenges in deploying LLMs in production. This way, we\nprovide a systematic overview of key aspects practitioners should be aware of\nwhen developing LLM-based applications. We further pale off topics of interest\nfor academics where further research is needed.",

However, the transition to predicted probabilities\nfrom logits would obscure certain indispensable information. To address this\nissue, it is intuitive to additionally introduce a logit-level loss function as\na supplement to the widely used probability-level loss function, for exploiting\nthe latent information of logits. Unfortunately, we empirically find that the\namalgamation of the newly introduced logit-level loss and the previous\nprobability-level loss will lead to performance degeneration, even trailing\nbehind the performance of employing either loss in isolation. We attribute this\nphenomenon to the collapse of the classification head, which is verified by our\ntheoretical analysis based on the neural collapse theory. Specifically, the\ngradients of the two loss functions exhibit contradictions in the linear\nclassifier yet display no such conflict within the backbone. Drawing from the\ntheoretical analysis, we propose a novel method called dual-head knowledge\ndistillation, which partitions the linear classifier into two classification\nheads responsible for different losses, thereby preserving the beneficial\neffects of both losses on the backbone while eliminating adverse influences on\nthe classification head.

    "abstract": "Grasping by a robot in unstructured environments is deemed a critical\nchallenge because of the requirement for effective adaptation to a wide\nvariation in object geometries, material properties, and other environmental\nfactors. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for robotic grasping based\non the idea of compressing high-dimensional target and gripper features in a\ncommon latent space using a set of autoencoders. Our approach simplifies\ngrasping by using three autoencoders dedicated to the target, the gripper, and\na third one that fuses their latent representations. This allows the RL agent\nto achieve higher learning rates at the initial stages of exploration of a new\nenvironment, as well as at non-zero shot grasp attempts. The agent explores the\nlatent space of the third autoencoder for better quality grasp without explicit\nreconstruction of objects. By implementing the PoWER algorithm into the RL\ntraining process, updates on the agent's policy will be made through the\nperturbation in the reward-weighted latent space. The successful exploration\nefficiently constrains both position and pose integrity for feasible executions\nof grasps. We evaluate our system on a diverse set of objects, demonstrating\nthe high success rate in grasping with minimum computational overhead.

One of the few known dark haloes smaller than a galaxy was discovered\nin the triple source plane strong lens system J0946+1006. Previous studies have\nfound that this structure is much more concentrated than expected in\n$\\Lambda$CDM, but have assumed the dark halo is at the same redshift as the\nmain deflector ($z_{\\rm main}=0.222$).

    "abstract": "Observing multiphoton electron-positron pair production (the nonlinear\nBreit-Wheeler process) requires high-energy $\\gamma$ rays to interact with\nstrong electromagnetic fields. In order for these observations to be as precise\nas possible, the $\\gamma$ rays would ideally be both mono-energetic and highly\npolarized. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of an experimental\nconfiguration that accomplishes this in two stages. First, a multi-GeV electron\nbeam interacts with a moderately intense laser pulse to produce a bright,\nhighly polarized beam of $\\gamma$ rays by inverse Compton scattering. Second,\nafter removing the primary electrons, these $\\gamma$ rays collide with another,\nmore intense, laser pulse in order to produce pairs. We show that it is\npossible to measure the $\\gamma$-ray polarization dependence of the nonlinear\nBreit-Wheeler process in near-term experiments, using a 100-TW class laser and\ncurrently available electron beams. Furthermore, it would also be possible to\nobserve harmonic structure and the perturbative-to-nonperturbative transition\nif such a laser were colocated with a future linear collider.",

Our goal\nis to explore near-wake flow modifications when a series of rigid and flexible\nplates ($l=1.8D$) divided into filaments ($h=0.2D$) are added. We focus on\nassessing the interaction between the flexible filaments and the wake dynamics,\nwith the aim of reducing the recirculation bubble and decreasing the velocity\ndeficit in the wake. To achieve this, we conduct a comparative study varying\nthe stiffness and position of the filaments at different flow velocities. The\nstudy combines Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements in the wake behind\nthe body with recordings of the deformation of the flexible filaments. Our\nobservations show that the flexible filaments can passively reconfigure in a\ntwo-dimensional fashion, with a mean tip deflection angle that increases with\nthe incoming flow velocity. Deflection angles up to approximately $\\sim\n9^\\circ$ and vibration tip amplitude of around $\\sim 4^\\circ$ are achieved for\nflow velocities $U^{*}\\simeq f_{n}D/u_{\\infty}\\geq 1.77$, where $f_n$ is the\nnatural frequency of the flexible filaments. This reconfiguration results in a\nreduction of the recirculation bubble and a decrease in the velocity deficit in\nthe wake compared to the reference and rigid cases. In addition, curved\nfilaments with a prescribed rigid deformation exhibit very similar behavior to\nthat of flexible filaments, indicating that the vibration of flexible filaments\ndoes not significantly disturb the wake.

The most challenging issue of the neutrino\nmechanism is that it cannot account for point-symmetric morphologies of CCSN\nremnants, many of which were identified in 2024. These contradictions with\nobservations imply that the neutrino mechanism cannot be the primary explosion\nmechanism of CCSNe. The alternative jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM)\nseems to be the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe; neutrino heating boosts\nthe energy of the jittering jets. Even if some simulations show explosions of\nstellar models (but usually with energies below observed), it does not mean\nthat the neutrino mechanism is the explosion mechanism. Jittering jets, which\nsimulations do not include, can explode the core before the neutrino heating\nprocess does. Morphological signatures of jets in many CCSN remnants suggest\nthat jittering jets are the primary driving mechanism, as expected by the JJEM.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic Configuration Networks (SCNs) are a class of randomized neural\nnetworks that integrate randomized algorithms within an incremental learning\nframework. A defining feature of SCNs is the supervisory mechanism, which\nadaptively adjusts the distribution to generate effective random basis\nfunctions, thereby enabling error-free learning. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive analysis of the impact of the supervisory mechanism on the\nlearning performance of SCNs. Our findings reveal that the current SCN\nframework evaluates the effectiveness of each random basis function in reducing\nresidual errors using a lower bound on its error reduction potential, which\nconstrains SCNs' overall learning efficiency. Specifically, SCNs may fail to\nconsistently select the most effective random candidate as the new basis\nfunction during each training iteration. To overcome this problem, we propose a\nnovel method for evaluating the hidden layer's output matrix, supported by a\nnew supervisory mechanism that accurately assesses the error reduction\npotential of random basis functions without requiring the computation of the\nMoore-Penrose inverse of the output matrix. This approach enhances the\nselection of basis functions, reducing computational complexity and improving\nthe overall scalability and learning capabilities of SCNs. We introduce a\nRecursive Moore-Penrose Inverse-SCN (RMPI-SCN) training scheme based on the new\nsupervisory mechanism and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations\nover some benchmark datasets. Experiments show that RMPI-SCN outperforms the\nconventional SCN in terms of learning capability, underscoring its potential to\nadvance the SCN framework for large-scale data modeling applications.",

    "abstract": "We extend the theory of quantum time loops introduced by Greenberger and\nSvozil [1] from the scalar situation (where paths have just an associated\ncomplex amplitude) to the general situation where the time traveling system has\nmulti-dimensional underlying Hilbert space. The main mathematical tool which\nemerges is the noncommutative Mobius Transformation and this affords a\nformalism similar to the modular structure well known to feedback control\nproblems. The self-consistency issues that plague other approaches do not arise\nin this approach as we do not consider completely closed time loops. We argue\nthat a sum-over-all-paths approach may be carried out in the scalar case, but\nquickly becomes unwieldy in the general case. It is natural to replace the\nbeamsplitters of [1] with more general components having their own quantum\nstructure, in which case the theory starts to resemble the quantum feedback\nnetworks theory for open quantum optical models and indeed we exploit this to\nlook at more realistic physical models of time loops.

We consider the partial-wave expansion of the wave\nfunction in the Koonin-Pratt formula to give the correction to the correlation\nfunction by a sum of the contributions from each partial wave. We also\ngeneralize the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula, which was originally derived for\nthe s-wave interaction, for higher partial waves. We find a compact\nrepresentation of the generalized Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula given by the\nbackward scattering amplitude $f(\\theta = \\pi)$ and the Fourier-Laplace\ntransform of the relative source function, which gives an insight into the\nstructure of the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formula and its relation to the optical\ntheorem.

This study\nintroduces a novel method for WSI classification by automating the\nidentification and examination of the most informative patches, thus\neliminating the need to process the entire slide. Our method involves\ntwo-stages: firstly, it extracts only a few patches from the WSIs based on\ntheir pathological significance; and secondly, it employs Fisher vectors (FVs)\nfor representing features extracted from these patches, which is known for its\nrobustness in capturing fine-grained details.

We have rigorously evaluated the proposed method across\nmultiple datasets to benchmark its performance against comprehensive WSI\nanalysis and contemporary weakly-supervised learning methodologies. The\nempirical results indicate that our focused analysis of select patches,\ncombined with Fisher vector representation, not only aligns with, but at times\nsurpasses, the classification accuracy of standard practices.

While prior research focuses on patent metadata, we employ machine\nlearning and natural language processing to extract hidden information from the\nwords in patent applications. Through these methods, we find that inventor\ngender can often be identified from textual attributes - even without knowing\nthe inventor's name. This ability to discern gender through text suggests that\nanonymized patent examination - often proposed as a solution to mitigate\ndisparities in patent grant rates - may not fully address gendered outcomes in\nsecuring a patent. Our study also investigates whether objective features of a\npatent application can predict if it will be granted. Using a classifier\nalgorithm, we correctly predicted whether a patent was granted over 60% of the\ntime. Further analysis emphasized that writing style - like vocabulary and\nsentence complexity - disproportionately influenced grant predictions relative\nto other attributes such as inventor gender and subject matter keywords.\nLastly, we examine whether women disproportionately invent in technological\nareas with higher rejection rates. Using a clustering algorithm, applications\nwere allocated into groups with related subject matter. We found that 85% of\nfemale-dominated clusters have abnormally high rejection rates, compared to\nonly 45% for male-dominated groupings.

However, the current questionnaire-based diagnostic methods could\nbring subjective biases and may be denied by subjects. In search of a more\nobjective means of diagnosis, researchers have begun to experiment with deep\nlearning-based methods for identifying depressive disorders in recent years.\nMethods: In this study, a novel Spatiotemporal-fused network with Automated\nmulti-scale Depth-wise and TIME-interval-related common feature extractor\n(SAD-TIME) is proposed. SAD-TIME incorporates an automated nodes' common\nfeatures extractor (CFE), a spatial sector (SpS), a modified temporal sector\n(TeS), and a domain adversarial learner (DAL). The CFE includes a multi-scale\ndepth-wise 1D-convolutional neural network and a time-interval embedding\ngenerator, where the unique information of each channel is preserved. The SpS\nfuses the functional connectivity with the distance-based connectivity\ncontaining spatial position of EEG electrodes. A multi-head-attention graph\nconvolutional network is also applied in the SpS to fuse the features from\ndifferent EEG channels. The TeS is based on long short-term memory and graph\ntransformer networks, where the temporal information of different time-windows\nis fused. Moreover, the DAL is used after the SpS to obtain the\ndomain-invariant feature. Results: Experimental results under tenfold\ncross-validation show that the proposed SAD-TIME method achieves 92.00% and\n94.00% depression classification accuracies on two datasets, respectively, in\ncross-subject mode. Conclusion: SAD-TIME is a robust depression detection\nmodel, where the automatedly-generated features, the SpS and the TeS assist the\nclassification performance with the fusion of the innate spatiotemporal\ninformation in the EEG signals.",

    "abstract": "Each year, the production of synthetic dye wastewater reaches a trillion\ntons, posing a significant challenge to addressing water scarcity on a global\nlevel. Hence, the treatment of wastewater to prevent water scarcity is of prime\nimportance, and failing to do so will increase ecotoxicological risks and human\nhealth. Textile wastewater contains harmful dye. Photocatalytic degradation of\nsuch dye-contaminated wastewater is crucial to purifying the dye-contaminated\nwater. However, this process takes time, uses high-power lamps, and is\nexpensive. Here, we report the effect of the concentration of precursor on the\nsize and surface morphology of TiO2 nanostructures prepared by facile\nhydrothermal synthesis and its ability to perform as a photocatalyst to degrade\nthe most common industrial textile dye, methylene blue (MB), under natural\nsunlight. The impact of particle size on the photocatalytic activity and\nphotocarrier migration rate was thoroughly examined. Also, the effect of pH on\nadsorption and photocatalytic degradation has been evaluated in detail. With\nseveral optimized conditions, almost complete dye degradation was achieved\nwithin 40 minutes under the direct illumination of natural sunlight. The\nenhanced photocatalytic performance can be correlated to the synergetic effect\nof a higher charge transfer mechanism, good catalytic active surface area\navailability (386 m2/g), and several optimized parameters that affect the\nreaction efficacy. Additionally, repeated use of NPs without sacrificing\nperformance five times confirmed its stability and Sustainability as a\npromising candidate for large-scale industrial textile wastewater remedies.",

In this study, we took first steps\nby investigating explainers' mental representations in everyday explanations of\ntechnological artifacts. According to the dual nature theory, technological\nartifacts require explanations with two distinct perspectives, namely\nobservable and measurable features addressing \"Architecture\" or interpretable\naspects addressing \"Relevance\". We conducted extended semi structured pre-,\npost- and video recall-interviews with explainers (N=9) in the context of an\nexplanation. The transcribed interviews were analyzed utilizing qualitative\ncontent analysis. The explainers' answers regarding the explainees' knowledge\nand interests with regard to the technological artifact emphasized the\nvagueness of early assumptions of explainers toward strong beliefs in the\ncourse of explanations. The assumed knowledge of explainees in the beginning is\ncentered around Architecture and develops toward knowledge with regard to both\nArchitecture and Relevance. In contrast, explainers assumed higher interests in\nRelevance in the beginning to interests regarding both Architecture and\nRelevance in the further course of explanations. Further, explainers often\nfinished the explanation despite their perception that explainees still had\ngaps in knowledge. These findings are transferred into practical implications\nrelevant for user models for adaptive explainable systems.",

Allowing\ndivision sizes to fluctuate reveals how the mechanism of cell size control\n(timer, sizer, adder) influences population growth.

Previous methods do not incorporate automatic functional\ncorrection mechanisms without human intervention and still suffer from low\nsuccess rates, especially for sequential tasks.

    "abstract": "Determining the spatial curvature $\\Omega_K$ of the Universe has long been\ncrucial in cosmology. In practice, this effort is often entangled with\nassumptions of dark energy. A combination of distance ($D_{\\rm M}$, $D_{\\rm\nL}$) and expansion rate ($H(z)$) measurements can break this degeneracy.\nHowever, fitting against discrete data points requires parameterizations of\ndistance and expansion rate as functions of redshifts, which often induces\ncosmological model dependence. In this work, we propose a new dark energy\nmodel-independent parameterization of the cosmological comoving radial distance\n$\\chi$. Fitting data combining distance ($D_{\\rm M}$, $D_{\\rm L}$) and Hubble\nparameter (or equivalently $D_H$) measurements, we are then able to obtain\n$\\Omega_K$ in a dark energy model-independent manner. We test this\nparameterization and the associated fitting scheme with mock data generated\nwith a wide range of fiducial dark energy equations of state ($-1.3<w<1.3$),\nfinding that the best-fit $\\Omega_K$ is always unbiased. Then we combine SDSS\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe\nIa), and Observational Hubble Data (OHD) to constrain $\\Omega_K$. We find a\nflat universe with $\\Omega_K=-0.01\\pm 0.09$. Most constraining power is\ncontributed by SDSS BAO, with the BAO-alone constraint $\\Omega_K=-0.03 \\pm\n0.10$. When replacing SDSS BAO with DESI year-one BAO measurement, we obtain\n$\\Omega_K=0.06 \\pm 0.08$. With the full DESI BAO data alone, we forecast\n$\\sigma(\\Omega_K)\\sim 0.03$. Our result verifies the flatness of the universe\nfree of dark energy modeling, and the proposed parameterization would be useful\nfor future investigation of $\\Omega_K$ and other parameters of interest, such\nas the horizon radius.",

This paper proposes a novel nonlinear SCMA (NL-SCMA) that can subsume\nthe conventional SCMA system which is referred to as linear SCMA, as special\ncases for downlink channels. This innovative approach allows a direct mapping\nof users' messages to a superimposed codeword for transmission, eliminating the\nneed of a codebook for each user. This mapping is referred to as nonlinear\nmapping (codebook) in this paper.\n  Hence, the primary objective is to design the nonlinear mapping, rather than\nthe linear codebook for each user. We leverage the Lattice constellation to\ndesign the superimposed constellation due to its advantages such as the minimum\nEuclidean distance (MED), constellation volume, design flexibility and shape\ngain. Then, by analyzing the error patterns of the Lattice-designed\nsuperimposed codewords with the aid of the pair-wise error probability, it is\nfound that the MED of the proposed nonlinear codebook is lower bounded by the\n``single error pattern''. To this end, an error pattern-inspired codebook\ndesign is proposed, which can achieve large MEDs of the nonlinear codebooks.\nNumerical results show that the proposed codebooks can achieve lower error rate\nperformance over both Gaussian and Rayleigh fading channels than\nthe-state-of-the-art linear codebooks.",

    "abstract": "We present a method for determining the physical parameters of a Kerr-Newman\nblack hole through shadow observation. In a system comprising a Kerr-Newman\nblack hole, an observer, and a light source, the relevant parameters are mass\n$M$, specific angular momentum $a$, electric charge $Q$, inclination angle $i$,\nand distance $r_o$. We consider the cases where the observer is at either a\nfinite distance or spatial infinity. Using our method, the dimensionless\nparameters $(a/M, Q/M, i)$ can be determined by observing the shadow contour of\nthe Kerr-Newman black hole from spatial infinity. We analytically prove that\nthe shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole observed from spatial infinity\nis unique, where uniqueness is defined as the absence of two congruent shadow\ncontours for distinct sets of dimensionless parameter values. This method is\nversatile and can be applied to a range of black hole solutions with charge.\nAdditionally, we show analytically that the shadow contour of a Kerr-Newman\nblack hole observed from a finite distance $r_o$ is not unique, meaning that\nthe parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole at finite distance cannot be\ndetermined from shadow observations. This result reveals a new challenge and\nprovides a clear direction for further research on black hole shadows.",

The equivalent width of Mg II\nabsorption strongly correlates to stellar mass with EW(Mg II) $\\propto\nM_{*}^{0.5}$ for star-forming galaxies with $\\log M_{*}/M_{\\odot} < 10$, but is\nindependent with mass for galaxies above this mass. At given stellar mass,\nEW(Mg II) is larger for galaxies of higher star formation rate with impact\nparameter less than $50$ kpc, while showing little dependence on galaxy size.\nBy studying the dependence on azimuthal angle, we find EW(Mg II) is strongest\nat the direction near the minor axis for star-forming galaxies with $\\log\nM_{*}/M_{\\odot} < 10.0$, while no dependence on azimuthal angle is seen for\nluminous red galaxies. This indicates that the outflow associated with star\nformation enhances the Mg II absorption. However, for galaxies with $\\log\nM_{*}/M_{\\odot} > 10.0$, the EW(Mg II) at the minor axis is largely suppressed\nwith respect to low mass galaxies.

    "abstract": "Face recognition datasets are often collected by crawling Internet and\nwithout individuals' consents, raising ethical and privacy concerns. Generating\nsynthetic datasets for training face recognition models has emerged as a\npromising alternative. However, the generation of synthetic datasets remains\nchallenging as it entails adequate inter-class and intra-class variations.\nWhile advances in generative models have made it easier to increase intra-class\nvariations in face datasets (such as pose, illumination, etc.), generating\nsufficient inter-class variation is still a difficult task. In this paper, we\nformulate the dataset generation as a packing problem on the embedding space\n(represented on a hypersphere) of a face recognition model and propose a new\nsynthetic dataset generation approach, called HyperFace. We formalize our\npacking problem as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient\ndescent-based approach. Then, we use a conditional face generator model to\nsynthesize face images from the optimized embeddings. We use our generated\ndatasets to train face recognition models and evaluate the trained models on\nseveral benchmarking real datasets. Our experimental results show that models\ntrained with HyperFace achieve state-of-the-art performance in training face\nrecognition using synthetic datasets.",

The Sylvester conjecture\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is that $\\min_K P^{(d)}_K(d+2)$ is achieved by the\n$d$-dimensional simplices $K$ (only).\n  In this paper, we focus on a companion model, already studied in the $2d$\ncase, which we define in any dimension $d$: we say that $K$ has $F$ as a flat\nfloor, if $F$ is a subset of $K$, contained in a hyperplan $P$, such that $K$\nlies in one of the half-spaces defined by $P$.\n  We define $Q_K^F(n)$ as the probability that $U_1,\\cdots,U_n$ together with\n$F$ are in convex position (i.e., the $U_i$ are on the boundary of the convex\nhull ${\\sf CH}(\\{U_1,\\cdots,U_n\\}\\cup F\\})$). We prove that, for all fixed $F$,\n  $K\\mapsto Q_K^F(2)$ reaches its minimum on the \"mountains\" with floor $F$\n(mountains are convex hull of $F$ union an additional vertex), while the\nmaximum is not reached, but $K\\mapsto Q_K^F(2)$ has values arbitrary close to\n1. If the optimisation is done on the set of $K$ contained in $F\\times[0,d]$\n(the \"subprism case\"), then the minimum is also reached by the mountains, and\nthe maximum by the \"prism\" $F\\times[0,1]$. Since again, $Q_K^F{(2)}$ relies on\nthe expected volume (of ${\\sf CH}(\\{V_1,V_2\\}\\cup F\\})$), this result can be\nseen as a proof of the Sylvester problem in the floor case.\n  In $2d$, where $F$ can essentially be the segment $[0,1],$ we give a general\ndecomposition formula for $Q_K^F(n)$ so to compute several formulas and bounds\nfor different $K$. In 3D, we give some bounds for $Q_K^F(n)$ for various floors\n$F$ and special cases of $K$.",

While UAV-based imaging has advanced\nhigh-throughput phenotyping, current methods often rely on orthophoto images,\nwhich struggle with overlapping leaves and incomplete structural information in\ncomplex field environments. This study integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\nwith the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D reconstruction and biomass\nestimation of oilseed rape. UAV multi-view oblique images from 36 angles were\nused to perform 3D reconstruction, with the SAM module enhancing point cloud\nsegmentation. The segmented point clouds were then converted into point cloud\nvolumes, which were fitted to ground-measured biomass using linear regression.\nThe results showed that 3DGS (7k and 30k iterations) provided high accuracy,\nwith peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNR) of 27.43 and 29.53 and training times\nof 7 and 49 minutes, respectively. This performance exceeded that of structure\nfrom motion (SfM) and mipmap Neural Radiance Fields (Mip-NeRF), demonstrating\nsuperior efficiency. The SAM module achieved high segmentation accuracy, with a\nmean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.961 and an F1-score of 0.980.\nAdditionally, a comparison of biomass extraction models found the point cloud\nvolume model to be the most accurate, with an determination coefficient (R2) of\n0.976, root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.92 g/plant, and mean absolute\npercentage error (MAPE) of 6.81%, outperforming both the plot crop volume and\nindividual crop volume models.

    "abstract": "The remarkable advances in deep learning have led to the emergence of many\noff-the-shelf classifiers, e.g., large pre-trained models. However, since they\nare typically trained on clean data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks. Despite this vulnerability, their superior performance and\ntransferability make off-the-shelf classifiers still valuable in practice,\ndemanding further work to provide adversarial robustness for them in a post-hoc\nmanner. A recently proposed method, denoised smoothing, leverages a denoiser\nmodel in front of the classifier to obtain provable robustness without\nadditional training. However, the denoiser often creates hallucination, i.e.,\nimages that have lost the semantics of their originally assigned class, leading\nto a drop in robustness. Furthermore, its noise-and-denoise procedure\nintroduces a significant distribution shift from the original distribution,\ncausing the denoised smoothing framework to achieve sub-optimal robustness. In\nthis paper, we introduce Fine-Tuning with Confidence-Aware Denoised Image\nSelection (FT-CADIS), a novel fine-tuning scheme to enhance the certified\nrobustness of off-the-shelf classifiers. FT-CADIS is inspired by the\nobservation that the confidence of off-the-shelf classifiers can effectively\nidentify hallucinated images during denoised smoothing. Based on this, we\ndevelop a confidence-aware training objective to handle such hallucinated\nimages and improve the stability of fine-tuning from denoised images. In this\nway, the classifier can be fine-tuned using only images that are beneficial for\nadversarial robustness. We also find that such a fine-tuning can be done by\nupdating a small fraction of parameters of the classifier. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that FT-CADIS has established the state-of-the-art\ncertified robustness among denoised smoothing methods across all\n$\\ell_2$-adversary radius in various benchmarks.",

Exisiting reviews in the field take the definition and purpose\nof an uncertainty visualisation to be self evident which results in a large\namout of conflicting information. This conflict largely stems from a conflation\nbetween uncertainty visualisations designed for decision making and those\ndesigned to prevent false conclusions. We coin the term \"signal suppression\" to\ndescribe a visualisation that is designed for preventing false conclusions, as\nthe approach demands that the signal (i.e. the collective take away of the\nestimates) is suppressed by the noise (i.e. the variance on those estimates).\nWe argue that the current standards in visualisation suggest that uncertainty\nvisualisations designed for decision making should not be considered\nuncertainty visualisations at all. Therefore, future work should focus on\nsignal suppression. Effective signal suppression requires us to communicate the\nsignal and the noise as a single \"validity of signal\" variable, and doing so\nproves to be difficult with current methods. We illustrate current approaches\nto uncertainty visualisation by showing how they would change the visual\napprearance of a choropleth map. These maps allow us to see why some methods\nsucceed at signal suppression, while others fall short. Evaluating\nvisualisations on how well they perform signal suppression also proves to be\ndifficult, as it involves measuring the effect of noise, a variable we\ntypically try to ignore.

In existing\nlarge-scale MoE training systems, experts would be distributed among different\nGPUs for parallelization, and thus input data requires additional all-to-all\ncommunications to access the target experts and conduct corresponding\ncomputations. However, upon evaluating the training process of three mainstream\nMoE models on commonly used GPU clusters, we found that the all-to-all\ncommunication ratio averaged around 45%, which significantly hinders the\nefficiency and scalability of training MoE models.\n  In this paper, we propose LSH-MoE, a communication-efficient MoE training\nframework using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). We first present the problems\nof scaling MoE training in existing systems and highlight the potential of\nexploiting token similarity to facilitate data compression. Then, we introduce\nan efficient LSH-based compression technique, which utilizes the cross-polytope\nhashing for rapid clustering and implements a residual-based error compensation\nscheme to alleviate the adverse impact of compression.

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning is new emerged technology that removes a subset of the\ntraining data from a trained model without affecting the model performance on\nthe remaining data. This topic is becoming increasingly important in protecting\nuser privacy and eliminating harmful or outdated data. The key challenge lies\nin effectively and efficiently unlearning specific information without\ncompromising the model's utility on the retained data. For the pre-trained\nmodels, fine-tuning is an important way to achieve the unlearning target.\nPrevious work typically fine-tuned the entire model's parameters, which incurs\nsignificant computation costs. In addition, the fine-tuning process may cause\nshifts in the intermediate layer features, affecting the model's overall\nutility. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient machine unlearning\nmethod on pre-trained models. We term the method as Residual Feature Alignment\nUnlearning. Specifically, we leverage LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to decompose\nthe model's intermediate features into pre-trained features and residual\nfeatures. By adjusting the residual features, we align the unlearned model with\nthe pre-trained model at the intermediate feature level to achieve both\nunlearning and remaining targets. The method aims to learn the zero residuals\non the retained set and shifted residuals on the unlearning set. Extensive\nexperiments on numerous datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

We find that smooth hybrid EOSs are slightly favoured in\nexplaining NS mass-radius relations, particularly for pulsars such as PSR\nJ0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. However, this preference is not definitive, as\ngravitational wave (GW) data does not significantly differentiate between our\nhybrid and nucleonic models. Our analysis also reveals tensions between older\nNICER data and recent measurements for PSR J0437-4715, highlighting the need\nfor more flexible EOS models. Through two sampling approaches - one fixing the\nhadronic EOS set and the other without fixing the same, we demonstrate that the\nhybrid EOS model can incorporate stiffer EOSs, resulting in a better agreement\nwith NICER data but leading to higher tidal deformability, which is less\nconsistent with GW observations. In some recent publications a parameter $d_c$,\nrelated to the trace anomaly and its derivative, is used to indicate the\npresence of deconfined quark matter. We find that our hadronic model, which\ndoes not include phase transition to deconfined matter, under the influence of\nimposed constraints, is able to predict values below 0.2 for $d_c$ at around\nfive times saturation density.

While many practical algorithms have been developed to tackle\nCMOPs, real-world scenarios often present cases where the constraint functions\nare unknown or unquantifiable, resulting in only binary outcomes (feasible or\ninfeasible). This limitation reduces the effectiveness of constraint violation\nguidance, which can negatively impact the performance of existing algorithms\nthat rely on this approach. Such challenges are particularly detrimental for\nalgorithms employing the epsilon-based method, as they hinder effective\nrelaxation of the feasible region. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a novel algorithm called DRMCMO based on the detection region method.\nIn DRMCMO, detection regions dynamic monitor feasible solutions to enhance\nconvergence, helping the population escape local optima. Additionally, these\nregions collaborate with the neighbor pairing strategy to improve population\ndiversity within narrow feasible areas. We have modified three existing test\nsuites to serve as benchmark test problems for CMOPs with binary\nconstraints(CMOP/BC) and conducted comprehensive comparative experiments with\nstate-of-the-art algorithms on these test suites and real-world problems.

The primary goal in DLP is for agents to\nreach a consensus on a unified coordinate system that accurately reflects the\nrelative positions of all points, $p_0, ..., p_{n-1}$. Extensive research on\nDLP has primarily focused on the feasibility and complexity of achieving\nconsensus when agents have limited access to inter-agent distances, often due\nto missing or imprecise data.

In this variant each agent can memorise one or a fixed number\nof coordinates, and when agents $a_i$ and $a_j$ interact, they can not only\nexchange their current knowledge but also either determine the distance\n$d(i,j)$ between them in $S$ (distance query model) or obtain the vector\n$v(i,j)$ spanning points $p_i$ and $p_j$ (vector query model).

To prevent such automated systems\nfrom discriminating against people belonging to certain groups, fairness\nmeasures have become a crucial component in socially relevant applications of\nmachine learning. However, existing fairness measures have been designed to\nassess the bias between predictions for protected groups without considering\nthe imbalance in the classes of the target variable. Current research on the\npotential effect of class imbalance on fairness focuses on practical\napplications rather than dataset-independent measure properties. In this paper,\nwe study the general properties of fairness measures for changing class and\nprotected group proportions. For this purpose, we analyze the probability mass\nfunctions of six of the most popular group fairness measures. We also measure\nhow the probability of achieving perfect fairness changes for varying class\nimbalance ratios. Moreover, we relate the dataset-independent properties of\nfairness measures described in this paper to classifier fairness in real-life\ntasks. Our results show that measures such as Equal Opportunity and Positive\nPredictive Parity are more sensitive to changes in class imbalance than\nAccuracy Equality.

While many dual-modal fusion methods based on graph\nneural networks (GNNs) have been proposed, they generally follow homogenous\nfusion ways ignoring rich heterogeneity of dual-modal information. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel method that integrates functional and structural\nconnectivity based on heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) to better\nleverage the rich heterogeneity in dual-modal images. We firstly use blood\noxygen level dependency and whiter matter structure information provided by\nrs-fMRI and DTI to establish homo-meta-path, capturing node relationships\nwithin the same modality. At the same time, we propose to establish\nhetero-meta-path based on structure-function coupling and brain community\nsearching to capture relations among cross-modal nodes. Secondly, we further\nintroduce a heterogeneous graph pooling strategy that automatically balances\nhomo- and hetero-meta-path, effectively leveraging heterogeneous information\nand preventing feature confusion after pooling. Thirdly, based on the\nflexibility of heterogeneous graphs, we propose a heterogeneous graph data\naugmentation approach that can conveniently address the sample imbalance issue\ncommonly seen in clinical diagnosis. We evaluate our method on ADNI-3 dataset\nfor mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis.

ODT bypasses the inherent limitations of 2D\nintegrated quantitative phase imaging methods. To increase the signal-to-noise\nratio easy-to-implement common-path shearing interferometry setups are\nsuccessfully combined with low spatiotemporal coherence of illumination. The\nneed for self-interference generated holograms, with small shear values,\ncritically impedes the analysis of dense and thick samples, e.g., cell\ncultures, tissue sections, and embryos/organoids. Phase gradient imaging\ntechniques, deployed as a popular solution in the small shear regime, up to now\nwere constrained to 2D integrated quasi-quantitative phase imaging and\nz-scanning for depth resolution. To fill this significant scientific gap, we\npropose a novel gradient optical diffraction tomography (GODT) method. The GODT\nuses coherence-tailored illumination-scanning sequence of phase gradient\nmeasurements to tomographically reconstruct, for the first time to the best of\nour knowledge, a derivative of the 3D RI distribution (in the shear direction)\nwith clearly visible 3D sample structure and high sensitivity to its spatial\nvariations.

In this\npaper, we use the spatial-temporal correlation of the sensor data of interest\nto infer the real-time data of the target sensor to reduce the mean squared\nerror (MSE) of reconstruction for industrial metaverse under short-packet\ntransmission (SPT). Both synchronous and asynchronous transmission modes for\nmultiple sensors are considered. It is proved that the average MSE of\nreconstruction and average block error probability (BLEP) have a positive\ncorrelation under inference with synchronous transmission scheme, and they have\na negative correlation in some conditions under inference with asynchronous\ntransmission scheme. Also, it is proved that the average MSE of reconstruction\nwith inference can be significantly lower than that without inference, even\nunder weak mean squared spatial correlation (MSSC). In addition, closed-form\nMSSC thresholds are derived for the superiority regions of the inference with\nsynchronous transmission and inference with asynchronous transmission schemes,\nrespectively. Adaptations of blocklength and time shift of asynchronous\ntransmission are conducted to minimize the average MSE of reconstruction.\nSimulation results show that the two schemes significantly outperform the no\ninference case, with an average MSE reduction of more than 50%.",

A constraint equation for the field strength of\nthe gravigauge field is derived, serving as a gravitization equation within the\nspin-related gravigauge spacetime. This equation reveals how gravitational\neffects emerge from the non-commutative relation of the gravigauge derivative\noperator. By transmuting the action from gravigauge spacetime to Minkowski\nspacetime, we demonstrate that translational invariance results in a vanishing\nenergy-momentum tensor in GQFT when the equations of motion are applied to all\nfundamental fields, including the gravigauge field. This extends the\nconservation law of the energy-momentum tensor in quantum field theory to a\ncancellation law of the energy-momentum tensor in GQFT. As a result, an\nequivalence between the general gravitational equation and the zero\nenergy-momentum tensor theorem naturally arises in GQFT. Certain aspects of the\nPoincar\\'e gauge theory are also briefly discussed. Furthermore, a GQFT\nincorporating the Chern-Simons action in three-dimensional spacetime is\ndeveloped, based on the inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry WS(1,2) and the\nglobal Poincar\\'e symmetry PO(1,2).

However, recent defense mechanisms against\nthese attacks have reached near-saturation performance on benchmark\nevaluations, often with minimal effort. This \\emph{dual high performance} in\nboth attack and defense raises a fundamental and perplexing paradox. To gain a\ndeep understanding of this issue and thus further help strengthen the\ntrustworthiness of VLLMs, this paper makes three key contributions: i) One\ntentative explanation for VLLMs being prone to jailbreak\nattacks--\\textbf{inclusion of vision inputs}, as well as its in-depth analysis.\nii) The recognition of a largely ignored problem in existing defense\nmechanisms--\\textbf{over-prudence}. The problem causes these defense methods to\nexhibit unintended abstention, even in the presence of benign inputs, thereby\nundermining their reliability in faithfully defending against attacks. iii) A\nsimple safety-aware method--\\textbf{LLM-Pipeline}. Our method repurposes the\nmore advanced guardrails of LLMs on the shelf, serving as an effective\nalternative detector prior to VLLM response. Last but not least, we find that\nthe two representative evaluation methods for jailbreak often exhibit chance\nagreement.

    "abstract": "Circumstellar OH maser lines are useful for studying the dynamics of the\ncircumstellar envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. This study aims to identify\nCSEs around cold stars, which exhibit deviations from the spherical expansion,\nby comparing the velocity ranges of the OH main lines (1665/1667 MHz) with\nthose of the satellite line (1612 MHz), using a database of circumstellar OH\nmaser sources. We performed this comparison for 377 circumstellar OH maser\nsources. In addition, using infrared two-color diagrams, we examined the\nevolutionary stages and infrared properties of objects showing velocity excess\n(velocity excess means the detection of the main lines outside the velocity\nrange of the satellite line). A periodicity analysis of the WISE light curves\nwas also carried out. As a result of the velocity range comparison, eight\ncircumstellar OH maser sources were found to exhibit velocity excess. The\ninfrared colors of these objects match those of post-AGB stars. Periodic\nvariations were observed in the WISE light curves of five of these eight\nobjects. The results suggest that examining velocity excess of the main lines\nrelative to the satellite line is scientifically significant because mainline\nmasers probe the CSE dynamics over a broader range of evolutionary stages\ncompared to the 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O maser line. Additionally, during the\npost-AGB phase, the emission regions of the mainline and 22.235 GHz H${_2}$O\nmasers may overlap in a CSE, whereas they originate from different regions\nduring the AGB phase.",

These schemes are\nrepresentative of two-stage methods for estimating or bounding EIG using\nmarginal and conditional density estimates. In this setting, we analyze the\noptimal allocation of samples between training (density estimation) and\napproximation of the outer prior expectation.

We then address the\nestimation of EIG in high dimensions, by deriving gradient-based upper bounds\non the mutual information lost by projecting the parameters and/or observations\nto lower-dimensional subspaces. Minimizing these upper bounds yields projectors\nand hence low-dimensional EIG approximations that outperform approximations\nobtained via other linear dimension reduction schemes.

This model allows for incorporation of group-level frequency\ndependence, facilitating the exploration for how the form of probabilities for\nvictory in a group-level conflict can impact the long-time support for\ncooperation via multilevel selection. We characterize well-posedness properties\nfor measure-valued solutions of our PDE model and apply these properties to\nshow that the population will converge to a delta-function at the all-defector\nequilibrium when between-group selection is sufficiently weak.

Fluid antenna systems (FAS) can\noffer an unorthodox solution due to their ability to dynamically adjust antenna\npositions for improved channel gain. In this letter, we study a FAS-driven CR\nsetup where a secondary user (SU) adjusts the positions of fluid antennas to\ndetect signals from the primary user (PU). We aim to maximize the detection\nprobability under the constraints of the false alarm probability and the\nreceived beamforming of the SU. To address this problem, we first derive a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal detection threshold and reformulate the\nproblem to find its solution. Then an alternating optimization (AO) scheme is\nproposed to decompose the problem into several sub-problems, addressing both\nthe received beamforming and the antenna positions at the SU. The beamforming\nsubproblem is addressed using a closed-form solution, while the fluid antenna\npositions are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation\nresults reveal that the proposed algorithm provides significant improvements\nover traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) schemes in terms of spectrum\nsensing performance.",

    "abstract": "In high frequency trading, accurate prediction of Order Flow Imbalance (OFI)\nis crucial for understanding market dynamics and maintaining liquidity. This\npaper introduces a hybrid predictive model that combines Vector Auto Regression\n(VAR) with a simple feedforward neural network (FNN) to forecast OFI and assess\ntrading intensity. The VAR component captures linear dependencies, while\nresiduals are fed into the FNN to model non-linear patterns, enabling a\ncomprehensive approach to OFI prediction. Additionally, the model calculates\nthe intensity on the Buy or Sell side, providing insights into which side holds\ngreater trading pressure. These insights facilitate the development of trading\nstrategies by identifying periods of high buy or sell intensity. Using both\nsynthetic and real trading data from Binance, we demonstrate that the hybrid\nmodel offers significant improvements in predictive accuracy and enhances\nstrategic decision-making based on OFI dynamics. Furthermore, we compare the\nhybrid models performance with standalone FNN and VAR models, showing that the\nhybrid approach achieves superior forecasting accuracy across both synthetic\nand real datasets, making it the most effective model for OFI prediction in\nhigh frequency trading.",

    "abstract": "An important problem on social information sites is the recovery of ground\ntruth from individual reports when the experts are in the minority. The wisdom\nof the crowd, i.e. the collective opinion of a group of individuals fails in\nsuch a scenario. However, the surprisingly popular (SP)\nalgorithm~\\cite{prelec2017solution} can recover the ground truth even when the\nexperts are in the minority, by asking the individuals to report additional\nprediction reports--their beliefs about the reports of others. Several recent\nworks have extended the surprisingly popular algorithm to an equivalent voting\nrule (SP-voting) to recover the ground truth ranking over a set of $m$\nalternatives. However, we are yet to fully understand when SP-voting can\nrecover the ground truth ranking, and if so, how many samples (votes and\npredictions) it needs. We answer this question by proposing two rank-order\nmodels and analyzing the sample complexity of SP-voting under these models. In\nparticular, we propose concentric mixtures of Mallows and Plackett-Luce models\nwith $G (\\ge 2)$ groups. Our models generalize previously proposed concentric\nmixtures of Mallows models with $2$ groups, and we highlight the importance of\n$G > 2$ groups by identifying three distinct groups (expert, intermediate, and\nnon-expert) from existing datasets. Next, we provide conditions on the\nparameters of the underlying models so that SP-voting can recover ground-truth\nrankings with high probability, and also derive sample complexities under the\nsame. We complement the theoretical results by evaluating SP-voting on\nsimulated and real datasets.",

By applying the Holstein-Primakoff\ntransformation, we explore the system in the semiclassical limit as a\nnon-Hermitian Dicke model, revealing rich exceptional points (EPs) and diabolic\npoints in such a system. We find that, by introducing the nonlinear saturation\ngain into an atomic ensemble, higher-order EP can be induced, leading to\nintriguing properties. Furthermore, if the system is extended to a\none-dimensional chain, then the band topology will interplay with the\nnon-Hermitian effect. In the quantum regime, we explore the quantum signature\nof EPs, noting that the conditions for their emergence are influenced by\ndiscrete photon numbers.

The objective is to\nminimize the global cumulative cost, which includes the sum of individual\nhitting costs $f^i_t(x^i_t)$, a temporal \"switching cost\" for changing\ndecisions, and a spatial \"dissimilarity cost\" that penalizes deviations in\ndecisions among neighboring agents. We propose the first truly decentralized\nalgorithm ACORD for multi-agent SOCO that provably exhibits asymptotic\noptimality. Our approach allows each agent to operate using only local\ninformation from its immediate neighbors in the graph. For finite-time\nperformance, we establish that the optimality gap in the competitive ratio\ndecreases with time horizon $T$ and can be conveniently tuned based on the\nper-round computation available to each agent. Our algorithm benefits from a\nprovably scalable computational complexity that depends only logarithmically on\nthe number of agents and almost linearly on their degree within the graph.\nMoreover, our results hold even when the communication graph changes\narbitrarily and adaptively over time.

Our model is capable of accommodating diverse input formats, such as\nimages and varying simulation conditions, and producing a range of outputs,\nfrom simulation results to effective properties. It supports both Cartesian and\nunstructured grids, with design choices that allow for seamless updates and\nextensions as new data and requirements emerge. Our results show that\nincreasing the scale of the model leads to significant performance gains (loss\nscales as $N^{-1.6}$, compared to language models which often scale as\n$N^{-0.5}$).",

    "abstract": "Consumer lighting plays a significant role in the development of smart cities\nand smart villages. With the advancement of (IoT) technology, smart lighting\nsolutions have become more prevalent in residential areas as well. These\nsolutions provide consumers with increased energy efficiency, added\nconvenience, and improved security. On the other hand, the growing number of\nIoT devices has become a global concern due to the carbon footprint and carbon\nemissions associated with these devices. The overuse of batteries increases\nmaintenance and cost to IoT devices and simultaneously possesses adverse\nenvironmental effects, ultimately exacerbating the pace of climate change.\nTherefore, in tandom with the principles of Industry 4.0, it has become crucial\nfor manufacturing and research industries to prioritize sustainable measures\nadhering to smart energy as a prevention to the negative impacts. Consequently,\nit has undoubtedly garnered global interest from scientists, researchers, and\nindustrialists to integrate state-of-the-art technologies in order to solve the\ncurrent issues in consumer light management systems making it a complete\nsustainable, and smart solution for consumer lighting application. This\nmanuscript provides a thorough investigation of various methods as well as\ntechniques to design a state-of-the-art IoT-enabled consumer light management\nsystem. It critically reviews the existing works done in consumer light\nmanagement systems, emphasizing the significant limitations and the need for\nsustainability. The top-down approach of developing sustainable computing\nframeworks for IoT-enabled consumer light management has been reviewed based on\nthe multidisciplinary technologies involved and state-of-the-art works in the\nrespective domains.

The\nquantitative analysis reveals that refugees' preferences for destination\ncountries often change during transit, influenced by factors such as safety\nconcerns, asylum conditions, education, and the presence of relatives at the\ndestination.

    "abstract": "A high-order quadrature scheme is constructed for the evaluation of Laplace\nsingle and double layer potentials and their normal derivatives on smooth\nsurfaces in three dimensions. The construction begins with a harmonic\napproximation of the density on each patch, which allows for a natural harmonic\npolynomial extension in a volumetric neighborhood of the patch in the ambient\nspace. Then by the general Stokes theorem, singular and nearly singular surface\nintegrals are reduced to line integrals preserving the singularity of the\nkernel, instead of the standard origin-centered 1-forms that require expensive\nadaptive integration. These singularity-preserving line integrals can be\nsemi-analytically evaluated using singularity-swap quadrature. In other words,\nthe evaluation of singular and nearly singular surface integrals is reduced to\nfunction evaluations at the vertices on the boundary of each patch. The\nrecursive reduction quadrature largely removes adaptive integration that is\nneeded in most existing high-order quadratures for singular and nearly singular\nsurface integrals, resulting in exceptional performance.

Most\nattention modules follow a squeeze-and-excitation paradigm. However, to design\nsuch attention modules, requires a substantial amount of experiments and\ncomputational resources. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), meanwhile, is able\nto automate the design of neural networks and spares the numerous experiments\nrequired for an optimal architecture. This motivates us to design a search\narchitecture that can automatically find near-optimal attention modules through\nNAS. We propose SASE, a Searching Architecture for Squeeze and Excitation\noperations, to form a plug-and-play attention block by searching within certain\nsearch space. The search space is separated into 4 different sets, each\ncorresponds to the squeeze or excitation operation along the channel or spatial\ndimension. Additionally, the search sets include not only existing attention\nblocks but also other operations that have not been utilized in attention\nmechanisms before. To the best of our knowledge, SASE is the first attempt to\nsubdivide the attention search space and search for architectures beyond\ncurrently known attention modules. The searched attention module is tested with\nextensive experiments across a range of visual tasks. Experimental results\nindicate that visual backbone networks (ResNet-50/101) using the SASE attention\nmodule achieved the best performance compared to those using the current\nstate-of-the-art attention modules.

    "abstract": "The recent discovery of an axial amplitude (Higgs) mode in the long-studied\ncharge density wave (CDW) systems GdTe$_3$ and LaTe$_3$ suggests a heretofore\nunidentified hidden order. A theoretical study proposed that the axial Higgs\nresults from a hidden ferroaxial component of the CDW, which could arise from\nnon-trivial orbital texture. Here, we report extensive experimental studies on\nErTe$_3$ and HoTe$_3$ that possess a high-temperature CDW similar to other\nRTe$_3$ (R = rare earth), along with an additional low-temperature CDW with an\northogonal ordering vector. Combining Raman spectroscopy with large-angle\nconvergent beam electron diffraction (LACBED), rotational anisotropy\nsecond-harmonic generation (RA-SHG), and muon-spin relaxation ($\\mu$SR), we\nprovide unambiguous evidence that the high-temperature CDW breaks translation,\nrotation, and all vertical and diagonal mirror symmetries, but not\ntime-reversal or inversion. In contrast, the low-temperature CDW only\nadditionally breaks translation symmetry. Simultaneously, Raman scattering\nshows the high-temperature CDW produces an axial Higgs mode while the\nlow-temperature mode is scalar. The weak monoclinic structural distortion and\nclear axial response in Raman and SHG are consistent with a ferroaxial phase in\nRTe$_3$ driven by coupled orbital and charge orders. Thus, our study provides a\nnew standard for uncovering unconventional orders and confirms the power of\nHiggs modes to reveal them.",

    "abstract": "Construction remains one of the most hazardous sectors. Recent advancements\nin AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer promising opportunities\nfor enhancing workplace safety. However, responsible integration of LLMs\nrequires systematic evaluation, as deploying them without understanding their\ncapabilities and limitations risks generating inaccurate information, fostering\nmisplaced confidence, and compromising worker safety. This study evaluates the\nperformance of two widely used LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, across three\nstandardized exams administered by the Board of Certified Safety Professionals\n(BCSP). Using 385 questions spanning seven safety knowledge areas, the study\nanalyzes the models' accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Results show that\nboth models consistently exceed the BCSP benchmark, with GPT-4o achieving an\naccuracy rate of 84.6% and GPT-3.5 reaching 73.8%. Both models demonstrate\nstrengths in safety management systems and hazard identification and control,\nbut exhibit weaknesses in science, mathematics, emergency response, and fire\nprevention. An error analysis identifies four primary limitations affecting LLM\nperformance: lack of knowledge, reasoning flaws, memory issues, and calculation\nerrors. Our study also highlights the impact of prompt engineering strategies,\nwith variations in accuracy reaching 13.5% for GPT-3.5 and 7.9% for GPT-4o.\nHowever, no single prompt configuration proves universally effective. This\nresearch advances knowledge in three ways: by identifying areas where LLMs can\nsupport safety practices and where human oversight remains essential, by\noffering practical insights into improving LLM implementation through prompt\nengineering, and by providing evidence-based direction for future research and\ndevelopment. These contributions support the responsible integration of AI in\nconstruction safety management toward achieving zero injuries.",

Second, we show that the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for renormalization convergence are finite-time\ncheckable. Lastly, we show that every infinitely renormalizable H\\'enon-like\nmap is $\\textit{regularly unicritical}$: there exists a unique orbit of\ntangencies between strong-stable and center manifolds, and outside a\nslow-exponentially shrinking neighborhood of this orbit, the dynamics behaves\nas a uniformly partially hyperbolic system.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the major\napproaches for studying affective states. Skin nerve activity (SKNA) derived\nfrom high-frequency components of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has been a\npromising surrogate for assessing the SNS. However, current SKNA analysis tools\nhave shown high variability across study protocols and experiments. Hence, we\npropose a time-varying spectral approach based on SKNA to assess the SNS with\nhigher sensitivity and reliability. We collected ECG signals at a sampling\nfrequency of 10 KHz from sixteen subjects who underwent various SNS\nstimulations. Our spectral analysis revealed that frequency bands between 150 -\n1,000 Hz showed significant increases in power during SNS stimulations. Using\nthis information, we developed a time-varying index of sympathetic function\nmeasurement based on SKNA, termed, Time-Varying Skin Nerve Activity (TVSKNA).\nTVSKNA is calculated in three steps: time-frequency decomposition,\nreconstruction using selected frequency bands, and smoothing. TVSKNA indices\nexhibited generally higher Youden's J, balanced accuracy, and area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve, indicating higher sensitivity. The\ncoefficient of variance was lower with TVSKNA indices for most SNS tasks.\nTVSKNA can serve as a highly sensitive and reliable marker of quantitative\nassessment of sympathetic function, especially during emotion and stress.",

As a result, evaluating the\nsynthesizability of molecules in general drug design scenarios remains a\nsignificant challenge in the field of drug discovery. The commonly used\nsynthetic accessibility (SA) score aims to evaluate the ease of synthesizing\ngenerated molecules, but it falls short of guaranteeing that synthetic routes\ncan actually be found.

    "abstract": "Achieving low remote memory access latency remains the primary challenge in\nrealizing memory disaggregation over Ethernet within the datacenters. We\npresent EDM that attempts to overcome this challenge using two key ideas.\nFirst, while existing network protocols for remote memory access over the\nEthernet, such as TCP/IP and RDMA, are implemented on top of the MAC layer, EDM\ntakes a radical approach by implementing the entire network protocol stack for\nremote memory access within the Physical layer (PHY) of the Ethernet. This\novercomes fundamental latency and bandwidth overheads imposed by the MAC layer,\nespecially for small memory messages. Second, EDM implements a centralized,\nfast, in-network scheduler for memory traffic within the PHY of the Ethernet\nswitch. Inspired by the classic Parallel Iterative Matching (PIM) algorithm,\nthe scheduler dynamically reserves bandwidth between compute and memory nodes\nby creating virtual circuits in the PHY, thus eliminating queuing delay and\nlayer 2 packet processing delay at the switch for memory traffic, while\nmaintaining high bandwidth utilization. Our FPGA testbed demonstrates that\nEDM's network fabric incurs a latency of only $\\sim$300 ns for remote memory\naccess in an unloaded network, which is an order of magnitude lower than\nstate-of-the-art Ethernet-based solutions such as RoCEv2 and comparable to\nemerging PCIe-based solutions such as CXL.

The paper also contains the original\nSanskrit verses describing the various methods and English translations\nthereof. Moreover, there is a presentation of a novel method for computing the\ncircumference of a circle found in Jyeshthadeva's (c. 1500 - 1575 CE)\nYuktibhasha which is based on method (i) for computing the arcsin function.

    "abstract": "This paper aims at improving the convergence to equilibrium of finite ergodic\nMarkov chains via permutations and projections. First, we prove that a specific\nmixture of permuted Markov chains arises naturally as a projection under the KL\ndivergence or the squared-Frobenius norm. We then compare various mixing\nproperties of the mixture with other competing Markov chain samplers and\ndemonstrate that it enjoys improved convergence. This geometric perspective\nmotivates us to propose samplers based on alternating projections to combine\ndifferent permutations and to analyze their rate of convergence. We give\nnecessary, and under some additional assumptions also sufficient, conditions\nfor the projection to achieve stationarity in the limit in terms of the trace\nof the transition matrix. We proceed to discuss tuning strategies of the\nprojection samplers when these permutations are viewed as parameters. Along the\nway, we reveal connections between the mixture and a Markov chain Sylvester's\nequation as well as assignment problems, and highlight how these can be used to\nunderstand and improve Markov chain mixing. We provide two examples as\nillustrations. In the first example, the projection sampler (with a suitable\nchoice of the permutation) improves upon Metropolis-Hastings in a discrete\nbimodal distribution with a reduced relaxation time from exponential to\npolynomial in the system size, while in the second example, the mixture of\npermuted Markov chain yields a mixing time that is logarithmic in system size\n(with high probability under random permutation), compared to a linear mixing\ntime in the Diaconis-Holmes-Neal sampler. Finally, we provide numerical\nexperiments on simple statistical physics models to illustrate the improved\nmixing performance of the proposed projection samplers over standard\nMetropolis-Hastings.",

This ballistic transport\nsignificantly enhances mobility compared to that of bare excitons, which often\nmove diffusively and become the bottleneck for energy conversion and transfer\ndevices. Despite being robustly reproduced in experiments and simulations,\nthere is no comprehensive microscopic theory addressing the group velocity of\npolariton transport, and its renormalization due to phonon scattering while\nstill preserving this ballistic behavior. In this work, we develop a\nmicroscopic theory to describe the group velocity renormalization using a\nfinite-temperature Green's function approach. Utilizing the generalized\nHolstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, we analytically derive an expression for\nthe group velocity renormalization and find that it is caused by\nphonon-mediated transitions from the lower polariton (LP) states to the dark\nstates, then scattering from dark states back to LP. The dark states do not\nhave to be populated in this process, serving as the virtual state for\nsuper-exchange (especially true for a large light-matter detuning). The theory\npredicts that the magnitude of group velocity renormalization scales linearly\nwith the phonon bath reorganization energy under weak coupling conditions\n(perturbative regime for exciton-phonon coupling) and also linearly depends on\nthe temperature in the high-temperature regime. These predictions are\nnumerically verified using quantum dynamics simulations, demonstrating\nquantitative agreement.

    "abstract": "Emerging 3D scene representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and\n3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have demonstrated their effectiveness in\nSimultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for photo-realistic rendering,\nparticularly when using high-quality video sequences as input. However,\nexisting methods struggle with motion-blurred frames, which are common in\nreal-world scenarios like low-light or long-exposure conditions. This often\nresults in a significant reduction in both camera localization accuracy and map\nreconstruction quality. To address this challenge, we propose a dense visual\ndeblur SLAM pipeline (i.e. MBA-SLAM) to handle severe motion-blurred inputs and\nenhance image deblurring. Our approach integrates an efficient motion\nblur-aware tracker with either neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting\nbased mapper. By accurately modeling the physical image formation process of\nmotion-blurred images, our method simultaneously learns 3D scene representation\nand estimates the cameras' local trajectory during exposure time, enabling\nproactive compensation for motion blur caused by camera movement. In our\nexperiments, we demonstrate that MBA-SLAM surpasses previous state-of-the-art\nmethods in both camera localization and map reconstruction, showcasing superior\nperformance across a range of datasets, including synthetic and real datasets\nfeaturing sharp images as well as those affected by motion blur, highlighting\nthe versatility and robustness of our approach.

Previous experimental and theoretical\nstudies have established a hierarchy of local and global reduced-order models\nfor vortex shedding based on the Stuart-Landau and Ginzburg-Landau equations.\nIn this work, we employ data-driven methods to discover a new Landau variable\nfor the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) for periodic two-dimensional\nvortex shedding past a cylinder. We first coarse grain vorticity field data\nfrom direct numerical simulations of the fluid by integrating over the vertical\nspatial dimension, and then time-delay embed this new variable to obtain phase\ninformation necessary for CGLE analysis. Finally, we use the sparse\nidentification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to learn an interpretable system\nof coupled real partial differential equations that balance model complexity\nand prediction error. We develop local homogeneous models in key regions of the\nwake, as well as global heterogeneous models that are parameterized by the\nstreamwise coordinate across the entire wake. After computing the normal-form\nparameters from the discovered equations, we classify the different models and\ndetermine behavior and stability in the different regions of the wake,\ndemonstrating the validity of these models across a range of spatiotemporal\nsubdomains. Different dynamics are found to dominate at different stations\nwithin the wake.

However, many quantum information tools remain agnostic to the\nunderlying spacetime. For instance, whenever we draw a quantum circuit the\neffective spacetime imposed by the connectivity of the physical qubits which\nwill realize this circuit is not taken into account. In this work, we aim to\naddress this limitation by extending the framework of process theories to\ninclude a background causal structure arising from a fixed spacetime. We\nintroduce the notion of process implementations, i.e., decompositions of a\nprocess. A process is then embeddable if and only if one of its implementations\ncan be embedded in such a way that all the component processes are localized\nand all wires follow timelike paths. While conceptually simple, checking for\nembeddability is generally computationally intractable. We therefore work\ntowards simplifying this problem as much as possible, identifying a canonical\nsubset of implementations that determine both the embeddability of a process\nand the causal structures distinguishable at least in some process theory.\nNotably, we discover countably infinite ``zigzag'' causal structures beyond\nthose typically considered. While these can be ignored in classical theory,\nthey seem to be essential in quantum theory, as the quantum CNOT gate can be\nimplemented by all zigzag structures but not in a standard causal structure,\nexcept in the trivial undecomposed way.

    "abstract": "In a two-stage model of choice a decision maker first shortlists a given menu\nand then applies her preferences. We show that a sizeable class of these models\nrun into significant issues in terms of identification of preferences\n(welfare-relevance) and thus cannot be used for welfare analysis. We classify\nthese models by their revealed preference principles and expose the principle\nthat we deem to be the root of their identification issue. Taking our analysis\nto an experimental data, we observe that half of the alternatives that are\nrevealed preferred to another under rational choice are left revealed preferred\nto nothing for any member of this class of models. Furthermore, the\nwelfare-relevance of the specific models established in the literature are much\nworse. The model with the highest welfare-relevance produces a revealed\npreference relation with the average density of 2% (1 out of 45 possible\ncomparisons revealed), while rational choice does 63% (28 out of 45 possible\ncomparisons). We argue that the issue is not an inherent feature of two-stage\nmodels, and rather lies in the approach with which the first stage is modelled\nin the literature.",

    "abstract": "Modern approaches to perform Bayesian variable selection rely mostly on the\nuse of shrinkage priors. That said, an ideal shrinkage prior should be adaptive\nto different signal levels, ensuring that small effects are ruled out, while\nkeeping relatively intact the important ones. With this task in mind, we\ndevelop the nonparametric Bayesian Lasso, an adaptive and flexible shrinkage\nprior for Bayesian regression and variable selection, particularly useful when\nthe number of predictors is comparable or larger than the number of available\ndata points. We build on spike-and-slab Lasso ideas and extend them by placing\na Dirichlet Process prior on the shrinkage parameters. The result is a prior on\nthe regression coefficients that can be seen as an infinite mixture of Double\nExponential densities, all offering different amounts of regularization,\nensuring a more adaptive and flexible shrinkage. We also develop an efficient\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. Through various\nsimulation exercises and real-world data analyses, we demonstrate that our\nproposed method leads to a better recovery of the true regression coefficients,\na better variable selection, and better out-of-sample predictions, highlighting\nthe benefits of the nonparametric Bayesian Lasso over existing shrinkage\npriors.",

    "abstract": "In medical-related tasks, soft robots can perform better than conventional\nrobots because of their compliant building materials and the movements they are\nable perform. However, designing soft robot controllers is not an easy task,\ndue to the non-linear properties of their materials. Since human expertise to\ndesign such controllers is yet not sufficiently effective, a formal design\nprocess is needed. The present research proposes neuroevolution-based\nalgorithms as the core mechanism to automatically generate controllers for\nbiohybrid actuators that can be used on future medical devices, such as a\ncatheter that will deliver drugs. The controllers generated by methodologies\nbased on Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) and Hypercube-based\nNEAT (HyperNEAT) are compared against the ones generated by a standard genetic\nalgorithm (SGA). In specific, the metrics considered are the maximum\ndisplacement in upward bending movement and the robustness to control different\nbiohybrid actuator morphologies without redesigning the control strategy.\nResults indicate that the neuroevolution-based algorithms produce better suited\ncontrollers than the SGA. In particular, NEAT designed the best controllers,\nachieving up to 25% higher displacement when compared with SGA-produced\nspecialised controllers trained over a single morphology and 23% when compared\nwith general purpose controllers trained over a set of morphologies.",

Numerous encounters between galaxies in the central region seem\nto be responsible for the morphology transformation from disks to spheroids.

Despite their impressive capabilities, these models\ncannot currently be directly applied to challenging robot manipulation problems\nthat require complex and precise continuous reasoning over long horizons. Task\nand Motion Planning (TAMP) systems can control high-dimensional continuous\nsystems over long horizons via a hybrid search over traditional primitive robot\nskills. However, these systems require detailed models of how the robot can\nimpact its environment, preventing them from directly interpreting and\naddressing novel human objectives, for example, an arbitrary natural language\ngoal. We propose deploying VLMs within TAMP systems by having them generate\ndiscrete and continuous language-parameterized constraints that enable TAMP to\nreason about open-world concepts. Specifically, we propose algorithms for VLM\npartial planning that constrain a TAMP system's discrete temporal search and\nVLM continuous constraints interpretation to augment the traditional\nmanipulation constraints that TAMP systems seek to satisfy. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach -- OWL-TAMP -- outperforms several related\nbaselines, including those that solely use TAMP or VLMs for planning, across\nseveral long-horizon manipulation tasks specified directly through natural\nlanguage.
