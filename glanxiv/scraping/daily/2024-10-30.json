    "abstract": "Measurement-based quantum computing offers a promising route towards\nscalable, universal photonic quantum computation. This approach relies on the\ndeterministic and efficient generation of photonic graph states in which many\nphotons are mutually entangled with various topologies. Recently, deterministic\nsources of graph states have been demonstrated with quantum emitters in both\nthe optical and microwave domains. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic\nand reconfigurable graph state generation with optical solid-state integrated\nquantum emitters. Specifically, we use a single semiconductor quantum dot in a\ncavity to generate caterpillar graph states, the most general type of graph\nstate that can be produced with a single emitter. By using fast detuned optical\npulses, we achieve full control over the spin state, enabling us to vary the\nentanglement topology at will. We perform quantum state tomography of two\nsuccessive photons, measuring Bell state fidelities up to 0.80$\\pm$0.04 and\nconcurrences up to 0.69$\\pm$0.09, while maintaining high photon\nindistinguishability. This simple optical scheme, compatible with commercially\navailable quantum dot-based single photon sources, brings us a step closer to\nfault-tolerant quantum computing with spins and photons.",

The idea is mapping the optimal solution(s) to a combinatorial\noptimization problem to the minimum energy state(s) of a physical system, which\nnaturally converges to a minimum energy state upon perturbance.

Ising model as a mathematical abstraction can be\nmapped to hardware using traditional devices. In this paper we instead focus on\nIsing machines which represent a network of physical spins directly implemented\nin hardware using, e.g., quantum bits or electronic oscillators. To eliminate\nthe scalability bottleneck due to the mismatch in problem vs. Ising machine\nsize and connectivity, in this paper we make the case for HETRI: Heterogeneous\nIsing Multiprocessing. HETRI organizes the maximum number of physical spins\nthat the underlying technology supports in Ising cores; and multiple\nindependent Ising cores, in Ising chips. Ising cores in a chip feature\ndifferent inter-spin connectivity or spin counts to match the problem\ncharacteristics.

This prompts general\nquestions relating to fundamental differences between coherence phenomena in\nopen and isolated quantum systems.

Our derived\nequations of motion for expected boson occupations turns out to be similar in\nform to the rate equations governing Fr\\\"ohlich-condensation.

Specifically, if the canonical\npurification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB\nin the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions\nin the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be\nefficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices\nexhibit SWSSB.

Gradient Boosting Models\n(XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and sequential models (LSTM, GRU) were trained on\nphysiological and demographic data from the MIMIC-III and IV datasets. A robust\npreprocessing pipeline addressed missing data, class imbalances, and\nincorporated synthetic data flagged with masks. Gradient Boosting Models (GBMs)\noutperformed sequential models in terms of training speed, interpretability,\nand reliability, making them well-suited for real-time decision-making. While\ntheir performance was comparable to that of sequential models, the GBMs used\nscore features from six physiological variables derived from the enhanced\nNational Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2, which we termed NEWS2+. This approach\nsignificantly improved prediction accuracy. While sequential models handled\ntemporal data well, their performance gains did not justify the higher\ncomputational cost. A 5-minute prediction window was chosen for timely\nintervention, with minute-level interpolations standardizing the data. Feature\nimportance analysis highlighted the significant role of mask and score features\nin enhancing both transparency and performance. Temporal dependencies proved to\nbe less critical, as Gradient Boosting Models were able to capture key patterns\neffectively without relying on them.

Existing research\nemphasizes the universality of human mobility, positing that simple models can\ncapture population-level movements. However, population-level accuracy does not\nguarantee consistent performance across all individuals. By overlooking\nindividual differences, universality laws may accurately describe certain\ngroups while less precisely representing others, resulting in aggregate\naccuracy from a balance of discrepancies. Using large-scale mobility data, we\nassess individual-level accuracy of a universal model, the Exploration and\nPreferential Return (EPR), by examining deviations from expected behavior in\ntwo scaling laws - one related to exploration and the other to return patterns.\nOur findings reveal that, while the model can describe population-wide movement\npatterns, it displays widespread deviations linked to individuals' behavioral\ntraits, socioeconomic status, and lifestyles, contradicting model assumptions\nlike non-bursty exploration and preferential return. Specifically, individuals\npoorly represented by the EPR model tend to visit routine locations in\nsequences, exploring rarely but in a bursty manner when they do. Among\nsocioeconomic factors, income most strongly correlates with significant\ndeviations. Consequently, spatial inhomogeneity emerges in model accuracy, with\nlower performance concentrated in urbanized, densely populated areas,\nunderscoring policy implications.

While this approach is\nrapidly adaptable to changing user preferences, only preferences over the types\nof terrain that are already known by the semantic classifier can be expressed.\nIn this paper, we hypothesize that a machine-learning-based alternative to the\nsemantics-based paradigm above will allow for rapid cost assignment adaptation\nto preferences expressed over new terrains at deployment time without the need\nfor additional training. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce and study\nPACER, a novel approach to costmap generation that accepts as input a single\nbirds-eye view (BEV) image of the surrounding area along with a user-specified\npreference context and generates a corresponding BEV costmap that aligns with\nthe preference context. Using both real and synthetic data along with a\ncombination of proposed training tasks, we find that PACER is able to adapt\nquickly to new user preferences while also exhibiting better generalization to\nnovel terrains compared to both semantics-based and representation-learning\napproaches.",

In this work we study the case where U corresponds to either\nlocal or global orthogonal Clifford gates, and W consists of real-valued\nvectors. Our results show that for various situations of interest, this\n``real'' classical shadow protocol improves the sample complexity over the\nstandard scheme based on general Clifford unitaries. For example, when one is\ninterested in estimating the expectation values of arbitrary real-valued\nobservables, global orthogonal Cliffords decrease the required number of\nsamples by a factor of two. More dramatically, for k-local observables composed\nonly of real-valued Pauli operators, sampling local orthogonal Cliffords leads\nto a reduction by an exponential-in-k factor in the sample complexity over\nlocal unitary Cliffords. Finally, we show that by measuring in a basis\ncontaining complex-valued vectors, orthogonal shadows can, in the limit of\nlarge system size, exactly reproduce the original unitary shadows protocol.",

A repetitive\naugmentation procedure is proposed to resolve any infeasibility in the\nsolution.

The effectiveness and\ncomputational efficiency of the proposed approach are assessed through\nextensive experiments on 1,620 test instances across various demand patterns\nand parameter settings. The results show that 195 instances required\naugmentation, mainly those with high penalty costs, low fixed ordering costs,\nlarge demand variability, and extended planning horizons.

As a\ntest of this idea, we present neutron diffraction results for a single crystal\nof La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ (LBCO) with x = 1/8, which is known to undergo two\nstructural transitions on cooling, from high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) to\nlow-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) near 240 K, involving a collective tilt\npattern of the corner-sharing CuO$_6$ octahedra, and from LTO to low\ntemperature tetragonal (LTT) near 56 K, involving a new tilt pattern and the\nappearance of intensity at peaks of type T. We observe both type M and type T\npeaks in the LTT phase, while the type M peaks (but not type T) are still\npresent in the LTO phase. Given that CDW order is observed only in the LTT\nphase of LBCO, it is apparent that the in-plane Cu-O bond anisotropy associated\nwith the octahedral tilt pattern is responsible for charge pinning. We point\nout that evidence for a similar, but weaker, bond anisotropy has been observed\npreviously in LSCO and should be responsible for CDW pinning there. In the case\nof LBCO, the monoclinic distortion may help to explain previously-reported\nmagneto-optical evidence for gyrotropic order.",

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of large language models across various\ntasks, they often struggle with reasoning under negated statements. Negations\nare important in real-world applications as they encode negative polarity in\nverb phrases, clauses, or other expressions. Nevertheless, they are\nunderrepresented in current benchmarks, which mainly include basic negation\nforms and overlook more complex ones, resulting in insufficient data for\ntraining a language model. In this work, we propose NegVerse, a method that\ntackles the lack of negation datasets by producing a diverse range of negation\ntypes from affirmative sentences, including verbal, non-verbal, and affixal\nforms commonly found in English text. We provide new rules for masking parts of\nsentences where negations are most likely to occur, based on syntactic\nstructure and use a frozen baseline LLM and prompt tuning to generate negated\nsentences. We also propose a filtering mechanism to identify negation cues and\nremove degenerate examples, producing a diverse range of meaningful\nperturbations. Our results show that NegVerse outperforms existing methods and\ngenerates negations with higher lexical similarity to the original sentences,\nbetter syntactic preservation and negation diversity.

In this contribution, we introduce a computational\napproach to construct all weights and biases of a recurrent neural network\nwithout using gradient-based methods. The approach is based on a combination of\nrandom feature networks and Koopman operator theory for dynamical systems. The\nhidden parameters of a single recurrent block are sampled at random, while the\nouter weights are constructed using extended dynamic mode decomposition. This\napproach alleviates all problems with backpropagation commonly related to\nrecurrent networks. The connection to Koopman operator theory also allows us to\nstart using results in this area to analyze recurrent neural networks. In\ncomputational experiments on time series, forecasting for chaotic dynamical\nsystems, and control problems, as well as on weather data, we observe that the\ntraining time and forecasting accuracy of the recurrent neural networks we\nconstruct are improved when compared to commonly used gradient-based methods.",

Diverging from traditional designs, this system\nemphasizes enhancing coupling strength while maintaining the compactness of the\nouter shell. We employ parametric optimization techniques, including magnetic\narray simulations, to improve coupling performance. Additionally, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of the rolling robot's motion to assess its operational\neffectiveness in the coupling mechanism. This examination reveals intriguing\nnew motion patterns driven by frictional and sliding effects between the\nrolling disk modules and the ground.

To address this challenge, we introduce\nMDCure, a scalable and effective instruction data generation framework to\nenhance the MD capabilities of LLMs without the computational cost of\npre-training or reliance on human-annotated data. MDCure generates high-quality\nsynthetic MD instruction data over sets of articles via targeted prompts.

With MDCure, we fine-tune a wide variety\nof LLMs up to 70B parameters in size from the FlanT5, Qwen2, and LLAMA3.1 model\nfamilies. Extensive evaluations on a wide range of MD and long-context\nbenchmarks spanning various tasks and domains show MDCure consistently improves\nperformance over pre-trained baselines and base models by up to 75.1%.

Previous works tackle the dynamics shift problem by\naugmenting the reward in the trajectory from the source domain to match the\noptimal trajectory in the target domain. However, this strategy can not be\ndirectly applicable in RCSL owing to (1) the unique form of the RCSL policy\nclass, which explicitly depends on the return, and (2) the absence of a\nstraightforward representation of the optimal trajectory distribution. We\npropose the Return Augmented Decision Transformer (RADT) method, where we\naugment the return in the source domain by aligning its distribution with that\nin the target domain. We provide the theoretical analysis demonstrating that\nthe RCSL policy learned from RADT achieves the same level of suboptimality as\nwould be obtained without a dynamics shift.

Furthermore, two different\nmethods for constructing the initial feasible solution are considered, and\nmultiple variations in the neighborhoods considered are explored in this study.\nThe considered variations and construction methods are evaluated on a total of\n128 instances generated with varying vehicle-to-target ratios, distribution for\ngenerating the targets, and vehicle-target assignment and are benchmarked\nagainst the best-known heuristic for this problem. Two heuristics were finally\nproposed based on the importance provided to objective value or computation\ntime through extensive computational studies.",

    "abstract": "Research into community content moderation often assumes that moderation\nteams govern with a single, unified voice. However, recent work has found that\nmoderators disagree with one another at modest, but concerning rates. The\nproblem is not the root disagreements themselves. Subjectivity in moderation is\nunavoidable, and there are clear benefits to including diverse perspectives\nwithin a moderation team. Instead, the crux of the issue is that, due to\nresource constraints, moderation decisions end up being made by individual\ndecision-makers. The result is decision-making that is inconsistent, which is\nfrustrating for community members. To address this, we develop Venire, an\nML-backed system for panel review on Reddit. Venire uses a machine learning\nmodel trained on log data to identify the cases where moderators are most\nlikely to disagree. Venire fast-tracks these cases for multi-person review.\nIdeally, Venire allows moderators to surface and resolve disagreements that\nwould have otherwise gone unnoticed. We conduct three studies through which we\ndesign and evaluate Venire: a set of formative interviews with moderators,\ntechnical evaluations on two datasets, and a think-aloud study in which\nmoderators used Venire to make decisions on real moderation cases.\nQuantitatively, we demonstrate that Venire is able to improve decision\nconsistency and surface latent disagreements. Qualitatively, we find that\nVenire helps moderators resolve difficult moderation cases more confidently.\nVenire represents a novel paradigm for human-AI content moderation, and shifts\nthe conversation from replacing human decision-making to supporting it.",

Approximate operators, learned from data, can serve\nas efficient surrogate models for problems in computational science and\nengineering, complementing traditional methods. However, despite their\nempirical success, our understanding of the underlying mathematical theory is\nin large part still incomplete. In this paper, we study the approximation of\nLipschitz operators with respect to Gaussian measures. We prove higher Gaussian\nSobolev regularity of Lipschitz operators and establish lower and upper bounds\non the Hermite polynomial approximation error. We then study general\nreconstruction strategies of Lipschitz operators from $m$ arbitrary\n(potentially adaptive) linear samples. As a key finding, we tightly\ncharacterize the corresponding sample complexity, that is, the smallest\nachievable worst-case error among all possible choices of (adaptive) sampling\nand reconstruction strategies in terms of $m$. As a consequence, we identify an\ninherent curse of sample complexity: No method to approximate Lipschitz\noperators based on $m$ linear samples can achieve algebraic convergence rates\nin $m$. On the positive side, we prove that a sufficiently fast spectral decay\nof the covariance operator of the underlying Gaussian measure guarantees\nconvergence rates which are arbitrarily close to any algebraic rate.

A one-way computation is driven entirely by successive adaptive\nmeasurements of a pre-prepared entangled resource state. For each measurement,\nonly one outcome is desired; hence a fundamental question is whether some\nintended measurement scheme can be performed in a robustly deterministic way.\nSo-called flow structures witness robust determinism by providing instructions\nfor correcting undesired outcomes. Pauli flow is one of the broadest of these\nstructures and has been studied extensively. It is known how to find flow\nstructures in polynomial time when they exist; nevertheless, their lengthy and\ncomplex definitions often hinder working with them.\n  We simplify these definitions by providing a new algebraic interpretation of\nPauli flow. This involves defining two matrices arising from the adjacency\nmatrix of the underlying graph: the flow-demand matrix $M$ and the order-demand\nmatrix $N$. We show that Pauli flow exists if and only if there is a right\ninverse $C$ of $M$ such that the product $NC$ forms the adjacency matrix of a\ndirected acyclic graph. From the newly defined algebraic interpretation, we\nobtain $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ algorithms for finding Pauli flow, improving on the\nprevious $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ bound for finding generalised flow, a weaker\nvariant of flow, and $\\mathcal{O}(n^5)$ bound for finding Pauli flow.

Bland-Altman analysis further confirmed high\nconsistency, with most measurements falling within 95% confidence limits. A\nmachine learning approach, using the Supervised Magnitude-Altitude Scoring\n(SMAS) method trained on NanoString data, identified OAS1 as a key marker for\ndistinguishing RT-qPCR positive from negative samples. Remarkably, when applied\nto RNA-Seq data, OAS1 also achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating infected\nfrom uninfected samples using logistic regression, demonstrating its robustness\nacross platforms. Further differential expression analysis identified 12 common\ngenes including ISG15, OAS1, IFI44, IFI27, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFI44L, MX1, MX2,\nOAS2, RSAD2, and OASL which demonstrated the highest levels of statistical\nsignificance and biological relevance across both platforms. Gene Ontology (GO)\nanalysis confirmed that these genes are directly involved in key immune and\nviral infection pathways, reinforcing their importance in EBOV infection. In\naddition, RNA-Seq uniquely identified genes such as CASP5, USP18, and DDX60,\nwhich play key roles in immune regulation and antiviral defense. This finding\nhighlights the broader detection capabilities of RNA-Seq and underscores the\ncomplementary strengths of both platforms in providing a comprehensive and\naccurate assessment of gene expression changes during Ebola virus infection.",

Both in gate operations and atomic transport,\nadditional errors will occur due to leakage out of the computation space,\natomic motional heating, or loss of an atom out of a trap completely. In this\nwork, we address these error channels in a unified manner through laser\nfluorescence that can detect and cool the atom without disturbing the quantum\ninformation encoded therein. As only the electrons in the atom couple directly\nto the laser field, such quantum nondemolition (QND) processes are made\npossible by encoding quantum information in the nuclear spin of alkaline\nearth-like atoms and avoiding the effects of the hyperfine interaction which\ncouples it to the electrons. By detuning a fluorescence laser off-resonantly\nfrom the $\\mathrm{^1S_0} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{^1P_1}$ transition, far compared\nto the (small) hyperfine spitting, optical pumping between nuclear states falls\noff rapidly with detuning, scaling as $~1/\\Delta^4$. In contrast, Rayleigh\nscattering falls off as $~1/\\Delta^2$. We also consider a resonant leakage\ndetection protocol off the $^1\\mathrm{P}_1$ line. This is achieved by disabling\nthe hyperfine coupling via a strong AC stark effect and canceling the residual\nlightshifts via dressing. The same scheme can be used to recool the atoms\ntowards the vibrational ground state for the quantum information encoded in the\nground state of alkaline earth atoms while preserving the coherence. These\nadvances could significantly improve the prospect of neutral atoms for\nfault-tolerant quantum computation.",

These objects\nexhibit diverse physical properties, such as Young$'$s modulus and bending\nstiffness.Such diversity poses challenges for developing generalized\nmanipulation policies. However, previous research limited their scope to\nsingle-material DLOs and engaged in time-consuming data collection for the\nstate estimation. In this paper, we propose a two-stage manipulation approach\nconsisting of a material property (e.g., flexibility) estimation and policy\nlearning for DLO insertion with reinforcement learning. Firstly, we design a\nflexibility estimation scheme that characterizes the properties of different\ntypes of DLOs. The ground truth flexibility data is collected in simulation to\ntrain our flexibility estimation module. During the manipulation, the robot\ninteracts with the DLOs to estimate flexibility by analyzing their visual\nconfigurations. Secondly, we train a policy conditioned on the estimated\nflexibility to perform challenging DLO insertion tasks. Our pipeline trained\nwith diverse insertion scenarios achieves an 85.6% success rate in simulation\nand 66.67% in real robot experiments.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is not yet competitive for many cyber-physical\nsystems, such as robotics, process automation, and power systems, as training\non a system with physical components cannot be accelerated, and simulation\nmodels do not exist or suffer from a large simulation-to-reality gap. During\nthe long training time, expensive equipment cannot be used and might even be\ndamaged due to inappropriate actions of the reinforcement learning agent. Our\nnovel approach addresses exactly this problem: We train the reinforcement agent\nin a so-called shadow mode with the assistance of an existing conventional\ncontroller, which does not have to be trained and instantaneously performs\nreasonably well. In shadow mode, the agent relies on the controller to provide\naction samples and guidance towards favourable states to learn the task, while\nsimultaneously estimating for which states the learned agent will receive a\nhigher reward than the conventional controller. The RL agent will then control\nthe system for these states and all other regions remain under the control of\nthe existing controller. Over time, the RL agent will take over for an\nincreasing amount of states, while leaving control to the baseline, where it\ncannot surpass its performance. Thus, we keep regret during training low and\nimprove the performance compared to only using conventional controllers or\nreinforcement learning. We present and evaluate two mechanisms for deciding\nwhether to use the RL agent or the conventional controller. The usefulness of\nour approach is demonstrated for a reach-avoid task, for which we are able to\neffectively train an agent, where standard approaches fail.",

Here, we exploited several\ncustom-pulled double-clad fibers to achieve the symmetry break required to\nexcite higher-order modes. The resulting components are short and exhibit high\nmodal isolation and low excess loss. They address some of the limitations of\nexisting photonic lanterns in terms of fragility and coupling efficiency. The\nfabrication process involves the use of lower-index capillary tubes to maintain\nfiber geometry during fusion and tapering. Through the use of varying first\ncladding diameters, mode selectivity is achieved without sacrificing\nsingle-mode compatibility. This in turn allows proper real-time\ncharacterization during the whole fabrication process. Results demonstrate that\ndouble-clad fibers stacked inside a fluoride-doped capillary tube feature high\nmodal isolation (above 60dB) and low excess loss (lower than 0.49dB), over a\nbroad wavelength range (more than 250nm) with steeper taper profiles, and more\nrobust components. The use of less expensive synthetic fused silica capillary\ntubes achieves high modal isolation (above 20dB) and excess loss lower than 2dB\nover the same broad wavelength range.",

We also quantified the similarities of the sizes, masses, and spacings\nof planets within each system, conducting both intra- and inter-system\nanalyses. Our results corroborate previous research showing that planets\norbiting the same star tend to be regularly spaced and that pairs of adjacent\nplanets with radii<1 R_Earth predominantly have orbital period ratios (PRs)<2.\nIn contrast to other studies, we identified a significant similarity of\nadjacent orbital spacings not only at PRs<4 but also at 1.17<PRs<2662. For the\nsystems with transiting planets, we additionally found that the reported\ncorrelation between the PRs and the sizes of adjacent planets disappears when\nplanet pairs with R<1 R_Earth are excluded. Furthermore, we examined the data\nfor possible correlations between the intra-system dispersions of orbital\nspacings and those of the planetary radii and masses.

    "abstract": "First-order methods (FOMs) are arguably the most scalable algorithms for\nequilibrium computation in large extensive-form games. To operationalize these\nmethods, a distance-generating function, acting as a regularizer for the\nstrategy space, must be chosen. The ratio between the strong convexity modulus\nand the diameter of the regularizer is a key parameter in the analysis of FOMs.\nA natural question is then: what is the optimal distance-generating function\nfor extensive-form decision spaces? In this paper, we make a number of\ncontributions, ultimately establishing that the weight-one dilated entropy\n(DilEnt) distance-generating function is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The\nDilEnt regularizer is notable due to its iterate-equivalence with Kernelized\nOMWU (KOMWU) -- the algorithm with state-of-the-art dependence on the game tree\nsize in extensive-form games -- when used in conjunction with the online mirror\ndescent (OMD) algorithm. However, the standard analysis for OMD is unable to\nestablish such a result; the only current analysis is by appealing to the\niterate equivalence to KOMWU. We close this gap by introducing a pair of\nprimal-dual treeplex norms, which we contend form the natural analytic\nviewpoint for studying the strong convexity of DilEnt. Using these norm pairs,\nwe recover the diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio that predicts the same\nperformance as KOMWU. Along with a new regret lower bound for online learning\nin sequence-form strategy spaces, we show that this ratio is nearly optimal.\nFinally, we showcase our analytic techniques by refining the analysis of\nClairvoyant OMD when paired with DilEnt, establishing an $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log\n|\\mathcal{V}| \\log T/T)$ approximation rate to coarse correlated equilibrium in\n$n$-player games, where $|\\mathcal{V}|$ is the number of reduced normal-form\nstrategies of the players, establishing the new state of the art.",

The hopping\nparameters are either aperiodically or randomly distributed. Our approach\nunifies techniques to solve SYK-like models in the large $N$ limit with a\nreal-space renormalization group method known as strong-disorder\nrenormalization group (SDRG). We show that the SDRG decimation of SYK dots\nlinked by a strong hopping induces an effective hopping interaction between\ntheir neighbouring sites. If two decimated sites are nearest neighbours, in the\nlarge $q$ limit their local ground states admit a holographic dual description\nin terms of eternal traversable wormholes. At the end of the SDRG procedure, we\nobtain a factorised ground state of the infinite inhomogeneous SYK chains that\nwe consider, which has a spacetime description involving a sequence of\nwormholes.

Operating within the constraints of limited managerial authority,\nthe HGRL framework demonstrates superior performance across a range of\nenvironmental conditions, outperforming established baseline methods. Our\nfindings highlight the critical influence of agent-to-agent learning (social\nlearning) on system behavior: under low social learning, the HGRL manager\npreserves cooperation, forming robust core-periphery networks dominated by\ncooperators. In contrast, high social learning accelerates defection, leading\nto sparser, chain-like networks. Additionally, the study underscores the\nimportance of the system manager's authority level in preventing system-wide\nfailures, such as agent rebellion or collapse, positioning HGRL as a powerful\ntool for dynamic network-based governance.",

    "abstract": "Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a widely used tool for nanoparticle\ncharacterization, but long-term directional drift can compromise image quality.\nWe present a novel algorithm for post-imaging drift correction in SEM\nnanoparticle imaging. Our approach combines multiple rapidly acquired, noisy\nimages to produce a single high-quality overlay through redundant\ncross-correlation, preventing drift-induced distortions. The preservation of\ncritical geometrical properties and accurate imaging of surface features were\nverified using Atomic Force Microscopy. On platinum nanoparticles with\ndiameters of 300 to 1000 nm, significant improvements in the mean-based\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were achieved, increasing from 4.4 dB in single\nimages to 11.3 dB when overlaying five images. This method offers a valuable\ntool for enhancing SEM image quality in nanoparticle research and metrology,\nparticularly in settings without specialized hardware-based drift correction.",

    "abstract": "Despite best efforts, various challenges remain in the creation and\nmaintenance processes of digital twins (DTs). One of those primary challenges\nis the constant, continuous and omnipresent evolution of systems, their user's\nneeds and their environment, demanding the adaptation of the developed DT\nsystems. DTs are developed for a specific purpose, which generally entails the\nmonitoring, analysis, simulation or optimization of a specific aspect of an\nactual system, referred to as the actual twin (AT). As such, when the twin\nsystem changes, that is either the AT itself changes, or the scope/purpose of a\nDT is modified, the DTs usually evolve in close synchronicity with the AT. As\nDTs are software systems, the best practices or methodologies for software\nevolution can be leveraged. This paper tackles the challenge of maintaining a\n(set of) DT(s) throughout the evolution of the user's requirements and\npriorities and tries to understand how this evolution takes place. In doing so,\nwe provide two contributions: (i) we develop DarTwin, a visual notation form\nthat enables reasoning on a twin system, its purposes, properties and\nimplementation, and (ii) we introduce a set of architectural transformations\nthat describe the evolution of DT systems. The development of these\ntransformations is driven and illustrated by the evolution and transformations\nof a family home's DT, whose purpose is expanded, changed and re-prioritized\nthroughout its ongoing lifecycle. Additionally, we evaluate the transformations\non a lab-scale gantry crane's DT.",

Fibernet uses cardiac activation as\nrecorded during electroanatomical mappings to infer local conduction properties\nusing physics-informed neural networks. In this work, we extend Fibernet to\ncope with the uncertainty in the estimated fiber field. Specifically, we use an\nensemble of neural networks to produce multiple samples, all fitting the\nobserved data, and compute posterior statistics. We also introduce a\nmethodology to select the best fiber orientation members and define the input\nof the neural networks directly on the atrial surface. With these improvements,\nwe outperform the previous methodology in terms of fiber orientation error in 8\ndifferent atrial anatomies. Currently, our approach can estimate the fiber\norientation and conduction velocities in under 7 minutes with quantified\nuncertainty, which opens the door to its application in clinical practice.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the transition to clean bus fleets has accelerated. Although\nthis transition might bring environmental and economic benefits, it requires a\nlong-term strategic plan due to the large investment costs involved. This paper\nproposes a multi-stage stochastic program to optimize strategic plans for the\nclean bus fleet transition that explicitly considers the uncertainty scenarios\nin the cost and efficiency improvements of clean buses. Our optimization model\nminimizes the total expected cost subject to emission targets, budget\nrestrictions and several other operational considerations. We propose a new\nforecasting approach that captures the correlation between these improvements\nto obtain realistic future pathways for Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) and\nHydrogen Fuel Cell Buses (HFCBs), which are then given to the multi-stage\nstochastic program as scenarios. We also utilize a physics-based model for BEBs\nto accurately capture their energy consumption and recharging needs. As a case\nstudy, we focus on the complex public bus network of Istanbul, which aims to\ntransition to a clean bus fleet by 2050. Utilizing real datasets, we solve a\nfive-stage stochastic program spanning a 25-year planning horizon that involves\n256 scenarios to obtain dynamic strategic plans that can be used by the policy\nmakers. Our results suggest that BEBs are more advantageous than HFCBs, even in\nslow BEB but fast HFCB development scenarios.

Automatic, data-driven detection methods\nexist but show limited performance. Still, the rise of deep learning (DL)-with\nits ability to reproduce human-like abilities-could revolutionize clinical MEG\npractice. Here, we developed and validated STIED, a simple yet powerful\nsupervised DL algorithm combining two convolutional neural networks with\ntemporal (1D time-course) and spatial (2D topography) features of MEG signals\ninspired from current clinical guidelines. Our DL model enabled both temporal\nand spatial localization of IEDs in patients suffering from focal epilepsy with\nfrequent and high amplitude spikes (FE group), with high-performance\nmetrics-accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity all exceeding 85%-when learning\nfrom spatiotemporal features of IEDs. This performance can be attributed to our\nhandling of input data, which mimics established clinical MEG practice. Reverse\nengineering further revealed that STIED encodes fine spatiotemporal features of\nIEDs rather than their mere amplitude. The model trained on the FE group also\nshowed promising results when applied to a separate group of presurgical\npatients with different types of refractory focal epilepsy, though further work\nis needed to distinguish IEDs from physiological transients.

As evidence of HD correlations in PTA data\nmounts in coming years, it is important to develop principled strategies for\nflexibly and optimally reconstructing the pattern of interpulsar timing\ncorrelations, both to test how well the correlations track the HD pattern and\nto possibly detect additional effects, systematic or otherwise. To this end, we\ndevelop orthonormal basis functions that fully capture HD correlations and\neliminate covariances between the HD curve and any additional correlated\nstructure. We do this analytically and in a data-adaptive way informed by\n\"optimal statistic\" analysis techniques widely used by PTA groups. These bases\nare adaptive in that they will vary from PTA to PTA and from data release to\ndata release as new pulsars of varied timing quality and baseline are added to\narrays, as instrumentation advances, and as observations accrue.

    "abstract": "We investigate the geometric response of chiral superfluids when coupled to a\ndynamic background geometry. We find that geometry fluctuations, represented by\nthe flexural mode, interact with the superfluid phase fluctuations (the\nGoldstone mode). Starting from a minimally coupled theory, we derive the\nequilibrium conditions for a static background defined by supercurrent,\ncurvature, and tension, and then obtain linearized equations for the\npropagation of the Goldstone and flexural modes. The equations reveal\ndistinctive chirality-dependent effects in the propagation of the flexural\nmode. Specifically, a background supercurrent induces a chiral drag effect,\nlocalizing flexural waves at the superfluid boundary, while background\ncurvature introduces anisotropic corrections to the superfluid phase and group\nvelocities, as well as a tension in the flexural mode dispersion. Furthermore,\ncurvature couples flexural and phase modes into dressed excitations, with\ntilted Dirac cones along the principal curvature directions. These effects\nprovide dynamical signatures of the formation of a chiral condensate, and can\nbe tuned by manipulating the background geometry.",

Despite this,\nthe literature indicates that work in this latter discipline is still in its\nearly stages. This study aims to understand the challenges faced by machine\nlearning approaches in crime linkage and to support foundational knowledge for\nfuture data-driven methods.

    "abstract": "We report the discovery of the repeating fast radio burst source FRB\n20240209A using the CHIME/FRB telescope. We have detected 22 bursts from this\nrepeater between February and July 2024, six of which were also recorded at the\nOutrigger station KKO. The 66-km long CHIME-KKO baseline can provide\nsingle-pulse FRB localizations along one dimension with $2^{\\prime\\prime}$\naccuracy. The high declination of $\\sim$86 degrees for this repeater allowed\nits detection with a rotating range of baseline vectors, enabling the combined\nlocalization region size to be constrained to\n$1^{\\prime\\prime}\\times2^{\\prime\\prime}$. We present deep Gemini observations\nthat, combined with the FRB localization, enabled a robust association of FRB\n20240209A to the outskirts of a luminous galaxy (P(O|x) = 0.99; $L \\approx 5.3\n\\times 10^{10}\\,L_{\\odot}$). FRB 20240209A has a projected physical offset of\n$40 \\pm 5$ kpc from the center of its host galaxy, making it the FRB with the\nlargest host galaxy offset to date. When normalized by the host galaxy size,\nthe offset of FRB 20240209A is comparable to that of FRB 20200120E, the only\nFRB source known to originate in a globular cluster. We consider several\nexplanations for the large offset, including a progenitor that was kicked from\nthe host galaxy or in situ formation in a low-luminosity satellite galaxy of\nthe putative host, but find the most plausible scenario to be a globular\ncluster origin. This, coupled with the quiescent, elliptical nature of the host\nas demonstrated in our companion paper, provide strong evidence for a delayed\nformation channel for the progenitor of the FRB source.",

By comparing with the $\\Lambda$CDM mass\nclustering correlation function, we measure the quasar bias to be\n$b_Q\\approx2.1$, implying a quasar halo mass of\n$M_{halo}\\approx8.5\\times10^{11}$h$^{-1} M_\\odot$. Second, we cross-correlate\nthese $z\\approx1.7$ ATLAS quasars with the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) lensing maps, detecting a somewhat stronger signal at $4'<\\theta<60'$\nthan previous authors. Scaling these authors' model fit to our data we estimate\na quasar host halo mass of $M_{halo}\\approx8.3\\times10^{11}h^{-1}$M$_{\\odot}$.\nThird, we fit Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model parameters to our quasar\nauto-correlation function and from the derived halo mass function we estimate a\nquasar halo mass of $M_{halo}\\approx2.5\\times10^{12}$h$^{-1} M_\\odot$. We then\ncompare our HOD model prediction to our quasar-CMB lensing result, confirming\ntheir consistency. We find that most ($\\approx2/3$) QSOs have halo masses\nwithin a factor of $\\approx3$ of this average mass. An analysis based on the\nprobability of X-ray detections of AGN in galaxies and the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction gives a similarly small mass range.

Wavefront shaping with spatial light modulators (SLMs) facilitates\nscalability of the transmission media by allowing for channel diagonalization\nand quasi-single-input single-output operation. Programmable mode multiplexing\nconfigurations like multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) utilise the SLM and\noffer the potential to simultaneously launch an arbitrary subset of spatial\ntributaries in any N-mode MMF. Such programmable optical processor would enable\nthe throughput of space-division multiplexing (SDM) systems to be progressively\nincreased by addressing a growing number of tributaries over one MMF and in\nthis way meet a growing traffic demand - similarly to the wavelength-division\nmultiplexing evolution path. Conventionally, MPLC phasemasks are calculated\nusing the wavefront matching algorithm (WMA). However, this method does not\nexploit the full potential of programmable mode multiplexers. We show, that\ncomputer-generated hologram algorithms like direct search enable significant\nimprovement compared to the traditional WMA-approach. Such gains are enabled by\ntailored cost functions with dynamic constraints concerning insertion loss as\nwell as mode extinction ratio. We show that average mode extinction ratio can\nbe greatly improved by as much as 15 dB at the expense of insertion loss\ndeterioration of < 3 dB. One particular feature of programmable mode\nmultiplexers is the adaptability to optimised transmission functions. Besides\nconventional LP modes transmission, we employ our approach on Schmidt modes,\nwhich are spatial eigenchannels with minimum crosstalk derived from a measured\ntransmission matrix.",

The cat qubits' noise bias enables\nmore hardware-efficient quantum error correction, and the use of transmons\nallows for practical, high-fidelity syndrome measurement. While correction of\nthe dominant cat Z errors with a repetition code has recently been demonstrated\nin experiment, here we show how the architecture can be scaled beyond a\nrepetition code. In particular, we propose a cat-transmon entangling gate that\nenables the correction of residual cat X errors in a thin rectangular surface\ncode, so that logical error can be arbitrarily suppressed by increasing code\ndistance. We numerically estimate logical memory performance, finding\nsignificant overhead reductions in comparison to architectures without biased\nnoise. For example, with current state-of-the-art coherence, physical error\nrates of $10^{-3}$ and noise biases in the range $10^{3} - 10^{4}$ are\nachievable. With this level of performance, the qubit overhead required to\nreach algorithmically-relevant logical error rates with the cat-transmon\narchitecture matches that of an unbiased-noise architecture with physical error\nrates in the range $10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$.",

    "abstract": "The non-convex nature of trained neural networks has created significant\nobstacles in their incorporation into optimization models. Considering the wide\narray of applications that this embedding has, the optimization and deep\nlearning communities have dedicated significant efforts to the convexification\nof trained neural networks. Many approaches to date have considered obtaining\nconvex relaxations for each non-linear activation in isolation, which poses\nlimitations in the tightness of the relaxations. Anderson et al. (2020)\nstrengthened these relaxations and provided a framework to obtain the convex\nhull of the graph of a piecewise linear convex activation composed with an\naffine function; this effectively convexifies activations such as the ReLU\ntogether with the affine transformation that precedes it. In this article, we\ncontribute to this line of work by developing a recursive formula that yields a\ntight convexification for the composition of an activation with an affine\nfunction for a wide scope of activation functions, namely, convex or\n``S-shaped\". Our approach can be used to efficiently compute separating\nhyperplanes or determine that none exists in various settings, including\nnon-polyhedral cases. We provide computational experiments to test the\nempirical benefits of these convex approximations.",

To mitigate this burden, language\ndesigners have started incorporating support for type inference, where the\ncompiler infers the type of a variable based on its declaration/usage context.\nAs a result, type annotations are optional in certain contexts, and developers\nare empowered to use type inference in these situations. However, the usage\npatterns of type annotations in languages that support type inference are\nunclear. These patterns can help provide evidence for further research in\nprogram comprehension, in language design, and for education. We conduct a\nlarge-scale empirical study using Boa, a tool for mining software repositories,\nto investigate when and where developers use type inference in 498,963 Kotlin\nprojects. We choose Kotlin because it is the default language for Android\ndevelopment, one of the largest software marketplaces. Additionally, Kotlin has\nsupported declaration-site optional type annotations from its initial release.\nOur findings reveal that type inference is frequently employed for local\nvariables and variables initialized with method calls declared outside the file\nare more likely to use type inference.

    "abstract": "In the field of large language model (LLM)-based proof generation, despite\nextensive training on large datasets such as ArXiv, LLMs still exhibit only\nmodest performance on proving tasks of moderate difficulty. We believe that\nthis is partly due to the widespread presence of suboptimal ordering within the\ndata for each proof used in training. For example, published proofs often\nfollow a purely logical order, where each step logically proceeds from the\nprevious steps based on the deductive rules. This order is designed to\nfacilitate the verification of the proof's soundness, rather than to help\npeople and models learn the discovery process of the proof. In proof\ngeneration, we argue that the optimal order for one training data sample occurs\nwhen the relevant intermediate supervision for a particular proof step in the\nproof is always positioned to the left of that proof step. We call such order\nthe intuitively sequential order. We validate our claims using two tasks:\nintuitionistic propositional logic theorem-proving and digit multiplication.\nOur experiments verify the order effect and provide support for our\nexplanations. We demonstrate that training is most effective when the proof is\nin the intuitively sequential order. Moreover, the order effect and the\nperformance gap between models trained on different data orders can be\nsubstantial -- with an 11 percent improvement in proof success rate observed in\nthe propositional logic theorem-proving task, between models trained on the\noptimal order compared to the worst order. Lastly, we define a common type of\norder issue in advanced math proofs and find that 17.3 percent of theorems with\nnontrivial proofs in the first two chapters of a widely used graduate-level\nmathematics textbook suffer from this issue. A detailed list of those proofs is\nprovided in the appendix.",

The first eRASS (eRASS1) was completed at solar minimum, when\nsolar wind charge exchange emission was minimal, providing the clearest view of\nthe SXRB. We aim to extract spatial and spectral information from each\nconstituent of the SXRB in the western Galactic hemisphere, focusing on the\nlocal hot bubble (LHB). We extracted and analysed eRASS1 spectra from almost\nall directions in the western Galactic hemisphere by dividing the sky into\nequal signal-to-noise bins. We fitted all bins with fixed spectral templates of\nknown background constituents. We find the temperature of the LHB exhibits a\nnorth-south dichotomy at high latitudes ($|b|>30^{\\circ}$), with the south\nbeing hotter, with a mean temperature at $kT=121.8\\pm0.6\\,$eV and the north at\n$kT=100.8\\pm0.5\\,$eV. At low latitudes, the LHB temperature increases towards\nthe Galactic plane, especially towards the inner Galaxy. The LHB emission\nmeasure (${\\rm EM_{LHB}}$) enhances approximately towards the Galactic poles.\nThe ${\\rm EM_{LHB}}$ map shows clear anti-correlation with the local dust\ncolumn density. In particular, we found tunnels of dust cavities filled with\nhot plasma, potentially forming a wider network of hot interstellar medium. We\nalso constructed a three-dimensional LHB model from ${\\rm EM_{LHB}}$, assuming\nconstant density. The average thermal pressure of the LHB is $P_{\\rm\nthermal}/k=10100^{+1200}_{-1500}\\,{\\rm cm^{-3}\\,K}$, a lower value than typical\nsupernova remnants and wind-blown bubbles. This could be an indication of the\nLHB being open towards high Galactic latitudes.",

We use a custom M31 photometric decomposition and A-LIST\nspectral templates to derive the radial velocity, velocity dispersion,\nmetallicity, and $\\alpha$ abundance for both components in each spectrum. In\nthe bulge, one component exhibits little net rotation, high velocity dispersion\n($\\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$), near-solar metallicity, and high $\\alpha$ abundance\n([$\\alpha$/M] = 0.28), while the second component shows structured rotation,\nlower velocity dispersion ($\\sim$121 km s$^{-1}$), and slightly higher\nabundances ([M/H] = 0.09, [$\\alpha$/M] = 0.3).

We further test the\ncluster and galaxy HOD models in the 2-halo range using the Planck Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) lensing map, finding that the cross-correlation with\nboth the poorest clusters and the galaxies may be marginally over-predicted by\nthe above HOD models.

Coupled with a star formation rate $<0.36\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}\\ yr^{-1}}$,\nthe specific star formation rate $<10^{-11.8}\\rm\\ yr^{-1}$ classifies the host\nas quiescent. Through surface brightness profile modeling, we determine an\nelliptical galaxy morphology, marking the host as the first confirmed\nelliptical FRB host. The discovery of a quiescent early-type host galaxy within\na transient class predominantly characterized by late-type star-forming hosts\nis reminiscent of short-duration gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernovae, and\nultraluminous X-ray sources. Based on these shared host demographics, coupled\nwith a large offset as demonstrated in our companion paper, we conclude that\npreferred progenitors for FRB20240209A include magnetars formed through merging\nbinary neutron stars/white dwarfs or the accretion-induced collapse of a white\ndwarf, or a luminous X-ray binary. Together with FRB20200120E localized to a\nglobular cluster in M81, our findings provide strong evidence that some\nfraction of FRBs may arise from a process distinct from the core collapse of\nmassive stars.",

    "abstract": "Modeling unresolved turbulence in astrophysical gasdynamic simulations can\nimprove the modeling of other subgrid processes dependent on the turbulent\nstructure of gas: from flame propagation in the interiors of combusting white\ndwarfs to star formation and chemical reaction rates in the interstellar\nmedium, and non-thermal pressure support of circum- and intergalactic gas. We\npresent a simple method for modeling unresolved turbulence in hydrodynamic\nsimulations via tracking its sourcing by local numerical dissipation and\nmodeling its decay into heat. This method is physically justified by the\ngeneric property of turbulent flows that they dissipate kinetic energy at a\nrate set by the energy cascade rate from large scales, which is independent of\nfluid viscosity regardless of its nature, be it physical or numerical. We\ncalibrate and test our model against decaying supersonic turbulence\nsimulations. Despite its simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces\nmultiple non-trivial features of the high-resolution turbulence run: the\ntemporal evolution of the average small-scale turbulence, its dependence on\nspatial scale, and the slope and scatter of the local correlation between\nsubgrid turbulent velocities, gas densities, and local compression rates. As an\nexample of practical applications, we use our model in isolated galactic disk\nsimulations to model locally variable star formation efficiency at the\nsubresolution scale. In the supersonic, star-forming gas, the new model\nperforms comparably to a more sophisticated model where the turbulent cascade\nis described by explicit subgrid terms. Our new model is straightforward to\nimplement in many hydrodynamic codes used in galaxy simulations as it utilizes\nalready existing infrastructure to implicitly track the numerical dissipation\nin such codes.",

We\nalleviate the issue in this work from two perspectives. 1) From the data\naspect, we carefully collect a human-centric dataset comprising over one\nmillion high-quality human-in-the-scene images and two specific sets of\nclose-up images of faces and hands.

When compared to DistilBERT (66M) and\nClinicalBERT (110M), LastBERT demonstrated comparable performance, with\nDistilBERT slightly outperforming it at 87%, and ClinicalBERT achieving 86%\nacross the same metrics. These findings highlight the LastBERT model's capacity\nto classify degrees of ADHD severity properly, so it offers a useful tool for\nmental health professionals to assess and comprehend material produced by users\non social networking platforms. The study emphasizes the possibilities of\nknowledge distillation to produce effective models fit for use in\nresource-limited conditions, hence advancing NLP and mental health diagnosis.\nFurthermore underlined by the considerable decrease in model size without\nappreciable performance loss is the lower computational resources needed for\ntraining and deployment, hence facilitating greater applicability. Especially\nusing readily available computational tools like Google Colab. This study shows\nthe accessibility and usefulness of advanced NLP methods in pragmatic world\napplications.",

Then, we propose\ntwo key modules to tackle the two main challenges: generating accurate and\nnatural relationships, especially when significant pose adjustments are\nrequired, and avoiding object confusion in cases of overlap. First, we\nintroduce a keypoint matching loss that effectively guides the model in\nadjusting object poses closely tied to their relationships. Second, we\nincorporate local features of the image prompts to better distinguish between\nobjects, preventing confusion in overlapping cases. Extensive results on our\nproposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DreamRelation in generating\nprecise relations while preserving object identities across a diverse set of\nobjects and relationships.",

Previous video generation models, however,\nprimarily focus on slow learning by pre-training on vast amounts of data,\noverlooking the fast learning phase crucial for episodic memory storage. This\noversight leads to inconsistencies across temporally distant frames when\ngenerating longer videos, as these frames fall beyond the model's context\nwindow. To this end, we introduce SlowFast-VGen, a novel dual-speed learning\nsystem for action-driven long video generation. Our approach incorporates a\nmasked conditional video diffusion model for the slow learning of world\ndynamics, alongside an inference-time fast learning strategy based on a\ntemporal LoRA module. Specifically, the fast learning process updates its\ntemporal LoRA parameters based on local inputs and outputs, thereby efficiently\nstoring episodic memory in its parameters. We further propose a slow-fast\nlearning loop algorithm that seamlessly integrates the inner fast learning loop\ninto the outer slow learning loop, enabling the recall of prior multi-episode\nexperiences for context-aware skill learning. To facilitate the slow learning\nof an approximate world model, we collect a large-scale dataset of 200k videos\nwith language action annotations, covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments show that SlowFast-VGen outperforms baselines across various\nmetrics for action-driven video generation, achieving an FVD score of 514\ncompared to 782, and maintaining consistency in longer videos, with an average\nof 0.37 scene cuts versus 0.89.

In this work, we introduce\nMulti-Student Distillation (MSD), a framework to distill a conditional teacher\ndiffusion model into multiple single-step generators.

MSD trains multiple distilled\nstudents, allowing smaller sizes and, therefore, faster inference. Also, MSD\noffers a lightweight quality boost over single-student distillation with the\nsame architecture. We demonstrate MSD is effective by training multiple\nsame-sized or smaller students on single-step distillation using distribution\nmatching and adversarial distillation techniques. With smaller students, MSD\ngets competitive results with faster inference for single-step generation.\nUsing 4 same-sized students, MSD significantly outperforms single-student\nbaseline counterparts and achieves remarkable FID scores for one-step image\ngeneration: 1.20 on ImageNet-64x64 and 8.20 on zero-shot COCO2014.",

In this work we study FRS in binary oxides based memristors by\ninvestigating the dynamics of oxygen vacancies (OV) on a two dimensional\nlattice and their role in forming low-resistance paths that facilitate the\ntransition between high and low global resistance states. We reveal that the\nmere formation of an OV percolation path is insufficient to induce a transition\nto a low-resistance state. Instead, an OV concentration exceeding a critical\nthreshold across all sites in the filament is required to generate a\nlow-resistivity conducting path. Furthermore, we simulate the impact of static\ndefects -which block OV migration and would correspond to voids in real porous\nsamples-, on filament formation. We show that there is a range of defect\ndensity values where OV percolate through the sample, leading to the formation\nof OV filaments, but conductive paths remain absent. Additionally, a small\nconcentration of defects can reduce the final value of the low-resistance\nstate, thereby increasing the ON-OFF ratio.

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning (MU) has gained significant attention as a means to remove\nspecific data from trained models without requiring a full retraining process.\nWhile progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image\nclassification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively\nunderexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in\nCLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual\nrepresentations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and\nselectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that\nunlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three\nkey modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget\nset, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a\nConsistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model.\nExtensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP\ndownstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated\nassociations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the\nmodel's performance on the retain set after unlearning.",

    "abstract": "Existing benchmarks often highlight the remarkable performance achieved by\nstate-of-the-art Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) in leveraging temporal\ncontext for video understanding. However, how well do the models truly perform\nvisual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this\ncapability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by\nusing a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current\nvisual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding\nmetrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame\nInformation Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO,\nTemporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to\nrigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding.\nTOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning\nsix tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity &\nfrequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805\nself-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world,\nand simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model\nperformance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth\nanalysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs.\nWhile they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to\ninterpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve\nas a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to\nthe community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world\ndynamics through the video modality.",

Here we perform the first simulation of\nthis decoupling process from a magnetically arrested circumbinary accretion\ndisk. In this regime, the central cavity is filled with very strong vertical\nmagnetic flux, regulating accretion onto the binary. Our simulations identify\nthree main stages of this process: (1) Large-scale magnetic flux loss prior to\ndecoupling. (2) Rayleigh-Taylor-driven accretion streams onto the binary during\nand after decoupling, which can power magnetic tower-like outflows, resembling\ndual jets.

We show that code switching between these codes\ncan be accomplished using Steane error correction. For fault-tolerant ancilla\npreparation we utilize the low-depth hypercube encoding circuit along with\ndifferent code automorphism permutations in different ancilla blocks, while\ndecoding is handled by the high-performance classical successive cancellation\nlist decoder. In this way, every logical operation in this universal gate set\nis amenable to extended rectangle analysis. The CNOT exRec has a failure rate\napproaching $10^{-9}$ at $10^{-3}$ circuit-level depolarizing noise.\n  Furthermore, we map the PQRM codes to a 2D layout suitable for implementation\nin arrays of trapped atoms and try to reduce the circuit depth of parallel atom\nmovements in state preparation. The resulting protocol is strictly\nfault-tolerant for the $[[127,1,7]]$ code and practically fault-tolerant for\nthe $[[127,1,15]]$ code.

EMMA maximizes the\nutility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by\nrepresenting all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego\nvehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural\nlanguage text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving\ntasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using\ntask-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by\nachieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well\nas competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also\nyields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo\nOpen Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories,\nobject detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three\ndomains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous\ndriving applications. However, EMMA also exhibits certain limitations: it can\nprocess only a small amount of image frames, does not incorporate accurate 3D\nsensing modalities like LiDAR or radar and is computationally expensive.

However, existing benchmarks often\noverlook critical dimensions like cultural and social awareness. To address\nthese, we introduce CASA, a benchmark designed to assess LLM agents'\nsensitivity to cultural and social norms across two web-based tasks: online\nshopping and social discussion forums. Our approach evaluates LLM agents'\nability to detect and appropriately respond to norm-violating user queries and\nobservations. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that\nmeasures awareness coverage, helpfulness in managing user queries, and the\nviolation rate when facing misleading web content. Experiments show that\ncurrent LLMs perform significantly better in non-agent than in web-based agent\nenvironments, with agents achieving less than 10% awareness coverage and over\n40% violation rates. To improve performance, we explore two methods: prompting\nand fine-tuning, and find that combining both methods can offer complementary\nadvantages -- fine-tuning on culture-specific datasets significantly enhances\nthe agents' ability to generalize across different regions, while prompting\nboosts the agents' ability to navigate complex tasks. These findings highlight\nthe importance of constantly benchmarking LLM agents' cultural and social\nawareness during the development cycle.",

This\nresults in a sequence of policy-dependent system state data with\npolicy-dependent temporal correlations. Following the recent literature on\nperformative prediction [21], we introduce the concept of a performatively\nstable control (PSC) solution. We first propose a sufficient condition for the\nperformative control problem to admit a unique PSC solution with a\nproblem-specific structure of distributional sensitivity propagation and\naggregation. We further analyze the impacts of system stability on the\nexistence of the PSC solution. Specifically, for almost surely strongly stable\npolicy-dependent dynamics, the PSC solution exists if the sum of the\ndistributional sensitivities is small enough. However, for almost surely\nunstable policy-dependent dynamics, the existence of the PSC solution will\nnecessitate a temporally backward decaying of the distributional sensitivities.\nWe finally provide a repeated stochastic gradient descent scheme that converges\nto the PSC solution and analyze its non-asymptotic convergence rate. Numerical\nresults validate our theoretical analysis.",

In practice, raw data are post-processed using\nheavy spatiotemporal binning to create more useful and interpretable images at\nthe cost of degrading spatiotemporal resolution. In this work, we propose\nbit2bit, a new method for reconstructing high-quality image stacks at the\noriginal spatiotemporal resolution from sparse binary quanta image data.\nInspired by recent work on Poisson denoising, we developed an algorithm that\ncreates a dense image sequence from sparse binary photon data by predicting the\nphoton arrival location probability distribution. However, due to the binary\nnature of the data, we show that the assumption of a Poisson distribution is\ninadequate. Instead, we model the process with a Bernoulli lattice process from\nthe truncated Poisson. This leads to the proposal of a novel self-supervised\nsolution based on a masked loss function. We evaluate our method using both\nsimulated and real data. On simulated data from a conventional video, we\nachieve 34.35 mean PSNR with extremely photon-sparse binary input (<0.06\nphotons per pixel per frame).

However,\nthese benchmarks do not capture the complexity and nuance of real-life physical\nprocesses.

We present the first embodied and cognitively meaningful\nevaluation of physical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. Our framework allows\ndirect comparison of LLMs with other embodied agents, such as those based on\nDeep Reinforcement Learning, and human and non-human animals. We employ the\nAnimal-AI (AAI) environment, a simulated 3D virtual laboratory, to study\nphysical common-sense reasoning in LLMs. For this, we use the AAI Testbed, a\nsuite of experiments that replicate laboratory studies with non-human animals,\nto study physical reasoning capabilities including distance estimation,\ntracking out-of-sight objects, and tool use.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for full-waveform seismic source\ninversion using simulation-based inference (SBI). Traditional probabilistic\napproaches often rely on simplifying assumptions about data errors, which we\nshow can lead to inaccurate uncertainty quantification. SBI addresses this\nlimitation by building an empirical probabilistic model of the data errors\nusing machine learning models, known as neural density estimators, which can\nthen be integrated into the Bayesian inference framework. We apply the SBI\nframework to point-source moment tensor inversions as well as joint moment\ntensor and time-location inversions. We construct a range of synthetic examples\nto explore the quality of the SBI solutions, as well as to compare the SBI\nresults with standard Gaussian likelihood-based Bayesian inversions. We then\ndemonstrate that under real seismic noise, common Gaussian likelihood\nassumptions for treating full-waveform data yield overconfident posterior\ndistributions that underestimate the moment tensor component uncertainties by\nup to a factor of 3. We contrast this with SBI, which produces well-calibrated\nposteriors that generally agree with the true seismic source parameters, and\noffers an order-of-magnitude reduction in the number of simulations required to\nperform inference compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques. Finally, we\napply our methodology to a pair of moderate magnitude earthquakes in the North\nAtlantic. We utilise seismic waveforms recorded by the recent UPFLOW ocean\nbottom seismometer array as well as by regional land stations in the Azores,\ncomparing full moment tensor and source-time location posteriors between SBI\nand a Gaussian likelihood approach. We find that our adaptation of SBI can be\ndirectly applied to real earthquake sources to efficiently produce high quality\nposterior distributions that significantly improve upon Gaussian likelihood\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning -- efficiently removing the effect of a small \"forget set\"\nof training data on a pre-trained machine learning model -- has recently\nattracted significant research interest. Despite this interest, however, recent\nwork shows that existing machine unlearning techniques do not hold up to\nthorough evaluation in non-convex settings. In this work, we introduce a new\nmachine unlearning technique that exhibits strong empirical performance even in\nsuch challenging settings. Our starting point is the perspective that the goal\nof unlearning is to produce a model whose outputs are statistically\nindistinguishable from those of a model re-trained on all but the forget set.\nThis perspective naturally suggests a reduction from the unlearning problem to\nthat of data attribution, where the goal is to predict the effect of changing\nthe training set on a model's outputs. Thus motivated, we propose the following\nmeta-algorithm, which we call Datamodel Matching (DMM): given a trained model,\nwe (a) use data attribution to predict the output of the model if it were\nre-trained on all but the forget set points; then (b) fine-tune the pre-trained\nmodel to match these predicted outputs. In a simple convex setting, we show how\nthis approach provably outperforms a variety of iterative unlearning\nalgorithms. Empirically, we use a combination of existing evaluations and a new\nmetric based on the KL-divergence to show that even in non-convex settings, DMM\nachieves strong unlearning performance relative to existing algorithms. An\nadded benefit of DMM is that it is a meta-algorithm, in the sense that future\nadvances in data attribution translate directly into better unlearning\nalgorithms, pointing to a clear direction for future progress in unlearning.",

    "abstract": "Visual content and accompanied audio signals naturally formulate a joint\nrepresentation to improve audio-visual (AV) related applications. While studies\ndevelop various AV representation learning frameworks, the importance of AV\ndata alignment is usually undermined for achieving high-quality representation.\nWe observe that an audio signal may contain background noise interference.\nAlso, non-synchronization may appear between audio and video streams. These\nnon-strict data alignment limits representation quality and downgrade\napplication performance. In this paper, we propose to improve AV joint\nrepresentations from a data-centric perspective by aligning audio signals to\nvisual data. Our alignment is conducted in an agentic workflow controlled by an\nLLM-based assistant named AVAgent. For each input AV data pair, our AVAgent\nuses a multi-modal LLM to convert audio and visual data into language\ndescriptions separately (i.e., tool use). Then, AVAgent reasons whether this\npaired data is aligned well and plans to edit the audio signal if needed (i.e.,\nplanning). The audio editing is executed by predefined actions that filter\nnoise or augment data. Moreover, we use a VLM to evaluate how modified audio\nsignals match the visual content and provide feedback to AVAgent (i.e.,\nreflection). The tool use, planning, and reflection steps operate cyclically to\nbecome an agentic workflow where audio signals are gradually aligned to visual\ncontent. To this end, existing methods can directly leverage the aligned AV\ndata via our agentic workflow to improve AV joint representations. The\nexperimental results comprehensively demonstrate the state-of-the-art\nperformance of the proposed approach against previous baselines in diverse\ndownstream tasks.",

To achieve robust\nalignment with general preferences, we model the alignment problem as a\ntwo-player zero-sum game, where the Nash equilibrium policy guarantees a 50%\nwin rate against any competing policy. However, previous algorithms for finding\nthe Nash policy either diverge or converge to a Nash policy in a modified game,\neven in a simple synthetic setting, thereby failing to maintain the 50% win\nrate guarantee against all other policies. We propose a meta-algorithm,\nConvergent Meta Alignment Algorithm (COMAL), for language model alignment with\ngeneral preferences, inspired by convergent algorithms in game theory.\nTheoretically, we prove that our meta-algorithm converges to an exact Nash\npolicy in the last iterate. Additionally, our meta-algorithm is simple and can\nbe integrated with many existing methods designed for RLHF and preference\noptimization with minimal changes. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework when combined with existing preference\npolicy optimization methods.",

However, previous efforts have primarily focused on designing model\narchitectures to address explicit heterogeneity among datasets such as various\nnumbers of channels, while often overlooking implicit heterogeneity such as\nvarying dependencies between channels. In this work, we introduce the concept\nof partial channel dependence (PCD), which enables a more sophisticated\nadjustment of channel dependencies based on dataset-specific information. To\nachieve PCD, we propose a channel mask that captures the relationships between\nchannels within a dataset using two key components: 1) a correlation matrix\nthat encodes relative dependencies between channels, and 2) domain parameters\nthat learn the absolute dependencies specific to each dataset, refining the\ncorrelation matrix. We validate the effectiveness of PCD across four tasks in\nTS including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection,\nunder diverse settings, including few-shot and zero-shot scenarios with both TS\nfoundation models and single-task models.

While these systems\nencourage self-improvement and the development of healthier habits through\nreal-time feedback, they also create psychological risks such as technostress,\naddiction, and loss of autonomy. The present study also aims to investigate the\npositive and negative psychological consequences of feedback mechanisms on\nusers' behaviour and well-being. Employing a descriptive survey method, the\nstudy collected data from 200 purposely selected users to assess changes in\nbehaviour, motivation, and mental well-being related to health, social, and\nlifestyle applications. Results indicate that while feedback mechanisms\nfacilitate goal attainment and social interconnection through streaks and\nbadges, among other components, they also enhance anxiety, mental weariness,\nand loss of productivity due to actions that are considered feedback-seeking.\nFurthermore, test subjects reported that their actions are unconsciously shaped\nby app feedback, often at the expense of personal autonomy, while real-time\nfeedback minimally influences professional or social interactions. The study\nshows that data-driven feedback loops deliver not only motivational benefits\nbut also psychological challenges. To mitigate these risks, users should\nestablish boundaries regarding their use of technology to prevent burnout and\naddiction, while developers need to refine feedback mechanisms to reduce\ncognitive load and foster more inclusive participation. Future research should\nfocus on designing feedback mechanisms that promote well-being without\ncompromising individual freedom or increasing social comparison.",

The emergent hydrodynamics\ndepends then on the charges conserved by the perturbation. We focus on\nnearly-integrable Galilean-invariant systems with conserved particle number,\nmomentum and energy. Basing on the Boltzmann approach to integrability-breaking\nwe describe dynamics of the system with GHD equation supplemented with a\ncollision term. The limit of large space-time-scales is addressed using\nChapman-Enskog expansion adapted to the GHD equation. For length scales larger\nthan $\\sim \\lambda^{-2}$, where $\\lambda$ is integrability-breaking parameter,\nwe recover Navier-Stokes equations and find transport coefficients: viscosity\nand thermal conductivity. At even larger length scales, this description\ncrosses over to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, characteristic to\ngeneric non-integrable one-dimensional fluids. Employing nonlinear fluctuating\nhydrodynamics we estimate this crossover length scale as $ \\sim \\lambda^{-4}$.",

    "abstract": "While large models trained with self-supervised learning on offline datasets\nhave shown remarkable capabilities in text and image domains, achieving the\nsame generalisation for agents that act in sequential decision problems remains\nan open challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by\nprocedurally generating tens of millions of 2D physics-based tasks and using\nthese to train a general reinforcement learning (RL) agent for physical\ncontrol. To this end, we introduce Kinetix: an open-ended space of\nphysics-based RL environments that can represent tasks ranging from robotic\nlocomotion and grasping to video games and classic RL environments, all within\na unified framework. Kinetix makes use of our novel hardware-accelerated\nphysics engine Jax2D that allows us to cheaply simulate billions of environment\nsteps during training. Our trained agent exhibits strong physical reasoning\ncapabilities in 2D space, being able to zero-shot solve unseen human-designed\nenvironments. Furthermore, fine-tuning this general agent on tasks of interest\nshows significantly stronger performance than training an RL agent *tabula\nrasa*. This includes solving some environments that standard RL training\ncompletely fails at. We believe this demonstrates the feasibility of large\nscale, mixed-quality pre-training for online RL and we hope that Kinetix will\nserve as a useful framework to investigate this further.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can be used on top of a wide\nvariety of self-supervised (SSL) approaches to take advantage of hierarchical\nstructures that emerge during training. SSL approaches typically work through\nsome invariance term to ensure consistency between similar samples and a\nregularization term to prevent global dimensional collapse. Dimensional\ncollapse refers to data representations spanning a lower-dimensional subspace.\nRecent work has demonstrated that the representation space of these algorithms\ngradually reflects a semantic hierarchical structure as training progresses.\nData samples of the same hierarchical grouping tend to exhibit greater\ndimensional collapse locally compared to the dataset as a whole due to sharing\nfeatures in common with each other. Ideally, SSL algorithms would take\nadvantage of this hierarchical emergence to have an additional regularization\nterm to account for this local dimensional collapse effect. However, the\nconstruction of existing SSL algorithms does not account for this property. To\naddress this, we propose an adaptive algorithm that performs a weighted\ndecomposition of the denominator of the InfoNCE loss into two terms: local\nhierarchical and global collapse regularization respectively. This\ndecomposition is based on an adaptive threshold that gradually lowers to\nreflect the emerging hierarchical structure of the representation space\nthroughout training. It is based on an analysis of the cosine similarity\ndistribution of samples in a batch. We demonstrate that this hierarchical\nemergence exploitation (HEX) approach can be integrated across a wide variety\nof SSL algorithms. Empirically, we show performance improvements of up to 5.6%\nrelative improvement over baseline SSL approaches on classification accuracy on\nImagenet with 100 epochs of training.",

We collected the long-term data\nfrom Jan 2019 to August 2024 when the source was in a long flaring episode. We\nused the Bayesian block methodology to identify the various flux states,\nincluding three flares. The broadband fractional variability is estimated\nduring two flaring states. The Fvar variation with respect to frequency shows a\nnearly double hump structure similar to broadband SED. The Power spectral\ndensity (PSD) shows a pink-noise kind of stochastic variability in the light\ncurve and we do not see any break in the power spectrum, suggesting a much\nlonger characteristic time scale is involved in gamma-ray variability. The flux\ndistribution is well-fitted with a double log-normal flux distribution,\nsuggesting the variability of non-linear in nature. The gamma-ray, optical, and\nX-ray emissions were found to be highly correlated with a zero time lag,\nsuggesting a co-spatial origin of their emissions. We used the one-zone\nleptonic model to reproduce the broad-band spectrum in the energy range from IR\nto very high-energy gamma-ray. The increase in the magnetic field and the\nDoppler factor were found to be the main cause for high flux states. The\nXMM-Newton spectra taken during one of the flaring durations exhibit a\nsignature of thermal black body emission from the accretion disk, suggesting a\npossible disk-jet coupling. This has also been indicated by the gamma-ray flux\ndistribution, which shows the distribution as non-linear in nature, which is\nmostly seen in galactic X-ray binaries or AGN where the accretion disk\ndominates the emission.",

This consists of (1) electrically\nstimulating the nerves that innervate the targeted fingers using our wristband\ndevice and (2) concurrently, visually augmenting the targeted finger in MR to\nsteer the perceived sensation to the desired location. In our psychophysics\nstudy, we found that our approach provides tactile perception akin to tapping\nand, even from the wrist, it is capable of delivering the sensation to the\ntargeted fingers with about 50% of sensation occurring in the thumb and about\n40% of sensation occurring in the index finger. These results on localizability\nare unprecedented compared to electro-tactile feedback alone or any prior work\nfor creating sensations in the hand with devices worn on the wrist/arm.\nMoreover, unlike conventional electro-tactile techniques, our wristband\ndispenses with gel electrodes. Instead, it incorporates custom-made\nelastomer-based dry electrodes and a stimulation waveform designed for the\nelectrodes, ensuring the practicality of the device beyond laboratory settings.\nLastly, we evaluated the haptic realism of our approach in mixed reality and\nelicited qualitative feedback from users. Participants preferred our approach\nto a baseline vibrotactile wrist-worn device.",

In addition to ions and electrons, it has been proposed that\ninterstellar dust grains could also be accelerated through diffusive shock\nacceleration, for instance, at supernova remnants (SNRs). Considering\ninterstellar dust grains of various size and composition, we investigate the\npossibility of grain acceleration at young SNR shocks (throughout the free\nexpansion and Sedov-Taylor phases) and the maximum energies reached by the\naccelerated grains. We investigate the potential implications on the abundance\nof refractory species relative to volatile elements in the cosmic-ray\ncomposition. We rely on semi-analytical descriptions of particle acceleration\nat strong shocks, and on self-similar solutions for the dynamics of SNR shock\nwaves. For simplicity, type Ia thermonuclear SNRs expanding in uniform\ninterstellar medium are considered. We find that the acceleration of dust\ngrains at relativistic speed is possible, up to Lorentz factor of $\\sim\n10^{2}$, kinetic energy $E_{\\rm k}/\\text{nuc}\\sim 10^2$ GeV/nuc for the smaller\ngrains of size $a\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-7}$ cm. We find that the subsequent\nsputtering of grains can produce nuclei with a rigidity sufficient to be\ninjected in the process of diffusive shock acceleration.

Previous research has focused on analyzing the\nso-called coherent structures of the flow (Q events, streaks, and vortices),\nwhich are regions of high turbulence transport, high/low streamwise\nfluctuation, and rotation, respectively.

A deep-learning model\nis trained to predict a future state of a turbulent channel flow and the\ngradient-SHAP explainability algorithm is used to calculate the importance of\neach grid point for such a prediction. Finally, high-importance regions are\ncomputed using the SHAP data, analyzing and comparing their characteristics\nwith those of the other coherent structures.

We find evidence for three\nconclusions. First, equivariance improves data efficiency, but training\nnon-equivariant models with data augmentation can close this gap given\nsufficient epochs. Second, scaling with compute follows a power law, with\nequivariant models outperforming non-equivariant ones at each tested compute\nbudget. Finally, the optimal allocation of a compute budget onto model size and\ntraining duration differs between equivariant and non-equivariant models.",

To overcome this problem,\nwe introduce TokenFormer, a natively scalable architecture that leverages the\nattention mechanism not only for computations among input tokens but also for\ninteractions between tokens and model parameters, thereby enhancing\narchitectural flexibility. By treating model parameters as tokens, we replace\nall the linear projections in Transformers with our token-parameter attention\nlayer, where input tokens act as queries and model parameters as keys and\nvalues. This reformulation allows for progressive and efficient scaling without\nnecessitating retraining from scratch. Our model scales from 124M to 1.4B\nparameters by incrementally adding new key-value parameter pairs, achieving\nperformance comparable to Transformers trained from scratch while greatly\nreducing training costs.

As a first corollary, we\ndeduce that every hyperbolic motion of the $N$-body problem must become, after\nsome time, a calibrating curve for the Busemann function associated to its\nlimit shape. This implies that every hyperbolic motionof the $N$-body problem\nis eventually a minimizer, that is, it must contain a geodesic ray of the\nJacobi-Maupertuis metric.

Although transition edge sensors\nrepresent the state-of-the-art in PNR performance, superconducting nanowire\nsingle-photon detectors (SNSPDs) offer superior efficiency, speed, noise\nreduction, and timing precision. Directly inferring photon numbers, however,\nhas only recently become feasible due to advances in readout technology.\nDespite this, photon-number discrimination remains constrained by the\nnanowire's electrical properties and readout jitter. In this work, we employ\nwaveguide-integrated SNSPDs and time-resolved measurements to explore how the\nnanowire kinetic inductance and system jitter affect PNR capabilities. By\nanalyzing the latency time of the photon detection, we can resolve changes in\nthe rising edge of the detection pulse. We find that lower jitter as well as\nincreased kinetic inductance enhances the pulse separation for different photon\nnumbers and improves the PNR capability. Enhancing the kinetic inductance from\n165 nH to 872 nH improves PNR quality by 12%, 31% and 23% over the first three\nphoton numbers, though at the cost of reducing the detector's count rate from\n165 Mcps to 19 Mcps.

Validating such models commonly\nutilizes in situ solar wind measurements made near the orbit of the Earth. The\npurpose of this study is to test the performance of G3DMHD (a data driven,\ntime-dependent, 3-D MHD model of the solar wind) with Parker Solar Probe (PSP)\nmeasurements. Since its launch in August 2018, PSP has traversed the inner\nheliosphere at different radial distances sunward of the Earth (the closest\napproach ~13.3 solar radii), thus providing a good opportunity to study\nevolution of the solar wind and to validate heliospheric models of the solar\nwind. The G3DMHD model simulation is driven by a sequence of maps of\nphotospheric field extrapolated to the assumed source surface (2.5 Rs) using\nthe potential field model from 2018 to 2022, which covers the first 15 PSP\norbits. The Pearson correlation coefficient (cc) and the mean absolute squared\nerror (MASE) are used as the metrics to evaluate the model performance. It is\nfound that the model performs better for both magnetic intensity (cc = 0.75;\nMASE = 0.60) and the solar wind density (cc = 0.73; MASE = 0.50) than for the\nsolar wind speed (cc = 0.15; MASE = 1.29) and temperature (cc = 0.28; MASE =\n1.14). This is due primarily to lack of accurate boundary conditions. The\nwell-known underestimate of the magnetic field in solar minimum years is also\npresent. Assuming that the radial magnetic field becomes uniformly distributed\nwith latitude at or below 18 Rs (the inner boundary of the computation\ndo-main), the agreement in the magnetic intensity significantly improves (cc =\n0.83; MASE = 0.49).",

    "abstract": "One way in which we can attempt to relate chemical pathways to geochemical\nenvironments is by studying the kinetics of a given sequence of reactions and\nidentifying the conditions under which this chemistry is the most productive.\nMany prebiotic reactions rely on a source of fixed carbon, therefore chemical\npathways that suggest prebiotically plausible ways of fixing carbon are of\nsignificant interest. One such pathway is the carboxysulfitic reaction network\nwhich uses solvated electrons, produced as a result of electron photodetachment\nfrom sulfite, to reduce carbon. In this work we explore carboxysulfitic\nchemistry at three different pH values: 6, 9, and 12. We utilise a new light\nsource, that matches the broadband spectral shape of the young Sun, to\nirradiate a mixture of bicarbonate and sulfite. We determine the rate equation\nfor the production of formate from these compounds and find the order to be\n0.71 $\\pm$ 0.12 with respect to bicarbonate and -0.60 $\\pm$ 0.10 with respect\nto sulfite. Following this, we determine rate constants for the production of\nformate considering two different mechanisms. We find this chemistry to be\nfeasible at all three of the pH values tested, with the magnitude of the rate\nconstants being highly dependent on the assumed mechanism. We suggest that\nthese results may have implications for Mars Sample Return owing to Jezero\nCrater having had lakes similar to those in which we propose carboxysulfitic\nchemistry to have been the most productive. Due to Mars' relatively unaltered\nsurface, we propose that Mars Sample Return missions could look for preserved\ntracers of this chemistry, shedding light on Mars' past conditions and its\npotential for having hosted life.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks and common\ncorruptions, which undermine their robustness. In order to enhance model\nresilience against such challenges, Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a\nprominent solution. Nevertheless, adversarial robustness is often attained at\nthe expense of model fairness during AT, i.e., disparity in class-wise\nrobustness of the model. While distinctive classes become more robust towards\nsuch adversaries, hard to detect classes suffer. Recently, research has focused\non improving model fairness specifically for perturbed images, overlooking the\naccuracy of the most likely non-perturbed data. Additionally, despite their\nrobustness against the adversaries encountered during model training,\nstate-of-the-art adversarial trained models have difficulty maintaining\nrobustness and fairness when confronted with diverse adversarial threats or\ncommon corruptions. In this work, we address the above concerns by introducing\na novel approach called Fair Targeted Adversarial Training (FAIR-TAT). We show\nthat using targeted adversarial attacks for adversarial training (instead of\nuntargeted attacks) can allow for more favorable trade-offs with respect to\nadversarial fairness.

    "abstract": "Photometric galaxy surveys, despite their limited resolution along the line\nof sight, encode rich information about the large-scale structure (LSS) of the\nUniverse thanks to the high number density and extensive depth of the data.\nHowever, the complicated selection effects in wide and deep surveys can\npotentially cause significant bias in the angular two-point correlation\nfunction (2PCF) measured from those surveys. In this paper, we measure the 2PCF\nfrom the newly published KiDS-Legacy sample. Given an $r$-band $5\\sigma$\nmagnitude limit of $24.8$ and survey footprint of $1347$ deg$^2$, it achieves\nan excellent combination of sky coverage and depth for such a measurement. We\nfind that complex selection effects, primarily induced by varying seeing,\nintroduce over-estimation of the 2PCF by approximately an order of magnitude.\nTo correct for such effects, we apply a machine learning-based method to\nrecover an organised random (OR) that presents the same selection pattern as\nthe galaxy sample. The basic idea is to find the selection-induced clustering\nof galaxies using a combination of self-organising maps (SOMs) and hierarchical\nclustering (HC). This unsupervised machine learning method is able to recover\ncomplicated selection effects without specifying their functional forms. We\nvalidate this SOM+HC method on mock deep galaxy samples with realistic\nsystematics and selections derived from the KiDS-Legacy catalogue. Using mock\ndata, we demonstrate that the OR delivers unbiased 2PCF cosmological parameter\nconstraints, removing the $27\\sigma$ offset in the galaxy bias parameter that\nis recovered when adopting uniform randoms. Blinded measurements on the real\nKiDS-Legacy data show that the corrected 2PCF is robust to the SOM+HC\nconfiguration near the optimal set-up suggested by the mock tests.",

    "abstract": "We study a flaring activity of the HSP Mrk421 that was characterized from\nradio to very-high-energy (VHE; E $>0.1$TeV) gamma rays with MAGIC, Fermi-LAT,\nSwift, XMM-Newton and several optical and radio telescopes. These observations\nincluded, for the first time for a gamma-ray flare of a blazar, simultaneous\nX-ray polarization measurements with IXPE. We find substantial variability in\nboth X-rays and VHE gamma rays throughout the campaign, with the highest VHE\nflux above 0.2 TeV occurring during the IXPE observing window, and exceeding\ntwice the flux of the Crab Nebula. However, the VHE and X-ray spectra are on\naverage softer, and the correlation between these two bands weaker that those\nreported in previous flares of Mrk421. IXPE reveals an X-ray polarization\ndegree significantly higher than that at radio and optical frequencies. The\nX-ray polarization angle varies by $\\sim$100$^\\circ$ on timescales of days, and\nthe polarization degree changes by more than a factor 4. The highest X-ray\npolarization degree reaches 26%, around which a X-ray counter-clockwise\nhysteresis loop is measured with XMM-Newton. It suggests that the X-ray\nemission comes from particles close to the high-energy cutoff, hence possibly\nprobing an extreme case of the Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone model. We model the\nbroadband emission with a simplified stratified jet model throughout the flare.\nThe polarization measurements imply an electron distribution in the X-ray\nemitting region with a very high minimum Lorentz factor, which is expected in\nelectron-ion plasma, as well as a variation of the emitting region size up to a\nfactor of three during the flaring activity. We find no correlation between the\nfluxes and the evolution of the model parameters, which indicates a stochastic\nnature of the underlying physical mechanism. Such behaviour would be expected\nin a highly turbulent electron-ion plasma crossing a shock front.",

    "abstract": "Sea ice plays a crucial role in the climate system, particularly in the\nMarginal Ice Zone (MIZ), a transitional area consisting of fragmented ice\nbetween the open ocean and consolidated pack ice. As the MIZ expands,\nunderstanding its dynamics becomes essential for predicting climate change\nimpacts. However, the role of clouds in these processes has been largely\noverlooked. This paper addresses that gap by developing an idealized coupled\natmosphere-ocean-ice model incorporating cloud and precipitation effects,\ntackling both forward (simulation) and inverse (data assimilation) problems.\nSea ice dynamics are modeled using the discrete element method, which simulates\nfloes driven by atmospheric and oceanic forces. The ocean is represented by a\ntwo-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, capturing mesoscale eddies and\nice-ocean drag. The atmosphere is modeled using a two-layer saturated\nprecipitating QG system, accounting for variable evaporation over sea surfaces\nand ice. Cloud cover affects radiation, influencing ice melting. The idealized\ncoupled modeling framework allows us to study the interactions between\natmosphere, ocean, and sea ice floes. Specifically, it focuses on how clouds\nand precipitation affect energy balance, melting, and freezing processes. It\nalso serves as a testbed for data assimilation, which allows the recovery of\nunobserved floe trajectories and ocean fields in cloud-induced uncertainties.\nNumerical results show that appropriate reduced-order models help improve data\nassimilation efficiency with partial observations, allowing the skillful\ninference of missing floe trajectories and lower atmospheric winds. These\nresults imply the potential of integrating idealized models with data\nassimilation to improve our understanding of Arctic dynamics and predictions.",

Such bias manifests itself in the\nabsence of concepts specific to the language or culture at hand, the presence\nof foreign (Anglo-Saxon) concepts, as well as in the lack of an explicit\nindication of untranslatability, also known as cross-lingual \\emph{lexical\ngaps}, when a term has no equivalent in another language. This paper proposes a\nnovel crowdsourcing methodology for reducing bias in LSRs. Crowd workers\ncompare lexemes from two languages, focusing on domains rich in lexical\ndiversity, such as kinship or food. Our LingoGap crowdsourcing tool facilitates\ncomparisons through microtasks identifying equivalent terms, language-specific\nterms, and lexical gaps across languages. We validated our method by applying\nit to two case studies focused on food-related terminology: (1) English and\nArabic, and (2) Standard Indonesian and Banjarese. These experiments identified\n2,140 lexical gaps in the first case study and 951 in the second.

    "abstract": "In federated learning, it is common to assume that clients are always\navailable to participate in training, which may not be feasible with user\ndevices in practice. Recent works analyze federated learning under more\nrealistic participation patterns, such as cyclic client availability or\narbitrary participation. However, all such works either require strong\nassumptions (e.g., all clients participate almost surely within a bounded\nwindow), do not achieve linear speedup and reduced communication rounds, or are\nnot applicable in the general non-convex setting. In this work, we focus on\nnonconvex optimization and consider participation patterns in which the chance\nof participation over a fixed window of rounds is equal among all clients,\nwhich includes cyclic client availability as a special case. Under this\nsetting, we propose a new algorithm, named Amplified SCAFFOLD, and prove that\nit achieves linear speedup, reduced communication, and resilience to data\nheterogeneity simultaneously. In particular, for cyclic participation, our\nalgorithm is proved to enjoy $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ communication rounds\nto find an $\\epsilon$-stationary point in the non-convex stochastic setting. In\ncontrast, the prior work under the same setting requires $\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa^2\n\\epsilon^{-4})$ communication rounds, where $\\kappa$ denotes the data\nheterogeneity. Therefore, our algorithm significantly reduces communication\nrounds due to better dependency in terms of $\\epsilon$ and $\\kappa$. Our\nanalysis relies on a fine-grained treatment of the nested dependence between\nclient participation and errors in the control variates, which results in\ntighter guarantees than previous work. We also provide experimental results\nwith (1) synthetic data and (2) real-world data with a large number of clients\n$(N = 250)$, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm under periodic\nclient participation.",

Under this framework, we prove that: 1) coarse-grained\npretraining only allows a neural network to learn the common features well,\nwhile 2) fine-grained pretraining helps the network learn the rare features in\naddition to the common ones, leading to improved accuracy on hard downstream\ntest samples.",

Climate change drives\nshifts in these phenological events, impacting ecosystems and the climate\nitself. Accurate phenology models are essential to predict the occurrence of\nthese phases under changing climatic conditions. Existing methods include\nhypothesis-driven process models and data-driven statistical approaches.\nProcess models account for dormancy stages and various phenology drivers, while\nstatistical models typically rely on linear or traditional machine learning\ntechniques. Research shows that process models often outperform statistical\nmethods when predicting under climate conditions outside historical ranges,\nespecially with climate change scenarios. However, deep learning approaches\nremain underexplored in climate phenology modeling. We introduce PhenoFormer, a\nneural architecture better suited than traditional statistical methods at\npredicting phenology under shift in climate data distribution, while also\nbringing significant improvements or performing on par to the best performing\nprocess-based models. Our numerical experiments on a 70-year dataset of 70,000\nphenological observations from 9 woody species in Switzerland show that\nPhenoFormer outperforms traditional machine learning methods by an average of\n13% R2 and 1.1 days RMSE for spring phenology, and 11% R2 and 0.7 days RMSE for\nautumn phenology, while matching or exceeding the best process-based models.\nOur results demonstrate that deep learning has the potential to be a valuable\nmethodological tool for accurate climate-phenology prediction, and our\nPhenoFormer is a first promising step in improving phenological predictions\nbefore a complete understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms is\navailable.",

Individual-based models (IBMs)\naccurately describe nonlinear interactions at the organism level and the\nstochastic spatial dynamics that drives pattern formation, but their\ncomputational cost scales quickly with system complexity, limiting their\npractical use. Population-level approximations such as spatial moment dynamics\n(SMD) -- which describe the moments of organism distributions -- and\ncoarse-grained biomass density models have been developed to address this\nlimitation. However, the extent to which these approximated descriptions\naccurately capture the spatial patterns and population sizes emerging from\nindividual-level simulations remains an open question.

This\ncontrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms\nbehind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly\nhigh and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be\ndue to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically\ninvestigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in\nreasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark\nbased on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We find that LLMs could interpolate\nand memorize the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after\nfine-tuning, yet they struggle with slight variations of these puzzles. On the\nother hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also\nconsistently improves generalization performance. Through in-depth analyses\nwith perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model\ninternals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers, we establish that LLMs develop\nreasoning skills on K&K puzzles alongside memorization. Finally, our analysis\nbased on a per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between\nreasoning and memorization when solving logical puzzles.

To remedy that, we design a unified\nframework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs\nsimultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations\nvia (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making\nit easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our\nframework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination\nEvaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation\nhallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we\nobserve that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object\nhallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem\ntowards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple\ntraining-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our\ndataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly\nat https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\nvarious domains, particularly in task generalization for both text and vision\ndata. While fine-tuning these models can significantly enhance their\nperformance on specific downstream tasks, it often requires high-quality data\nthat cannot be shared due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a\npromising solution for collaborative training without direct data sharing.\nHowever, many parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for LLMs in FL,\nparticularly those based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), face limitations. In\nthis paper, we critically analyze the convergence and performance guarantees of\npopular FL frameworks utilizing LoRA, highlighting its suboptimal nature due to\nconstrained subspace learning of low-rank matrices. This limitation hinders\neffective fine-tuning of LLMs in federated settings. Through rigorous\nanalytical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that direct weight\naveraging outperforms LoRA-based strategies, leading to superior performance\nfor fine-tuned models. Our comprehensive comparison unmasks inefficiencies in\nLoRA approaches and underscores the advantages of direct weight aggregation. We\nextend our analysis to low-rank gradient-based optimizers, such as GaLore, used\nduring local training steps. Our findings show that GaLore along with\ndirect-weight aggregation is a more effective approach, outperforming federated\nLoRA methods like FlexLoRA and FFA-LoRA across both text and image modalities.\nWhile privacy remains paramount in FL discourse, our focus is on assessing\nperformance outcomes of federated fine-tuned models and evaluating various FL\nframeworks from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Our findings\nadvocate reassessing the reliance on LoRA within FL contexts, paving the way\nfor more efficient training methodologies.",

Representational Similarity Matrices (RSMs)\ndistill this similarity into scalar values for each input pair.

Photonic time crystals are\nspatially homogeneous media in which the refractive index changes periodically\nin time, leading to the formation of bands in the wave number domain. By\nanalogy to Anderson localization in space, one might expect that the presence\nof temporal disorder in photonic time crystals would lead to Anderson\nlocalization in the time domain. Here, we show that indeed periodic modulations\nof the refractive index with the addition of temporal disorder lead to Anderson\nlocalization in time, where an electromagnetic field can emerge from the\ntemporally modulated medium at a certain moment in time and then decay\nexponentially over time. Thus, we are dealing with a situation where, in a\nfluctuating three-dimensional medium, the birth and death of waves can occur,\nand the mechanism of this phenomenon corresponds to Anderson localization.",

As\na result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted,\nthereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes.\nDespite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting\nmolecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is\nseverely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols.

It includes new evaluation metrics and a\ngeneralization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS\nannotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine\nlearning community.

In recent years, deep-learning-based point cloud\nenhancement methods, which aim to achieve dense, clean, and complete point\nclouds from low-quality raw point clouds using deep neural networks, are\ngaining tremendous research attention. This paper, for the first time to our\nknowledge, presents a comprehensive survey for deep-learning-based point cloud\nenhancement methods. It covers three main perspectives for point cloud\nenhancement, i.e., (1) denoising to achieve clean data; (2) completion to\nrecover unseen data; (3) upsampling to obtain dense data. Our survey presents a\nnew taxonomy for recent state-of-the-art methods and systematic experimental\nresults on standard benchmarks.

Firstly, we construct a multi-branch\nactivity recognition framework that not only separates different object\ncategories but also the tasks of single object and object group recognition,\nthereby enhancing recognition accuracy. Subsequently, we develop various model\nensembling strategies, including integrations of multiple frame sampling\nsequences, different frame sampling sequence lengths, multiple training epochs,\nand different backbone networks.

    "abstract": "Investment Analysis is a cornerstone of the Financial Services industry. The\nrapid integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), offers opportunities to enhance the equity rating\nprocess. This paper explores the application of LLMs to generate multi-horizon\nstock ratings by ingesting diverse datasets. Traditional stock rating methods\nrely heavily on the expertise of financial analysts, and face several\nchallenges such as data overload, inconsistencies in filings, and delayed\nreactions to market events. Our study addresses these issues by leveraging LLMs\nto improve the accuracy and consistency of stock ratings. Additionally, we\nassess the efficacy of using different data modalities with LLMs for the\nfinancial domain.\n  We utilize varied datasets comprising fundamental financial, market, and news\ndata from January 2022 to June 2024, along with GPT-4-32k (v0613) (with a\ntraining cutoff in Sep. 2021 to prevent information leakage). Our results show\nthat our benchmark method outperforms traditional stock rating methods when\nassessed by forward returns, specially when incorporating financial\nfundamentals. While integrating news data improves short-term performance,\nsubstituting detailed news summaries with sentiment scores reduces token use\nwithout loss of performance. In many cases, omitting news data entirely\nenhances performance by reducing bias.\n  Our research shows that LLMs can be leveraged to effectively utilize large\namounts of multimodal financial data, as showcased by their effectiveness at\nthe stock rating prediction task. Our work provides a reproducible and\nefficient framework for generating accurate stock ratings, serving as a\ncost-effective alternative to traditional methods. Future work will extend to\nlonger timeframes, incorporate diverse data, and utilize newer models for\nenhanced insights.",

    "abstract": "The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have activated the\ncapabilitiesof Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving visual-language tasks by\nintegratingvisual information. The prevailing approach in existing MLLMs\ninvolvesemploying an image encoder to extract visual features, converting\nthesefeatures into visual tokens via an adapter, and then integrating them with\ntheprompt into the LLM. However, because the process of image encoding\nisprompt-agnostic, the extracted visual features only provide a\ncoarsedescription of the image, impossible to focus on the requirements of\ntheprompt. On one hand, it is easy for image features to lack information\naboutthe prompt-specified objects, resulting in unsatisfactory responses. On\ntheother hand, the visual features contain a large amount of\nirrelevantinformation, which not only increases the burden on memory but also\nworsens thegeneration effectiveness. To address the aforementioned issues, we\npropose\\textbf{PIP-MM}, a framework that\n\\textbf{P}re-\\textbf{I}ntegrates\\textbf{P}rompt information into the visual\nencoding process using existingmodules of MLLMs. Specifically, We utilize the\nfrozen LLM in the MLLM tovectorize the input prompt, which summarizes the\nrequirements of the prompt.Then, we input the prompt vector into our trained\nMulti-Layer Perceptron (MLP)to align with the visual input requirements, and\nsubsequently replace the classembedding in the image encoder. Since our model\nonly requires adding atrainable MLP, it can be applied to any MLLM. To validate\nthe effectiveness ofPIP-MM, we conducted experiments on multiple benchmarks.\nAutomated evaluationmetrics and manual assessments demonstrate the strong\nperformance of PIP-MM.Particularly noteworthy is that our model maintains\nexcellent generationresults even when half of the visual tokens are reduced.",

In particular, if an\nalgorithm uses $O(n/\\log^c k)$ samples for some constant $c>0$ and polynomial\nspace, then the query time of the data structure must be at least\n$k^{1-O(1)/\\log \\log k}$, i.e., close to linear in the number of distributions\n$k$. This is a novel \\emph{statistical-computational} trade-off for density\nestimation, demonstrating that any data structure must use close to a linear\nnumber of samples or take close to linear query time. The lower bound holds\neven in the realizable case where $q=p_i$ for some $i$, and when the\ndistributions are flat (specifically, all distributions are uniform over half\nof the domain $[n]$).

EigenCAM is the only notable label-independent\nalternative, leveraging Singular Value Decomposition to generate saliency maps\napplicable across CNN models, but it does not fully exploit the tensorial\nstructure of feature maps. In this work, we introduce the Tucker Saliency Map\n(TSM) method, which applies Tucker tensor decomposition to better capture the\ninherent structure of feature maps, producing more accurate singular vectors\nand values. These are used to generate high-fidelity saliency maps, effectively\nhighlighting objects of interest in the input.

Quantitative evaluations on supervised\nclassification models demonstrate that TSM, Multivec-EigenCAM, and MTSM achieve\ncompetitive performance with label-dependent methods.

    "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between close-in small planets (CS) and\ndistant giants (DG) is central to understanding the formation of planetary\nsystems like our own. Most studies of this connection have found evidence for a\npositive correlation, though significant statistical and systematic\nuncertainties remain due to differences in sample size, target selection bias,\nand even the definitions of `close-in small' and `distant giant' planets.\nRecently, Bryan & Lee (2024) conducted a study of 184 stars hosting\nsuper-Earths ($M \\sin i = 1-20 \\, M_{E}$ or $R = 1-4 \\, R_{E}$) to determine\nthe effect of stellar metallicity on the prevalence of distant giant companions\n($M \\sin i = 0.5-20 \\, M_{Jup}$, $a = 1-10$ AU). They found that such giants\nare twice as common in the presence of inner planets, but \\textit{only} in\nmetal-rich systems: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]>0) = $28^{+4.9}_{-4.6}\\%$ vs.\nP(DG|[Fe/H]>0) = $14.3 ^{+2.0}_{-1.8}\\%$. Further, they found that this\ncorrelation disappears for metal-poor stars: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]$\\leq$0) =\n$4.5^{+2.6}_{-1.9}\\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]$\\leq$0) = $5.0^{+1.6}_{-1.3}\\%$. We\nconducted an analogous study to test whether this effect was present in the\nCalifornia Legacy Survey sample. Using the same planet definitions, we did not\nfind evidence for an enhancement in metal-rich systems: P(DG|CS, [Fe/H]>0) =\n$14^{+12}_{-8}\\%$ vs. P(DG|[Fe/H]>0) = $16.4^{+2.5}_{-2.4}\\%$. We also found a\n$2\\sigma$ tension between our conditional rate and a 2x enhancement. The\ndiscrepancy between our findings and theirs may arise from a variety of\nsources, underscoring the need for large exoplanet surveys to overcome both\nsmall number statistics and sample inhomogeneities.",

Specifically, we examine the case where the customary\nassumption of a strictly positive effective dark energy (DE) density -- natural\nin general relativity -- may not apply, offering new possibilities. Focusing on\nthe exponential infrared model $f(T)=Te^{\\beta T_0/T}$, where $T$ is the\ntorsion scalar, we investigate cosmological solutions characterized by the\nconstant $\\beta$, which is controlled by the present-day matter density\nparameter $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}$. Ensuring consistency with CMB data, we find that\nthe widely studied $\\beta_{+}$ (positive exponent) case exhibits phantom\nbehavior, while the previously overlooked $\\beta_{-}$ (negative exponent) case\n-- sufficient to avoid instabilities or ghosts -- features a sign-changing DE\ndensity that transitions smoothly from negative to positive values at redshift\n$z_{\\dagger} \\sim 1.5$, consistent with recent approaches to alleviating\ncosmological tensions. Though the sign-changing DE density in the $f(T)$ model\nleads to a larger-than-expected enhancement, we further extend the analysis by\nincorporating a cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$. This extension, $f(T)\n\\rightarrow f(T) + 2\\Lambda$, broadens the solution space consistent with the\nSH0ES $H_0$ measurement while maintaining consistency with CMB power spectra.\nAdditionally, it introduces richer phenomenological possibilities, including\nthe potential moderation or cessation of cosmic acceleration at very low\nredshifts, aligning with recent observational analyses, such as those from DESI\nBAO data. Our findings also suggest that existing $f(T)$ cosmological models\nshould be revisited in light of the novel theoretical insights presented here.",

A recent experiment in\nsuperconducting circuits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 197701, (2021)] provided first\nevidence for direct dynamical signatures of instantons (phase slips),\nmanifested by order-unity inelastic decay probabilities for photons with which\nthey interact, motivating the development of a scattering theory of instantons\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 137701, (2021)]. While this framework successfully\npredicted the measured inelastic decay rates of the photons for several\nexperimental devices, it is valid only if the tunneling time of the instantons\nis much shorter than the relaxation time due to the environment in which they\nare embedded, and requires a closed analytical expression for the instanton\ntrajectory. Here, we alleviate these restrictions by incorporating numerical\nmethods that eliminate some of the previously applied approximations. Our\nresults improve the agreement with the experimental measurements, also for\ndevices with lower impedances and thus shorter relaxation times, without\nfitting parameters.

    "abstract": "When solving inverse problems, one has to deal with numerous potential\nsources of model inexactnesses, like object motion, calibration errors, or\nsimplified data models. Regularized Sequential Subspace Optimization (ReSeSOp)\nallows to compensate for such inaccuracies within the reconstruction step by\nemploying consecutive projections onto suitably defined subspaces. However,\nthis approach relies on a priori estimates for the model inexactness levels\nwhich are typically unknown. In dynamic imaging applications, where\ninaccuracies arise from the unpredictable dynamics of the object, these\nestimates are particularly challenging to determine in advance. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a learned version of ReSeSOp which allows to\napproximate inexactness levels on the fly. The proposed framework generalizes\nestablished unrolled iterative reconstruction schemes to inexact forward\noperators and is particularly tailored to the structure of dynamic problems. We\nalso present a comprehensive mathematical analysis regarding the effect of\ndependencies within the forward problem, clarifying when and why dividing the\noverall problem into subproblems is essential.

Many studies simply\nassert the NP-hardness of the general problem without investigating whether the\nspecific cases they address inherit this computational complexity.\n  In this paper, we examine a variant of the personnel scheduling problems,\nwhich involves scheduling a homogeneous workforce subject to constraints\nconcerning both the total number and the number of consecutive work days and\ndays off. This problem was claimed to be NP-complete by [Brunner+2013]. In this\npaper, we prove its NP-completeness and investigate how the combination of\nconstraints contributes to this complexity.

Most existing approaches train and track within a single\ndomain, resulting in a lack of cross-domain generalizability to data from other\ndomains. While several works have introduced natural language representation to\nbridge the domain gap in visual tracking, these textual descriptions often\nprovide too high-level a view and fail to distinguish various instances within\nthe same class. In this paper, we address this limitation by developing IP-MOT,\nan end-to-end transformer model for MOT that operates without concrete textual\ndescriptions. Our approach is underpinned by two key innovations: Firstly,\nleveraging a pre-trained vision-language model, we obtain instance-level pseudo\ntextual descriptions via prompt-tuning, which are invariant across different\ntracking scenes; Secondly, we introduce a query-balanced strategy, augmented by\nknowledge distillation, to further boost the generalization capabilities of our\nmodel. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely used MOT benchmarks,\nincluding MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack, demonstrate that our approach not only\nachieves competitive performance on same-domain data compared to\nstate-of-the-art models but also significantly improves the performance of\nquery-based trackers by large margins for cross-domain inputs.",

The contact\narea increases with the contact age at rest. In contrast, it usually reduces\nunder unidirectional shear loading. Although the physical origin of such a\nreduction is still debated, it always happens in an anisotropic way because the\nreduction mainly occurs along the shearing direction. Whether such anisotropy\nis a necessary condition for shear-induced area reduction remains an open\nquestion. Here, we investigate the contact area evolution of elastomer-based\nsphere-plane contacts under an isotropic shear loading, i.e. torsional loading.\nWe find that, when macroscopic sliding is reached, the contact area has\nundergone a net area reduction. However, the area evolves non-monotonically as\nthe twisting angle increases, with an initial rise up to a maximum before\ndropping to the value during macroscopic sliding. The ratio of maximum to\ninitial contact area is found weakly dependent on the normal load, angular\nvelocity and dwell time (time interval between the instants when the normal\nload and twist motion are first applied) within the investigated ranges. We\nshow that non-monotonic area evolution can also be found under unidirectional\nshear loading conditions under large normal force.

    "abstract": "Robotic systems show significant promise for water environmental sensing\napplications such as water quality monitoring, pollution mapping and\nbiodiversity data collection.\n  Conventional deployment methods often disrupt fragile ecosystems, preventing\ndepiction of the undisturbed environmental condition. In response to this\nchallenge, we propose a novel framework utilizing a lightweight tumbler system\nequipped with a sensing unit, deployed via a drone. This design minimizes\ndisruption to the water habitat by maintaining a slow descent. The sensing unit\nis detached once on the water surface, enabling precise and non-invasive data\ncollection from the benthic zone.\n  The tumbler is designed to be lightweight and compact, enabling deployment\nvia a drone. The sensing pod, which detaches from the tumbler and descends to\nthe bottom of the water body, is equipped with temperature and pressure\nsensors, as well as a buoyancy system. The later, activated upon task\ncompletion, utilizes a silicon membrane inflated via a chemical reaction. The\nreaction generates a pressure of 70 kPa, causing the silicon membrane to expand\nby 30\\%, which exceeds the 5.7\\% volume increase required for positive\nbuoyancy. The tumblers, made from ecofriendly materials to minimize\nenvironmental impact when lost during the mission, were tested for their\ngliding ratio and descent rate. They exhibit a low descent rate, in the range\nof 0.8 to 2.5 meters per seconds, which minimizes disturbance to the ecosystem\nupon water landing. Additionally, the system demonstrated robustness in\nmoderate to strong wind conditions during outdoor tests, validating the overall\nframework.",

On the one hand, we obtain the first intractability results, in\nthe best-case sense, for pseudo-Boolean optimization problems on signed\nhypergraphs with bounded rank, in terms of the treewidth of the intersection\ngraph. Namely, first, under some mild assumptions, we show that for every\nsequence of hypergraphs indexed by the treewidth and with bounded rank, the\ncomplexity of solving the associated pseudo-Boolean optimization problem grows\nsuper-polynomially in the treewidth. Second, we show that any hypergraph of\nbounded rank is the underlying hypergraph of some signed hypergraph for which\nthe corresponding pseudo-Boolean polytope has an exponential extension\ncomplexity in the treewidth. On the other hand, we introduce the nest-set gap,\na new hypergraph-theoretic notion that enables us to define a notion of\n\"distance\" from the hypergaph acyclicity. We prove that if this distance is\nbounded, the pseudo-Boolean polytope admits a polynomial-size extended\nformulation.

In existing methods, one of the camera images is chosen and\nconsidered as a reference, ignoring the color information of all other\nrecordings. Our new approach does not just take one image as reference, but\nuses statistical information such as the location parameter to generate a\nconsensus image as basis for calibration.

We do so by first analyzing a\nsimplified model that uses a gating mechanism to choose between an in-weight\nand an in-context predictor. Through a combination of a generalization error\nand regret analysis we identify conditions where in-context and in-weight\nlearning emerge. These theoretical findings are then corroborated\nexperimentally by comparing the behaviour of a full transformer on the\nsimplified distributions to that of the stylized model, demonstrating aligned\nresults.

This has promoted the exploration of\nrole-playing agents in various applications, such as chatbots that can engage\nin natural conversations with users and virtual assistants that can provide\npersonalized support and guidance. The crucial factor in the role-playing task\nis the effective utilization of character memory, which stores characters'\nprofiles, experiences, and historical dialogues. Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG) technology is used to access the related memory to enhance the response\ngeneration of role-playing agents. Most existing studies retrieve related\ninformation based on the semantic similarity of memory to maintain characters'\npersonalized traits, and few attempts have been made to incorporate the\nemotional factor in the retrieval argument generation (RAG) of LLMs. Inspired\nby the Mood-Dependent Memory theory, which indicates that people recall an\nevent better if they somehow reinstate during recall the original emotion they\nexperienced during learning, we propose a novel emotion-aware memory retrieval\nframework, termed Emotional RAG, which recalls the related memory with\nconsideration of emotional state in role-playing agents. Specifically, we\ndesign two kinds of retrieval strategies, i.e., combination strategy and\nsequential strategy, to incorporate both memory semantic and emotional states\nduring the retrieval process. Extensive experiments on three representative\nrole-playing datasets demonstrate that our Emotional RAG framework outperforms\nthe method without considering the emotional factor in maintaining the\npersonalities of role-playing agents.

In this work, we propose the \\textit{neural attention\nfield} for representing semantic-aware dense feature fields in the 3D space by\nmodeling inter-point relevance instead of individual point features. Core to it\nis a transformer decoder that computes the cross-attention between any 3D query\npoint with all the scene points, and provides the query point feature with an\nattention-based aggregation. We further propose a self-supervised framework for\ntraining the transformer decoder from only a few 3D pointclouds without hand\ndemonstrations. Post-training, the attention field can be applied to novel\nscenes for semantics-aware dexterous grasping from one-shot demonstration.\nExperiments show that our method provides better optimization landscapes by\nencouraging the end-effector to focus on task-relevant scene regions, resulting\nin significant improvements in success rates on real robots compared with the\nfeature-field-based methods.",

We use simple models to demonstrate\nthat the vertical thickness of an isothermal layer around the disk midplane has\nimportant effects on the CO column density radial profile, with a thick layer\nproducing a sharp CO snowline transition. We simulate ngVLA and ALMA images to\nshow that this sharp change in CO column density can be detected in the\nderivative of the radial profile of emission from optically thin CO\nisotopologue lines. We apply this method to archival ALMA observations of the\ndisk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O J=1-0\nand J=2-1 lines to identify a sharp CO snowline transition near 80 au (0.8\narcsec at 101 pc), and show the CO column density decreases by more than a\nfactor of 20. This finding is consistent with previous inferences from the\nsteep rise of N$_2$H$^+$ emission, which marks the location where CO depletes.\nWe also demonstrate that the disk's thermal structure introduces a significant\nsystematic uncertainty to estimates of total disk gas mass derived from these\nlines. The substantial improvement in sensitivity envisioned for the ngVLA over\nALMA for observations of ground-state lines of CO isotopologues has the\npotential to extend this approach to a much larger population of disks.",

A swarm of drones has\nshowcased autonomous navigation through the canopy, maneuvering with agility\nand evading tree collisions, all aimed at mapping the area and collecting data.\nHowever, relying solely on free-flying drones has proven insufficient for data\ncollection. Flying drones within the canopy generates loud noise, disturbing\nanimals and potentially corrupting the data. Additionally, commercial drones\noften have limited autonomy for dexterous tasks where aerial physical\ninteraction could be required, further complicating data acquisition efforts.\nAerial deployed sensor placement methods such as bio-gliders and sensor\nshooting have proven effective for data collection within the lower canopy.\nHowever, these methods face challenges related to retrieving the data and\nsensors, often necessitating human intervention.",

To address this issue, we use a combination of muon spin\nrelaxation/rotation, electrical transport and reciprocal space mapping which\nallows to correlate magnetic, electronic and structural degrees of freedom in\nstrain-engineered V2O3 thin films. Evidence is found for a magnetic instability\nin the vicinity of the structural transition.

Moreover, we find evidence for an onset of\nantiferromagnetic (AF) fluctuations in the rhombohedral phase even without a\nstructural transition to the monoclinic phase. The non-congruence of the\nstructural and magnetic transitions increases as the transition temperature is\nreduced by strain. In samples where the transition is most strongly suppressed\nby strain, a depth-dependent magnetic state is observed.

Despite\nthis, few studies explore the simultaneous impacts of decarbonising both\nsectors. This paper aims to examine how industrial decarbonisation in Europe\naffects the energy system and vice versa. To address this, an industry model\nincorporating key heavy industry sectors across six European countries is\ncombined with an energy system model for electricity and hydrogen covering\nfifteen European regions, refered to as the EU-15, divided into eleven zones.\nThe study evaluates various policy scenarios under different conditions.The\nresults demonstrate that industrial decarbonisation leads to a significant\nincrease in electricity and hydrogen demand. This additional demand for\nelectricity is largely met through renewable energy sources, while hydrogen\nsupply is predominantly addressed by blue hydrogen production when fossil fuels\nare authorized and the system lacks renewable energy. This increased demand\nresults in higher prices with considerable regional disparities. Furthermore,\nthe findings reveal that, regardless of the scenario, the electricity mix in\nthe EU-15 remains predominantly renewable, exceeding 85%.A reduction in carbon\ntaxes lowers the prices of electricity and hydrogen, but does not increase\nconsumption, as the lower carbon tax makes the continued use of fossil fuels\nmore attractive to industry. In scenarios that enforce a phase-out of fossil\nfuels, electricity prices rise, leading to a greater reliance on imports of\nlow-carbon hydrogen and methanol. Results also suggest that domestic hydrogen\nproduction benefits from synergies between electrolytic hydrogen and blue\nhydrogen, helping to maintain competitive prices.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the spatial evolution of a zero pressure gradient\nturbulent boundary layer (TBL) imposed by a square-wave (SqW) of steady\nspanwise wall-forcing, which varies along the streamwise direction ($x$). The\nSqW wall-forcing is imposed experimentally via a series of streamwise periodic\nbelts running in opposite spanwise directions, following the methodology of\nKnoop et al. (Exp. Fluids, vol 65, 2024), with the streamwise extent increased\nto beyond $\\sim 11$ times the boundary layer thickness (${\\delta}_o$) in the\npresent study. This unique setup is leveraged to investigate the influence of\nviscous-scaled wavelength of SqW wall-forcing on the turbulent drag reduction\n(DR) efficacy for $\\lambda^+_x = $ 471 (sub-optimal), 942 (near-optimal), and\n1884 (post-optimal conditions), at fixed viscous-scaled wall-forcing amplitude,\n$A^+ = 12$, and friction Reynolds number, $Re_\\tau = 960$. The TBL's response\nto this wall-forcing is elucidated by drawing inspiration from established\nknowledge on traditionally studied sinusoidal forcing (SinW), based on analysis\nof the streamwise-phase variation of the Stokes strain rate (SSR). The analysis\nreveals the SqW forcing to be characterized by a combination of two markedly\ndifferent SSR regimes whose influence on the overlying turbulence is found to\ndepend on the forcing waveform: sub-phase-I of local and strong impulses of SSR\ndownstream of the half- ($\\lambda_x$/2) and full-phase ($\\lambda_x$) locations,\nassociated with a reversal in spanwise forcing directions, leading to\nsignificant turbulence attenuation, and sub-phase-II of near-zero SSR over the\nremainder of forcing phase that enables turbulence recovery (when wall-forcing\nmagnitudes and direction remain constant).",

This study investigated how VR displayed with an head-mounted\ndisplay (HMD) affects serial recall performance compared to traditional\ncomputer monitors, focusing on their effects on audiovisual processing in\ncognitive tasks. For that matter, we conducted two experiments with both an HMD\nand a computer monitor as display devices and two types of audiovisual\nincongruences: angle (Exp. 1) and voice (Exp. 2) incongruence. To quantify\ncognitive performance an audiovisual verbal serial recall (avVSR) task was\ndeveloped where an embodied conversational agent (ECA) was animated to speak\nthe target digit sequence. Even though subjective evaluations showed a higher\nsense of presence in the HMD condition, we found no effect of the display\ndevice on the proportion of correctly recalled digits. For the extreme\nconditions of angle incongruence in the computer monitor presentation the\nproportion of correctly recalled digits increased marginally, presumably due to\nraised attention, but the effect is likely too small to be meaningful. Response\ntimes were not affected by incongruences in either display device across both\nexperiments. These findings suggest that the avVSR task is robust against\nangular and voice audiovisual incongruences, irrespective of the display\ndevice, at least for the conditions studied here.

This article presents a theoretical\nanalysis of economic cycles and financial crises, highlighting the role of\ndominant currencies in global economic stability. Currencies such as the dollar\nand the euro strongly influence emerging economies, notably through exchange\nrate variations and international capital movements. Analysis of the monetary\nstrategies of emerging economies, through case studies of Brazil, India and\nNigeria, reveals how these countries use tools such as interest rates, foreign\nexchange interventions and capital controls to manage the impacts of crises and\nfluctuations in dominant currencies. The article also highlights the challenges\nand limitations faced by these countries, including structural and\ninstitutional constraints and the reactions of international financial\nmarkets.Finally, an econometric analysis using a Vector AutoRegression (VAR)\nmodel illustrates the impact of monetary policies on key economic variables,\nsuch as GDP, interest rates, inflation and exchange rates. The results show\nthat emerging economies, although sensitive to external shocks, can adjust\ntheir policies to stabilize economic growth in the medium and long term.",

The theory for the evaluation of precise probabilistic\nforecasts is well-developed and is grounded in the key concepts of proper\nscoring rules and calibration. For the case of imprecise probabilistic\nforecasts (sets of probabilities), such theory is still lacking. In this work,\nwe therefore generalize proper scoring rules and calibration to the imprecise\ncase. We develop these concepts as relative to data models and decision\nproblems. As a consequence, the imprecision is embedded in a clear context. We\nestablish a close link to the paradigm of (group) distributional robustness and\nin doing so provide new insights for it. We argue that proper scoring rules and\ncalibration serve two distinct goals, which are aligned in the precise case,\nbut intriguingly are not necessarily aligned in the imprecise case. The concept\nof decision-theoretic entropy plays a key role for both goals. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the theoretical insights in machine learning practice, in\nparticular we illustrate subtle pitfalls relating to the choice of loss\nfunction in distributional robustness.",

In addition to consuming the\nstatic resource, each case requires post-allocation services from a server,\nsuch as a translator. Given the uncertainty in service time, a server may not\nbe available at a given time, thus we refer to it as a dynamic resource. Upon\nmatching, the case will wait to avail service in a first-come-first-serve\nmanner. Bursty matching to a location may result in undesirable congestion at\nits corresponding server.

Unfortunately,\nthis perturbation expansion often fails in systems with strong multi-reference\ncharacters. Extending diagrammatic MBPT to the multi-reference case is highly\nnontrivial and remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the breakdown of\nWick's theorem. In this work, we develop a diagrammatic multi-reference\ngeneralization of MBPT for computing correlation energies of strongly\ncorrelated systems, by using the cumulant expansion of many-body Green's\nfunction in place of Wick's theorem. This theoretical framework bridges the gap\nbetween MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation\ntheories (MRPT) in quantum chemistry, which had been almost exclusively\nformulated within time-independent wavefunction frameworks prior to this work.\nOur formulation enables the explicit incorporation of strong correlation\neffects from the outset as in MRPT, while treating residual weak interactions\nthrough a generalized diagrammatic perturbation expansion as in MBPT. As a\nconcrete demonstration, we formulate a multi-reference (MR) extension of the\nstandard single-reference (SR) RPA by systematically resumming generalized ring\ndiagrams, which naturally leads to a unified set of equations applicable to\nboth SR and MR cases. Benchmark calculations on prototypical molecular systems\nreveal that MR-RPA successfully resolves the well-known failure of SR-RPA in\nstrongly correlated systems.

This paper\nintroduces two novel propensity score-based methods for local equating:\nstratification and inverse probability weighting (IPW). These methods use\ncovariates to account for group differences, with propensity scores serving as\nproxies for latent ability differences between test groups. The stratification\nmethod partitions examinees into comparable groups based on similar propensity\nscores, while IPW assigns weights inversely proportional to the probability of\ngroup membership.

It\ncan be regarded as the classical limit of the log of the quantum S-matrix. In a\nclassical analog of the Born approximation in quantum mechanics, the classical\neikonal admits an expansion in oriented tree graphs, where oriented edges\ndenote retarded/advanced worldline propagators. The Magnus expansion, which\ntakes the log of a time-ordered exponential integral, offers an efficient\nmethod to compute the coefficients of the tree graphs to all orders. We exploit\na Hopf algebra structure behind the Magnus expansion to develop a fast\nalgorithm which can compute the tree coefficients up to the 12th order (over\nhalf a million trees) in less than an hour. In a relativistic setting, our\nmethods can be applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion for gravitational\nbinaries in the worldline formalism. We demonstrate the methods by computing\nthe 3PM eikonal and find agreement with previous results based on amplitude\nmethods. Importantly, the Magnus expansion yields a finite eikonal, while the\nna\\\"ive eikonal based on the time-symmetric propagator is infrared-divergent\nfrom 3PM on.",

Firstly, a centralized cooperative\ntrajectory planning problem is formulated subject to the safely constraints and\ntraffic performance in ramp merging scenario, where the trajectories of all\nvehicles are jointly optimized. To get rid of the reliance on a central\ncontroller and reduce computation time, a distributed solution to this problem\nimplemented among CAVs through Vehicles-to-Everything (V2X) communication is\nproposed. Unlike existing method, our method can distribute the computational\ntask among CAVs and carry out parallel solving through V2X communication. Then,\na multi-vehicles model predictive control (MPC) problem aimed at maximizing\nsystem stability and minimizing control input is formulated based on the\nsolution of the first problem subject to strict safety constants and input\nlimits. Due to these complex constraints, this problem becomes\nhigh-dimensional, centralized, and non-convex. To solve it in a short time, a\ndecomposition and convex reformulation method, namely distributed cooperative\niterative model predictive control (DCIMPC), is proposed. This method leverages\nthe communication capability of CAVs to decompose the problem, making full use\nof the computational resources on vehicles to achieve fast solutions and\ndistributed control. The two above problems with their corresponding solving\nmethods form the systemic framework of the V2X assisted distributed computing\nand control.

Moreover,\nwith the growing abundance of graph data, the significance of multi-view graph\nclustering (MVGC) has become evident. Most existing methods focus on graph\nneural networks (GNNs) to extract information from both graph structure and\nfeature data to learn distinguishable node representations. However,\ntraditional GNNs are designed with the assumption of homophilous graphs, making\nthem unsuitable for widely prevalent heterophilous graphs.

While these\nmethods partially mitigate the heterophilous graph issue, they often neglect\nthe advantages of traditional GNNs, such as their simplicity, interpretability,\nand efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view graph clustering\nmethod based on dual-optimized adaptive graph reconstruction, named DOAGC. It\nmainly aims to reconstruct the graph structure adapted to traditional GNNs to\ndeal with heterophilous graph issues while maintaining the advantages of\ntraditional GNNs.

Significant efforts have been made to integrate\nadvanced network architectures and training strategies that enhance the capture\nof temporal dependencies, thereby improving forecasting accuracy. On the other\nhand, mainstream approaches typically utilize a single unified model with\nsimplistic channel-mixing embedding or cross-channel attention operations to\naccount for the critical intricate inter-channel dependencies. Moreover, some\nmethods even trade capacity for robust prediction based on the\nchannel-independent assumption. Nonetheless, as time series data may display\ndistinct evolving patterns due to the unique characteristics of each channel\n(including multiple strong seasonalities and trend changes), the unified\nmodeling methods could yield suboptimal results. To this end, we propose\nDisenTS, a tailored framework for modeling disentangled channel evolving\npatterns in general multivariate time series forecasting. The central idea of\nDisenTS is to model the potential diverse patterns within the multivariate time\nseries data in a decoupled manner. Technically, the framework employs multiple\ndistinct forecasting models, each tasked with uncovering a unique evolving\npattern. To guide the learning process without supervision of pattern\npartition, we introduce a novel Forecaster Aware Gate (FAG) module that\ngenerates the routing signals adaptively according to both the forecasters'\nstates and input series' characteristics. The forecasters' states are derived\nfrom the Linear Weight Approximation (LWA) strategy, which quantizes the\ncomplex deep neural networks into compact matrices.

    "abstract": "We present the first application of quantics tensor trains (QTTs) and tensor\ncross interpolation (TCI) to the solution of a full set of self-consistent\nequations for multivariate functions, the so-called parquet equations. We show\nthat the steps needed to evaluate the equations (Bethe--Salpeter equations,\nparquet equation and Schwinger--Dyson equation) can be decomposed into basic\noperations on the QTT-TCI (QTCI) compressed objects. The repeated application\nof these operations does not lead to a loss of accuracy beyond a specified\ntolerance and the iterative scheme converges even for numerically demanding\nparameters. As examples we take the Hubbard model in the atomic limit and the\nsingle impurity Anderson model, where the basic objects in parquet equations,\nthe two-particle vertices, depend on three frequencies, but not on momenta. The\nresults show that this approach is able to overcome major computational\nbottlenecks of standard numerical methods. The applied methods allow for an\nexponential increase of the number of grid points included in the calculations\nleading to an exponentially improving computational error for a linear increase\nin computational cost.",

    "abstract": "In high energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy with shower arrays the most discriminating\nsignature of the photon-induced showers against the background of\nhadron-induced cosmic-ray is the content of muons in the observed events. In\nthe electromagnetic $\\gamma$-showers the muon production is mainly due to the\nphoto-production of pions followed by the decay $\\pi\\to\\mu\\nu$. In high energy\nphoto-production process the photon exhibits an internal structure which is\nvery similar to that of hadrons. Indeed, photon-hadron interactions can be\nunderstood if the physical photon is viewed as a superposition of a bare photon\nand an accompanying small hadronic component which feels conventional hadronic\ninteractions. Information on photo-production $\\gamma$p and $\\gamma\\gamma$\ncross-sections are limited to $\\sqrt{s}\\leq$ 200 GeV from data collected at\nHERA. Starting from $E_{lab}\\approx$100 TeV the difference between different\nextrapolations of the cross sections increases to more than 50\\% at\n$E_{lab}\\approx$10$^{19}$ eV, with important impact on a number of shower\nobservables and on the selection of the photon-initiated air showers. Recently,\nthe LHAASO experiment opened the PeV-sky to observations detecting 40 PeVatrons\nin a background-free regime starting from about $E_{lab}\\approx$ 100 TeV. This\nresult provides a beam of pure high energy primary photons allowing to measure\nfor the first time the photo-production cross section even at energies not\nexplored yet. The future air shower array SWGO in the Southern Hemisphere,\nwhere the existence of Super-Pevatrons emitting photons well above the PeV is\nexpected, could extend the study of the hadron nature of the photons in the PeV\nregion. In this contribution the opportunity for a measurement of the\nphoto-production cross section with air shower arrays is presented and\ndiscussed.",

Accordingly, an optical redefinition of the second\nhas been widely discussed, prompting a need for the consistency of optical\nclocks to be verified worldwide. While satellite frequency links are sufficient\nto compare microwave clocks, a suitable method for comparing high-performance\noptical clocks over intercontinental distances is missing. Furthermore, remote\ncomparisons over frequency links face fractional uncertainties of a few\n$10^{-18}$ due to imprecise knowledge of each clock's relativistic redshift,\nwhich stems from uncertainty in the geopotential determined at each distant\nlocation. Here, we report a landmark campaign towards the era of optical\nclocks, where, for the first time, state-of-the-art transportable optical\nclocks from Japan and Europe are brought together to demonstrate international\ncomparisons that require neither a high-performance frequency link nor\ninformation on the geopotential difference between remote sites. Conversely,\nthe reproducibility of the clocks after being transported between countries was\nsufficient to determine geopotential height offsets at the level of 4 cm.

Surface terms are added to the evolution equations, and SBM\ncalculations are compared with benchmark simulations for which the boundary\nconditions are explicitly imposed at the borders of the calculation domain.

The dynamics of \"who follows whom\"\nare governed by a directed graph, where each vertex represents an elephant, and\nthe edges indicate that an elephant will consider the past steps of its\nin-neighbour elephants when deciding its next move. In other words, this model\ninvolves a collection of reinforced random walks evolving through graph-based\ninteractions. We briefly investigate the first- and second-order asymptotic\nbehaviour of the joint walks and establish connections with other network-based\nreinforced stochastic processes studied in the literature. We show that the\njoint walk can be expressed as a stochastic approximation scheme. In certain\nregimes, we employ tools from stochastic approximation theory to derive the\nasymptotic properties of the joint walks. Additionally, in a specific regime,\nwe use better techniques to establish a strong invariance principle and a\ncentral limit theorem with improved rates compared to existing results in the\nstochastic approximation literature. These techniques can also be used to\nstrengthen equivalent results in stochastic approximation theory. As a\nbyproduct, we establish a strong invariance principle for the simple elephant\nrandom walk with significantly improved rates.",

    "abstract": "Image restoration has experienced significant advancements due to the\ndevelopment of deep learning. Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to\nill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions\nand ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique,\naims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base\nmodels. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of\nrestoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage\nensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to\nenable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to\nprefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this,\nwe reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture\nmodels (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to\nestimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate\nthe range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup\ntable (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is\nmodel-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement\nof various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms\nregression based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks\nacross 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and\nderaining. The codes and all estimated weights have been released in Github.",

Here we\ndemonstrate a novel approach for manipulating vector vortex beams carrying\nlongitudinal field components using metamaterials with extreme anisotropy.\nImplementing vectorial spectroscopy, we show that the propagation of complex\nbeams with inhomogeneous polarisation is strongly affected by the interplay of\nthe metamaterial anisotropy with the transverse and longitudinal field\nstructure of the beam. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in the\nepsilon-near-zero regime, exclusively realised for light polarised along the\nmetamaterial optical axis, strongly influencing the interaction of longitudinal\nfields with the metamaterial. The requirements on the balance between the\ntransverse and longitudinal fields to maintain a polarisation singularity at\nthe beam axis allow control of the beam modal content, filtering diffraction\neffects and tailoring spatial polarisation distribution. The proposed approach\noffers important capabilities for wavefront shaping as well as local spatial\npolarisation engineering. The understanding of the interaction of vector beams\nwith metamaterials opens new opportunities for applications in microscopy,\ninformation encoding, biochemical sensing and quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Traditional methods for solving physical equations in curved spaces,\nespecially in fluid mechanics and general relativity, rely heavily on the use\nof Christoffel symbols. These symbols provide the necessary corrections to\naccount for curvature in differential geometries but lead to significant\ncomputational complexity, particularly in numerical simulations. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel, simplified approach that obviates the need for Christoffel\nsymbols by symbolic programming and advanced numerical methods.\n  Our approach is based on defining a symbolic mapping between Euclidean space\nand curved coordinate systems, enabling the transformation of spatial and\ntemporal derivatives through Jacobians and their inverses. This eliminates the\nnecessity of using Christoffel symbols for defining local bases and tensors,\nallowing for the direct application of physical laws in Cartesian coordinates\neven when solving problems in curved spaces.\n  We demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of our method through several\nexamples, including the derivation of the Navier-Stokes equations in\ncylindrical coordinates, the modeling of complex flows in bent cylindrical\ntubes, and the breakup of viscoelastic fluid threads. These examples highlight\nhow our method simplifies the numerical formulation while maintaining accuracy\nand efficiency. Additionally, we explore how these advancements benefit\nfree-surface flows, where mapping physical 3D domains to a simpler\ncomputational domain is essential for solving moving boundary problems.",

To harness the full potential of ISAC networks, it is\nessential to experimentally validate their sensing capabilities and the role of\nsensing in boosting communication. However, current prototype systems fall\nshort in supporting multiple sensing functions or validating sensing-assisted\ncommunication. In response, we have developed an advanced ISAC prototype system\nthat incorporates monostatic, bistatic, and network sensing modes. This system\nsupports multimodal data collection and synchronization, ensuring comprehensive\nexperimental validation.

For sensing\napplications, it provides precise angle and range measurements, real-time\nangle-range imaging, and radio-based simultaneous localization and mapping\n(SLAM). Our prototype aligns with the 5G New Radio standard, offering\nscalability for up to 16 user equipments (UEs) in uplink transmission and 10\nUEs in downlink transmission. Real-world tests showcase the system's superior\naccuracy, with root mean square errors of 2.3 degrees for angle estimation and\n0.3 meters (m) for range estimation.

To address this issue, we propose Reliability-Aware RAG\n(RA-RAG), a new multi-source RAG framework that estimates the reliability of\nsources and leverages this information to prioritize highly reliable and\nrelevant documents, ensuring more robust and accurate response generation.\nSpecifically, RA-RAG first estimates source reliability by cross-checking\ninformation across multiple sources. It then retrieves documents from the\ntop-$\\kappa$ reliable and relevant sources and aggregates their information\nusing weighted majority voting (WMV), where the selective retrieval ensures\nscalability while not compromising the performance. Comprehensive experiments\nshow that RA-RAG consistently outperforms baselines in scenarios with\nheterogeneous source reliability while scaling efficiently as the number of\nsources increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of RA-RAG to\nestimate real-world sources' reliability, highlighting its practical\napplicability. \\jy{Our code and data are available at\n\\href{https://github.com/ml-postech/RA-RAG}{RA-RAG}.}",

    "abstract": "Anderson localization transitions are a universal quantum phenomenon\nsensitive to the disorder and dimensionality of electronic systems. Over the\npast decades, this intriguing topic has inspired overwhelmingly more\ntheoretical studies than experimental verifications due to the difficulty of\ncontrolling a material's disorder or dimensionality without modifying its\nfundamental electronic properties. Organic crystals with their rich disorders\nwould be terrific playgrounds to investigate such disorder-driven phase\ntransitions except for their low conductivities which usually prohibit\nlow-temperature measurements. Here, we conduct systematic transport experiments\nin mesoscopic devices made with copper benzenehexathiol thin films across a\nwide range of thicknesses. We find metal-insulator transitions both among\nthree-dimensional samples with different disorder strengths and between\nthree-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional samples. Temperature-dependence\nanalysis of the conductivities corroborates the dimensionality crossover.\nMoreover, our theoretical modeling provides a basis for understanding both\ntypes of metal-insulator transitions within the framework of Anderson\nlocalization transitions. Our findings establish for the first time that\norganic crystals such as conductive metal-organic frameworks can exhibit such\nquantum interference effects. With organic materials' versatile chemical\ndesigns and crystalline structures, our work opens new avenues to search for\nnovel quantum phenomena in organic material platforms.",

    "abstract": "A common strategy for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained\nVision Transformers (ViTs) involves adapting the model to downstream tasks by\nlearning a low-rank adaptation matrix. This matrix is decomposed into a product\nof down-projection and up-projection matrices, with the bottleneck\ndimensionality being crucial for reducing the number of learnable parameters,\nas exemplified by prevalent methods like LoRA and Adapter. However, these\nlow-rank strategies typically employ a fixed bottleneck dimensionality, which\nlimits their flexibility in handling layer-wise variations. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel PEFT approach inspired by Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) for representing the adaptation matrix. SVD decomposes a\nmatrix into the product of a left unitary matrix, a diagonal matrix of scaling\nvalues, and a right unitary matrix. We utilize Householder transformations to\nconstruct orthogonal matrices that efficiently mimic the unitary matrices,\nrequiring only a vector. The diagonal values are learned in a layer-wise\nmanner, allowing them to flexibly capture the unique properties of each layer.\nThis approach enables the generation of adaptation matrices with varying ranks\nacross different layers, providing greater flexibility in adapting pre-trained\nmodels. Experiments on standard downstream vision tasks demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves promising fine-tuning performance.",

The Margin Propagation (MP) framework,\nbeing one such initiative in the analog computing domain, stands out due to its\nscalability across biasing conditions, temperatures, and diminishing process\ntechnology nodes. However, the lack of digital-like automation tools for\ndesigning analog systems (including that of MP analog) hinders their adoption\nfor designing large systems. The inherent scalability and modularity of MP\nsystems present a unique opportunity in this regard. This paper introduces\nKALAM (toolKit for Automating high-Level synthesis of Analog computing\nsysteMs), which leverages factor graphs as the foundational paradigm for\nsynthesizing MP-based analog computing systems. Factor graphs are the basis of\nvarious signal processing tasks and, when coupled with MP, can be used to\ndesign scalable and energy-efficient analog signal processors. Using Python\nscripting language, the KALAM automation flow translates an input factor graph\nto its equivalent SPICE-compatible circuit netlist that can be used to validate\nthe intended functionality. KALAM also allows the integration of design\noptimization strategies such as precision tuning, variable elimination, and\nmathematical simplification.

    "abstract": "Image Signal Processors (ISPs) convert raw sensor signals into digital\nimages, which significantly influence the image quality and the performance of\ndownstream computer vision tasks. Designing ISP pipeline and tuning ISP\nparameters are two key steps for building an imaging and vision system. To find\noptimal ISP configurations, recent works use deep neural networks as a proxy to\nsearch for ISP parameters or ISP pipelines. However, these methods are\nprimarily designed to maximize the image quality, which are sub-optimal in the\nperformance of high-level computer vision tasks such as detection, recognition,\nand tracking. Moreover, after training, the learned ISP pipelines are mostly\nfixed at the inference time, whose performance degrades in dynamic scenes. To\njointly optimize ISP structures and parameters, we propose AdaptiveISP, a\ntask-driven and scene-adaptive ISP. One key observation is that for the\nmajority of input images, only a few processing modules are needed to improve\nthe performance of downstream recognition tasks, and only a few inputs require\nmore processing. Based on this, AdaptiveISP utilizes deep reinforcement\nlearning to automatically generate an optimal ISP pipeline and the associated\nISP parameters to maximize the detection performance. Experimental results show\nthat AdaptiveISP not only surpasses the prior state-of-the-art methods for\nobject detection but also dynamically manages the trade-off between detection\nperformance and computational cost, especially suitable for scenes with large\ndynamic range variations.

    "abstract": "The application of reinforcement learning in traffic signal control (TSC) has\nbeen extensively researched and yielded notable achievements. However, most\nexisting works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding\nintersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In\nreal-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions\nor data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the\nneeds of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional\ndiffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting.\nSpecifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data\nimputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned\nDiffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the\nlearning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal\ndependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer\n(STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication\nMechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under\ndata-missing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five datasets with various\ndata-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to\naddress TSC with missing data.

We\ninterviewed seven politicians (politically appointed officials as heads of\ngovernment institutions) and thirteen public servants (career government\nemployees who design and administrate policy interventions), inquiring how they\nchoose whether and how to use NLP tools to support civic participation\nprocesses. The interviews suggest that policymakers across both groups focused\non their needs for career advancement and the need to showcase the legitimacy\nand fairness of their work when considering NLP tool adoption and use. Because\nthese needs vary between politicians and public servants, their preferred NLP\nfeatures and tool designs also differ. Interestingly, despite their differing\nneeds and opinions, neither group clearly identifies who should advocate for\nNLP adoption to enhance civic participation or address the unintended\nconsequences of a poorly considered adoption. This lack of clarity in\nresponsibility might have caused the governments' low adoption of NLP tools. We\ndiscuss how these findings reveal new insights for future HCI research.

The major challenge is\nthat inverse graphics cannot be directly applied to such image latent spaces\nbecause they lack an underlying 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose an\nInverse Graphics Autoencoder (IG-AE) that specifically addresses this issue. To\nthis end, we regularize an image autoencoder with 3D-geometry by aligning its\nlatent space with jointly trained latent 3D scenes. We utilize the trained\nIG-AE to bring NeRFs to the latent space with a latent NeRF training pipeline,\nwhich we implement in an open-source extension of the Nerfstudio framework,\nthereby unlocking latent scene learning for its supported methods. We\nexperimentally confirm that Latent NeRFs trained with IG-AE present an improved\nquality compared to a standard autoencoder, all while exhibiting training and\nrendering accelerations with respect to NeRFs trained in the image space.

We scrutinize this assumption using chiral\nkinetic theory in curved space, focusing on spin response to hydrodynamic\ngradient. Two effects of metric perturbation have been identified: one is to\nchange particle motion by scattering it off the metric fields, which does\ncapture spin response to hydrodynamic gradient, but is limited by kinematic\ncondition in the scattering picture. The other is the genuine effect of\noff-equilibrium state, which is realizable by mapping the equilibrium state in\ncurved space to flat space through a suitable frame choice. It lifts the\nkinematic condition in the spin response to hydrodynamic gradient. We classify\noff-equilibrium effect on spin polarization into modifications of (i) spectral\nfunction; (ii) distribution function; (iii) KMS relation. While the last two\nhave been studied using chiral kinetic theory, the first one is usually ignored\nin kinetic description.

Finally, the mechanical properties of T-TPU, altered by the\ninclusion of TiN nanoparticles, were assessed, showing a slight enhancement in\nmodulus and friction coefficient relative to neat TPU (N-TPU).

So far researchers focused on\n$\\mathbf{Ex}$-learning, in which the learner is asked to eventually stabilize\nto the correct hypothesis, and on restrictions where the learner is allowed to\nchange the hypothesis a fixed number of times.

    "abstract": "In an era where single large language models have dominated the landscape of\nartificial intelligence for years, multi-agent systems arise as new\nprotagonists in conversational task-solving. While previous studies have\nshowcased their potential in reasoning tasks and creative endeavors, an\nanalysis of their limitations concerning the conversational paradigms and the\nimpact of individual agents is missing. It remains unascertained how\nmulti-agent discussions perform across tasks of varying complexity and how the\nstructure of these conversations influences the process. To fill that gap, this\nwork systematically evaluates multi-agent systems across various discussion\nparadigms, assessing their strengths and weaknesses in both generative tasks\nand question-answering tasks. Alongside the experiments, I propose a taxonomy\nof 20 multi-agent research studies from 2022 to 2024, followed by the\nintroduction of a framework for deploying multi-agent LLMs in conversational\ntask-solving. I demonstrate that while multi-agent systems excel in complex\nreasoning tasks, outperforming a single model by leveraging expert personas,\nthey fail on basic tasks. Concretely, I identify three challenges that arise:\n1) While longer discussions enhance reasoning, agents fail to maintain\nconformity to strict task requirements, which leads to problem drift, making\nshorter conversations more effective for basic tasks. 2) Prolonged discussions\nrisk alignment collapse, raising new safety concerns for these systems. 3) I\nshowcase discussion monopolization through long generations, posing the problem\nof fairness in decision-making for tasks like summarization.

However, NWs-based devices face\nsignificant challenges because of number of surface states, basal plane\nstacking faults and coalescence related defect states. While the origins of\nmost of the defect states have been identified and mitigated using\nwell-established methods, the origins of few defect states remain unknown, and\nthus their suppression methods have yet to be explored. One such defect state\nis the 3.45 eV luminescence peak, known as the UX-band. In this report, we have\ninvestigated the origin of this peak in NWs grown on a sapphire substrate by\nusing Plasma Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (PAMBE) tool. We have found that\nthe defect states, generated due to oxygen incorporation, especially when the\noxygen atoms substitute the Ga atoms, are the primary cause of this band.\nActually the excitons are localized at this defect center and the radiative\nrecombination of localized excitons gives the characteristic UX-band. By\nprotecting the NWs from oxygen incorporation through AlN encapsulation process,\nwe have completely suppressed the 3.45 eV peak and proved further that the peak\nis caused by oxygen induced defect states. Thus we have addressed an issue that\npersisted over the last three decades, potentially paving the way for\nefficiency improvements in optoelectronic devices.",

Using distances in a ground truth\nfeature space, DII identifies a low-dimensional subset of features that best\npreserves these relationships.

This allows\nsimultaneously performing unit alignment and relative importance scaling, while\npreserving interpretability.

    "abstract": "Bipartite entangled states between a qubit and macroscopically distinct\nstates of a mesoscopic system, known as micro-macro entangled states, are\nemerging resources for quantum information processing. One main challenge in\ngenerating such states in the lab is their fragility to environmental noise. We\nanalyze this fragility in detail for single particle noise by identifying what\nfactors play a role in the robustness and quantifying their effect. There is a\ntrade-off between the macroscopicity of a micro-macro entangled state and the\nrobustness of its bipartite entanglement to environmental noise. We identify\nsymmetric micro-macro entangled states as the most robust states to single\nparticle noise. We show that the robustness of bipartite entanglement of such\nstates to single particle noise decreases as the second order of\nmacroscopicity, which identifies a regime where the bipartite entangled state\nis both robust and macroscopic. Our result is a step towards retaining quantum\ncharacteristics on large scales and experimental realization of micro-macro\nentangled spin states and their use for connecting separated qubits. Moreover,\nit advances our understanding of quantum to classical transition.",

Mod-SbSG enhances cooperative decision-making among\nself-learning agents within production systems by integrating State-based\nPotential Games (SbPG) with Stackelberg games. This hierarchical structure\nassigns more important modules of the manufacturing system a first-mover\nadvantage, while less important modules respond optimally to the leaders'\ndecisions. This decision-making process differs from typical multi-agent\nlearning algorithms in manufacturing systems, where decisions are made\nsimultaneously. We provide convergence guarantees for the novel game structure\nand design learning algorithms to account for the hierarchical game structure.\nWe further analyse the effects of single-leader/multiple-follower and\nmultiple-leader/multiple-follower scenarios within a Mod-SbSG. To assess its\neffectiveness, we implement and test Mod-SbSG in an industrial control setting\nusing two laboratory-scale testbeds featuring sequential and serial-parallel\nprocesses. The proposed approach delivers promising results compared to the\nvanilla SbPG, which reduces overflow by 97.1%, and in some cases, prevents\noverflow entirely.

This representation enables two\nMPCs with continuous properties, thereby avoiding inaccurate model-state\ntransition and dense decision-variable settings in existing MPCs using the\ndiscretization method. It strengthens the online execution of the bilevel MPC\nframework in high-dimensional space and facilitates the generation of\nconsistent commands for our hybrid position/velocity-controlled robot.

    "abstract": "Non-rigid point cloud registration is a critical challenge in 3D scene\nunderstanding, particularly in surgical navigation. Although existing methods\nachieve excellent performance when trained on large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets, these datasets are prohibitively expensive to collect and annotate,\ne.g., organ data in authentic medical scenarios. With insufficient training\nsamples and data noise, existing methods degrade significantly since non-rigid\npatterns are more flexible and complicated than rigid ones, and the\ndistributions across samples are more distinct, leading to higher difficulty in\nrepresentation learning with few data. In this work, we aim to deal with this\nchallenging few-shot non-rigid point cloud registration problem. Based on the\nobservation that complex non-rigid transformation patterns can be decomposed\ninto rigid and small non-rigid transformations, we propose a novel and\neffective framework, UniRiT. UniRiT adopts a two-step registration strategy\nthat first aligns the centroids of the source and target point clouds and then\nrefines the registration with non-rigid transformations, thereby significantly\nreducing the problem complexity. To validate the performance of UniRiT on\nreal-world datasets, we introduce a new dataset, MedMatch3D, which consists of\nreal human organs and exhibits high variability in sample distribution. We\nfurther establish a new challenging benchmark for few-shot non-rigid\nregistration. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that UniRiT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on MedMatch3D, improving the existing best\napproach by 94.22%.",

While most renowned for the\nsuperconductivity observed in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases, many of these\nlayered compounds are also ferroelectric and exhibit a sizeable in-plane\npolarization. Among these, the Carpy-Galy phases (A${_n}$B${_n}$O$_{3n+2}$),\ncharacterized by 110-oriented perovskite planes interleaved with additional\noxygen layers, have been debated as platforms for hosting not only a robust\npolarization but also multiferroicity and polar metallicity. However, the\nchallenges associated with the synthesis of ultrathin Carpy-Galy films and\nunderstanding the impact of strain on their properties limit their integration\ninto devices. Addressing this issue, our study focuses on La$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, an\n$n$=4 (A$_2$B$_2$O$_7$) representative of the Carpy-Galy family, exploring its\ngrowth and concurrent phase stability on various substrates under different\nstrain conditions. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a 3% tensile strain from\nDyScO$_3$ (100) substrates promotes a controlled layer-by-layer growth mode,\nwhile SrTiO$_3$ (110) and LaAlO$_3$-Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$ (110), that exert\nnegligible and compressive strains respectively, require post-deposition\nannealing to achieve similar results.

    "abstract": "When matching parts of a surface to its whole, a fundamental question arises:\nWhich points should be included in the matching process? The issue is\nintensified when using isometry to measure similarity, as it requires the\nvalidation of whether distances measured between pairs of surface points should\ninfluence the matching process. The approach we propose treats surfaces as\nmanifolds equipped with geodesic distances, and addresses the partial shape\nmatching challenge by introducing a novel criterion to meticulously search for\nconsistent distances between pairs of points. The new criterion explores the\nrelation between intrinsic geodesic distances between the points, geodesic\ndistances between the points and surface boundaries, and extrinsic distances\nbetween boundary points measured in the embedding space. It is shown to be less\nrestrictive compared to previous measures and achieves state-of-the-art results\nwhen used as a loss function in training networks for partial shape matching.",

However, modelling and\ncontrolling the collective dynamics of vehicles and pedestrians raises several\nchallenges. Not only are the individual entities self-propelled and hard to\ndescribe, but their complex nonlinear physical and social interactions makes\nthe multi-agent problem of crowd and traffic flow even more involved. In this\nchapter, we purport to review the suitability and limitations of classical\nmodelling approaches through four examples of collective behaviour: stop-and-go\nwaves in traffic flow, lane formation, long-term avoidance behaviour, and load\nbalancing in pedestrian dynamics. While stop-and-go dynamics and lane formation\ncan both be addressed by basic reactive models (at least to some extent), the\nlatter two require anticipation and/or coordination at the level of the group.\nThe results highlight the limitations of classical force-based models, but also\nthe need for long-term anticipation mechanisms and multiscale modelling\napproaches.

Conversely, computer science, especially\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), can contribute quantitative concepts and methods\nto psychoanalysis, identifying patterns and emotional cues in human expression.\nIn particular, this research aims to apply computer science methods to\nestablish fundamental relationships between emotions and Lacanian discourses.\nSuch relations are discovered in our approach via empirical investigation and\nstatistical analysis, and are eventually validated in a theoretical\n(psychoanalytic) way. It is worth noting that, although emotions have been\nsporadically studied in Lacanian theory, to the best of our knowledge a\nsystematic, detailed investigation of their role is missing. Such fine-grained\nunderstanding of the role of emotions can also make the identification of\nLacanian discourses more effective and easy in practise. In particular, our\nmethods indicate the emotions with highest differentiation power in terms of\ncorresponding discourses; conversely, we identify for each discourse the most\ncharacteristic emotions it admits. As a matter of fact, we develop a method\nwhich we call Lacanian Discourse Discovery (LDD), that simplifies (via\nsystematizing) the identification of Lacanian discourses in texts. Although the\nmain contribution of this paper is inherently theoretical (psychoanalytic), it\ncan also facilitate major practical applications in the realm of interactive\ndigital systems.

By iterating over sentence pairs in a\npreference dataset, DPO enhances generation quality by increasing the\nlikelihood of producing preferred sentences over less favored ones. Preference\ndatasets are typically created by selecting preferred sentences through a\nvoting process involving multiple individuals, as opinions can vary due to the\nsubjective nature of human preferences. While the number of votes offers\ninsight into whether a sentence pair is clearly preferable or controversial,\ncurrent methods do not fully leverage this information. In this paper, we\nintroduce a technique that leverages user voting data to better align with\ndiverse subjective preferences. We employ the Bayesian Minimum Mean Square\nError (Bayesian MMSE) estimator to model the probability that one generation is\npreferable to another. Using this estimated probability as a target, we develop\nthe Vote-based Preference Optimization (VPO) framework, which incorporates the\nnumber of votes on both sides to distinguish between controversial and obvious\ngeneration pairs.

To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a\nresponse function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic\nvertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely\nscreened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen'\nformulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a\nfunctional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary\npart of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized\nFermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of\nvertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The screen-screen\nformulation can be further extended partitioning the electronic interaction in\nseparate contributions, expressing the response in terms of partially screened\nelectronic vertices (`partial screen-partial screen'), preserving the\nstationary properties. We numerically validate the effectiveness of our\nformalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits\nstrong excitonic effects. To do so, we solve the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on a\ntight-binding model, including exchange effects in the response of graphene.\nOur findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen\nformulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with\ndensity-matrix approximations.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown remarkable data representation\ncapabilities across a wide range of datasets. However, when applied to\nreal-world datasets with long-tailed distributions, performance on multiple\ndownstream tasks degrades significantly. Recently, the community has begun to\nfocus more on self-supervised long-tailed learning. Some works attempt to\ntransfer temperature mechanisms to self-supervised learning or use\ncategory-space uniformity constraints to balance the representation of\ndifferent categories in the embedding space to fight against long-tail\ndistributions. However, most of these approaches focus on the joint\noptimization of all samples in the dataset or on constraining the category\ndistribution, with little attention given to whether each individual sample is\noptimally guided during training. To address this issue, we propose Temperature\nAuxiliary Sample-level Encouragement (TASE). We introduce pseudo-labels into\nself-supervised long-tailed learning, utilizing pseudo-label information to\ndrive a dynamic temperature and re-weighting strategy. Specifically, We assign\nan optimal temperature parameter to each sample. Additionally, we analyze the\nlack of quantity awareness in the temperature parameter and use re-weighting to\ncompensate for this deficiency, thereby achieving optimal training patterns at\nthe sample level. Comprehensive experimental results on six benchmarks across\nthree datasets demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in\nimproving long-tail recognition, while also exhibiting high robustness.",

    "abstract": "Computer vision researchers have extensively worked on fundamental infrared\nvisual recognition for the past few decades. Among various approaches, deep\nlearning has emerged as the most promising candidate. However, Infrared Small\nObject Segmentation (ISOS) remains a major focus due to several challenges\nincluding: 1) the lack of effective utilization of local contrast and global\ncontextual information; 2) the potential loss of small objects in deep models;\nand 3) the struggling to capture fine-grained details and ignore noise. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a modified U-Net architecture, named\nSFA-UNet, by combining Scharr Convolution (SC) and Fast Fourier Convolution\n(FFC) in addition to vertical and horizontal Attention gates (AG) into UNet.\nSFA-UNet utilizes double convolution layers with the addition of SC and FFC in\nits encoder and decoder layers. SC helps to learn the foreground-to-background\ncontrast information whereas FFC provide multi-scale contextual information\nwhile mitigating the small objects vanishing problem. Additionally, the\nintroduction of vertical AGs in encoder layers enhances the model's focus on\nthe targeted object by ignoring irrelevant regions. We evaluated the proposed\napproach on publicly available, SIRST and IRSTD datasets, and achieved superior\nperformance by an average 0.75% with variance of 0.025 of all combined metrics\nin multiple runs as compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods",

By analogy with the construction (in the\ninfinite-dimensional white-noise space) of the latter, we introduce two\nprocesses defined by means of Hadamard-type fractional operators. When used to\nreplace the time derivative in the governing p.d.e.'s, the Hadamard-type\nderivatives are usually associated with ultra-slow diffusions. On the other\nhand, in our construction, they directly determine the memory properties of the\nso-called Hadamard fractional Brownian motion (H-fBm) and its long-time\nbehaviour. Still, for any finite time horizon, the H-fBm displays a standard\ndiffusing feature. We then extend the definition of the H-fBm from the white\nnoise space to an infinite dimensional grey-noise space built on the Le Roy\nmeasure, so that our model represents an alternative to the generalized grey\nBrownian motion. In this case, we prove that the one-dimensional distribution\nof the process satisfies a heat equation with non-constant coefficients and\nfractional Hadamard time-derivative.

While the experimental trends are\nencouraging, the recombination parameters estimated through extensive\ncurve-fitting of photoluminescence (PL) transients are often not amenable to\nreasonable interpretations. In view of the same, through a detailed analysis of\nfree carrier - exciton dynamics in perovskite optoelectronic materials, here we\nidentify a coherent scheme to unambiguously back extract the relevant\nparameters. The model predictions compare well with the recent experimental\nresults on perovskite LEDs with record EQE thus quantifying the role of\nexcitons.

Essentially, an\neffective descent morphism enables bundles over its codomain to be fully\ndescribed as bundles over its domain endowed with additional algebraic\nstructure, called descent data. Like the study of epimorphisms, studying\neffective descent morphisms is interesting in its own right, providing deeper\ninsights into the category under consideration. Moreover, studying these\nmorphisms is part of the foundations of several applications of descent theory,\nnotably including Janelidze-Galois theory, also known as categorical Galois\ntheory.\n  Traditionally, the study of effective descent morphisms has focused on\ninvestigating and exploiting the reflection properties of certain functors. In\ncontrast, we introduce a novel approach by establishing general results on the\npreservation of effective descent morphisms. We demonstrate that these\npreservation results enhance the toolkit for studying such morphisms, by\nobserving that all Grothendieck (op)fibrations satisfying mild conditions fit\nour framework. To illustrate these findings, we provide several examples of\nGrothendieck (op)fibrations that preserve effective descent morphisms,\nincluding topological functors and other forgetful functors of significant\ninterest in the literature.",

Recent studies have shown that LLMs still struggle to critically\nanalyse RAG-based in-context information, a limitation that may lead to\nincorrect inferences and hallucinations. In this paper, we investigate how to\nelicit critical reasoning in RAG via contrastive explanations.

    "abstract": "Identifying stars belonging to different classes is vital in order to build\nup statistical samples of different phases and pathways of stellar evolution.\nIn the era of surveys covering billions of stars, an automated method of\nidentifying these classes becomes necessary. Many classes of stars are\nidentified based on their emitted spectra. In this paper, we use a combination\nof the multi-class multi-label Machine Learning (ML) method XGBoost and the\nPySSED spectral-energy-distribution fitting algorithm to classify stars into\nnine different classes, based on their photometric data. The classifier is\ntrained on subsets of the SIMBAD database. Particular challenges are the very\nhigh sparsity (large fraction of missing values) of the underlying data as well\nas the high class imbalance. We discuss the different variables available, such\nas photometric measurements on the one hand, and indirect predictors such as\nGalactic position on the other hand. We show the difference in performance when\nexcluding certain variables, and discuss in which contexts which of the\nvariables should be used. Finally, we show that increasing the number of\nsamples of a particular type of star significantly increases the performance of\nthe model for that particular type, while having little to no impact on other\ntypes. The accuracy of the main classifier is ~0.7 with a macro F1 score of\n0.61. While the current accuracy of the classifier is not high enough to be\nreliably used in stellar classification, this work is an initial proof of\nfeasibility for using ML to classify stars based on photometry.",

Charge transfer insulators, such\nas ReNiO3 (where Re represents rare earth metals like Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu...), form\na family of PCMs with tunable metal-insulator transition (MIT) temperatures\nacross a broad range.

EuNiO3, in particular, is an attractive choice for\noscillator devices given its bulk transition temperature (TMI) of approximately\n190{\\deg}C, which is well above room temperature, reducing crosstalk issues\nwhile remaining low enough to support energy-efficient applications. We\ndemonstrate a method to stabilize high-quality epitaxial EuNiO3 thin films\nthrough scalable reactive RF sputtering and post-annealing, optimizing oxygen\npartial pressures and annealing temperatures across two substrates. Growth at\nlow or zero oxygen partial pressures resulted in amorphous samples, while\nhigher pressures improved crystallinity but led to the stabilization of\nRuddlesden-Popper (RP) phases [An+1BnO3n+1] and associated faults.\nPost-annealing enhanced crystallinity in all samples, transforming RP phases\nand faults toward the perovskite phase.\n  We conducted operando XRD and transport measurements on our films, finding\nthe transition temperatures of perovskite phase samples grown on LAO and LSAT\nto be approximately 300{\\deg}C and 250{\\deg}C, respectively. We attribute the\nincrease in TMI for LAO samples to in-plane compressive strain (-0.76%), which\nreduces the Ni-O-Ni bond angles in-plane. Similarly, LSAT samples experience\nin-plane tensile strain (2.1%), which decreases out-of-plane Ni-O-Ni bond\nangles, increasing TMI compared to bulk.

However, existing\nretargeting methods often struggle to balance the preservation of key semantics\nand image quality, resulting in either deformation or loss of important\nobjects, or the introduction of local artifacts such as discontinuous pixels\nand inconsistent regenerated content. To address these issues, we propose a\ncontent-aware retargeting method called PruneRepaint. It incorporates semantic\nimportance for each pixel to guide the identification of regions that need to\nbe pruned or preserved in order to maintain key semantics. Additionally, we\nintroduce an adaptive repainting module that selects image regions for\nrepainting based on the distribution of pruned pixels and the proportion\nbetween foreground size and target aspect ratio, thus achieving local\nsmoothness after pruning. By focusing on the content and structure of the\nforeground, our PruneRepaint approach adaptively avoids key content loss and\ndeformation, while effectively mitigating artifacts with local repainting. We\nconduct experiments on the public RetargetMe benchmark and demonstrate through\nobjective experimental results and subjective user studies that our method\noutperforms previous approaches in terms of preserving semantics and\naesthetics, as well as better generalization across diverse aspect ratios.\nCodes will be available at https://github.com/fhshen2022/PruneRepaint.",

We exploit future observations\nof stars at the Galactic Center, orbiting the supermassive black hole\nSagittarius A*, to forecast the ability to constrain the first-order PPN\nparameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$. We have generated a mock catalog of\nastrometric and spectroscopic data for S2, based on the Schwarzschild metric,\nsimulating observations over multiple orbital periods with the GRAVITY and\nSINFONI instruments. Our analysis includes the effects of relativistic orbital\nprecession and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity gravitational redshift. Since\nfuture data for S2 can provide constraints only on a linear combination of the\nPPN parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ we also analyzed the impact of future\nobservations of the gravitational lensing for stars that pass closer in the sky\nto Sgr A*, like the known star S62, which can potentially provide tight\nconstraints on the parameter $\\gamma$, that alone regulates the amplitude of\nthe astrometric deviations due to lensing.

By jointly learning both outputs, DAVINCI\nminimizes error accumulation and enhances the performance of constrained CAD\nsketch inference. Notably, DAVINCI achieves state-of-the-art results on the\nlarge-scale SketchGraphs dataset, demonstrating effectiveness on both precise\nand hand-drawn raster CAD sketches. To reduce DAVINCI's reliance on large-scale\nannotated datasets, we explore the efficacy of CAD sketch augmentations. We\nintroduce Constraint-Preserving Transformations (CPTs), i.e. random\npermutations of the parametric primitives of a CAD sketch that preserve its\nconstraints. This data augmentation strategy allows DAVINCI to achieve\nreasonable performance when trained with only 0.1% of the SketchGraphs dataset.\nFurthermore, this work contributes a new version of SketchGraphs, augmented\nwith CPTs. The newly introduced CPTSketchGraphs dataset includes 80 million\nCPT-augmented sketches, thus providing a rich resource for future research in\nthe CAD sketch domain.",

The results clarify the connection\nbetween inhomogeneous medium scattering and obstacle scattering for acoustic\nwaves, providing a clear criterion for identifying the boundary conditions of\nacoustic obstacles in practice. The contributions of this paper are twofold.\nFirst, we provide a rigorous mathematical characterization of the classical\nsound-hard and sound-soft obstacle scattering models. We demonstrate that a\nsound-hard obstacle can be viewed as an inhomogeneous medium inclusion with\ninfinite mass density, while a sound-soft obstacle corresponds to an inclusion\nwith zero mass density and zero bulk modulus.

Their\nclose connection to various other models (e.g., PDAs, Vector Addition Systems,\nand Counter Automata) make them an attractive modeling tool. The two-way\nvariant of OCNs (2-OCNs) was introduced in the 1980's and shown to be more\nexpressive than OCNs, so much so that the emptiness problem is undecidable\nalready in the deterministic model (2-DOCNs). In a first part, we study the\nemptiness problem of natural restrictions of 2-OCNs, under the light of modern\nresults about Vector Addition System with States (VASS). We show that emptiness\nis decidable for 2-OCNs over \\emph{bounded languages} i.e., languages contained\nin $a_1^*a_2^*\\cdots a_k^*$), and decidable and Ackermann-complete for\n\\emph{sweeping} 2-OCNs, where the head direction only changes at the\nend-markers. Both decidability results revolve around reducing the problem to\nVASS reachability, but they rely on strikingly different approaches.\n  In a second part, we study the expressive power of 2-OCNs, showing an array\nof connections between bounded languages, sweeping 2-OCNs, and semilinear\nlanguages. Most noteworthy among these connections, is that the bounded\nlanguages recognized by sweeping 2-OCNs are precisely those that are\nsemilinear. Finally, we establish an intricate pumping lemma for 2-DOCNs and\nuse it to show that there are OCN languages that are not 2-DOCN recognizable,\nimproving on the known result that there are such 2-OCN languages.",

Most existing algorithms only perform pixel-level or\nfeature-level fusion from different modalities in the spatial domain.

To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper proposes an efficient Spatial-Frequency Domain Fusion\n(SFDFusion) network for infrared and visible image fusion. First, we propose a\nDual-Modality Refinement Module (DMRM) to extract complementary information.\nThis module extracts useful information from both the infrared and visible\nmodalities in the spatial domain and enhances fine-grained spatial details.\nNext, to introduce frequency domain information, we construct a Frequency\nDomain Fusion Module (FDFM) that transforms the spatial domain to the frequency\ndomain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and then integrates frequency\ndomain information. Additionally, we design a frequency domain fusion loss to\nprovide guidance for the fusion process. Extensive experiments on public\ndatasets demonstrate that our method produces fused images with significant\nadvantages in various fusion metrics and visual effects. Furthermore, our\nmethod demonstrates high efficiency in image fusion and good performance on\ndownstream detection tasks, thereby satisfying the real-time demands of\nadvanced visual tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly improved\nperformance in super-resolution (SR) tasks. However, previous research often\noverlooks the fundamental differences between SR and general image generation.\nGeneral image generation involves creating images from scratch, while SR\nfocuses specifically on enhancing existing low-resolution (LR) images by adding\ntypically missing high-frequency details. This oversight not only increases the\ntraining difficulty but also limits their inference efficiency. Furthermore,\nprevious diffusion-based SR methods are typically trained and inferred at fixed\ninteger scale factors, lacking flexibility to meet the needs of up-sampling\nwith non-integer scale factors. To address these issues, this paper proposes an\nefficient and elastic diffusion-based SR model (E$^2$DiffSR), specially\ndesigned for continuous-scale SR in remote sensing imagery. E$^2$DiffSR employs\na two-stage latent diffusion paradigm. During the first stage, an autoencoder\nis trained to capture the differential priors between high-resolution (HR) and\nLR images. The encoder intentionally ignores the existing LR content to\nalleviate the encoding burden, while the decoder introduces an SR branch\nequipped with a continuous scale upsampling module to accomplish the\nreconstruction under the guidance of the differential prior. In the second\nstage, a conditional diffusion model is learned within the latent space to\npredict the true differential prior encoding. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat E$^2$DiffSR achieves superior objective metrics and visual quality\ncompared to the state-of-the-art SR methods. Additionally, it reduces the\ninference time of diffusion-based SR methods to a level comparable to that of\nnon-diffusion methods.",

However, spatial symmetry, which\nserves as a significant inductive bias, is often not optimally harnessed in the\ndesign process. This oversight tends to result in crystals with lower symmetry,\npotentially limiting the practical applications of certain functional\nmaterials. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLICES-PLUS, an enhanced variant of\nSLICES that emphasizes spatial symmetry. Our experiments in classification and\ngeneration have shown that SLICES-PLUS exhibits greater sensitivity and\nrobustness in learning crystal symmetries compared to the original SLICES.\nFurthermore, by integrating SLICES-PLUS with a customized MatterGPT model, we\nhave demonstrated its exceptional capability to target specific physical\nproperties and crystal systems with precision. Finally, we explore\nautoregressive generation towards multiple elastic properties in few-shot\nlearning. Our research represents a significant step forward in the realm of\ncomputational materials discovery.",

Existing benchmarks have two limitations - data leakage and lack\nof domain-specific evaluation. The former hurts the fairness of benchmarks, and\nthe latter hinders practitioners from selecting superior LLMs for specific\nprogramming domains. To address these two limitations, we propose a new\nbenchmark - EvoCodeBench, which has the following advances: (1) Evolving data.\nEvoCodeBench will be dynamically updated every period (e.g., 6 months) to avoid\ndata leakage. This paper releases the first version - EvoCodeBench-2403,\ncontaining 275 samples from 25 repositories. (2) A domain taxonomy and domain\nlabels. Based on the statistics of open-source communities, we design a\nprogramming domain taxonomy consisting of 10 popular domains. Based on the\ntaxonomy, we annotate each sample in EvoCodeBench with a domain label. (3)\nDomain-specific evaluations. Besides the Pass@k, we compute the Domain-Specific\nImprovement (DSI) and define LLMs' comfort and strange domains. These\nevaluations help practitioners select superior LLMs in specific domains and\ndiscover the shortcomings of existing LLMs. We evaluate 8 popular LLMs (e.g.,\ngpt-4, DeepSeek Coder) on EvoCodeBench and summarize some insights.\nEvoCodeBench reveals the actual abilities of these LLMs in real-world\nrepositories. For example, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-4 on EvoCodeBench-2403 is\nonly 20.74%. Besides, we evaluate LLMs in different domains and discover their\ncomfort and strange domains. For example, gpt-4 performs best in most domains\nbut falls behind others in the Internet domain. StarCoder 2-15B unexpectedly\nperforms well in the Database domain and even outperforms 33B LLMs.\nEvoCodeBench has been released.",

Naively, one would predict that the larger the violation, the\ngreater the adaptation. However, experiments reveal that when violations are\nextreme, individuals are more likely to hold on to their prior expectations\nrather than adjust them. To address this puzzle, we tested the adaptation of\nartificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of relational learning and found a\nsimilar phenomenon: Standard learning dynamics dictates that small violations\nwould lead to adjustments of expected relations while larger ones would be\nresolved using a different mechanism -- a change in object representation that\nbypasses the need for adaptation of the relational expectations.

    "abstract": "Researchers in empirical machine learning recently spotlighted their fears of\nso-called Model Collapse. They imagined a discard workflow, where an initial\ngenerative model is trained with real data, after which the real data are\ndiscarded, and subsequently, the model generates synthetic data on which a new\nmodel is trained. They came to the conclusion that models degenerate as\nmodel-fitting generations proceed. However, other researchers considered an\naugment workflow, where the original real data continue to be used in each\ngeneration of training, augmented by synthetic data from models fit in all\nearlier generations. Empirical results on canonical datasets and learning\nprocedures confirmed the occurrence of model collapse under the discard\nworkflow and avoidance of model collapse under the augment workflow. Under the\naugment workflow, theoretical evidence also confirmed avoidance in particular\ninstances; specifically, Gerstgrasser et al. (2024) found that for classical\nLinear Regression, test risk at any later generation is bounded by a moderate\nmultiple, viz. pi-squared-over-6 of the test risk of training with the original\nreal data alone. Some commentators questioned the generality of theoretical\nconclusions based on the generative model assumed in Gerstgrasser et al.\n(2024): could similar conclusions be reached for other task/model pairings? In\nthis work, we demonstrate the universality of the pi-squared-over-6 augment\nrisk bound across a large family of canonical statistical models, offering key\ninsights into exactly why collapse happens under the discard workflow and is\navoided under the augment workflow. In the process, we provide a framework that\nis able to accommodate a large variety of workflows (beyond discard and\naugment), thereby enabling an experimenter to judge the comparative merits of\nmultiple different workflows by simulating a simple Gaussian process.",

    "abstract": "Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the most popular\nmathematical formulations with numerous applications. In practice, improving\nthe performance of MILP solvers often requires a large amount of high-quality\ndata, which can be challenging to collect. Researchers thus turn to generation\ntechniques to generate additional MILP instances. However, existing approaches\ndo not take into account specific block structures -- which are closely related\nto the problem formulations -- in the constraint coefficient matrices (CCMs) of\nMILPs. Consequently, they are prone to generate computationally trivial or\ninfeasible instances due to the disruptions of block structures and thus\nproblem formulations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel MILP\ngeneration framework, called Block Structure Decomposition (MILP-StuDio), to\ngenerate high-quality instances by preserving the block structures.\nSpecifically, MILP-StuDio begins by identifying the blocks in CCMs and\ndecomposing the instances into block units, which serve as the building blocks\nof MILP instances. We then design three operators to construct new instances by\nremoving, substituting, and appending block units in the original instances,\nenabling us to generate instances with flexible sizes. An appealing feature of\nMILP-StuDio is its strong ability to preserve the feasibility and computational\nhardness of the generated instances. Experiments on the commonly-used\nbenchmarks demonstrate that using instances generated by MILP-StuDio is able to\nsignificantly reduce over 10% of the solving time for learning-based solvers.",

A standard approach to this task is to\nuse neural beamforming that can work efficiently in an online manner.

The performance of such a supervised approach, however, is\ndrastically degraded under mismatched conditions. This calls for run-time\nadaptation of the DNN. Although the ground-truth speech spectrogram required\nfor adaptation is not available at run time, blind dereverberation and\nseparation methods such as weighted prediction error (WPE) and fast\nmultichannel nonnegative matrix factorization (FastMNMF) can be used for\ngenerating pseudo groundtruth data from a mixture.

In this\nletter, we employ reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to address this\nissue and investigate how large the surface should be to ensure a better\nperformance for DP MIMO. Specifically, we first derive the capacities of DP and\nSP MIMO systems with an RIS, and then study the influence of the RIS size on\nthe system capacity. Our analyses reveal how to deploy the RIS in a DP MIMO\nscenario.",

    "abstract": "(Partial) differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental tools for describing\nnatural phenomena, making their solution crucial in science and engineering.\nWhile traditional methods, such as the finite element method, provide reliable\nsolutions, their accuracy is often tied to the use of computationally intensive\nfine meshes. Moreover, they do not naturally account for measurements or prior\nsolutions, and any change in the problem parameters requires results to be\nfully recomputed. Neural network-based approaches, such as physics-informed\nneural networks and neural operators, offer a mesh-free alternative by directly\nfitting those models to the PDE solution. They can also integrate prior\nknowledge and tackle entire families of PDEs by simply aggregating additional\ntraining losses. Nevertheless, they are highly sensitive to hyperparameters\nsuch as collocation points and the weights associated with each loss. This\npaper addresses these challenges by developing a science-constrained learning\n(SCL) framework. It demonstrates that finding a (weak) solution of a PDE is\nequivalent to solving a constrained learning problem with worst-case losses.\nThis explains the limitations of previous methods that minimize the expected\nvalue of aggregated losses. SCL also organically integrates structural\nconstraints (e.g., invariances) and (partial) measurements or known solutions.\nThe resulting constrained learning problems can be tackled using a practical\nalgorithm that yields accurate solutions across a variety of PDEs, neural\nnetwork architectures, and prior knowledge levels without extensive\nhyperparameter tuning and sometimes even at a lower computational cost.",

So far, only eight PNe have been confirmed to show OH and/or H$_2$O maser\nemission, and none has ever been found to show SiO maser emission. We intend to\nobtain the first detection of a SiO maser from a PNe. Such a detection would\nprovide us with a useful tool to probe mass-loss in PNe at a scales of a few AU\nfrom the central star, much shorter than the scales traced by H$_2$ or OH\nmasers. We compiled two different samples. The first one comprises all known\nPNe with confirmed OH and/or H$_2$O maser emission, as well as two candidate\nPNe showing OH masers. For the second sample we compiled single-dish SiO maser\ndetections in the literature, and compared them with catalogs of PNe and radio\ncontinuum emission (which could trace photoionized gas in a PNe). We identified\nfive targets (either PN or radio continuum sources) within the beam of the\nsingle-dish SiO maser observations. We then carried out interferometric\nobservations of both samples with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, to\nconfirm the spatial association between continuum and SiO maser emission. We\nfound no SiO maser emission associated with any confirmed or candidate PN. In\nall targets, except IRAS 17390$-$3014, there is no spatial coincidence between\nSiO masers and radio continuum emission.

This is particularly important in 6G-enabled Internet of Things\n(6G-IoT) scenarios, where bandwidth constraints, latency requirements, and data\nprivacy are critical. However, existing methods struggle to fully disentangle\ntask-relevant and task-irrelevant information, leading to privacy concerns and\nsuboptimal performance. To address this, we propose an information-bottleneck\ninspired method, named CLAD (contrastive learning and adversarial\ndisentanglement). CLAD utilizes contrastive learning to effectively capture\ntask-relevant features while employing adversarial disentanglement to discard\ntask-irrelevant information. Additionally, due to the absence of reliable and\nreproducible methods to quantify the minimality of encoded feature vectors, we\nintroduce the Information Retention Index (IRI), a comparative metric used as a\nproxy for the mutual information between the encoded features and the input.\nThe IRI reflects how minimal and informative the representation is, making it\nhighly relevant for privacy-preserving and bandwidth-efficient 6G-IoT systems.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CLAD outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines in terms of semantic extraction, task performance, privacy\npreservation, and IRI, making it a promising building block for responsible,\nefficient and trustworthy 6G-IoT services.",

The\nzero-energy QMBSs widely exist across various systems due to the intertwining\nof chiral symmetry and spatial inversion symmetry. In this work, we study the\nphenomenology of the zero-energy QMBS under the interplay between the chiral\nsymmetry and pseudo HSF, where the Hilbert space is approximately fragmented\ninto different blocks. We consider a model of tilted chain of interacting\nspinless fermions with periodically varying tunneling strength. At small\ntunneling strength and under resonance condition, the system is described by an\neffective model with chiral symmetry and pseudo HSF. We find that the interplay\nbetween the two gives rise to a highly localized zero-energy QMBS when the\nparticle number is even. We identify a simple product state to signalize the\nzero-energy QMBS, which gives rise to unusual scarred dynamics. The fidelity\noscillates around a fixed value without decaying instead of showing the usual\ncollapse and revival in common scarred systems.

    "abstract": "We theoretically propose a mechanism to realize the superconducting diode\neffect (SDE): The current can generate a magnetic field, affecting the magnetic\nmoment of magnetic impurity. When the connection region of the Josephson\njunction is coupled with the magnetic impurity, the supercurrents in positive\nand negative directions have different influences on the magnetic moment. This\nresults in a phenomenon that the critical supercurrents in these opposite\ndirections are unequal, which is called SDE. We model the Josephson connection\nregion by a quantum dot. Then the critical supercurrents are investigated by\nthe non-equilibrium Green's function method, and we carry out a detailed\nsymmetry analysis on the supercurrent relations. The calculation results\nconfirm that the SDE does exist in this system. Besides, the SDE is significant\nin a wide parameter space and can be effectively adjusted in various ways. Our\ndesign only demands a magnetic impurity and conventional superconductors. The\nunconventional finite-momentum Cooper pair and spin-orbit coupling are not\nrequired, and there is also no need for the existence of chirality or an\nexternal magnetic field. Our work provides a universal device structure for the\ndevelopment of superconducting electronics.",

    "abstract": "We introduce deterministic suffix-reading automata (DSA), a new automaton\nmodel over finite words. Transitions in a DSA are labeled with words. From a\nstate, a DSA triggers an outgoing transition on seeing a word ending with the\ntransition's label. Therefore, rather than moving along an input word letter by\nletter, a DSA can jump along blocks of letters, with each block ending in a\nsuitable suffix. This feature allows DSAs to recognize regular languages more\nconcisely, compared to DFAs. In this work, we focus on questions around finding\na \"minimal\" DSA for a regular language. The number of states is not a faithful\nmeasure of the size of a DSA, since the transition-labels contain strings of\narbitrary length. Hence, we consider total-size (number of states + number of\nedges + total length of transition-labels) as the size measure of DSAs.\n  We start by formally defining the model and providing a DSA-to-DFA conversion\nthat allows to compare the expressiveness and succinctness of DSA with related\nautomata models. Our main technical contribution is a method to derive DSAs\nfrom a given DFA: a DFA-to-DSA conversion. We make a surprising observation\nthat the smallest DSA derived from the canonical DFA of a regular language L\nneed not be a minimal DSA for L. This observation leads to a fundamental\nbottleneck in deriving a minimal DSA for a regular language. In fact, we prove\nthat given a DFA and a number k, the problem of deciding if there exists an\nequivalent DSA of total-size at most k is NP-complete.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of reactive systems aims for the automated construction of\nstrategies for systems that interact with their environment. Whereas the\nsynthesis approach has the potential to change the development of reactive\nsystems significantly due to the avoidance of manual implementation, it still\nsuffers from a lack of efficient synthesis algorithms for many application\nscenarios. The translation of the system specification into an automaton that\nallows for strategy construction is nonelementary in the length of the\nspecification in S1S and double exponential for LTL, raising the need of highly\nspecialized algorithms. In this paper, we present an approach on how to reduce\nthis state space explosion in the construction of this automaton by exploiting\na monotony property of specifications. For this, we introduce window counting\nconstraints that allow for step-wise refinement or abstraction of\nspecifications. In an iterating synthesis procedure, those window counting\nconstraints are used to construct automata representing over- or\nunder-approximations (depending on the counting constraint) of\nconstraint-compliant behavior. Analysis results on winning regions of previous\niterations are used to reduce the size of the next automaton, leading to an\noverall reduction of the state space explosion extend. We present the\nimplementation results of the iterated synthesis for a zero-sum game setting as\nproof of concept. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations of the\napproach in a zero-sum setting and sketch future work in non-zero-sum settings.",

    "abstract": "Matter composed of hyperons has been hypothesized to occur in neutron stars\nat densities slightly above the nuclear saturation density and in many\ndescriptions gives rise to a significant softening in the equation of state\n(EoS). This softening would be at odds with the constraints from neutron star\nobservations and ab initio nuclear matter computations at low density. This\ninconsistency is known as the hyperon puzzle. We show that Quarkyonic Matter\nmodels, which take into account the quark substructure of baryons, can mitigate\nthe hyperon puzzle. We demonstrate two important consequences of the quark\nsubstructure effects. First, the hyperon threshold is shifted to a higher\ndensity as neutrons preoccupy the phase space for down quarks, preventing the\nemergence of hyperons at low energy. Secondly, the softening in the EoS becomes\nmild even above the hyperon threshold density because only little phase space\nis available for low-energy hyperons; increasing hyperon density quickly drives\nhyperons into the relativistic regime. In this work, we illustrate these two\neffects for a matter composed of charge-neutral baryons, using the ideal dual\nQuarkyonic (IdylliQ) model for three flavors. This model incorporates the\nQuarkyonic duality and allows us to manifestly express the quark Pauli blocking\nconstraints in terms of the baryon occupation probability.

    "abstract": "Kernel embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool for representing\nprobability measures in a variety of statistical inference problems. By mapping\nprobability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), kernel\nembeddings enable flexible representations of complex relationships between\nvariables. They serve as a mechanism for efficiently transferring the\nrepresentation of a distribution downstream to other tasks, such as hypothesis\ntesting or causal effect estimation. In the context of causal inference, the\nmain challenges include identifying causal associations and estimating the\naverage treatment effect from observational data, where confounding variables\nmay obscure direct cause-and-effect relationships. Kernel embeddings provide a\nrobust nonparametric framework for addressing these challenges. They allow for\nthe representations of distributions of observational data and their seamless\ntransformation into representations of interventional distributions to estimate\nrelevant causal quantities. We overview recent research that leverages the\nexpressiveness of kernel embeddings in tandem with causal inference.",

Combining IL with Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) by adding KL divergence between RL and IL policy to the RL loss\ncan alleviate IL's weakness but suffer from over-conservation caused by\ncovariate shift of IL.

The optimal subsampling probabilities\nare derived through the L-optimality criterion, which minimizes the trace of\nthe product of the asymptotic covariance matrix and a constant matrix.\nEfficient algorithms are proposed to implement the proposed subsampling methods\nto address the challenge that optimal subsampling strategy depends on unknown\nparameter estimation from full data.

Binary\nclassification faces no such barrier for learnability, but a similar one for\noptimal learning, which can in general only be achieved by improper learners.\nFortunately, recent advances in binary classification have demonstrated that\nthis requirement can be satisfied using aggregations of proper learners, some\nof which are strikingly simple. This raises a natural question: to what extent\ncan simple aggregations of proper learners overcome the properness barrier in\nmulticlass classification?\n  We give a positive answer to this question for classes which have finite\nGraph dimension, $d_G$. Namely, we demonstrate that the optimal binary learners\nof Hanneke, Larsen, and Aden-Ali et al. (appropriately generalized to the\nmulticlass setting) achieve sample complexity $O\\left(\\frac{d_G + \\ln(1 /\n\\delta)}{\\epsilon}\\right)$. This forms a strict improvement upon the sample\ncomplexity of ERM. We complement this with a lower bound demonstrating that for\ncertain classes of Graph dimension $d_G$, majorities of ERM learners require\n$\\Omega \\left( \\frac{d_G + \\ln(1 / \\delta)}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ samples.\nFurthermore, we show that a single ERM requires $\\Omega \\left(\\frac{d_G \\ln(1 /\n\\epsilon) + \\ln(1 / \\delta)}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ samples on such classes,\nexceeding the lower bound of Daniely et al. (2015) by a factor of $\\ln(1 /\n\\epsilon)$. For multiclass learning in full generality -- i.e., for classes of\nfinite DS dimension but possibly infinite Graph dimension -- we give a strong\nrefutation to these learning strategies, by exhibiting a learnable class which\ncannot be learned to constant error by any aggregation of a finite number of\nproper learners.",

Although the solution to the relaxed SDP problem cannot\ndirectly solve the original problem, it offers valuable insights for further\nrefinement.

To bridge this\nresearch gap, we conducted a formative study including a survey (n=46),\nsemi-structured interviews (n=20), and a diary study (n=10) with cancer\nsurvivors. Our results revealed a wide range of impairments experienced by\ncancer survivors, including chemo brain, neuropathy, and visual impairments.\nCancer survivors heavily relied on software for socialization, health purposes,\nand cancer advocacy, but their impairments made software use more challenging\nfor them. Based on the results, we offer a set of accessibility guidelines that\nsoftware designers can utilize when creating applications for cancer survivors.\nFurther, we suggest design features for inclusion, such as health resources,\nsocialization tools, and games, tailored to the needs of cancer survivors.

Consequently, multi-task learning has become an\nintegral part of their ranking systems. However, existing multi-task learning\nmethods encounter two main challenges: some lack explicit modeling of task\nrelationships, resulting in inferior performance, while others have limited\napplicability due to being computationally intensive, having scalability\nissues, or relying on strong assumptions. To address these limitations and\nbetter fit our real-world scenario, pre-rank in Shopee Search, we introduce in\nthis paper ResFlow, a lightweight multi-task learning framework that enables\nefficient cross-task information sharing via residual connections between\ncorresponding layers of task networks. Extensive experiments on datasets from\nvarious scenarios and modalities demonstrate its superior performance and\nadaptability over state-of-the-art methods. The online A/B tests in Shopee\nSearch showcase its practical value in large-scale industrial applications,\nevidenced by a 1.29% increase in OPU (order-per-user) without additional system\nlatency. ResFlow is now fully deployed in the pre-rank module of Shopee Search.\nTo facilitate efficient online deployment, we propose a novel offline metric\nWeighted Recall@K, which aligns well with our online metric OPU, addressing the\nlongstanding online-offline metric misalignment issue. Besides, we propose to\nfuse scores from the multiple tasks additively when ranking items, which\noutperforms traditional multiplicative fusion.

The exact formation process for this\nabundant planet population has not yet been fully constrained. Aims. Recent\nstudies on the formation of these planets make various assumptions with regard\nto the disk. The primary mass budget, held in pebbles, is either assumed to\nhave a constant size or is parametrized as a flux. Simplifications of the\ntemperature structure, in the form of a static power law, do not consider the\ntemperature evolution and high magnitudes of heating in the inner part of the\ndisk. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect these simplifications of\ntemperature and pebble sizes have on the pebble densities and resulting planet\npopulations. Methods. To constrain the timescales needed to form super-Earths,\nwe developed a model for exploring a large parameter space. We included the\neffect of two different temperature prescriptions on a viscously accreting and\nspreading disk. We formed a pebble reservoir utilizing a simplified conversion\ntimescale with a time- and radially dependent Stokes number for the dust. We\nthen tracked the temporal evolution of the surface densities of gas, dust, and\npebbles. Pebbles were allowed to drift and be accreted onto a growing\nprotoplanet. As a planet grows, it exerts a torque on the disk, carving out a\ngap and affecting the pebble drift, before halting the growth of the planet.",

However, this transition is absent in its isostructural sister\ncompound BaCo$_2$Al$_9$. Consequently, an intriguing question arises as to the\nunderlying factors that differentiate BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ from BaCo$_2$Al$_9$ and\ndrive the CDW transition in BaFe$_2$Al$_9$. Here, we set out to address this\nquestion by conducting a comparative \\emph{ab initio} study of the electronic\nstructures, lattice dynamics, \\textcolor{black}{and electron-phonon\ninteractions} of their high-temperature phases. We find that both compounds are\ndynamically stable with similar phonon dispersions. The electronic structure\ncalculations reveal that both compounds are nonmagnetic metals; however, they\nexhibit distinct band structures around the Fermi level. In particular,\nBaFe$_2$Al$_9$ exhibits a higher density of states at the Fermi level with\ndominant partially filled Fe-$3d$ states and a more intricate Fermi surface.\nThis leads to an electronic instability of BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ toward the CDW\ntransition, which is manifested by the diverged electronic susceptibility at\nthe CDW wave vector $\\mathbf{q}_{\\rm CDW}$=(0.5, 0, 0.3), observable in both\nthe real and imaginary parts. Conversely, BaCo$_2$Al$_9$ does not display such\nbehavior, aligning well with experimental observations. Although the\nelectron-phonon interactions in BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ surpass those in BaCo$_2$Al$_9$\nby two orders of magnitude, the strength is relatively weak at the CDW wave\nvector, suggesting that the CDW in BaFe$_2$Al$_9$ is primarily driven by\nelectronic factors.",

We propose two naive\nOBD objectives, DBC and PBC, which measure distillation performance via the\ndecision difference between policies trained on distilled data and either\noffline data or a near-expert policy.

    "abstract": "Recent experiments suggest a new paradigm towards novel colossal\nmagnetoresistance (CMR) in a family of materials EuM$_2$X$_2$(M=Cd, In, Zn;\nX=P, As), distinct from the traditional avenues involving Kondo-RKKY\ncrossovers, magnetic phase transitions with structural distortions, or\ntopological phase transitions. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to\nexplore their origin, particularly focusing on EuCd$_2$P$_2$. While the\nlow-energy spectral weight royally tracks that of the resistivity anomaly near\nthe temperature with maximum magnetoresistance (T$_{MR}$) as expected from\ntransport-spectroscopy correspondence, the spectra are completely incoherent\nand strongly suppressed with no hint of a Landau quasiparticle. Using\nsystematic material and temperature dependence investigation complemented by\ntheory, we attribute this non-quasiparticle caricature to the strong presence\nof entangled magnetic and lattice interactions, a characteristic enabled by the\n$p$-$f$ mixing. Given the known presence of ferromagnetic clusters, this\nnaturally points to the origin of CMR being the scattering of spin-polarized\npolarons at the boundaries of ferromagnetic clusters. These results are not\nonly illuminating to investigate the strong correlations and topology in\nEuCd$_2$X$_2$ family, but, in a broader view, exemplify how multiple\ncooperative interactions can give rise to extraordinary behaviors in condensed\nmatter systems.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the convergence rates for the homogenization of\nelliptic equations with lower-order terms under the spectral gap assumption, in\nboth bounded domains and the entire space. Our analysis demonstrates that\nlower-order terms significantly affect the convergence rate, particularly in\nthe full space, where the rate changes from \\(O(\\epsilon)\\) (observed without\nlower-order terms) to \\(O(\\epsilon^{d/({d+2})})\\) due to their influence. In\ncontrast, in bounded domains, the convergence rate remains\n\\(O(\\epsilon^{1/2})\\), as boundary conditions exert a stronger influence than\nthe lower-order terms. To manage the complexities introduced by lower-order\nterms, we developed a novel technique that localizes the analysis within small\ngrids, enabling the application of the Poincar\\'e inequality for effective\nestimates. This work builds upon existing frameworks, offering a refined\napproach to quantitative homogenization with lower-order terms.",

Accurate CD is extremely challenging\nbecause CD is associated with complex relationships and mechanisms among\nstudents, knowledge concepts, studying records, etc. However, existing\napproaches loosely consider these relationships and mechanisms by a\nnon-end-to-end learning framework, resulting in sub-optimal feature extractions\nand fusions for CD. Different from them, this paper innovatively proposes an\nEnd-to-end Graph Neural Networks-based Cognitive Diagnosis (EGNN-CD) model.\nEGNN-CD consists of three main parts: knowledge concept network (KCN), graph\nneural networks-based feature extraction (GNNFE), and cognitive ability\nprediction (CAP). First, KCN constructs CD-related interaction by\ncomprehensively extracting physical information from students, exercises, and\nknowledge concepts. Second, a four-channel GNNFE is designed to extract\nhigh-order and individual features from the constructed KCN. Finally, CAP\nemploys a multi-layer perceptron to fuse the extracted features to predict\nstudents' learning abilities in an end-to-end learning way. With such designs,\nthe feature extractions and fusions are guaranteed to be comprehensive and\noptimal for CD.

Therefore, some third-party service platforms collect different model\ninterfaces and provide cheaper API services and more flexibility in T2I model\nselections. However, this also raises a new security concern: Are these\nthird-party services truly offering the models they claim?\n  To answer this question, we first define the concept of T2I model\nverification, which aims to determine whether a black-box target model is\nidentical to a given white-box reference T2I model. After that, we propose\nVerifyPrompt, which performs T2I model verification through a special designed\nverify prompt. Intuitionally, the verify prompt is an adversarial prompt for\nthe target model without transferability for other models. It makes the target\nmodel generate a specific image while making other models produce entirely\ndifferent images. Specifically, VerifyPrompt utilizes the Non-dominated Sorting\nGenetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to optimize the cosine similarity of a prompt's\ntext encoding, generating verify prompts. Finally, by computing the CLIP-text\nsimilarity scores between the prompts the generated images, VerifyPrompt can\ndetermine whether the target model aligns with the reference model.\nExperimental results demonstrate that VerifyPrompt consistently achieves over\n90\\% accuracy across various T2I models, confirming its effectiveness in\npractical model platforms (such as Hugging Face).",

The prominence propagates non-radially and makes a detour around\nthe large-scale coronal loops in active region NOAA 13243. The northward\ndeflection angle increases from ~36 degrees to ~47 degrees before returning to\n~36 degrees and keeping up. There is no longitudinal deflection throughout the\npropagation. The angular width of the cone increases from ~30 degrees and\nreaches a plateau at ~37 degrees. The heliocentric distance of the prominence\nrises from ~1.1 to ~10.0 solar radii, and the prominence experiences continuous\nacceleration (~51 m/s^2) over two hours, which is probably related to the\nmagnetic reconnection during the C-class flare. The true speed of CME front is\nestimated to be ~829 km/s, which is ~1.2 times larger than that of CME core\n(prominence).

In\nthis letter, we devise a mechanism for establishing a stable DTC with\nperiod-doubling oscillations in an open quantum system that is governed by a\nproperly tailored non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We find a specific class of\nnon-reciprocal couplings in our non-Hermitian dynamics which prevents\nthermalization through eigenstate ordering.

However, existing\nTransformer-based detector-free local feature matching methods encounter\nchallenges due to the quadratic computational complexity of attention\nmechanisms, especially at high resolutions. However, while existing\nTransformer-based detector-free local feature matching methods have reduced\ncomputational costs using linear attention mechanisms, they still struggle to\ncapture detailed local interactions, which affects the accuracy and robustness\nof precise local correspondences. In order to enhance representations of\nattention mechanisms while preserving low computational complexity, we propose\nthe LoFLAT, a novel Local Feature matching using Focused Linear Attention\nTransformer in this paper. Our LoFLAT consists of three main modules: the\nFeature Extraction Module, the Feature Transformer Module, and the Matching\nModule. Specifically, the Feature Extraction Module firstly uses ResNet and a\nFeature Pyramid Network to extract hierarchical features. The Feature\nTransformer Module further employs the Focused Linear Attention to refine\nattention distribution with a focused mapping function and to enhance feature\ndiversity with a depth-wise convolution. Finally, the Matching Module predicts\naccurate and robust matches through a coarse-to-fine strategy. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed LoFLAT outperforms the\nLoFTR method in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.",

In this paper, we introduce a new framework for analyzing the\nasymptotic distribution of estimators for degree tail indices in scale-free\ninhomogeneous random graphs. Our framework leverages the relationship between\nthe large weights and large degrees of Norros-Reittu and Chung-Lu random\ngraphs.

Such alignment of upper-order statistics is then employed to\nestablish the asymptotic normality of three different tail index estimators\nbased on the upper degrees.

    "abstract": "As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding\nhuman preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address\nthis, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human\nchoice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent\ncan use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of\nstates and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined\nby the partial return or the cumulative advantage.\n  We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return,\nwhich adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of\nthe bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike\npartial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs\nabout the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from\nchoices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct,\ndoing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not.\n  To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an\nAlignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of\npreferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This\nensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based\non bootstrapped return.\n  The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice\nbehavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a\nbootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds\nwith choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both\nadhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other\nhand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return\nor cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward\nfunction.",

Under the quadratic growth assumption, it is known that the\ndual iterates and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) residuals of ALMs applied to\nsemidefinite programs (SDPs) converge linearly. In contrast, the convergence\nrate of the primal iterates has remained elusive. In this paper, we resolve\nthis challenge by establishing new $\\textit{quadratic growth}$ and\n$\\textit{error bound}$ properties for primal and dual SDPs under the strict\ncomplementarity condition. Our main results reveal that both primal and dual\niterates of the ALMs converge linearly contingent solely upon the assumption of\nstrict complementarity and a bounded solution set.

Persistent Homology, a topological data analysis method,\nis employed with two distinct filtration techniques - Vietoris-Rips and graph\nfiltration-for classifying MCI subtypes. For Vietoris-Rips filtration,\ninter-ROI Wasserstein distance matrices between persistent diagrams are used\nfor classification, while graph filtration relies on the top ten most\npersistent homology features. Comparative analysis shows that the Vietoris-Rips\nfiltration significantly outperforms graph filtration, capturing subtle\nvariations in brain connectivity with greater accuracy. The Vietoris-Rips\nfiltration method achieved the highest classification accuracy of 85.7\\% for\ndistinguishing between age and gender matched healthy controls and MCI, whereas\ngraph filtration reached a maximum accuracy of 71.4\\% for the same task. This\nsuperior performance highlights the sensitivity of Vietoris-Rips filtration in\ndetecting intricate topological features associated with neurodegeneration.

Recent research on differentially private machine\nlearning and membership inference has highlighted that with the same\ntheoretical $\\epsilon$ setting, the likelihood-ratio-based membership inference\n(LiRA) attacking success rate (ASR) may vary according to specific datasets and\nmodels, which might be a better indicator for evaluating real-world privacy\nrisks. Inspired by this practical privacy measure, we study the approaches that\ncan lower the attacking success rate to allow for more flexible privacy budget\nsettings in model training. We find that by selectively suppressing\nprivacy-sensitive features, we can achieve lower ASR values without\ncompromising application-specific data utility. We use the SHAP and LIME model\nexplainer to evaluate feature sensitivities and develop feature-masking\nstrategies. Our findings demonstrate that the LiRA $ASR^M$ on model $M$ can\nproperly indicate the inherent privacy risk of a dataset for modeling, and it's\npossible to modify datasets to enable the use of larger theoretical $\\epsilon$\nsettings to achieve equivalent practical privacy protection.

While a few hundred CLAGN are known, a complete sample of\nturn-on CLAGN is still elusive. Here, we present a search for turn-on CLAGN in\na complete sample of galaxies, using archival spectra and recent light curves.\nWe obtained light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System\n(ATLAS) for 16,232 emission line galaxies, including both star-forming and\nactive galaxies, at $z<0.1$ with spectra from the Six-degree Field Galaxy\nSurvey (6dFGS). We first establish typical variability behaviour for different\nAGN types, as recorded between 2001 and 2009, and then select outliers from the\nbulk behaviour as CLAGN candidates. We obtain new spectra for the candidates\nand identify 12 new turn-on CLAGN (appearing broad H$\\beta$ line) and 19 new\nturn-off CLAGN (disappearing broad H$\\beta$ line). We may have missed AGN that\nchanged and reverted their state over the 15$-$20 years since 6dFGS spectra\nwere taken, and thus our CLAGN rates of 1.7$\\%$ for turn-on and 9.6$\\%$ for\nturn-off are lower limits. The turn-on rate is naturally much lower as the type\n1.9/2 sample is dominated by obscured AGN due to orientation, which are not\nexpected to change. However, the number of turn-on (27) and turn-off (24) CLAGN\nwe find are similar, suggesting that our parent AGN sample is reasonably\ncomplete in our search volume at $z<0.1$.",

    "abstract": "Modern web traffic relies on 2048-bit RSA encryption to secure our data in\ntransit. Rapid advances in Quantum Computing pose a grave challenge by allowing\nhackers to break this encryption in hours. In August of 2024, the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology published Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC)\nstandards, including CRYSTALS-Kyber for general encryption and\nCRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+ for digital signatures. Despite this\nproactive approach, the slow adoption of encryption protocols remains a\nconcern, leaving a significant portion of data vulnerable to interception. In\nthis context, this study aims to evaluate the impact of NIST's\nQuantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithms on website response times,\nparticularly focusing on SSL handshake time and total download time under\nvarying network conditions. By assessing the performance of these algorithms,\nthis research seeks to provide empirical evidence and a reusable framework for\nvalidating the efficacy of QSC in real-world scenarios. It was found that the\nQSC algorithms outperformed the classical algorithm under normal and congested\nnetwork conditions. There was also found to be an improvement in the total\ndownload time for larger file sizes, and a better performance by QSC under\nhigher latency and packet loss conditions. Therefore, this study recommends\nthat websites switch to QSC when the standards are ratified.

To balance swath width and resolution, an Instantaneous Geometric Field\nof View (IGFOV) of 2.5 meters is maintained while ensuring a 1.25-meter GSD\nboth along and across track. Along-track sampling is achieved through precise\ntiming, while across-track accuracy is ensured by using two staggered pixel\narrays.

To further boost resolution, the\nsatellite employs super-resolution (SR), combining multiple low-resolution\ncaptures using sub-pixel shifts to produce high-resolution images. This\ntechnique, effective when images contain aliased high-frequency details,\nreconstructs full-resolution imagery using phase information from multiple\nobservations, and has been successfully applied in remote sensing missions like\nSPOT-5, SkySat, and DubaiSat-1.

These applications can significantly impact ethics, economics, and\nhuman behavior, raising serious concerns about trusting ML decisions. Studies\nindicate that conventional metrics are insufficient to build human trust in ML\nmodels. These models often learn spurious correlations and predict based on\nthem. In the real world, their performance can deteriorate significantly. To\navoid this, a common practice is to test whether predictions are reasonable\nbased on valid patterns in the data. Along with this, a challenge known as the\ntrustworthiness oracle problem has been introduced. Due to the lack of\nautomated trustworthiness oracles, the assessment requires manual validation of\nthe decision process disclosed by explanation methods. However, this is\ntime-consuming, error-prone, and unscalable.\n  We propose TOKI, the first automated trustworthiness oracle generation method\nfor text classifiers. TOKI automatically checks whether the words contributing\nthe most to a prediction are semantically related to the predicted class.\nSpecifically, we leverage ML explanations to extract the decision-contributing\nwords and measure their semantic relatedness with the class based on word\nembeddings. We also introduce a novel adversarial attack method that targets\ntrustworthiness vulnerabilities identified by TOKI. To evaluate their alignment\nwith human judgement, experiments are conducted. We compare TOKI with a naive\nbaseline based solely on model confidence and TOKI-guided adversarial attack\nmethod with A2T, a SOTA adversarial attack method. Results show that relying on\nprediction uncertainty cannot effectively distinguish between trustworthy and\nuntrustworthy predictions, TOKI achieves 142% higher accuracy than the naive\nbaseline, and TOKI-guided attack method is more effective with fewer\nperturbations than A2T.",

We argue that the hysteresis q-diagram can be\nwell explained with a recently proposed magnetized accretion disk model. The\nmodel takes into account the saturated magnetic pressure and predicts that the\nstandard Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SSD) has an inner truncation at relatively low\naccretion rates, filled with an optically thin, hot accretion flow that\nresembles the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) inside. Given a\nperturbation of accretion rate, the variation of the truncation radius can be\nderived as a result of thermal equilibrium by comparing the heating and cooling\nrates. We show that the truncation radius displays a hysteresis effect in\nresponse to the variation of mass accretion rate. As a result, the spectral\nhardness due to competition of the soft SSD and hard ADAF components is also\nhysteresis along with the rise and decay of the mass accretion rate or source\nintensity, leading to a q-shaped diagram in the HID.",

This paper introduces\ngeotechnical property estimation from noisy and incomplete data within the\nlabeled random finite set (LRFS) framework. We leverage the ability of the\ngeneralized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter, a fundamental solution for\nmulti-object estimation, to deal with measurement uncertainties from a Bayesian\nperspective. In particular, this work focuses on the similarity between LRFSs\nand big indirect data (BID) in geotechnics as those characteristics resemble\neach other, which enables GLMB filtering to be exploited potentially for\ndata-centric geotechnical engineering.

To assess the impact of space weather on the\npower grid, one needs to calculate the GIC on a national or continental scale.\nIn this study, we developed a smart and parallelized GIC modelling algorithm,\nGraph GIC. This algorithm deploys a graph representing a power grid in a\nsingle-line diagram, in which substations/transformers act as nodes and\ntransmission lines as edges. With these denotations, a power grid and its\nelectric parameters are mathematically represented with an adjacency matrix and\nan admittance matrix. We used sparse matrix and parallelisation techniques to\nexpedite the intensive computation in cases of large-scale power grids. The\nGraph GIC was validated with a benchmark grid, applied to the GIC calculation\nof the 500 kV power grid of Guangdong, China, and conducted preliminary\nanalysis on the grid's susceptibility to geomagnetic storms. The Graph GIC\nalgorithm has the advantage of an intuitive and highly scalable graph\nrepresentation of a power grid at any scale. It achieves high-accuracy\ncalculation and a speedup of about 18 times after parallelisation. This\nalgorithm could be applied to assess the impact of space weather on a power\ngrid up to continental scales and could be incorporated into global space\nweather modelling frameworks.",

    "abstract": "To achieve efficient long-range wireless power transfer (WPT), large antenna\nsystems are necessary spanning lengths of tens to thousands of meters in one\ndimension. This creates an array in the order of at least hundreds of thousands\nto billions of elements. This makes the implementation of beamforming control a\nchallenge. Various works focus on iterative optimization or channel estimation\nto maintain high efficiency in a time-varying environment requiring complex\nprocessing capabilities. A simpler alternative is the both-sides retrodirective\nantenna array (BS-RDAA) system where iterative optimization or channel\nestimation is not required. In a previous study, it was observed that this\nsystem achieves maximum WPT efficiency if the system is marginally stable.\nThus, there is a need to regulate the system to maintain marginal stability\nregardless of the transmission channel conditions. In this paper, we present a\nplant model for the system and design a control system to drive it to marginal\nstability. The result is a WPT implementation that is not dependent on complex\nprocessing capabilities present in other established high efficiency methods.\nWe also confirmed the ability of the proposed design to maintain maximum\nefficiency in a dynamic environment through the results of an electromagnetic\nsimulator and a time domain simulator.",

    "abstract": "Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents\nsignificant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning\nmethods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic\nalgorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local\noptima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time\nefficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is\ninsufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking\ntrajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable\nset analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency.\nSpecifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe\ntrajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the\nspatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner\nto identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in\nlocal optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple\ninitial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method\nis integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation.\nThis method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model\nconstraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while\nensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method\nimproves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing\ntrajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by\n62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.",

By leveraging the\nerror-correcting capability of channel codes we increase the degrees of freedom\nin the transmit signal design, thereby enhancing the overall system\nperformance. We first propose a novel data-dependent precoding framework for\ncoded MISO systems, referred to as channel-coded precoding (CCP), which\nmaximizes the probability that information bits can be correctly recovered by\nthe channel decoder. This proposed CCP framework allows the transmit signals to\nproduce data symbol errors at the users' receivers, as long as the overall\ninformation BER performance can be improved. We develop the CCP framework for\nboth one-bit and multi-bit error-correcting capacity and devise a projected\ngradient-based approach to solve the design problem. We also develop a robust\nCCP framework for the case where knowledge of perfect channel state information\n(CSI) is unavailable at the transmitter, taking into account the effect of both\nnoise and channel estimation errors.

Recently, diffusion denoising bridge models (DDBMs), a new formulation of\ngenerative modeling that builds stochastic processes between fixed data\nendpoints based on a reference diffusion process, have achieved empirical\nsuccess across tasks with coupled data distribution, such as image-to-image\ntranslation. However, DDBM's sampling process typically requires hundreds of\nnetwork evaluations to achieve decent performance, which may impede their\npractical deployment due to high computational demands. In this work, inspired\nby the recent advance of consistency models in DMs, we tackle this problem by\nlearning the consistency function of the probability-flow ordinary differential\nequation (PF-ODE) of DDBMs, which directly predicts the solution at a starting\nstep given any point on the ODE trajectory. Based on a dedicated general-form\nODE solver, we propose two paradigms: consistency bridge distillation and\nconsistency bridge training, which is flexible to apply on DDBMs with broad\ndesign choices.

The most notable finding is that the\nsurface critical temperature $T_{cs}$ can be significantly enhanced relative to\nthe bulk critical temperature $T_{cb}$. In this work, considering a $1D$\nattractive Hubbard model for the half-filling level, we investigate how this\nenhancement is affected by variations in the Debye energy $\\hbar\\omega_D$,\nwhich controls the number of states contributing to the pair potential and, in\nturn, influences the critical temperature. Our study reveals a universal\ncrossover of the surface SC from the weak- to strong-coupling regime,\nregardless of the specific value of the Debye energy. The location of this\ncrossover is marked by the maximum of $\\tau = (T_{cs} - T_{cb})/T_{cb}$, which\ndepends strongly on $\\hbar\\omega_D$. At its maximum, $\\tau$ can increase up to\nnearly $70\\%$. Additionally, we examine the evolution of the ratio\n$\\Delta_{s0}/k_B T_{cs}$ along the crossover, where $\\Delta_{s0}$ is the\nzero-temperature pair potential near the surface (the chain ends), and\ndemonstrate that this ratio can significantly deviate from $\\Delta_{b0}/k_B\nT_{cb}$, where $\\Delta_{b0}$ is the zero-temperature bulk pair potential (in\nthe chain center).

However, existing approaches cannot capture the\ntemporal evolution of high-order correlations in TKGs. To this end, we propose\na Deep Evolutionary Clustering jointed temporal knowledge graph Representation\nLearning approach (DECRL). Specifically, a deep evolutionary clustering module\nis proposed to capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations among\nentities. Furthermore, a cluster-aware unsupervised alignment mechanism is\nintroduced to ensure the precise one-to-one alignment of soft overlapping\nclusters across timestamps, thereby maintaining the temporal smoothness of\nclusters. In addition, an implicit correlation encoder is introduced to capture\nlatent correlations between any pair of clusters under the guidance of a global\ngraph. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that\nDECRL achieves the state-of-the-art performances, outperforming the best\nbaseline by an average of 9.53%, 12.98%, 10.42%, and 14.68% in MRR, Hits@1,\nHits@3, and Hits@10, respectively.",

In order to\nget reliable classification results from MRI scans quickly, deep learning is\none of the most practical methods. Early human illness diagnosis has been\ndemonstrated to be more accurate when deep learning methods are used. In the\ncase of diagnosing a brain tumor, when even a little misdiagnosis might have\nserious consequences, accuracy is especially important. Disclosure of brain\ntumors in medical images is still a difficult task. Brain MRIs are notoriously\nimprecise in revealing the presence or absence of tumors. Using MRI scans of\nthe brain, a CNN was trained to identify the presence of a tumor in this\nresearch. Results from the CNN model showed an accuracy of 99.17%. The CNN\nmodel's characteristics were also retrieved. The CNN model's characteristics\nwere also retrieved and we also localized the tumor regions from the\nunannotated images using GradCAM, a deep learning explainability tool. In order\nto evaluate the CNN model's capability for processing images, we applied the\nfeatures into different ML models. CNN and machine learning models were also\nevaluated using the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1\nscore. The significance of the doctor's diagnosis enhanced the accuracy of the\nCNN model's assistance in identifying the existence of tumor and treating the\npatient.",

Specifically, the\ngame is played on an infinite periodic sequence $\\mathcal{G} = (G_0, \\dots,\nG_{p-1})^*$ of graphs on the same set $V$ of $n$ vertices: in round $t$, the\ntopology of $\\mathcal{G}$ is $G_i=(V,E_i)$ where $i\\equiv t \\pmod{p}$.\n  Concentrating on the case of a single cop, we provide a characterization of\ncopwin periodic temporal graphs, establishing several basic properties on their\nnature, and extending to the temporal domain classical C&R concepts such as\ncovers and corners. Based on these results, we design an efficient algorithm\nfor determining if a periodic temporal graph is copwin.\n  We also consider the case of $k>1$ cops. By shifting from a representation in\nterms of directed graphs to one in terms of directed multi-hypergraphs, we\nprove that all the fundamental properties established for $k=1$ continue to\nhold, providing a characterization of $k$-copwin periodic graphs, as well as a\ngeneral strategy to determine if a periodic graph is $k$-copwin.\n  Our results do not rely on any assumption on properties such as connectivity,\nsymmetry, reflexivity held by the individual graphs in the sequence. They are\nestablished for a unified version of the game that includes the standard games\nstudied in the literature, both for undirected and directed graphs, and both\nwhen the players are fully active and when they are not.

The answer\ndepends on the type of regulation, monetary and non-monetary factors\ninfluencing demand, technological factors affecting supply elasticities,\ndifference between pre-regulation and expected post-regulation prices, and\ngeographical area. State-level variations in telehealth parity laws provide a\nunique opportunity to study the effects of Price Controls and Cost Controls on\nhealthcare service quantity, proxied by physician count, across metro and\nnon-metro areas, with broadband as a technological mediator. At the micro\nlevel, Price Controls distort the input mix, causing production inefficiency\nand rotating the supply curve. Cost Controls change the consumption mix,\ncausing consumption inefficiency and rotating the demand curve. This results in\nequilibrium quantity shifts causing allocative inefficiency in healthcare\nprovision, signified by physician redistribution at the macro level. The\nmicro-founded non-price competition models predicts shifts from unregulated to\nregulated equilibrium quantities under various combinations of Price Control\nand Cost Control types. Empirical analysis supports these predictions, showing\nthat a Price Ceiling or Price Floor positively affects physician count in metro\nareas but negatively in non-metro areas. Conversely, Cost Parity has a negative\neffect in metro areas, while a Cost Ceiling positively impacts physician count\nin both regions. When examining combinations of different types of Price and\nCost Controls, Cost Parity tends to dominate with a net negative effect,\nwhereas a Cost Ceiling amplifies the positive effect of a Price Ceiling.

The core\nchallenge of the mission is solving the retrieval problem, which involves\nestimating atmospheric properties from the radiance spectra observed by the\nsatellite. This problem is ill-posed and regularization techniques are\nnecessary. In this work, we present a novel and fast data-driven approach to\napproximate the inverse mapping. In the first phase, we generate an initial\napproximation of the inverse mapping using only simulated FORUM data. In the\nsecond phase, we improve this approximation by introducing climatological data\nas a priori information and using a neural network to estimate the optimal\nregularization parameters.

Notably, its magnetic order is suppressed in a relatively\nlow magnetic field of approximately 4 T, indicating that non-Kitaev\ninteractions can be restrained by reducing trigonal distortion. Our findings\nhighlight the potential of CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ as a viable platform for exploring\nKitaev quantum spin liquids and pave the way for a deeper understanding of the\nfundamental mechanisms in Kitaev physics.",
