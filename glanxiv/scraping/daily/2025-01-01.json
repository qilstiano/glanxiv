    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with stochastic linear quadratic (LQ, for short)\noptimal control problems in an infinite horizon with conditional mean-field\nterm in a switching regime environment. The orthogonal decomposition introduced\nin [21] has been adopted. Desired algebraic Riccati equations (AREs, for short)\nand a system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs, for short)\nin infinite time horizon with the coefficients depending on the Markov chain\nhave been derived. The determination of closed-loop optimal strategy follows\nfrom the solvability of ARE and BSDE. Moreover, the solvability of BSDEs leads\nto a characterization of open-loop solvability of the optimal control problem.",

The Bi\ncontent is selected for low coercivity and higher magnetostriction than that of\nYIG, yielding significant changes in the hysteresis loops through the\nmagnetoelastic effect. The piezoelectric substrate is poled along its\nthickness, which is the [011] direction, by applying a voltage across the\nPMN-PT/SiO2/Bi-YIG/Pt heterostructure. In-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect\nmicroscopy (MOKE) shows the modulation of magnetic anisotropy with\nvoltage-induced strain. Furthermore, voltage control of the magnetic domain\nstate of the Bi-YIG film at a fixed magnetic field produces a 90{\\deg}\nswitching of the magnetization easy axis above a threshold voltage. The\nmagnetoelectric coefficient of the heterostructure is 1.05x10^(-7)s/m which is\ncompetitive with that of other ferromagnetic oxide films on ferroelectric\nsubstrates such as La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/PMNPT and YIG/PMN-PZT.

Under FA preferences, agents consider any other agent\neither a friend or an enemy, preferring coalitions with more friends and, in\ncase of ties, the ones with fewer enemies.

Existing attack-resilient control strategies\ngenerally have strict assumptions on the attack signals and overlook safety\nconstraints, such as collision avoidance. In practical applications, leader\nagents equipped with advanced sensors or weaponry span a safe region to guide\nheterogeneous follower agents, ensuring coordinated operations while addressing\ncollision avoidance to prevent financial losses and mission failures. This\nletter addresses these gaps by introducing and solving the safety-aware and\nattack-resilient (SAAR) control problem under exponentially unbounded false\ndata injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Specifically, a novel attack-resilient\nobserver layer (OL) is first designed to defend against EU-FDI attacks on the\nOL. Then, an attack-resilient compensational signal is designed to mitigate the\nadverse effects caused by the EU-FDI attack on control input layer (CIL).\nFinally, a SAAR controller is designed by solving a quadratic programming (QP)\nproblem integrating control barrier function (CBF) certified collision-free\nsafety constraints. Rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis certifies the\nSAAR controller's effectiveness in ensuring both safety and resilience.

Standard BO learns the performance of a system\n$f(x)$ by using a Gaussian Process (GP) model; this treats the system as a\nblack-box and limits its ability to exploit available structural knowledge\n(e.g., physics and sparse interconnections in a complex system). Grey-box\nmodeling, wherein the performance function is treated as a composition of known\nand unknown intermediate functions $f(x, y(x))$ (where $y(x)$ is a GP model)\noffers a solution to this limitation; however, generating an analytical\nprobability density for $f$ from the Gaussian density of $y(x)$ is often an\nintractable problem (e.g., when $f$ is nonlinear). Previous work has handled\nthis issue by using sampling techniques or by solving an auxiliary problem over\nan augmented space where the values of $y(x)$ are constrained by confidence\nintervals derived from the GP models; such solutions are computationally\nintensive. In this work, we provide a detailed implementation of a recently\nproposed grey-box BO paradigm, BOIS, that uses adaptive linearizations of $f$\nto obtain analytical expressions for the statistical moments of the composite\nfunction. We show that the BOIS approach enables the exploitation of structural\nknowledge, such as that arising in interconnected systems as well as systems\nthat embed multiple GP models and combinations of physics and GP models. We\nbenchmark the effectiveness of BOIS against standard BO and existing grey-box\nBO algorithms using a pair of case studies focused on chemical process\noptimization and design. Our results indicate that BOIS performs as well as or\nbetter than existing grey-box methods, while also being less computationally\nintensive.",

    "abstract": "The proxy pattern is a well-known design pattern with numerous use cases in\nseveral sectors of the software industry. As such, the use of the proxy pattern\nis also a common approach in the development of complex decentralized\napplications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the importance of\nproxy contracts, little is known about (i) how their prevalence changed over\ntime, (ii) the ways in which developers integrate proxies in the design of\nDApps, and (iii) what proxy types are being most commonly leveraged by\ndevelopers. This study bridges these gaps through a comprehensive analysis of\nEthereum smart contracts, utilizing a dataset of 50 million contracts and 1.6\nbillion transactions as of September 2022. Our findings reveal that 14.2% of\nall deployed smart contracts are proxy contracts. We show that proxy contracts\nare being more actively used than non-proxy contracts. Also, the usage of proxy\ncontracts in various contexts, transactions involving proxy contracts, and\nadoption of proxy contracts by users have shown an upward trend over time,\npeaking at the end of our study period. They are either deployed through\noff-chain scripts or on-chain factory contracts, with the former and latter\nbeing employed in 39.1% and 60.9% of identified usage contexts in turn. We\nfound that while the majority (67.8%) of proxies act as an interceptor, 32.2%\nenables upgradeability. Proxy contracts are typically (79%) implemented based\non known reference implementations with 29.4% being of type ERC-1167, a class\nof proxies that aims to cheaply reuse and clone contracts' functionality. Our\nevaluation shows that our proposed behavioral proxy detection method has a\nprecision and recall of 100% in detecting active proxies. Finally, we derive a\nset of practical recommendations for developers and introduce open research\nquestions to guide future research on the topic.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) are transforming multiple aspects of\nsociety, including education and foreign language learning. In the context of\nEnglish as a Foreign Language (EFL), significant research has been conducted to\ninvestigate the applicability of GenAI as a learning aid and the potential\nnegative impacts of new technologies. Critical questions remain about the\nfuture of AI, including whether improvements will continue at such a pace or\nstall and whether there is a true benefit to implementing GenAI in education,\ngiven the myriad costs and potential for negative impacts.\n  Apart from the ethical conundrums that GenAI presents in EFL education, there\nis growing consensus that learners and teachers must develop AI literacy skills\nto enable them to use and critically evaluate the purposes and outputs of these\ntechnologies. However, there are few formalised frameworks available to support\nthe integration and development of AI literacy skills for EFL learners. In this\narticle, we demonstrate how the use of a general, all-purposes framework (the\nAI Assessment Scale) can be tailored to the EFL writing and translation\ncontext, drawing on existing empirical research validating the scale and\nadaptations to other contexts, such as English for Academic Purposes.

Existing\nquantitative measures of stereotypes are based on statistical parity that does\nnot align with the sociological definition of stereotypes and, therefore,\nincorrectly categorizes biases as stereotypes. Instead of oversimplifying\nstereotypes as biases, we propose a quantitative measure of stereotypes that\naligns with its sociological definition. We then propose OASIS to measure the\nstereotypes in a generated dataset and understand their origins within the T2I\nmodel. OASIS includes two scores to measure stereotypes from a generated image\ndataset: (M1) Stereotype Score to measure the distributional violation of\nstereotypical attributes, and (M2) WALS to measure spectral variance in the\nimages along a stereotypical attribute. OASIS also includes two methods to\nunderstand the origins of stereotypes in T2I models: (U1) StOP to discover\nattributes that the T2I model internally associates with a given concept, and\n(U2) SPI to quantify the emergence of stereotypical attributes in the latent\nspace of the T2I model during image generation. Despite the considerable\nprogress in image fidelity, using OASIS, we conclude that newer T2I models such\nas FLUX.1 and SDv3 contain strong stereotypical predispositions about concepts\nand still generate images with widespread stereotypical attributes.\nAdditionally, the quantity of stereotypes worsens for nationalities with lower\nInternet footprints.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models often rely on simple spurious features -- patterns in\ntraining data that correlate with targets but are not causally related to them,\nlike image backgrounds in foreground classification. This reliance typically\nleads to imbalanced test performance across minority and majority groups. In\nthis work, we take a closer look at the fundamental cause of such imbalanced\nperformance through the lens of memorization, which refers to the ability to\npredict accurately on atypical examples (minority groups) in the training set\nbut failing in achieving the same accuracy in the testing set. This paper\nsystematically shows the ubiquitous existence of spurious features in a small\nset of neurons within the network, providing the first-ever evidence that\nmemorization may contribute to imbalanced group performance. Through three\nexperimental sources of converging empirical evidence, we find the property of\na small subset of neurons or channels in memorizing minority group information.\nInspired by these findings, we hypothesize that spurious memorization,\nconcentrated within a small subset of neurons, plays a key role in driving\nimbalanced group performance. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we show\nthat eliminating these unnecessary spurious memorization patterns via a novel\nframework during training can significantly affect the model performance on\nminority groups. Our experimental results across various architectures and\nbenchmarks offer new insights on how neural networks encode core and spurious\nknowledge, laying the groundwork for future research in demystifying robustness\nto spurious correlation.",

This paper presents\nSurfPatch, a novel framework supporting exploratory stream surface\nvisualization. To begin with, we translate the issue of surface placement to\nsurface selection and trace a large number of stream surfaces from a given flow\nfield dataset. Then, we introduce a three-stage process: vertex-level\nclassification, patch-level matching, and surface-level clustering that\nhierarchically builds the connection between vertices and patches and between\npatches and surfaces. This bottom-up approach enables fine-grained, multiscale\npatch-level matching, sharply contrasts surface-level matching offered by\nexisting works, and provides previously unavailable flexibility during\nquerying. We design an intuitive visual interface for users to conveniently\nvisualize and analyze the underlying collection of stream surfaces in an\nexploratory manner. SurfPatch is not limited to stream surfaces traced from\nsteady flow datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on\nstream surfaces produced from steady and unsteady flows as well as isosurfaces\nextracted from scalar fields.

The earlier\nanalysis was based on the data for high polymers (degree of polymerization, N >\n200, and molecular weight, Mw > 20,000 g/mol). Here, we investigate the\ndependence of T_{g} and /tau_{el} on N (or, equivalently, on the molecular\nweight, M). We consider the dielectric spectroscopy data for homologous series\nof four polymers: polystyrene (PS), poly-(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP),\npoly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), and polybutadiene (PB). It is shown that the\nrelaxation time curves for various oligomers can be successfully collapsed onto\nthe same master curve as the high polymers. The glass transition temperature\nand the dynamic fragility are found to be linear functions of 1/M, in agreement\nwith the Fox-Flory equation. The scaling results are interpreted based on the\nSL-TS2 theory, ensuring that the model description is consistent with the Boyer\nrules for the coefficients of thermal expansion above and below T_{g}, as well\nas the thermodynamical scaling for the pressure dependence of the relaxation\ntime.",

    "abstract": "Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data\npoints for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials\nand chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these\nproperties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active\nlearning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights\nare treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high\ncomputational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks\n(PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others\nremain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active\nlearning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational\ncost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained\non theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage\ncomputational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data.\nWe validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and\nmaterials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active\nlearning with limited, complex datasets.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the pseudorandom quantum authentication scheme (PQAS), an\nefficient method for encrypting quantum states that relies solely on the\nexistence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). The scheme guarantees that for any\neavesdropper with quantum polynomial-time (QPT) computational power, the\nencrypted states are indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state.\nFurthermore, the receiver can verify that the state has not been tampered with\nand recover the original state with asymptotically unit fidelity. Our scheme is\ncost-effective, requiring only polylogarithmic circuit depth and a single\nshared key to encrypt a polynomial number of states. Notably, the PQAS can\npotentially exist even without quantum-secure one-way functions, requiring\nfundamentally weaker computational assumptions than semantic classical\ncryptography. Additionally, PQAS is secure against attacks that plague\nprotocols based on QPT indistinguishability from Haar random states, such as\nchosen-plaintext attacks (CPAs) and attacks that reveal meta-information such\nas quantum resources. We relate the amount of meta-information that is leaked\nto quantum pseudoresources, giving the concept a practical meaning. As an\napplication, we construct important cryptographic primitives, such as\nverifiable pseudorandom density matrices (VPRDMs), which are\nQPT-indistinguishable from random mixed states while being efficiently\nverifiable via a secret key, as well as verifiable noise-robust EFI pairs and\none-way state generators (OWSGs).

    "abstract": "The future mobile network has the complex mission of distributing available\nradio resources among various applications with different requirements. The\nradio access network slicing enables the creation of different logical networks\nby isolating and using dedicated resources for each group of applications. In\nthis scenario, the radio resource scheduling (RRS) is responsible for\ndistributing the radio resources available among the slices to fulfill their\nservice-level agreement (SLA) requirements, prioritizing critical slices while\nminimizing the number of intent violations. Moreover, ensuring that the RRS can\ndeal with a high diversity of network scenarios is essential. Several recent\npapers present advances in machine learning-based RRS. However, the scenarios\nand slice variety are restricted, which inhibits solid conclusions about the\ngeneralization capabilities of the models after deployment in real networks.\nThis paper proposes an intent-based RRS using multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning in a radio access network (RAN) slicing context. The proposed method\nprotects high-priority slices when the available radio resources cannot fulfill\nall the slices. It uses transfer learning to reduce the number of training\nsteps required. The proposed method and baselines are evaluated in different\nnetwork scenarios that comprehend combinations of different slice types,\nchannel trajectories, number of active slices and users' equipment (UEs), and\nUE characteristics. The proposed method outperformed the baselines in\nprotecting slices with higher priority, obtaining an improvement of 40% and,\nwhen considering all the slices, obtaining an improvement of 20% in relation to\nthe baselines. The results show that by using transfer learning, the required\nnumber of training steps could be reduced by a factor of eight without hurting\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "We present a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation based\non the analogy of the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down\nconversion (SPDC) when the black hole (pump) is allowed to deplete to zero\nmass. The model incorporates an additional new feature that allows for the\ninterior Hawking partner-particles (idlers) behind the horizon to further\ngenerate new Hawking particle pairs of lower energy, one of which remains\nbehind the horizon, and the other that adds to the externally emitted Hawking\nradiation (signals) outside the horizon. This model produces a Page curve for\nthe evolution of the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black hole\ninternal degrees of freedom entangled with the generated Hawking radiation\npairs entangled across the horizon. The Page curve yields an entropy that rises\nat early times during the evaporation process as Hawking pairs are generated,\nreaches a peak midway through the evolution, and then decays to zero upon\ncomplete evaporation of the black hole. The entire system remains in a pure\nstate at all times undergoing unitary (squeezed state) evolution, with the\ninitial state of the black hole modeled as a bosonic Fock state of large, but\nfinite number $n_{p0}$ of particles. For the final state of the system, the\nblack hole reaches the vacuum state of zero mass, while the external Hawking\nradiation carries away the total energy of the initial black hole. Inside the\nhorizon there remains $n_{p0}$ Hawking partner-particles of vanishingly small\ntotal energy, reminiscent of the \"soft-hair\" (zero energy) qubit model of\nHotta, Nambu and Yamaguchi, but now from a Hamiltonian for squeezed state\ngeneration perspective.

Various approaches have been proposed to address this\ndrawback. One such approach focuses on reducing the number of tokens fed into\nthe self-attention, known as token merging (ToMe). In our method, which is\ncalled cached adaptive token merging(CA-ToMe), we calculate the similarity\nbetween tokens and then merge the r proportion of the most similar tokens.\nHowever, due to the repetitive patterns observed in adjacent steps and the\nvariation in the frequency of similarities, we aim to enhance this approach by\nimplementing an adaptive threshold for merging tokens and adding a caching\nmechanism that stores similar pairs across several adjacent steps.

In scientific computing, most tasks study the conversion\nof multiple data modalities to describe physical phenomena, for example,\nspatial and waveform in seismic imaging, time and frequency in signal\nprocessing, and temporal and spectral in climate modeling; as such, multi-modal\npairwise data generation is highly required instead of single-modal data\ngeneration, which is usually used in natural images (e.g., faces, scenery).\nMoreover, in real-world applications, the unbalance of available data in terms\nof modalities commonly exists; for example, the spatial data (i.e., velocity\nmaps) in seismic imaging can be easily simulated, but real-world seismic\nwaveform is largely lacking.

    "abstract": "The quantitative formulation of evolution equations is the backbone for\nprediction, control, and understanding of dynamical systems across diverse\nscientific fields. Besides deriving differential equations for dynamical\nsystems based on basic scientific reasoning or prior knowledge in recent times\na growing interest emerged to infer these equations purely from data. In this\narticle, we introduce a novel method for the sparse identification of nonlinear\ndynamical systems from observational data, based on the observation how the key\nchallenges of the quality of time derivatives and sampling rates influence this\nproblem. Our approach combines system identification based on thresholded least\nsquares minimization with additional error measures that account for both the\ndeviation between the model and the time derivative of the data, and the\nintegrated performance of the model in forecasting dynamics. Specifically, we\nintegrate a least squares error as well as the Wasserstein metric for estimated\nmodels and combine them within a Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently\ndetermine optimal hyperparameters for thresholding and weighting of the\ndifferent error norms. Additionally, we employ distinct regularization\nparameters for each differential equation in the system, enhancing the method's\nprecision and flexibility. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach\nthrough applications to dynamical fMRI data and the prototypical example of a\nwake flow behind a cylinder. In the wake flow problem, our method identifies a\nsparse, accurate model that correctly captures transient dynamics, oscillation\nperiods, and phase information, outperforming existing methods. In the fMRI\nexample, we show how our approach extracts insights from a trained recurrent\nneural network, offering a novel avenue for explainable AI by inferring\ndifferential equations that capture potentially causal relationships.",

However, their performance\nhighly depends on the representativeness of the training dataset. A major issue\nis the uncertainty of whether the training dataset covers all test environments\nand waveform configurations, and thus, whether the trained model is robust in\npractical deployment conditions. To this end, we propose a joint\nmeasurement-recovery framework for AI-native transceivers post deployment,\ncalled VERITAS, that continuously looks for distribution shifts in the received\nsignals and triggers finite re-training spurts. VERITAS monitors the wireless\nchannel using 5G pilots fed to an auxiliary neural network that detects\nout-of-distribution channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay spread. As\nsoon as such a change is detected, a traditional (reference) receiver is\nactivated, which runs for a period of time in parallel to the AI-native\nreceiver. Finally, VERTIAS compares the bit probabilities of the AI-native and\nthe reference receivers for the same received data inputs, and decides whether\nor not a retraining process needs to be initiated. Our evaluations reveal that\nVERITAS can detect changes in the channel profile, transmitter speed, and delay\nspread with 99%, 97%, and 69% accuracies, respectively, followed by timely\ninitiation of retraining for 86%, 93.3%, and 94.8% of inputs in channel\nprofile, transmitter speed, and delay spread test sets, respectively.",

Using the Klein-Gordon equation, we\ncompute the Bogoliubov coefficients and derive the Hawking temperature.\nSubsequently, we examine Hawking radiation as a tunneling process, resolving\ndivergent integrals through the residue method. The analysis is then extended\nto fermionic particle modes, also within the tunneling framework. Particle\ncreation densities are calculated for both bosonic and fermionic cases.\nAdditionally, greybody bounds are estimated for bosonic and fermionic\nparticles. Furthermore, we explore the evaporation process, considering the\nfinal state of the black holes and we also investigate the correlation between\nthe greybody factors and the quasinormal modes. Finally, constraints on the\nLorentz-violating parameters $\\ell$ (for the metric case) and $X$ (for the\nmetric-affine case) are established using recent astrophysical data on black\nhole lifetimes.

The number of super arms could be\nexponential to the number of arms in many scenarios. In wireless networks,\ninterference constraints can cause the number of super arms to grow\nexponentially with the number of arms. Evaluating all the feasible super arms\nto find the one with the maximum total weight can incur extremely high\ncomputational complexity in the pessimistic-optimistic algorithm.

    "abstract": "An adjoint-based shape optimization method for solid bodies subjected to both\nrarefied and continuum gas flows is proposed. The gas-kinetic BGK equation with\nthe diffuse-reflection boundary condition is used to describe the multiscale\ngas flows. In the vicinity of the gas-solid interface, a body-fitted mesh is\nutilized, and the sensitivity with respect to the boundary geometry is analyzed\nthrough a combined continuous and discrete adjoint methods. The primal and\nadjoint governing equations are resolved using efficient multiscale numerical\nschemes, ensuring the precision of the sensitivity analysis in all flow\nregimes. The sensitivity data is subsequently integrated into a quasi-Newton\noptimization algorithm to facilitate rapid convergence towards the optimal\nsolution. Numerical experiments reveal that the discretization of the molecular\nvelocity space can induce sensitivity oscillations; however, these can be\neffectively eliminated by employing appropriate parameterization of the\nboundary geometry.

This essay\nhypothesizes that these occurrences signify a broader, Heisenberg-like\nuncertainty principle for learning: optimizing learning and assessing actual\nerrors using the same data are fundamentally at odds. Only suboptimal learning\npreserves untapped information for actual error assessments, and vice versa,\nreinforcing the `no free lunch' principle. To substantiate this intuition, a\nCramer-Rao-style lower bound is established under the squared loss, which shows\nthat the relative regret in learning is bounded below by the square of the\ncorrelation between any unbiased error assessor and the actual learning error.\nReaders are invited to explore generalizations, develop variations, or even\nuncover genuine `free lunches.' The connection with the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple is more than metaphorical, because both share an essence of the\nCramer-Rao inequality: marginal variations cannot manifest individually to\narbitrary degrees when their underlying co-variation is constrained, whether\nthe co-variation is about individual states or their generating mechanisms, as\nin the quantum realm.

Despite the initial success, existing works mostly focus on\nthe authenticity of data at the individual level, but pay less attention to\npreserving the population-level properties on the entire dataset. Such\npopulation-level properties include value distributions for each dimension and\ndistributions of certain functional dependencies (e.g., cross-correlation, CC)\nbetween different dimensions. For instance, when generating house energy\nconsumption TS data, the value distributions of the outside temperature and the\nkitchen temperature should be preserved, as well as the distribution of CC\nbetween them. Preserving such TS population-level properties is critical in\nmaintaining the statistical insights of the datasets, mitigating model bias,\nand augmenting downstream tasks like TS prediction.

    "abstract": "We study when a piecewise full group (a.k.a. topological full group) of\nhomeomorphisms of the Cantor space $X$ can be given a non-discrete totally\ndisconnected locally compact (t.d.l.c.) topology and give a criterion for the\nalternating full group (in the sense of Nekrashevych's group A(G) to be\ncompactly generated. As a result, starting from qualitative criteria, we obtain\na large class of t.d.l.c. groups such that the derived group is non-discrete,\ncompactly generated, open and simple, putting previous constructions of\nNeretin, Roever and Lederle in a more systematic context. We also show some\nnotable properties of Neretin's groups apply to this class in general. General\nconsequences are derived for the theory of simple t.d.l.c. groups, prime among\nthem the universal role that alternating full groups play in the class of\nsimple t.d.l.c. groups that are non-discrete, compactly generated and locally\ndecomposable.\n  Some of the theory is developed in the setting of topological inverse monoids\nof partial homeomorphisms of $X$. In particular, we obtain a sufficient\ncondition to extend the topology to a monoid equipped with all restrictions\nwith respect to compact open subsets of $X$ and all joins of compatible pairs\nof elements. The compact generation criterion is also naturally expressed in\nthis context.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of social media, user-generated content has surged on\nonline platforms. When such content includes hateful, abusive, offensive, or\ncyberbullying behavior, it is classified as toxic speech, posing a significant\nthreat to the online ecosystem's integrity and safety. While manual content\nmoderation is still prevalent, the overwhelming volume of content and the\npsychological strain on human moderators underscore the need for automated\ntoxic speech detection. Previously proposed detection methods often rely on\nlarge annotated datasets; however, acquiring such datasets is both costly and\nchallenging in practice. To address this issue, we propose an\nuncertainty-guided firewall for toxic speech in few-shot scenarios, U-GIFT,\nthat utilizes self-training to enhance detection performance even when labeled\ndata is limited. Specifically, U-GIFT combines active learning with Bayesian\nNeural Networks (BNNs) to automatically identify high-quality samples from\nunlabeled data, prioritizing the selection of pseudo-labels with higher\nconfidence for training based on uncertainty estimates derived from model\npredictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U-GIFT significantly\noutperforms competitive baselines in few-shot detection scenarios. In the\n5-shot setting, it achieves a 14.92\\% performance improvement over the basic\nmodel. Importantly, U-GIFT is user-friendly and adaptable to various\npre-trained language models (PLMs). It also exhibits robust performance in\nscenarios with sample imbalance and cross-domain settings, while showcasing\nstrong generalization across various language applications. We believe that\nU-GIFT provides an efficient solution for few-shot toxic speech detection,\noffering substantial support for automated content moderation in cyberspace,\nthereby acting as a firewall to promote advancements in cybersecurity.",

In optical traps driven by high-energy pulses, material\nnon-linearity can result in unusual opto-mechanical effects, such as displaced\nequilibrium points. However, existing theoretical models of non-linear optical\nforce on small particles consider smooth material dependence on the incident\nfield strength alone, and not the feedback between the particle permittivity\nand internal field strength, which is, in turn, a function of the permittivity.\nThe hysteresis effects of optical bistability in pulsed optical traps therefore\nelude existing optical force models. Here, we investigate a bistable optical\ntrap, set up by counter-propagating ultrashort pulses, in which the optical\nforce exerted on a particle depends not only on the field at the particle's\ncurrent location, but on the particle's historic trajectory in the trap. The\ndeveloped formalism will be important for designing optical traps and\nnanoparticle manipulation in pulsed field for various applications, including\npotentially time crystal demonstrations.",

    "abstract": "Generative foundation models have advanced large-scale text-driven natural\nimage generation, becoming a prominent research trend across various vertical\ndomains. However, in the remote sensing field, there is still a lack of\nresearch on large-scale text-to-image (text2image) generation technology.\nExisting remote sensing image-text datasets are small in scale and confined to\nspecific geographic areas and scene types. Besides, existing text2image methods\nhave struggled to achieve global-scale, multi-resolution controllable, and\nunbounded image generation. To address these challenges, this paper presents\ntwo key contributions: the Git-10M dataset and the Text2Earth foundation model.\nGit-10M is a global-scale image-text dataset comprising 10.5 million image-text\npairs, 5 times larger than the previous largest one. The dataset covers a wide\nrange of geographic scenes and contains resolution information, significantly\nsurpassing existing datasets in both size and diversity. Building on Git-10M,\nwe propose Text2Earth, a 1.3 billion parameter generative foundation model\nbased on the diffusion framework to model global-scale remote sensing scenes.\nText2Earth integrates a resolution guidance mechanism, enabling users to\nspecify image resolutions. A dynamic condition adaptation strategy is proposed\nfor training and inference to improve image quality. Text2Earth excels in\nzero-shot text2image generation and demonstrates robust generalization and\nflexibility across multiple tasks, including unbounded scene construction,\nimage editing, and cross-modal image generation. This robust capability\nsurpasses previous models restricted to the basic fixed size and limited scene\ntypes. On the previous benchmark dataset, Text2Earth outperforms previous\nmodels with an improvement of +26.23 FID and +20.95% Zero-shot Cls-OA\nmetric.Our project page is https://chen-yang-liu.github.io/Text2Earth",

However, the strict definition of SSB is different: the Hamiltonian and\nthe boundary conditions are invariant under a symmetry transformation, while\nthe \\emph{ground state} is not. Based on the latter criterion, we study a\nfinite system of spinless, weakly interacting bosons using three approaches:\nthe standard Bogoliubov method, the particle-number-conserving Bogoliubov\nmethod, and the approach based on the exact ground-state wave function. Our\nresults show that the answer to the question in the title is \\textquotedblleft\nno\\textquotedblright. Thus, phonons in a real-world (finite) superfluid Bose\ngas are similar to sound in a classical gas: they are not Goldstone bosons, but\nquantised collective vibrational modes arising from the interaction between\natoms. In the case of an infinite Bose gas, however, the picture becomes\nparadoxical: the ground state can be regarded as either infinitely degenerate\nor non-degenerate, making the phonon both similar to a Goldstone boson and\ndifferent from it.",

We rigorously establish a sharp upper bound\nfor the chromatic number of such tilings, predicated on the fractal's intrinsic\nHausdorff dimension $d$, its boundary Hausdorff dimension $b$, and the\nregularity parameters of the tiling. Specifically, we demonstrate that if $d >\nb$, the chromatic number $\\chi(\\mathcal{T})$ of a regular tiling $\\mathcal{T}$\nadmits the bound \\[ \\chi(\\mathcal{T}) \\leq C \\left( 1 +\n\\left(\\frac{r_{\\max}}{r_{\\min}}\\right)^{\\max(0, b - (d - 1))} \\right), \\] where\n$C$ is a strictly positive constant contingent solely upon the dimension of the\nembedding Euclidean space, $n$, and intrinsic measure-theoretic properties of\nthe fractal $F$.

However, existing algorithms,\nwhich rely on the upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy, struggle to gather\nadequate statistical information to accurately identify unknown user clusters.\nAs a result, their theoretical analyses require several strong assumptions\nabout the \"diversity\" of contexts generated by the environment, leading to\nimpractical settings, complicated analyses, and poor practical performance.\nRemoving these assumptions has been a long-standing open problem in the\nclustering of bandits literature. In this paper, we provide two solutions to\nthis open problem. First, following the i.i.d. context generation setting in\nexisting studies, we propose two novel algorithms, UniCLUB and PhaseUniCLUB,\nwhich incorporate enhanced exploration mechanisms to accelerate cluster\nidentification. Remarkably, our algorithms require substantially weaker\nassumptions while achieving regret bounds comparable to prior work.

In this paper, we\npropose a decentralized microservice architecture (DMSA), which delegates\nscheduling functions from the control plane to edge nodes. DMSA redesigns and\nimplements three core modules of microservice discovery, monitoring, and\nscheduling for edge networks to achieve precise awareness of instance\ndeployments, low monitoring overhead and measurement errors, and accurate\ndynamic scheduling, respectively. Particularly, DMSA has customized a\nmicroservice scheduling scheme that leverages multi-port listening and\nzero-copy forwarding to guarantee high data forwarding efficiency. Moreover, a\ndynamic weighted multi-level load balancing algorithm is proposed to adjust\nscheduling dynamically with consideration of reliability, priority, and\nresponse delay. Finally, we have implemented a physical verification platform\nfor DMSA. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that compared to\nstate-of-the-art and traditional scheduling schemes, DMSA effectively\ncounteracts link failures and network fluctuations, improving the service\nresponse delay and execution success rate by approximately $60\\% \\sim 75\\%$ and\n$10\\%\\sim15\\%$, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Video summarization aims to generate a compact, informative, and\nrepresentative synopsis of raw videos, which is crucial for browsing,\nanalyzing, and understanding video content. Dominant approaches in video\nsummarization primarily rely on recurrent or convolutional neural networks, and\nmore recently on encoder-only transformer architectures. However, these methods\ntypically suffer from several limitations in parallelism, modeling long-range\ndependencies, and providing explicit generative capabilities. To address these\nissues, we propose a transformer-like architecture named FullTransNet with\ntwo-fold ideas. First, it uses a full transformer with an encoder-decoder\nstructure as an alternative architecture for video summarization. As the full\ntransformer is specifically designed for sequence transduction tasks, its\ndirect application to video summarization is both intuitive and effective.\nSecond, it replaces the standard full attention mechanism with a combination of\nlocal and global sparse attention, enabling the model to capture long-range\ndependencies while significantly reducing computational costs. This\nlocal-global sparse attention is applied exclusively at the encoder side, where\nthe majority of computations occur, further enhancing efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, SumMe and TVSum, demonstrate\nthat our model achieves F-scores of 54.4% and 63.9%, respectively, while\nmaintaining relatively low computational and memory requirements. These results\nsurpass the second-best performing methods by 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively,\nverifying the effectiveness and efficiency of FullTransNet.",

This oversight may lead to suboptimal utilization of visual\ngeneration capabilities within the LLM framework. In this paper, we explore the\ncharacteristics of visual embedding space under the LLM framework and discover\nthat the correlation between visual embeddings can help achieve more stable and\nrobust generation results. We present IAR, an Improved AutoRegressive Visual\nGeneration Method that enhances the training efficiency and generation quality\nof LLM-based visual generation models. Firstly, we propose a Codebook\nRearrangement strategy that uses balanced k-means clustering algorithm to\nrearrange the visual codebook into clusters, ensuring high similarity among\nvisual features within each cluster. Leveraging the rearranged codebook, we\npropose a Cluster-oriented Cross-entropy Loss that guides the model to\ncorrectly predict the cluster where the token is located. This approach ensures\nthat even if the model predicts the wrong token index, there is a high\nprobability the predicted token is located in the correct cluster, which\nsignificantly enhances the generation quality and robustness. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the model\ntraining efficiency and performance from 100M to 1.4B, reducing the training\ntime by half while achieving the same FID.

Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from\ncommunication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to\nprovide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for\nmission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks.

For the first time, this work demonstrates a circular crested LWR. Its\nadvantages over the straight crested LWR are presented comprehensively by\nstudying their fundamental symmetric (S0) mode, which is the simplest and most\nrepresentative Lamb wave mode. Utilizing circular crested Lamb waves, the\nproposed resonator avoids only utilizing waves propagating in the lateral\ndirection in the straight crested LWRs, thus eliminating the transverse\nspurious modes as no transverse direction exists. Besides, different from\nstraight crested Lamb waves maintaining the same displacement amplitude along\nthe propagation direction, circular crested Lamb waves exhibit displacement\nattenuation toward device edges, which effectively concentrates energy in the\ndevice center, assists in reducing energy loss through anchors, and improves Q.\nBased on 20 at.% scandium-doped aluminum nitride (Al0.8Sc0.2N) thin films, the\nmicrofabricated circular crested LWR effectively suppresses transverse spurious\nmodes and achieves a 40.7% Q improvement in experiments with no degradation in\neffective electromechanical coupling coefficients (keff2) compared with the\nconventional straight crested LWR when working in S0 mode in experiments, in\ncontrast with the conventional straight crested LWR which shows inherent\nexperimental transverse spurious modes.

A common solution is to leverage\npowerful vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to bridge the gap between\nvision and text information.

In\ncontrast, segmentation tasks require fine-grained pixel-level alignment and\ndetailed category boundary information, which VLMs alone cannot provide. As a\nresult, information extracted directly from VLMs can't meet the requirements of\nsegmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose FGAseg, a model\ndesigned for fine-grained pixel-text alignment and category boundary\nsupplementation. The core of FGAseg is a Pixel-Level Alignment module that\nemploys a cross-modal attention mechanism and a text-pixel alignment loss to\nrefine the coarse-grained alignment from CLIP, achieving finer-grained\npixel-text semantic alignment. Additionally, to enrich category boundary\ninformation, we introduce the alignment matrices as optimizable pseudo-masks\nduring forward propagation and propose Category Information Supplementation\nmodule. These pseudo-masks, derived from cosine and convolutional similarity,\nprovide essential global and local boundary information between different\ncategories.

No bound or resonant states are found in\nthe trilepton $e^+\\mu^+e^-$, $\\mu^+e^+\\mu^-$ systems, nor in the tetralepton\n$\\mu^+e^+\\mu^-e^-$ system. A comparison with fully heavy tetraquark systems\nreveals that the additional color degree of freedom in QCD results in the\nabsence of low-energy bound and resonant states. However, this extra degree of\nfreedom allows for a broader range of $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers to produce\nresonant states, highlighting the rich complexity of QCD systems.",

Here, we tested a possible association between M31 tidal tail particles\nand MW dwarf galaxies, focusing first on the LMC and its associated dwarfs\nsince they are less affected by ram pressure. We traced back these dwarf galaxy\norbits by one billion years and calculated their association with the tidal\ntail particles in the 6D phase space, based on their proper motion from\n\\textit{Gaia} DR3. We find that for low-mass MW models (total mass less than 5\n$\\times 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$), the separation in the 6D space can be less than\n1$\\sigma$ for most of the M31 modelling, albeit with a significant degree of\nfreedom due to the still unknown proper motion of M31. We further discover that\nmany other dwarfs could also be associated with the M31 tidal tails if their\nmotions had been radially slowed, as expected from the ram pressure exerted by\nthe MW corona. This intriguing coincidence could explain the origin of the\nVPOS, which resulted from a matter exchange between M31 and MW.",

I conclude this thesis by presenting the vision of my\nideal laboratory in a perspective of 5 to 10 years from today. This laboratory\nwould have two experimental devices, a first, classic, for carrying out tests\nin a constrained and therefore unnatural environment, the data of which would\nbe compared to those from a second device called \"naturalistic\" in which the\nanimals could potentially express their entire behavioral repertoire. The tasks\ntested would be characterized by strong ecological principles, such as in those\nsimulating the properties of foraging, and the data would make it possible to\ntest hypotheses based on the progressive addition of ecological components in\nthese tasks, all this in order to maintain control over the interpretability of\nthese data which are complex by nature.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the relationship between soft and hard paternalism by\nexamining two kinds of restriction: a waiting period and a hard limit (cap) on\nrisk-seeking behavior. Mandatory waiting periods have been instituted for\nmedical procedures, gun purchases and other high-stakes decisions. Are these\npolicies substitutes for hard restrictions, and are delayed decisions more\nrespected? In an experiment, decision-makers are informed about an impending\nhigh-stakes decision. Treatments define when the decision is made: on the spot\nor after one day, and whether the initial decision can be revised. In a general\npopulation survey experiment, another class of subjects (Choice Architects) is\ngranted the opportunity to make rules for decision-makers. Given a decision's\ntemporal structure, Choice Architects can decide on a cap to the\ndecision-maker's risk taking. In another treatment, Choice Architects can\nimplement a mandatory waiting period in addition to the cap. This allows us to\nstudy the substitutional relationship between waiting periods and paternalistic\naction and the effect of deliberation on the autonomy afforded to the\ndecision-maker. Our highly powered experiment reveals that exogenous\ndeliberation has no effect on the cap. Moreover, endogenously prescribed\nwaiting periods represent add-on restrictions that do not substitute for the\ncap. Choice Architects believe that, with time, the average decision-maker will\ntake less risk and -- because of the distribution of Choice Architects' bliss\npoints -- come closer to Choice Architects' subjective ideal choice. These\nfindings highlight the complementarity of policy tools in targeting various\nparts of a distribution of decision-makers.",

    "abstract": "Sequential decision problems are widely studied across many areas of science.\nA key challenge when learning policies from historical data - a practice\ncommonly referred to as off-policy learning - is how to ``identify'' the impact\nof a policy of interest when the observed data are not randomized. Off-policy\nlearning has mainly been studied in two settings: dynamic treatment regimes\n(DTRs), where the focus is on controlling confounding in medical problems with\nshort decision horizons, and offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the\nfocus is on dimension reduction in closed systems such as games. The gap\nbetween these two well studied settings has limited the wider application of\noff-policy learning to many real-world problems. Using the theory for causal\ninference based on acyclic directed mixed graph (ADMGs), we provide a set of\ngraphical identification criteria in general decision processes that encompass\nboth DTRs and MDPs. We discuss how our results relate to the often implicit\ncausal assumptions made in the DTR and RL literatures and further clarify\nseveral common misconceptions. Finally, we present a realistic simulation study\nfor the dynamic pricing problem encountered in container logistics, and\ndemonstrate how violations of our graphical criteria can lead to suboptimal\npolicies.",

    "abstract": "The Hierarchical Directed Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (HDCARP) is an\nextension of the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), where the arcs of a\ngraph are divided into classes based on their priority. The traversal of these\nclasses is determined by either precedence constraints or a hierarchical\nobjective, resulting in two distinct HDCARP variants. To the best of our\nknowledge, only one matheuristic has been proposed for these variants, but it\nperforms relatively slowly, particularly for large-scale instances (Ha et al.,\n2024). In this paper, we propose a fast heuristic to efficiently address the\ncomputational challenges of HDCARP. Furthermore, we incorporate Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) into our heuristic to effectively guide the selection of local\nsearch operators, resulting in a hybrid algorithm. We name this hybrid\nalgorithm as the Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Heuristic Algorithm for\nDirected Arc Routing (HRDA). The hybrid algorithm adapts to changes in the\nproblem dynamically, using real-time feedback to improve routing strategies and\nsolution's quality by integrating heuristic methods. Extensive computational\nexperiments on artificial instances demonstrate that this hybrid approach\nsignificantly improves the speed of the heuristic without deteriorating the\nsolution quality.

    "abstract": "The goal of referring remote sensing image segmentation (RRSIS) is to extract\nspecific pixel-level regions within an aerial image via a natural language\nexpression. Recent advancements, particularly Transformer-based fusion designs,\nhave demonstrated remarkable progress in this domain. However, existing methods\nprimarily focus on refining visual features using language-aware guidance\nduring the cross-modal fusion stage, neglecting the complementary\nvision-to-language flow. This limitation often leads to irrelevant or\nsuboptimal representations. In addition, the diverse spatial scales of ground\nobjects in aerial images pose significant challenges to the visual perception\ncapabilities of existing models when conditioned on textual inputs. In this\npaper, we propose an innovative framework called Scale-wise Bidirectional\nAlignment Network (SBANet) to address these challenges for RRSIS. Specifically,\nwe design a Bidirectional Alignment Module (BAM) with learnable query tokens to\nselectively and effectively represent visual and linguistic features,\nemphasizing regions associated with key tokens. BAM is further enhanced with a\ndynamic feature selection block, designed to provide both macro- and\nmicro-level visual features, preserving global context and local details to\nfacilitate more effective cross-modal interaction. Furthermore, SBANet\nincorporates a text-conditioned channel and spatial aggregator to bridge the\ngap between the encoder and decoder, enhancing cross-scale information exchange\nin complex aerial scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nproposed method achieves superior performance in comparison to previous\nstate-of-the-art methods on the RRSIS-D and RefSegRS datasets, both\nquantitatively and qualitatively. The code will be released after publication.",

    "abstract": "We study the class of generalized Kerr-Schild (GKS) spacetimes in dimensions\n$n\\geq 3$ and analyze their geometric and algebraic properties in a completely\ntheory-independent setting. First, considering the case of a general null\nvector $\\mathbf{k}$ defined by the GKS metric, we obtain the conditions under\nwhich it is geodesic. Assuming $\\mathbf{k}$ to be geodesic for the remainder of\nthe paper, we examine the alignment properties of the curvature tensors, namely\nthe Ricci and Weyl tensors. We show that the algebraic types of the curvatures\nof the full (GKS) geometry are constrained by those of the respective\nbackground curvatures, thereby listing all kinematically allowed combinations\nof the algebraic types for the background and the full geometry. A notable\naspect of these results is that, unlike the case of Kerr-Schild (KS)\nspacetimes, the Weyl types of the GKS spacetimes need not be type $II$ or more\nspecial. Then, focusing on the case of an expanding $\\mathbf k$, we derive the\nconditions for it to satisfy the optical constraint, extending the previous\nresults of KS spacetimes. We illustrate the general results using the example\nof (A)dS-Taub-NUT spacetimes in $n=4$, where we also comment on their KS double\ncopy from a GKS perspective. Finally, as an application of our general results,\nwe obtain the full family of GKS spacetimes with a geodesic, expanding,\ntwistfree, and shearfree $\\mathbf k$, satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations,\nand identify it with a subset of the higher-dimensional vacuum\nRobinson-Trautman solutions.

    "abstract": "Current optical flow methods exploit the stable appearance of frame (or RGB)\ndata to establish robust correspondences across time. Event cameras, on the\nother hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in\nchallenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the\npotential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation.\nHowever, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary\nadvantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study\nintroduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the\naggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective\ncross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame\nrepresentation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic\nstructure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality\nand employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust\nmotion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of\nmotion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a\ntransformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with\nspatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation.\nAdditionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive\nspatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments\non the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nframework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our\nmethod achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the\nevent-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\\%. Furthermore, it\noutperforms the state-of-the-art fusion-based method with a 4\\% accuracy gain\nand a 45\\% reduction in inference time.",

It is\ndemonstrated that an extreme nonreciprocity where two critical currents can\nbecome both positive (or negative) has been observed in a recent experiment. In\nthis work, we theoretically propose a possible mechanism to realize an extreme\nnonreciprocal SDE. Based on a microscopic theory and a simple valley-polarized\nmodel, we demonstrate that depairing currents required to dissolve Cooper pairs\ncan be remodulated under the interplay between the valley polarization and the\napplied current. Near the disappearance of the superconductivity, the\nremodulation is shown to induce the extreme nonreciprocity and also the\ncurrent-induced re-entrant superconductivity where the system has two different\ncritical current intervals.

It is well-known\nthat the depth and size of decision trees are closely related to time and\nnumber of processors respectively for computing functions in the CREW-PRAM\nmodel. For a given $f$, a fundamental goal is to minimize the depth and/or the\nsize of the decision tree computing it.\n  In this paper, we extend the decision tree model to the world of hazard-free\ncomputation. We allow each query to produce three results: zero, one, or\nunknown. The output could also be: zero, one, or unknown, with the constraint\nthat we should output \"unknown\" only when we cannot determine the answer from\nthe input bits. This setting naturally gives rise to ternary decision trees\ncomputing functions, which we call hazard-free decision trees. We prove various\nlower and upper bounds on the depth and size of hazard-free decision trees and\ncompare them to their Boolean counterparts. We prove optimal separations and\nrelate hazard-free decision tree parameters to well-known Boolean function\nparameters. We show that the analogues of sensitivity, block sensitivity, and\ncertificate complexity for hazard-free functions are all polynomially\nequivalent to each other and to hazard-free decision tree depth. i.e., we prove\nthe sensitivity theorem in the hazard-free model. We then prove that\nhazard-free sensitivity satisfies an interesting structural property that is\nknown to hold in the Boolean world. Hazard-free functions with small\nhazard-free sensitivity are completely determined by their values in any\nHamming ball of small radius in $\\{0, u, 1\\}^n$.",

While deep\nlearning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their\nblack-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently,\nlarge language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due\nto their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable\ndecisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive\ntasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in\ncryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in\ntheir training corpora.\n  To overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal,\nmulti-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment.

The results\ndemonstrate that haptic force feedback enhances physical perception\ncapabilities and complex task operating abilities. In addition, it compensates\nfor visual perception deficiencies and reduces the operator's work burden.\nConsequently, our proposed system achieves more intuitive, realistic and\nimmersive teleoperation, improves operating efficiency, and expands the\ncomplexity of tasks that robots can perform through teleoperation.",

    "abstract": "Lenses are typically based on refractive index profiles derived from the\ngeometric approximation of high-frequency waves, yet the critical issue of\nimpedance mismatch is often neglected. Mismatched devices suffer from unwanted\nreflections and dispersion, which can significantly degrade performance in\npractical applications. In this work, we propose impedance profiles for lenses\nto achieve efficient wave transmission while maintaining the desired refractive\nindex and minimizing dispersion effects. A family of impedance profiles is\nderived from the acoustic wave equation such that the phase velocity is\npreserved. First, the 1D setting is considered to explain how dispersion occurs\ninside a lens and at its interfaces. Then, the method is applied to 2D\naxisymmetric configurations where the impedance mismatch is radially\nredistributed. These profiles are demonstrated in the acoustic setting of a\nLuneburg lens, but can be easily extended to more general scenarios such as\nimaging or cloaking in air and water, where matching the impedance of the\nbackground poses significant challenges.",

The standard TTA mainly considers\nthe case where the target domain is static, while the continual TTA needs to\nundergo a sequence of domain changes. This encounters a significant challenge\nas the model needs to adapt for the long-term and is unaware of when the domain\nchanges occur. The quality of pseudo-labels is hard to guarantee. Noisy\npseudo-labels produced by simple self-training methods can cause error\naccumulation and catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose a new\nframework named SPARNet which consists of two parts, sample partitioning\nstrategy and anti-forgetting regularization. The sample partition strategy\ndivides samples into two groups, namely reliable samples and unreliable\nsamples. According to the characteristics of each group of samples, we choose\ndifferent strategies to deal with different groups of samples. This ensures\nthat reliable samples contribute more to the model. At the same time, the\nnegative impacts of unreliable samples are eliminated by the mean teacher's\nconsistency learning. Finally, we introduce a regularization term to alleviate\nthe catastrophic forgetting problem, which can limit important parameters from\nexcessive changes.

This data representation is effective for studying the\nmoduli space of HCMU surfaces with specified genus and conical angles,\nsuggesting a topological approach to this topic. As a first application, we\npresent a unified proof of the angle constraints on HCMU surfaces. Using the\nsame approach, we establish an existence theorem for HCMU surfaces of any genus\nwith a single conical point, which is also a saddle point. Finally, we\ndetermine the dimension of the moduli space, defined as the number of\nindependent continuous parameters.

However,\nin computations of the incident flux thermalization and subsequent re-emission\nin the optical-UV band the lamppost approximation is most frequently assumed.\nWe test if the UV-optical reverberation mapping and time delay measurements are\nsensitive to this assumption. We assume that the incident radiation originates\nfrom a region extended along the symmetry axis. To model this, we adopt a\nsimple setup by representing the emission as two lamps irradiating the disk\nsimultaneously from two different heights. We then compare the resulting\npredictions with those obtained for a single lamppost located at an\nintermediate height. We show at the basis of the transfer function that the\ndeviation of the wavelength-dependent delay curve shows at most a difference of\n20% in comparison to a single lamppost, assuming the black hole mass of $10^8\nM_{\\odot}$, Eddington ratio 1, and the location of the lamps at 5 and 100 r$g$.\nThe maximum deviation happens for the lamp luminosity ratio $\\sim3$. When\nsimulating light curves for a two-lamp setup and a standard lamppost with the\nsame black hole mass and a sampling rate of 0.1 days, we find no measurable\ndifferences in the ICCF profiles between the two setups. Larger black hole mass\nand considerably lower Eddington ratio would allow to see larger differences\nbetween a single lamppost and a two-lampost model.

    "abstract": "This work presents stellar weak rates and mass fractions of 20 most important\nelectron capture (ec) and beta decay (bd) nuclei with $A < 65$ according to a\nrecent study during the presupernova evolution of massive stars. The mass\nfractions of these nuclei were calculated using the Sahas equation which\nassumes nuclear statistical equilibrium for a set of initial conditions ($T_9$,\n$\\rho$ and $Y_e$) that represents the trajectory which a massive stars central\nregion takes after its silicon core burns. Our computed mass fractions were\nfound in decent comparison in most cases, and up to a factor 4 difference was\nnoted when compared with the Independent Particle Model results. The weak\ninteraction (ec and bd) rates were calculated in a totally microscopic fashion\nusing the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase ap proximation model and\nwithout assuming the Brink Axel hypothesis. The rates were computed for a wide\nrange of density ($10$-$10^{11}$) g/cm$^3$ and temperature (0.01-30) GK. In\ncomparison with large scale shell model, our computed rates were found bigger\nat high values of core temperature. The current study may contribute in a more\nrealistic simu lation of stellar evolution processes and modeling of core\ncollapse supernovae.",

    "abstract": "The task of long-term action anticipation demands solutions that can\neffectively model temporal dynamics over extended periods while deeply\nunderstanding the inherent semantics of actions. Traditional approaches, which\nprimarily rely on recurrent units or Transformer layers to capture long-term\ndependencies, often fall short in addressing these challenges. Large Language\nModels (LLMs), with their robust sequential modeling capabilities and extensive\ncommonsense knowledge, present new opportunities for long-term action\nanticipation. In this work, we introduce the ActionLLM framework, a novel\napproach that treats video sequences as successive tokens, leveraging LLMs to\nanticipate future actions. Our baseline model simplifies the LLM architecture\nby setting future tokens, incorporating an action tuning module, and reducing\nthe textual decoder layer to a linear layer, enabling straightforward action\nprediction without the need for complex instructions or redundant descriptions.\nTo further harness the commonsense reasoning of LLMs, we predict action\ncategories for observed frames and use sequential textual clues to guide\nsemantic understanding. In addition, we introduce a Cross-Modality Interaction\nBlock, designed to explore the specificity within each modality and capture\ninteractions between vision and textual modalities, thereby enhancing\nmultimodal tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed ActionLLM framework, encouraging a promising\ndirection to explore LLMs in the context of action anticipation.

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems\nnecessitates advanced, interpretable, and scalable intrusion detection systems\n(IDS) to combat emerging cyber threats. Traditional IDS face challenges such as\nhigh computational demands, limited explainability, and inflexibility against\nevolving attack patterns. To address these limitations, this study introduces\nthe Lightweight Explainable Network Security framework (LENS-XAI), which\ncombines robust intrusion detection with enhanced interpretability and\nscalability. LENS-XAI integrates knowledge distillation, variational\nautoencoder models, and attribution-based explainability techniques to achieve\nhigh detection accuracy and transparency in decision-making. By leveraging a\ntraining set comprising 10% of the available data, the framework optimizes\ncomputational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experimental\nevaluation on four benchmark datasets: Edge-IIoTset, UKM-IDS20, CTU-13, and\nNSL-KDD, demonstrates the framework's superior performance, achieving detection\naccuracies of 95.34%, 99.92%, 98.42%, and 99.34%, respectively. Additionally,\nthe framework excels in reducing false positives and adapting to complex attack\nscenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Key strengths of\nLENS-XAI include its lightweight design, suitable for resource-constrained\nenvironments, and its scalability across diverse IIoT and cybersecurity\ncontexts. Moreover, the explainability module enhances trust and transparency,\ncritical for practical deployment in dynamic and sensitive applications. This\nresearch contributes significantly to advancing IDS by addressing computational\nefficiency, feature interpretability, and real-world applicability.

We demonstrate by\ndirect numerical simulations how a group of mesoscale swimmers immersed in a\nturbulent flow alters the shape of the odor plume they release in the water.\nOdor mixing is enhanced by increased velocity fluctuations and a\nswimmer-induced flow circulation which widen the odor plume at close range\nwhile speeding up dilution of the chemical trace. Beyond a short-range increase\nin the likelihood of being detected, swimming considerably reduces detections\nwith effects that can persist at distances of the order of ten times the size\nof the group or more. We find that puller-like swimmers are more effective at\nolfactory shielding than pusher-like swimmers. We trace this difference back to\nthe dynamics at the swimmer location, which tends to trap odor at the source\nfor pushers and to dilute it for pullers. Olfactory shielding is robust to\nchanges in the conditions, and is more pronounced for weak turbulent Reynolds\nnumbers and large swimmer Reynolds numbers.

In this article, it is theoretically shown that two aspects have to\nbe fulfilled for the chiral induced spin selectivity effect to arise. First,\nchirality is a necessary condition for breaking spin-degeneracy in molecular\nstructures that do not comprise heavy elements. Second, dissipation is\nindispensable for the molecule to develop a non-vanishing spin-polarization.\nThese theoretical conclusions are illustrated in terms of a few examples,\nshowing the necessity of the two aspects to be coordinated for the emergence of\nthe chiral induced spin selectivity effect.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel meshless simulation method for the McKean-Vlasov\nStochastic Differential Equation (MV-SDE) utilizing deep learning, applicable\nto both self-interaction and interaction scenarios. Traditionally, numerical\nmethods for this equation rely on the interacting particle method combined with\ntechniques based on the It\\^o-Taylor expansion. The convergence rate of this\napproach is determined by two parameters: the number of particles $N$ and the\ntime step size $h$ for each Euler iteration. However, for extended time\nhorizons or equations with larger Lipschitz coefficients, this method is often\nlimited, as it requires a significant increase in Euler iterations to achieve\nthe desired precision $\\epsilon$. To overcome the challenges posed by the\ndifficulty of parallelizing the simulation of continuous interacting particle\nsystems, which involve solving high-dimensional coupled SDEs, we propose a\nmeshless MV-SDE solver grounded in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)\nthat does not rely on the propagation of chaos result. Our method constructs a\npseudo MV-SDE using It\\^o calculus, then quantifies the discrepancy between\nthis equation and the original MV-SDE, with the error minimized through a loss\nfunction. This loss is controlled via an optimization algorithm, independent of\nthe time step size, and we provide an error estimate for the loss function.

Proposed mechanisms for the polymorphism such as\nnegative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) and heterozygote advantage (HA)\nfocus on HLA alleles, not haplotypes. Here, we propose a model for the\npolymorphism in which infectious diseases impose independent density-dependent\nregulation on HLA haplotypes. More specifically, a complex pathogen environment\ndrives extensive host polymorphism through a guild of HLA haplotypes that are\nspecialised and show incomplete peptide recognition. Separation of haplotype\nguilds is maintained by limiting similarity. The outcome is a wide and stable\nrange of haplotype densities at steady-state in which effective Fisher\nfitnesses are zero.

    "abstract": "Prenatal ultrasound evaluates fetal growth and detects congenital\nabnormalities during pregnancy, but the examination of ultrasound images by\nradiologists requires expertise and sophisticated equipment, which would\notherwise fail to improve the rate of identifying specific types of fetal\ncentral nervous system (CNS) abnormalities and result in unnecessary patient\nexaminations. We construct a deep learning model to improve the overall\naccuracy of the diagnosis of fetal cranial anomalies to aid prenatal diagnosis.\nIn our collected multi-center dataset of fetal craniocerebral anomalies\ncovering four typical anomalies of the fetal central nervous system (CNS):\nanencephaly, encephalocele (including meningocele), holoprosencephaly, and\nrachischisis, patient-level prediction accuracy reaches 94.5%, with an AUROC\nvalue of 99.3%. In the subgroup analyzes, our model is applicable to the entire\ngestational period, with good identification of fetal anomaly types for any\ngestational period. Heatmaps superimposed on the ultrasound images not only\nprovide a visual interpretation for the algorithm but also provide an intuitive\nvisual aid to the physician by highlighting key areas that need to be reviewed,\nhelping the physician to quickly identify and validate key areas. Finally, the\nretrospective reader study demonstrates that by combining the automatic\nprediction of the DL system with the professional judgment of the radiologist,\nthe diagnostic accuracy and efficiency can be effectively improved and the\nmisdiagnosis rate can be reduced, which has an important clinical application\nprospect.",

    "abstract": "Sign language is the primary communication mode for 72 million\nhearing-impaired individuals worldwide, necessitating effective bidirectional\nSign Language Production and Sign Language Translation systems. However,\nfunctional bidirectional systems require a unified linguistic environment,\nhindered by the lack of suitable unified datasets, particularly those providing\nthe necessary pose information for accurate Sign Language Production (SLP)\nevaluation. Concurrently, current SLP evaluation methods like back-translation\nignore pose accuracy, and high-quality coordinated generation remains\nchallenging. To create this crucial environment and overcome these challenges,\nwe introduce CNText2Sign and CNSign, which together constitute the first\nunified dataset aimed at supporting bidirectional accessibility systems for\nChinese sign language; CNText2Sign provides 15,000 natural language-to-sign\nmappings and standardized skeletal keypoints for 8,643 vocabulary items\nsupporting pose assessment. Building upon this foundation, we propose the\nAuraLLM model, which leverages a decoupled architecture with CNText2Sign's pose\ndata for novel direct gesture accuracy assessment. The model employs retrieval\naugmentation and Cascading Vocabulary Resolution to handle semantic mapping and\nout-of-vocabulary words and achieves all-scenario production with controllable\ncoordination of gestures and facial expressions via pose-conditioned video\nsynthesis. Concurrently, our Sign Language Translation model SignMST-C employs\ntargeted self-supervised pretraining for dynamic feature capture, achieving new\nSOTA results on PHOENIX2014-T with BLEU-4 scores up to 32.08.

    "abstract": "This paper is a continuation of a series of studies investigating collisional\ndepolarization of solar molecular lines like those of MgH, CN and C$_2$. It is\nfocused on the case of the solar molecule C$_2$ which exhibits striking\nscattering polarization profiles although its intensity profiles are\ninconspicuous and barely visible. In fact, interpretation of the C$_2$\npolarization in terms of magnetic fields is incomplete due to the almost\ncomplete lack of collisional data. This work aims at accurately computing the\ncollisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the C$_2$~$(X\n^1\\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\\Pi_u)$ by isotropic collisions with hydrogen atoms\nH~$(^2S_{1/2})$. We also investigate the solar implications of our findings. We\nutilize the MOLPRO package to obtain potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the\nelectronic states $X ^1\\Sigma^+_g$ and $a^3\\Pi_u$ of C$_2$, and the MOLSCAT\ncode to study the quantum dynamics of the C$_2$~$(X ^1\\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\\Pi_u)$ +\nH$(^2S_{1/2})$ systems. We use the tensorial irreducible basis to express the\nresulting collisional cross-sections and rates. Furthermore, sophisticated\ngenetic programming techniques are employed to determine analytical expressions\nfor the temperature and total molecular angular momentum dependence of these\ncollisional rates. We obtain quantum depolarization and polarization transfer\nrates for the C$_2$ $(X ^1\\Sigma^+_g, a ^3\\Pi_u)$ + H$(^2S_{1/2})$ collisions\nin the temperature range T=2,000--15,000~K. We also determine analytical\nexpressions giving these rates as functions of the temperature and total\nmolecular angular momentum. In addition, we show that isotropic collisions with\nneutral hydrogen can only partially depolarize the lower state of C$_2$ lines,\nrather than completely. This highlights the limitations of the approximation of\nneglecting lower-level polarization while modeling the polarization of C$_2$\nlines.",

The core innovation of CausalBGM\nlies in its ability to estimate the individual treatment effect (ITE) by\nlearning individual-specific distributions of a low-dimensional latent feature\nset (e.g., latent confounders) that drives changes in both treatment and\noutcome. This approach not only effectively mitigates confounding effects but\nalso provides comprehensive uncertainty quantification, offering reliable and\ninterpretable causal effect estimates at the individual level. CausalBGM adopts\na Bayesian model and uses a novel iterative algorithm to update the model\nparameters and the posterior distribution of latent features until convergence.\nThis framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex dependencies among\nvariables while adhering to the Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that CausalBGM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nparticularly in scenarios with high-dimensional covariates and large-scale\ndatasets. Its Bayesian foundation ensures statistical rigor, providing robust\nand well-calibrated posterior intervals. By addressing key limitations of\nexisting methods, CausalBGM emerges as a robust and promising framework for\nadvancing causal inference in modern applications in fields such as genomics,\nhealthcare, and social sciences.

Achieving this requires\nsufficient data; however, unauthorized access by an eavesdropping learner can\nlead to security risks. Thus, it is important to ensure the performance of the\n\"authorized\" learner by limiting the quality of the training data accessible to\neavesdroppers. Unlike previous studies focusing on encryption or access\ncontrols, we provide a theorem to ensure superior learning outcomes exclusively\nfor the authorized learner with quantum label encoding. In this context, we use\nthe probably-approximately-correct (PAC) learning framework and introduce the\nconcept of learning probability to quantitatively assess learner performance.\nOur theorem allows the condition that, given a training dataset, an authorized\nlearner is guaranteed to achieve a certain quality of learning outcome, while\neavesdroppers are not. Notably, this condition can be constructed based only on\nthe authorized-learning-only measurable quantities of the training data, i.e.,\nits size and noise degree.

    "abstract": "In ultrarelativistic collisions of nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider, the\ncreated QCD environment rapidly changes, leading to a non-adiabatic evolution\nof the quantum states involved. Considering this, we first examine the\npre-equilibrium state of QCD matter and its effect on the initially produced\ncharmonium using a temperature-independent Hamiltonian. As the QCD matter\nreaches local thermal equilibrium, this Hamiltonian transforms to its finite\ntemperature counterpart. To model the pre-equilibrium stage, we use the\nbottom-up thermalization approach to determine the effective temperature of the\nQCD matter, followed by a Gubser-type expansion for the thermalized medium.\nAdditionally, we consider collisional damping, gluonic dissociation, and\nregeneration mechanisms, which specifically modify the charmonium yield in the\nthermalized medium. Mainly, the gluonic dissociation and collisional damping\ncause a reduction in the yield conversely, regeneration through gluonic\ndeexcitation enhances the yield of charmonium. Further, we explore the combined\neffects of these mechanisms on the collective yield of charmonium states with\ntransverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) and event multiplicity in the proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Based on our findings, we contend that the\ncombined effects of these mechanisms can serve as a robust probe for\ndetermining the possible existence of a thermalized QCD medium in such a small\ncollision system.",

    "abstract": "We propose Foreground-Covering Prototype Generation and Matching to resolve\nFew-Shot Segmentation (FSS), which aims to segment target regions in unlabeled\nquery images based on labeled support images. Unlike previous research, which\ntypically estimates target regions in the query using support prototypes and\nquery pixels, we utilize the relationship between support and query prototypes.\nTo achieve this, we utilize two complementary features: SAM Image Encoder\nfeatures for pixel aggregation and ResNet features for class consistency.\nSpecifically, we construct support and query prototypes with SAM features and\ndistinguish query prototypes of target regions based on ResNet features. For\nthe query prototype construction, we begin by roughly guiding foreground\nregions within SAM features using the conventional pseudo-mask, then employ\niterative cross-attention to aggregate foreground features into learnable\ntokens. Here, we discover that the cross-attention weights can effectively\nalternate the conventional pseudo-mask. Therefore, we use the attention-based\npseudo-mask to guide ResNet features to focus on the foreground, then infuse\nthe guided ResNet feature into the learnable tokens to generate\nclass-consistent query prototypes. The generation of the support prototype is\nconducted symmetrically to that of the query one, with the pseudo-mask replaced\nby the ground-truth mask. Finally, we compare these query prototypes with\nsupport ones to generate prompts, which subsequently produce object masks\nthrough the SAM Mask Decoder. Our state-of-the-art performances on various\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for FSS. Our\nofficial code is available at https://github.com/SuhoPark0706/FCP",

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines\nhas transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems\nare vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks,\nwhere attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and\npromote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this\npaper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this\nproblem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players\nstrategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions\nunder which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as\nattack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that\ninfluence player behavior.

Most\nepidemic outbreaks are likely to create multiple mutations during their\nspreading over the population. In this paper, we study the evolution of a\npathogen which can mutate continuously during the epidemic spreading. We\nconsider pathogens whose mutating parameter is the mortality mean-time, and\nstudy the evolution of this parameter over the spreading process. We use\nanalytical methods to compute the dynamic equation of the epidemic and the\nconditions for it to spread.

    "abstract": "The restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method (rPDHG) is a first-order\nmethod that has recently received significant attention for its computational\neffectiveness in solving linear program (LP) problems. Despite its impressive\npractical performance, the theoretical iteration bounds for rPDHG can be\nexponentially poor. To shrink this gap between theory and practice, we show\nthat rPDHG achieves polynomial-time complexity in a high-probability sense,\nunder assumptions on the probability distribution from which the data instance\nis generated. We consider not only Gaussian distribution models but also\nsub-Gaussian distribution models as well.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised feature selection (UFS) is widely applied in machine learning\nand pattern recognition. However, most of the existing methods only consider a\nsingle sparsity, which makes it difficult to select valuable and discriminative\nfeature subsets from the original high-dimensional feature set. In this paper,\nwe propose a new UFS method called DSCOFS via embedding double sparsity\nconstrained optimization into the classical principal component analysis (PCA)\nframework. Double sparsity refers to using $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm and $\\ell_0$-norm\nto simultaneously constrain variables, by adding the sparsity of different\ntypes, to achieve the purpose of improving the accuracy of identifying\ndifferential features. The core is that $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm can remove irrelevant\nand redundant features, while $\\ell_0$-norm can filter out irregular noisy\nfeatures, thereby complementing $\\ell_{2,0}$-norm to improve discrimination. An\neffective proximal alternating minimization method is proposed to solve the\nresulting nonconvex nonsmooth model. Theoretically, we rigorously prove that\nthe sequence generated by our method globally converges to a stationary point.\nNumerical experiments on three synthetic datasets and eight real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and convergence of the proposed\nmethod. In particular, the average clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized\nmutual information (NMI) are improved by at least 3.34% and 3.02%,\nrespectively, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, two\ncommon statistical tests and a new feature similarity metric verify the\nadvantages of double sparsity.

A mathematical model\nfor energy expenditure can be useful in estimating real-time costs of movements\nor to predict energy optimal movements. Metabolic cost models developed so far\nhave predominantly aimed at dynamic movement tasks, where mechanical work\ndominates. Further, while it is known that both force magnitude and rate of\nchange of force (force rate) affect metabolic cost, it is not known how these\nterms interact, or if the force rate dependence can be a consequence of the\nforce dependence. Here, we performed extensive human subject experiments,\ninvolving each subject over 5 hours of metabolic trials, which systematically\nchanged the mean forces and forces rates so as to characterize a holistic\nrelation for metabolic cost based on both force and force rate -- or\nanalogously, torque and torque rate. Our experiments involved humans producing\nsymmetric or asymmetric sinusoidal forces with different means, amplitudes,\nfrequencies, and rise and fall periods. We showed that the metabolic cost can\nbe well-approximated by a sum of power law functions of torque and torque rate.\nWe found that the metabolic cost scales non-linearly with joint torque (with\nexponent = 1.36) and non-linearly with torque rate (with exponent = 2.5).\nSurprisingly, the data suggested that the cost was roughly four times higher\nfor decreasing the torque than increasing, mirroring the analogous ratio\nbetween the cost of positive and negative work. Using these metabolic cost\nrelations, we show that if the metabolic cost scales with particular exponents\nwith muscle force and force rates, the same exponents will be observed in\nmulti-joint tasks with multiple muscles. Our new metabolic cost model involving\nboth force and force rate will potentially allow better predictions of energy\noptimal movements and thus inform wearable robot design and analysis.",

Unlike on\ntreadmills, participants can vary both speed and gait during this task. We find\nthat gait transition in this overground task occurs over a broad `gait\ntransition regime' spanning average speeds from 1.9 m/s to 3.0 m/s. In this\nregime, people use mixtures of walking and running: mostly walking at low\naverage speeds (around 1.9 m/s) and mostly running at high average speeds (3.0\nm/s); the walk vs run fraction gradually changes between these speed limits.\nWithin any walk-run mixture, there is a speed gap between the walking and\nrunning. These gait mixtures and their specific structure are predicted by\nenergy optimality. These findings extend earlier results from much shorter\ndistance tasks, showing that similar energetic principles govern longer, more\nphysically and cognitively demanding tasks.

An analogous problem associated\nwith Catalan numbers is also presented, which has a simpler feature in terms of\nanalysis. The third enumeration problem is a quest of identifying a hidden\ncurve behind the Ap\\'ery sequence, which remains to be discovered.\n  It is examined how a counting problem leads to a \\emph{spectral curve}\nthrough a differential equation, of Picard-Fuchs type but can be nonlinear. The\ncounting problem is a geometric question associated with the \\emph{genus $0$,\none marked point} case. Going from the $(0,1)$-case to arbitrary $(g,n)$-case\nis explained as a process of \\emph{quantization} of the spectral curve.\n  This perspective of quantization is discussed in a geometric setting, when\nthe differential equations have holomorphic coefficients, in terms of Higgs\nbundles, opers, and Gaiotto's conformal limit construction. In this context,\nhowever, there are no counting problems behind the scene.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing the long-term behavior of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical\nsystems remains a significant challenge. While the Koopman operator framework\nprovides a powerful global linearization tool, current methods for\napproximating its spectral components often face theoretical limitations and\ndepend on predefined dictionaries. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD)\nadvanced the field by introducing the \\emph{spectral residual} to assess\nKoopman operator approximation accuracy; however, its approach of only\nfiltering precomputed spectra prevents the discovery of the operator's complete\nspectral information, a limitation known as the `spectral inclusion' problem.\nWe introduce ResKoopNet (Residual-based Koopman-learning Network), a novel\nmethod that directly addresses this by explicitly minimizing the \\emph{spectral\nresidual} to compute Koopman eigenpairs. This enables the identification of a\nmore precise and complete Koopman operator spectrum. Using neural networks, our\napproach provides theoretical guarantees while maintaining computational\nadaptability. Experiments on a variety of physical and biological systems show\nthat ResKoopNet achieves more accurate spectral approximations than existing\nmethods, particularly for high-dimensional systems and those with continuous\nspectra, which demonstrates its effectiveness as a tool for analyzing complex\ndynamical systems.",

However, no coherence peak in $1/T_1$\nhas been observed in unconventional superconductors like cuprates. In this\nstudy, an unconventional coherence peak is identified for the first time using\nnuclear quadrupole resonance on YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, pointing to a distinctive\npairing symmetry. The spin-lattice relaxation rate in nuclear quadrupole\nresonance and nuclear magnetic resonance with nuclear spin $I>1/2$ comprises\nthe magnetic relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\\rm mag}$, which probes magnetic\nfluctuations, and the quadrupole relaxation rate $1/T_{1}^{\\rm quad}$, which\nprobes charge fluctuations. By utilizing $^{63}$Cu and $^{65}$Cu isotopes, we\nsuccessfully distinguish $1/T_{1}^{\\rm mag}$ and $1/T_{1 }^{\\rm quad}$ of\nYBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$ and reveal the presence of the coherence peak in $1/T_{1\n}^{\\rm quad}$ but not in $1/T_{1}^{\\rm mag}$, in contrast to conventional\nsuperconductors. Our finding demonstrates that unconventional superconductors\ndo not exhibit a coherence peak in $1/T_{1}$ when the relaxation is due to\nfluctuations of the hyperfine field. Conversely, a coherence peak is expected\nwhen the relaxation is caused by electric field gradient fluctuations, due to\nthe different coherence factors between charge and magnetic fluctuations. Our\nsuccessful measurements of $1/T_{1}$ for the chains of YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$\nsuggest that, should the conditions for predominant quadrupole relaxation be\nsatisfied, this phenomenon could provide a novel approach to exploring the\nunconventional nature of the pairing mechanism in other superconductors.",

Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) can benefit from this paradigm\nby enabling multi-tier model aggregation across distributed computing nodes.\nHowever, the potential of HFL is significantly constrained by the inherent\nheterogeneity and dynamic characteristics of EECC environments. Specifically,\nthe uniform model structure bounded by the least powerful end device across all\ncomputing nodes imposes a performance bottleneck. Meanwhile, coupled\nheterogeneity in data distributions and resource capabilities across tiers\ndisrupts hierarchical knowledge transfer, leading to biased updates and\ndegraded performance. Furthermore, the mobility and fluctuating connectivity of\ncomputing nodes in EECC environments introduce complexities in dynamic node\nmigration, further compromising the robustness of the training process. To\naddress multiple challenges within a unified framework, we propose\nEnd-Edge-Cloud Federated Learning with Self-Rectified Knowledge Agglomeration\n(FedEEC), which is a novel EECC-empowered FL framework that allows the trained\nmodels from end, edge, to cloud to grow larger in size and stronger in\ngeneralization ability. FedEEC introduces two key innovations: (1) Bridge\nSample Based Online Distillation Protocol (BSBODP), which enables knowledge\ntransfer between neighboring nodes through generated bridge samples, and (2)\nSelf-Knowledge Rectification (SKR), which refines the transferred knowledge to\nprevent suboptimal cloud model optimization.

Existing methods fall back to\ntraining LLMs with short contexts (a maximum of a few thousands tokens in\ntraining) and use inference time techniques when evaluating on long contexts\n(above 1M tokens context window at inference). As opposed to\nlong-context-inference, training on very long context input prompts is quickly\nlimited by GPU memory availability and by the prohibitively long training times\nit requires on state-of-the-art hardware. Meanwhile, many real-life\napplications require not only inference but also training/fine-tuning with long\ncontext on specific tasks. Such applications include, for example, augmenting\nthe context with various sources of raw reference information for fact\nextraction, fact summarization, or fact reconciliation tasks. We propose\nadjoint sharding, a novel technique that comprises sharding gradient\ncalculation during training to reduce memory requirements by orders of\nmagnitude, making training on very long context computationally tractable.\nAdjoint sharding is based on the adjoint method and computes equivalent\ngradients to backpropagation. We also propose truncated adjoint sharding to\nspeed up the algorithm while maintaining performance.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a high-performance Soft-Core Processor based data\nacquisition system designed for handling Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs). The\nDAQ consist of FPGA-based hardware equipped with Soft-Core Processor and\nembedded hardwired Ethernet controllers named RPC-DAQ, offering a versatile and\nfast network-enabled data acquisition solution. A soft processor, NIOS, is\ninstantiated within an Intel Cyclone IV FPGA, overseeing control,\ncommunication, and data transfer with remote processing units. These integrated\nRPC-DAQ units, in substantial numbers, connect to a limited set of high-end\nprocessing units via LAN switches. This paper provides a detailed account of\nthe software implementation scheme for the NIOS processor in the RPC-DAQ\nsystem. A remarkable 28,800 RPC-DAQ units will be deployed in proximity to the\nRPCs, serving the proposed INO-ICAL experiment in Theni-Madurai, Tamil Nadu.\nThe network-enabled RPC-DAQ units controlled by the soft processor offloads\nFPGA tasks including event data acquisition, periodic health monitoring of\nRPCs, command interfaces, high voltage control, and data transfer to back-end\ndata concentrators. Communication and data transfer are executed efficiently\nvia TCP and UDP protocols over a 100 Mbps Ethernet interface. This system\nprovides innovative solutions to improve data acquisition and control in\nlarge-scale scientific experiments.",

    "abstract": "Global supply lines have been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 epidemic and\nthe conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has sharply increased the price\nof commodities and generated inflation. These incidents highlight how critical\nit is to improve supply chain resilience (SCRES) in order to fend off\nunforeseen setbacks. Controlling both internal and external interruptions, such\nas transportation problems brought on by natural catastrophes and wars, is the\nresponsibility of SCRES. Enhancing resilience in supply chains requires\naccurate and timely information transfer. Promising answers to these problems\ncan be found in the Metaverse and ChatGPT, two new digital technologies. The\nMetaverse may imitate real-world situations and offer dynamic, real-time 3D\nrepresentations of supply chain data by integrating blockchain, IoT, network\nconnection, and computer power.Large-scale natural language processing model\nChatGPT improves communication and data translation accuracy and speed. To\nmanage risk and facilitate decision making in Supply Chain management, firms\nshould increase information transmission, Speed and quality. This study aim to\nshow the importance of ChatGPT and Metaverse technologies to improve SCRES,\nwith an emphasis on the most important criteria for SCRES, and maturity factor\nthat can influence directly the SC development.",

    "abstract": "We propose a quantization of coarse spaces and uniform Roe algebras. The\nobjects are based on the quantum relations introduced by N.

In the case of the diagonal\ninclusion l_infty(X) subset B(l_2(X)), they reduce to the usual constructions.\nQuantum metric spaces furnish natural examples parallel to the classical\nsetting, but we provide other examples that are not inspired by metric\nconsiderations, including the new class of support expansion C*-algebras. We\nalso work out the basic theory for maps between quantum coarse spaces and their\nconsequences for quantum uniform Roe algebras.",

    "abstract": "Solving arithmetic tasks is a simple and fundamental skill, yet modern Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have great difficulty with them. We introduce the\nIntegrated Gated Calculator (IGC), a module that enables LLMs to perform\narithmetic by emulating a calculator on the GPU. We finetune a Llama model with\nour module and test it on the BigBench Arithmetic benchmark, where it beats the\nState of the Art, outperforming all models on the benchmark, including models\nalmost two orders of magnitude larger. Our approach takes only a single\niteration to run and requires no external tools. It performs arithmetic\noperations entirely inside the LLM without the need to produce intermediate\ntokens. It is computationally efficient, interpretable, and avoids side-effects\non tasks that do not require arithmetic operations. It reliably achieves 98\\%\nto 99\\% accuracy across multiple training runs and for all subtasks, including\nthe substantially harder subtask of multiplication, which was previously\nunsolved.",
