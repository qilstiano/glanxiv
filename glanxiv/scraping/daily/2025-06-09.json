    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal vision-language-action (VLA) models have\nrevolutionized traditional robot learning, enabling systems to interpret\nvision, language, and action in unified frameworks for complex task planning.\nHowever, mastering complex manipulation tasks remains an open challenge,\nconstrained by limitations in persistent contextual memory, multi-agent\ncoordination under uncertainty, and dynamic long-horizon planning across\nvariable sequences. To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{HiBerNAC}, a\n\\textbf{Hi}erarchical \\textbf{B}rain-\\textbf{e}mulated \\textbf{r}obotic\n\\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{A}gent \\textbf{C}ollective, inspired by breakthroughs\nin neuroscience, particularly in neural circuit mechanisms and hierarchical\ndecision-making. Our framework combines: (1) multimodal VLA planning and\nreasoning with (2) neuro-inspired reflection and multi-agent mechanisms,\nspecifically designed for complex robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging\nneuro-inspired functional modules with decentralized multi-agent collaboration,\nour approach enables robust and enhanced real-time execution of complex\nmanipulation tasks. In addition, the agentic system exhibits scalable\ncollective intelligence via dynamic agent specialization, adapting its\ncoordination strategy to variable task horizons and complexity. Through\nextensive experiments on complex manipulation tasks compared with\nstate-of-the-art VLA models, we demonstrate that \\textbf{HiBerNAC} reduces\naverage long-horizon task completion time by 23\\%, and achieves non-zero\nsuccess rates (12\\textendash 31\\%) on multi-path tasks where prior\nstate-of-the-art VLA models consistently fail. These results provide indicative\nevidence for bridging biological cognition and robotic learning mechanisms.",

By contrast, active reasoning-where an LLM must interact with\nexternal systems to acquire missing evidence or data-has received little\nsystematic attention. To address this shortfall, we present AR-Bench, a novel\nbenchmark designed explicitly to evaluate an LLM's active reasoning skills.\nAR-Bench comprises three task families-detective cases, situation puzzles, and\nguessing numbers-that together simulate real-world, agentic scenarios and\nmeasure performance across commonsense, logical, and symbolic reasoning\nchallenges. Empirical evaluation on AR-Bench demonstrates that contemporary\nLLMs exhibit pronounced difficulties with active reasoning: they frequently\nfail to acquire or leverage the information needed to solve tasks. This gap\nhighlights a stark divergence between their passive and active reasoning\nabilities. Moreover, ablation studies indicate that even advanced strategies,\nsuch as tree-based searching or post-training approaches, yield only modest\ngains and fall short of the levels required for real-world deployment.\nCollectively, these findings highlight the critical need to advance methodology\nfor active reasoning, e.g., incorporating interactive learning, real-time\nfeedback loops, and environment-aware objectives for training.

Protein\nLanguage Models (pLMs) aim to unlock insights from the vast space of unlabeled\nprotein sequences by learning rich, semantic representations from primary\nsequences via masked language modeling. However, these models typically exhibit\nlimited generative capacity. In this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequence\nModel (DSM), a novel pLM trained with masked diffusion to enable both\nhigh-quality representation learning and generative protein design. DSM builds\nupon the ESM2 architecture by incorporating a masked forward diffusion process\ninspired by the LLaDA framework. After training, DSM is capable of generating\ndiverse, biomimetic sequences that align with expected amino acid compositions,\nsecondary structures, and predicted functions, even with 90\\% token corruption.\nFurthermore, DSM's learned representations match or exceed those of similarly\nsized pLMs on downstream tasks. We also introduce DSM(ppi), a variant\nfine-tuned to generate protein binders by attending to target sequences. We\ndemonstrate DSM(ppi)'s effectiveness on the challenging Bench-tested Binder\nBenchmark (BenchBB), where both DSM and DSM(ppi) produce candidates with\nsuperior predicted binding affinity compared to known binders.

This AMG method extends an idea proposed by Reitzinger and Schoberl.\nThe main feature of the Reitzinger and Schoberl algorithm (RSAMG) is that it\nmaintains null-space properties of the Curl-Curl operator throughout all levels\nof the AMG hierarchy. It does this by enforcing a commuting relationship\ninvolving grid transfers and the discrete gradient operator. This null-space\npreservation property is critical to the algorithm's success, however enforcing\nthis commuting relationship is non-trivial except in the special case where one\nleverages a piece-wise constant nodal interpolation operator. For this reason,\nmesh independent convergence rates are generally not observed for RSAMG due to\nits reliance on sub-optimal piece-wise constant interpolation. We present a new\nAMG algorithm that enforces the same commuting relationship. The main advance\nis that the new structure preserving H-curl algorithm (SpHcurlAMG) does not\nrely on piece-wise constant interpolation and can leverage fairly general and\nmore sophisticated nodal interpolation operators. The key idea is to employ\nenergy minimization AMG (EAMG) to construct edge interpolation grid transfers\nand to enforce the commuting relationship by embedding it as constraints within\nan EAMG procedure. While it might appear that solving such a constrained energy\nminimization is costly, we illustrate how this is not the case in our context.\nNumerical results are then given demonstrating mesh independent convergence\nover a range of test problems.",

These mesoscale features are observed across\nall heliocentric distances, with heightened activity in the young solar wind,\nsuch as successive SMFRs, blobs, and SBs using PSP in situ observations. One\nstudy, in particular, focuses on SMFRs observed during the intervals of PSP\nco-rotating with the Sun, which suggests a similar source of the observed solar\nwind. In this letter, we identified SBs at the boundaries of SMFRs as a\nregularly observed phenomenon and found instances where SBs and SMFRs co-occur,\nwith the significance level $\\alpha<0.05$. The SMFR-related SBs - observed at\nthe leading and trailing edges of an SMFR - exhibit well-organized axial\nco-orientations, with their polarity flipping, meaning the radial direction\nremains constrained while the transversal field reverses. Furthermore, the\naxial field directions of SMFRs-related SBs appear to be more closely connected\nthan to another SB that is spatially closer and are linked to the SMFR\norientation. Our analysis of their relative geometry, which examines the\nalignment between SBs and the SMFR axis, reveals a distinct tendency\nemphasizing their correlation, further supporting the idea that the axes of\nSMFR-related SBs are presumably determined by the SMFR orientation.\nObservations suggest that a fraction of SBs is spatially and temporally\nassociated with SMFRs, implying that processes related to SMFR boundaries may\ncontribute to SB formation, or that SBs tend to develop in magnetic\nenvironments shaped by SMFRs.",

More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to\ngenerate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity.\nHowever, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily\nfocused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal\nmodels for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain\nalignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity\nrecorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with\naudio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized\ninstruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned\nMLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that\ninstruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned\nmultimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for\nboth video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear\ndisentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise\ndifferentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find\nthat MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas\nshowing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and\nlanguage regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide\nclear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the\nalignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping\njoint information processing in both the systems.

Supermassive stars (SMSs) with\nmasses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these\nphenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of\nstellar rotation.

We\ndemonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and\nextends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss\nrates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further\nindicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\\sim 200$ km\ns$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* < 0.1$ for\nintermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than\ntheoretical maximum spins.

We\ndevelop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training\nwith an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to\npromote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it\napplies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned\nexpressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that\nthe LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae\noutperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design\ncomponent through ablation studies.",

    "abstract": "Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a\ntradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in\nsensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose\nHigh-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a\nmethod that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing\nhelpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human\npreferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by\ntraining a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a\ntwo-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the\nreward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost\nconstraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to\nverify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the\nactual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including\nproof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater\nthan a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF\nto align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and\nLLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF\nproduces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and\nhelpfulness compared to previous methods.",

    "abstract": "In hypothesis testing problems the property of strict unbiasedness describes\nwhether a test is able to discriminate, in the sense of a difference in power,\nbetween any distribution in the null hypothesis space and any distribution in\nthe alternative hypothesis space. In this work we examine conditions under\nwhich unbiased tests exist for discrete statistical models. It is shown that\nthe existence of an unbiased test can be reduced to an algebraic criterion; an\nunbiased test exists if and only if there exists a polynomial that separates\nthe null and alternative hypothesis sets. This places a strong, semialgebraic\nrestriction on the classes of null hypotheses that have unbiased tests. The\nminimum degree of a separating polynomial coincides with the minimum sample\nsize that is needed for an unbiased test to exist, termed the unbiasedness\nthreshold. It is demonstrated that Gr\\\"obner basis techniques can be used to\nprovide upper bounds for, and in many cases exactly find, the unbiasedness\nthreshold. Existence questions for uniformly most powerful unbiased tests are\nalso addressed, where it is shown that whether such a test exists can depend\nsubtly on the specified level of the test and the sample size. Numerous\nexamples, concerning tests in contingency tables, linear, log-linear, and\nmixture models are provided.

This technique relies on the use\nof electro-optical devices that modify the phase or amplitude of light fields\nin a controlled manner, the so-called spatial light modulators. However, given\nthat holography typically requires coherent light sources, a common problem\nwith three-dimensional projection is the crosstalk between the layers that make\nup the 3D object. This limits full-depth control and directly affects image\nquality. Interestingly, in the past few years, several methods have proven to\nbe effective in breaking layer crosstalk by erasing the spatial coherence of\nlight. A drawback of such solutions is that, in many cases, additional optical\nresources are required to achieve such a task. In this work, we present a\nmethod for high-density reconstruction of three-dimensional objects using rapid\nmodulation of light fields by means of digital micromirror devices (DMDs). The\n3D reconstruction is performed by discretizing the object into multiplane\nlight-point contours, where the resolution of the contours is controlled by the\ndensity of the light points. This allows us to achieve point separations, in\nthe transverse plane, as small as 100 $\\mu$m. The high refresh rate of the DMD\n($\\sim 10$ kHz) allows for a reconstruction where each point of the 3D image is\nspatially and temporally controlled by independent amplitude holograms, thus\neffectively eliminating coherence-induced multiplane crosstalk without the need\nfor additional optical elements. Because of its simplicity and versatility, we\nbelieve that our method provides a practical route toward compact,\nhigh-resolution 3D holographic projectors.",

TVLA analysis further\nconfirms that synthesized netlists exhibit negligible leakage. Additionally,\ncompared to conventional countermeasures like masking and shuffling, PoSyn\nsignificantly lowers attack success rates, achieving reductions of up to 72%,\nwhile simultaneously enhancing area efficiency by as much as 3.79 times.",

In this work we present late-time optical\nobservations of AT2022cmc, both imaging and spectroscopy, that extend the\noptical dataset to $\\sim 160$ days from the first detection in the observed\nframe. The light curve clearly evolves from red to blue, which we interpret as\na transition from a non-thermally dominated spectral energy distribution (SED)\nto thermally dominated SED. By accounting for the non-thermal emission evident\nin the optical SED at early times, we extract the properties of the thermal\nemission and compare to a sample of optically selected thermal TDEs. We find\nthat the properties of AT2022cmc are consistent with previous correlations\nfound for the evolution and properties of thermal TDEs, with the thermal\nproperties of AT2022cmc aligning with the class of featureless and luminous\nTDEs. The confirmation of this similarity motivates the importance of prompt\nand multi-wavelength follow-up of featureless and luminous TDEs in order to\nfurther explore the connection they have with jetted TDEs.",

RADAR comprises 2980 table query pairs, grounded in real-world data\nspanning 9 domains and 5 data artifact types. In addition to evaluating\nartifact handling, RADAR systematically varies table size to study how\nreasoning performance holds when increasing table size. Our evaluation reveals\nthat, despite decent performance on tables without data artifacts, frontier\nmodels degrade significantly when data artifacts are introduced, exposing\ncritical gaps in their capacity for robust, data-aware analysis.

Through the analytical derivation of dispersion relations by\na first-order expansion of the MHD-EBM equations, we explore the changes in\nwave propagation across a range of heliocentric distances on the linear\nmagnetohydrodynamic modes: the Alfv\\'en mode and the fast and slow magnetosonic\nmodes, as obtained from the ideal MHD-EBM equations. Our findings reveal a\nspatial dependence in the derived dispersion relations that aligns with both\nthe literature and the traditional ideal MHD case in the non-expanding limit,\nthereby helping to bridge the gap between theory and observation in solar wind\ndynamics. We observe a general decrease in wave frequencies as the plasma\nexpands farther from the Sun. This decrease is reflected in the dispersion\nrelations through the radial decrease of both the Alfv\\'en and sound speeds,\nwhich decrease proportionally to $1/R$ and $1/R^{\\gamma - 1}$, respectively,\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the plasma polytropic index. The fast magnetosonic mode\nfrequency and phase speed are significantly affected by the polytropic index\nvalue. We consider three models for the polytropic index evolution in the\nexpanding solar wind: a constant (quasi-adiabatic) case, a radially decreasing\nprofile in the outer heliosphere, and a model incorporating thermodynamic\nheating effects. Notably, we find that in the case of a decreasing polytropic\nindex, the fast magnetosonic mode experiences an acceleration in the distant\nheliosphere, highlighting the significant influence of expansion on solar wind\ndynamics.",

The more general\nverification problem, i.e., checking whether all allowed program runs are\nconsistent with a memory model, has still not been studied as much. The purpose\nof this work is to bridge this gap. We tackle the verification problem, where,\ngiven an implementation described as a register machine, we check if any of its\nruns violates the RA semantics or its Strong (SRA) and Weak (WRA) variants. We\nshow that verifying WRA in this setup is in O([)n5 ], while verifying the RA\nand SRA is in both NP- and coNP-hard, and provide a PSPACE upper bound.

HD209458b, the archetypal hot-Jupiter,\nexhibits relatively weak He I 10830 \\AA\\ and H$\\alpha$ absorption, which has\nbeen interpreted as evidence for a high H/He ratio (98/2), possibly due to\ndiffusive separation.

Our model reproduces the\nobserved He I transit depth and H$\\alpha$ upper limit, showing strong diffusive\nseparation. We match the observations assuming a photoelectron efficiency of\n20-40\\%, depending on the composition of the atmosphere, corresponding to\nmass-loss rates of $1.9-3\\times10^{10}$ g/s. We find that the He I 10830 \\AA\\\ntransit depth is sensitive to both stellar activity and diffusion processes,\nwhile H$\\alpha$ is largely unaffected due to its strong dependence on\nLyman-$\\alpha$ excitation.

Here, we present a\nsymmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment\nGeometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these\nlimitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on\nan augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning\nstructure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known\nlow-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the\nground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy\nfor the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as\nmetal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials.",

In this\npaper we present \\textbf{\\textit{gh0stEdit}}, a vulnerability that\nfundamentally undermines the integrity of Docker images and subverts the\nassumed trust and transparency they utilise.

Our analysis is based on\nnear-infrared time-series photometry in the Y, J, and Ks bands for about 200\nACs in the Magellanic Clouds from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds\nsystem (VMC, 2009-2018). VMC data are complemented with optical photometry from\nGaia DR3 and OGLE-IV, which also provide periods and pulsation modes. Custom\nlight-curve templates were used to derive precise intensity-averaged magnitudes\nfor 118 ACs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 75 in the Small Magellanic\nCloud. These data were used to derive multi-band PL and PW relations,\ncalibrated using the geometric LMC distance from eclipsing binaries. We find\nthat PL relation slopes increase and dispersions decrease with wavelength.\nUsing Gaia parallaxes, we determine the LMC distance modulus and the LMC-SMC\nrelative distance. We also confirm the AC nature of several new candidates in\nGalactic Globular Clusters and derive a distance modulus for the Draco dSph\ngalaxy of 19.425+/-0.048 mag. A 0.1 mag discrepancy with RR Lyrae-based\ndistances may reflect metallicity effects. Future spectroscopic surveys and\nGaia DR4 will help refine the AC distance scale and quantify metallicity\nimpacts.",

[Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2021, 23, 4161], is explained\nby facile thermal migration on top of the Si dimer rows, while diffusion is\ninactive once an Ag adatom lands in one of the optimal binding sites in between\ndimer rows. The previously hypothesized transient mobility due to the hot spot\nformed as an Ag atom lands on the Si surface is found not to contribute\nsignificantly to mobility and dimer formation. The experimental conditions are\nsimulated by a combination of classical dynamics calculations of the deposition\nevents, systematic searches of saddle points representing transition states for\nthermally activated events and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of long\ntimescale evolution of the system over a temperature range from 100 K to 300 K.\nWhile the calculated energy barriers for diffusion parallel and perpendicular\nto the Si dimer rows are found to be nearly equal, indicating isotropic\ndiffusion, the simulations show highly anisotropic diffusion, as the optimal\nmigration mechanism involves multiple hops of Ag adatoms on top of Si dimer\nrows. Impinging Ag atoms are found to have a 90% chance of landing on top of a\ndimer row and while the hot spot created cools down too fast for transient\nmobility to play an important role, the energy barrier for thermally activated\nhops along the dimer row is low enough for migration to be active even at 100\nK. A migrating Ag adatom can dimerise with another Ag adatom sitting at a\nstable binding site in between rows or another adatom on top of the same row.\nThe simulations for deposition at 140 K show that most of the deposited Ag\natoms end up forming dimers.",

While India has achieved progress in overall health indicators\nsince independence, the distribution of health outcomes remains uneven, a fact\nstarkly highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates the\nsocio-economic determinants of health disparities using the National Family and\nHealth Survey (NFHS)-5 data from 2019-20, focusing on both national and\nstate-level analyses, specifically for Maharashtra. Employing a health\neconomics framework, the analysis delves into individual-level data, population\nshares, self-reported morbidity prevalence, and treatment patterns across\ndiverse socio-economic groups. Regression analyses, stratified by gender, are\nconducted to quantify the impact of socio-economic factors on reported\nmorbidity. Furthermore, a Fairlie decomposition, an extension of the Oaxaca\ndecomposition, is utilised to dissect the gender gap in morbidity, assessing\nthe extent to which observed differences are attributable to explanatory\nvariables. The findings reveal a significant burden of self-reported morbidity,\nwith approximately one in nine individuals in India and one in eight in\nMaharashtra reporting morbidity. Notably, women exhibit nearly double the\nmorbidity rate compared to men. The decomposition analysis identifies key\ndrivers of gender disparities. In India, marital status exacerbates these\ndifferences, while insurance coverage, caste, urban residence, and wealth\nmitigate them. In Maharashtra, urban residence and marital status widen the\ngap, whereas religion, caste, and insurance coverage narrow it. This research\nunderscores the importance of targeted policy interventions to address the\ncomplex interplay of socio-economic factors driving health inequalities in\nIndia.",

Accurately determining their full-field distributions\nis essential for optimizing the structural integrity and longevity. However,\nthe experimental effort required for full-field characterization is\nimpractical. Given these challenges, this work proposes a machine learning (ML)\nbased Residual Stress Generator (RSG) to infer full-field stresses from limited\nmeasurements. An extensive dataset was initially constructed by performing\nnumerous process simulations with a diverse parameter set. A ML model based on\nU-Net architecture was then trained to learn the underlying structure through\nsystematic hyperparameter tuning. Then, the model's ability to generate\nsimulated stresses was evaluated, and it was ultimately tested on actual\ncharacterization data to validate its effectiveness. The model's prediction of\nsimulated stresses shows that it achieved excellent predictive accuracy and\nexhibited a significant degree of generalization, indicating that it\nsuccessfully learnt the latent structure of residual stress distribution. The\nRSG's performance in predicting experimentally characterized data highlights\nthe feasibility of the proposed approach in providing a comprehensive\nunderstanding of residual stress distributions from limited measurements,\nthereby significantly reducing experimental efforts.",

To address this challenge, we developed AstroQ, an\nautomated framework for scheduling cadenced observations. We tested this on a\nsuite of Doppler exoplanet programs at Keck Observatory, where the algorithm\npowers the KPF-Community Cadence project. As a point of reference, AstroQ can\ndetermine the provably optimal ordering of 3680 observations of 200 targets --\neach with its own cadence needs and accessibility constraints -- over a six\nmonth period to five minute time resolution. Schedules of this size may be\nconstructed in ~120 seconds on modern workstation, enabling dynamic\nrescheduling due to weather changes, target-of-opportunity interrupts, and\nother needs. A key advantage of AstroQ over manual scheduling is realistic\nprojections of program completion, savings in human effort, and elimination of\nhuman bias in balancing many programs. AstroQ is open source and may be applied\nto other scheduling needs, both in astronomy and beyond.",

These aspects are expressed as latent parameters which\ncontrol a differentiable renderer that performs image reconstruction, so that\nthe model can be trained end-to-end with gradient using reconstruction loss. In\nthis study, we extend the original DVP so that it can handle multiple objects\nin a scene.

To examine the performance of this approach,\nwe propose a new benchmark featuring multiple 2D objects, which subsumes the\npreviously proposed Multi-dSprites dataset while being more parameterizable. We\ncompare the DVP extended in these ways with two baselines (MONet and LIVE) and\ndemonstrate its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality and capacity to\ndecompose overlapping objects.

Some\nwork, however, has suggested that direct compilation from Clifford+T to lattice\nsurgery operations may be beneficial for circuits that have high degrees of\nlogical parallelism. In this study, we analyze the resource costs for\nimplementing Hamiltonian simulation using example approaches from each of these\nleading surface code compilation families. The Hamiltonians whose dynamics we\nconsider are those of the transverse-field Ising model in several geometries,\nthe Kitaev honeycomb model, and the $\\mathrm{\\alpha-RuCl_3}$ complex under a\ntime-varying magnetic field. We show, among other things, that the optimal\nscheme depends on whether Hamiltonian simulation is implemented using the\nquantum signal processing or Trotter-Suzuki algorithms, with Trotterization\nbenefiting by orders of magnitude from direct Clifford+T compilation for these\napplications.

One interesting feature of the proposed algorithm is that the\nregularization parameter of the model and the accuracy of the derivative\napproximations are jointly adjusted using a nonmonotone line search criterion.\nImplementations of the method, where derivative information is computed using\nfinite difference strategies, are discussed.

We derive a distance of\n3.51$\\pm$0.74 kpc, consistent with the position of the Scutum-Crux near arm at\nGalactic longitudes of $\\sim$340$^\\circ$. At this distance, the ionized gas\ntraced by Brackett-$\\gamma$ emission has a radius of 0.27$\\pm$0.06 pc, placing\nthe source in a transition phase between ultra-compact and compact HII regions.\nFrom radio data, we estimate an ionizing photon flux of\nN$_{ly}$=(2.3$\\pm$0.3)$\\times10^{47}$ photons s$^{-1}$, and an electron\ntemperature of T$_e$=(5.4$\\pm$0.2)$\\times$10$^3$ K for the ionized gas. The\nanalysis also reveals an obscured high-density molecular clump southwest of the\nHII region, coincident with an ATLASGAL sub-millimeter peak, indicating a\npotential site of ongoing and triggered star formation as the ionization front\nadvances into the surrounding molecular material. These results suggest that\nIRAS 16475-4609 is a young high-mass star-forming region with stellar feedback\nactively shaping its environment, offering valuable insight into the early\nevolution of compact HII regions.",

Our work\ngeneralizes the physics of the Io plasma torus to propose a hypothetical\ncircumstellar plasma torus generated by exoplanetary volcanism. The\nquasi-steady torus mass is determined by a balance between material injection\nand ejection rates from volcanic activity and corotating magnetospheric\nconvection, respectively. By estimating the Alfv\\'en surfaces of planet-hosting\nstars, we calculate the torus mass-removal timescale for a number of exoplanets\nwith properties amenable to plasma torus construction. Assuming a uniform\ntoroidal geometry comparable to Io's \"warm\" torus, we calculate quasi-steady\ntorus masses inferable from the optical depth of atomic spectral features in\ntorus-contaminated stellar spectra. The calculated quasi-steady masses can be\nused to constrain the volcanic outgassing rates of each species detected in the\ntorus, providing quantitative estimates of bulk volcanic activity and interior\ncomposition with minimal assumptions. Such insight into the interior state of\nan exoplanet is otherwise accessible only after destruction via tidal forces.\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of our method by showcasing known exoplanets\nwhich are susceptible to tidal heating and could generate readily-detectable\ntori with realistic outgassing rates of order 1 ton s$^{-1}$, comparable to the\nIo plasma torus mass injection rate.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of English technical terminology presents a significant\nchallenge to traditional expert-based standardization, particularly in rapidly\ndeveloping areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Manual\napproaches face difficulties in maintaining consistent multilingual\nterminology. To address this, we introduce LLM-BT, a back-translation framework\npowered by large language models (LLMs) designed to automate terminology\nverification and standardization through cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our\nkey contributions include: (1) term-level consistency validation: by performing\nEnglish -> intermediate language -> English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves\nhigh term consistency across different models (such as GPT-4, DeepSeek, and\nGrok). Case studies demonstrate over 90 percent of terms are preserved either\nexactly or semantically; (2) multi-path verification workflow: we develop a\nnovel pipeline described as Retrieve -> Generate -> Verify -> Optimize, which\nsupports both serial paths (e.g., English -> Simplified Chinese -> Traditional\nChinese -> English) and parallel paths (e.g., English -> Chinese / Portuguese\n-> English). BLEU scores and term-level accuracy indicate strong cross-lingual\nrobustness, with BLEU scores exceeding 0.45 and Portuguese term accuracy\nreaching 100 percent; (3) back-translation as semantic embedding: we\nreinterpret back-translation as a form of dynamic semantic embedding that\nuncovers latent trajectories of meaning. In contrast to static embeddings,\nLLM-BT offers transparent, path-based embeddings shaped by the evolution of the\nmodels. This reframing positions back-translation as an active mechanism for\nmultilingual terminology standardization, fostering collaboration between\nmachines and humans - machines preserve semantic integrity, while humans\nprovide cultural interpretation.",

Although there\nare growing interests in developing various unlearning algorithms, it remains\nunclear how to best formulate the unlearning problem. The most popular\nformulation uses a weighted sum of forget and retain loss, but it often leads\nto performance degradation due to the inherent trade-off between forget and\nretain losses. In this work, we argue that it is important to model the\nhierarchical structure of the unlearning problem, where the forget problem\n(which \\textit{unlearns} certain knowledge and/or capabilities) takes priority\nover the retain problem (which preserves model utility). This hierarchical\nstructure naturally leads to a bi-level optimization formulation where the\nlower-level objective focuses on minimizing the forget loss, while the\nupper-level objective aims to maintain the model's utility. Based on this new\nformulation, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Bi-Level UnleaRning\n(\\texttt{BLUR}), which not only possesses strong theoretical guarantees but\nmore importantly, delivers superior performance. In particular, our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that \\texttt{BLUR} consistently outperforms all the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms across various unlearning tasks, models, and\nmetrics.

Importantly, knowledge transfer is achieved\nthrough simple matrix operations, significantly reducing training time and\nmemory usage. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat ETT-CKGE consistently achieves superior or competitive predictive\nperformance, while substantially improving training efficiency and scalability\ncompared to state-of-the-art CKGE methods.

We also consider\na more general class of outer min-$k$-planar graphs, which are graphs admitting\na convex drawing where for every crossing of two edges at least one of these\nedges is crossed at most $k$ times.\n  Firman, Gutowski, Kryven, Okada and Wolff [GD 2024] proved that every outer\n$k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $1.5k+2$ and provided a lower bound of\n$k+2$ for even $k$. We establish a lower bound of $1.5k+0.5$ for every odd $k$.\nAdditionally, they showed that every outer min-$k$-planar graph has treewidth\nat most $3k+1$. We improve this upper bound to $3 \\cdot \\lfloor 0.5k\n\\rfloor+4$.\n  Our approach also allows us to upper bound the separation number, a parameter\nclosely related to treewidth, of outer min-$k$-planar graphs by $2 \\cdot\n\\lfloor 0.5k \\rfloor+4$. This improves the previous bound of $2k+1$ and\nachieves a bound with an optimal multiplicative constant.",

To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual\ndataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and\nSpanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced\ndistribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels.

Given a\nfull-field measurement of the displacement field, for instance as obtained from\ndigital image correlation (DIC), a continuous approximation of the strain field\nis obtained by training a neural network that incorporates Fourier features to\neffectively capture sharp gradients in the data. A physics-based data-driven\nmethod built upon ordinary neural differential equations (NODEs) is employed to\ndiscover constitutive equations. The NODE framework can represent arbitrary\nmaterials while satisfying constraints in the theory of constitutive equations\nby default. To account for heterogeneity, a hyper-network is defined, where the\ninput is the material coordinate system, and the output is the NODE-based\nconstitutive equation. The parameters of the hyper-network are optimized by\nminimizing a multi-objective loss function that includes penalty terms for\nviolations of the strong form of the equilibrium equations of elasticity and\nthe associated Neumann boundary conditions. We showcase the framework with\nseveral numerical examples, including heterogeneity arising from variations in\nmaterial parameters, spatial transitions from isotropy to anisotropy, material\nidentification in the presence of noise, and, ultimately, application to\nexperimental data. As the numerical results suggest, the proposed approach is\nrobust and general in identifying the mechanical properties of heterogeneous\nmaterials with very few assumptions, making it a suitable alternative to\nclassical inverse methods.",

We study the\ntwo-flavor red-green paired color-superconducting (2SC) phase, while allowing\nfor the presence of unpaired strange quarks and blue color light quarks of all\nflavors. Our calculations are based on the SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL)\nmodel, extended to include both vector interactions and the `t Hooft\ndeterminant term. The primary focus is on how variations in the NJL Lagrangian\nparameters -- specifically, the diquark and vector coupling strengths -- affect\nboth the static properties of quark matter, such as its equation of state and\ncomposition, and its dynamical behavior, including bulk viscosity and\nassociated damping timescales. We find that the bulk viscosity and\ncorresponding damping timescale can change by more than an order of magnitude\nupon varying the vector coupling by a factor of two at high densities and by a\nlesser degree at lower densities. This sensitivity primarily arises from the\nsusceptibility of 2SC matter, with a smaller contribution from modifications to\nthe weak interaction rates. In comparison, changes in the diquark coupling have\na more limited impact. The damping of density oscillations in 2SC matter is\nsimilar quantitatively to nucleonic matter and can be a leading mechanism of\ndissipation in merging hybrid stars containing color superconducting cores.\n  -",

State-of-the-art semantic\nsegmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large,\nwell-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate\nground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks\nhave graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or\nconnectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground\ntruth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a\nsemantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI,\nDEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module\nprocesses satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on\nthe entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show\nthat IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and\ntraining with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification.\nIGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and\nmapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery.

The benchmark\ncomprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains\nsuch as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task\nchallenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual\ncontent, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive\ndata through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting\nmultiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by\nrigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability.\nUnlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data\nsources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a\ndiverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure\ncases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding,\nplan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial\nperformance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation,\nand multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed\nfor economic web intelligence.",

    "abstract": "The structure of astrophysical objects is usually modeled under the\nassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, actual configurations may\ndeviate from perfect spherical or isotropic properties. Consequently, cosmic\nobjects are expected to exhibit some degree of anisotropy. This consideration\nalso extends to hypothetical dark structures, such as dark stars and dark\nmatter halos. Although the nature of dark matter remains unknown, axion-like\nparticles (ALPs) are strong candidates, suggesting that dark matter halos may\nhave originated from bosonic configurations undergoing gravitational collapse,\nsustained by boson-boson interactions in the condensate state. This system is\ndescribed by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation. Furthermore, within the\nframework of the Bohm-de Broglie approach, quantum effects,encapsulated in the\nso-called quantum potential, may play a significant role in equilibrium\nastrophysical configurations. In this study, we examine a class of static\nanisotropic boson stars which are non-minimally coupled to gravity. By\nincluding all these factors, we derive a generalized Lane-Emden-like equation\nand conduct a detailed analysis of the maximum degree of anisotropy that such\nsystems can sustain, thereby identifying physically viable equilibrium\nconfigurations. Apart from focusing on the impact of anisotropic contributions,\nwe find that for the so-called Quantum Polytropes (when the quantum potential\nis the main responsible for the equilibrium condition), the anisotropic factor\nand the gravitational field have opposite roles compared to the classical case.\nThis leads to a new class of hydrostatic equilibrium objects.",

    "abstract": "Fast training of large machine learning models requires distributed training\non AI clusters consisting of thousands of GPUs. The efficiency of distributed\ntraining crucially depends on the efficiency of the network interconnecting\nGPUs in the cluster. These networks are commonly built using RDMA following a\nClos-like datacenter topology. To efficiently utilize the network bandwidth,\nload balancing is employed to distribute traffic across multiple redundant\npaths. While there exists numerous techniques for load-balancing in traditional\ndatacenters, these are often either optimized for TCP traffic or require\nspecialized network hardware, thus limiting their utility in AI clusters.\n  This paper presents the design and evaluation of Hopper, a new load-balancing\ntechnique optimized for RDMA traffic in AI clusters. Operating entirely at the\nhost level, Hopper requires no specialized hardware or modifications to network\nswitches. It continuously monitors the current path for congestion and\ndynamically switches traffic to a less congested path when congestion is\ndetected. Furthermore, it incorporates a lightweight mechanism to identify\nalternative paths and carefully controls the timing of path switching to\nprevent excessive out-of-order packets.\n  We evaluated Hopper using ns-3 simulations and a testbed implementation. Our\nevaluations show that Hopper reduces the average and 99-percentile tail flow\ncompletion time by up to 20% and 14%, respectively, compared to\nstate-of-the-art host-based load balancing techniques.",

Social determinants of\nhealth (SDoH) indices, like the widely used Area Deprivation Index (ADI), guide\nefforts to manage patient health and costs. However, the ADI's reliance on\nhousing-related variables (e.g., median home value) may reduce its\neffectiveness, especially in high-cost regions, by masking inequalities and\npoor health outcomes.\n  Methods: To overcome these limitations, we developed the balanced ADI (bADI),\na new SDoH index that reduces dependence on housing metrics through\nstandardized construction. We evaluated the bADI using data from millions of\nMedicare Fee-for-Service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Correlation\nanalyses measured its association with clinical outcomes, life expectancy,\nhealthcare use, and cost, and compared results to the ADI.\n  Results: The bADI showed stronger correlations with clinical outcomes and\nlife expectancy than the ADI. It was less influenced by housing costs in\nexpensive regions and more accurately predicted healthcare use and costs. While\nADI-based research suggested both the most and least disadvantaged groups had\nhigher healthcare costs, the bADI revealed a more nuanced pattern, showing more\naccurate cost differences across groups.\n  Conclusions: The bADI offers stronger predictive power for healthcare\noutcomes and spending, making it a valuable tool for accountable care\norganizations. By reallocating resources from less to more disadvantaged areas,\nACOs could use the bADI to promote equity and cost-effective care within\npopulation health initiatives.",

Superconducting resonators provide a\nconvenient way to study TLS-induced loss due to easier design and fabrication\nin comparison to devices that include non-linear elements. However, accurately\nmeasuring TLS-induced loss in a resonator in the quantum regime is challenging\ndue to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the temporal fluctuations of the\nTLS, leading to uncertainties of 30% or more. To address these limitations, we\ndevelop a multi-wave resonator device that extends the resonator length from a\nstandard quarter-wave $\\lambda/4$ to $N\\lambda/4$ where $N = 37$ at 6GHz. This\ndesign provides two key advantages: the TLS-induced fluctuations are reduced by\na factor of $\\sqrt{N}$ due to spatial averaging over an increased number of\nindependent TLS, and the measurement SNR for a given intra-resonator energy\ndensity improves by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$. The multi-wave resonator also has\nfundamental and harmonic resonances that allow one to study the frequency\ndependence of TLS-induced loss. In this work we fabricate both multi-wave and\nquarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators formed from thin-film aluminum on a\nsilicon substrate, and characterize their TLS properties at both 10mK and\n200mK. Our results show that the power-dependent TLS-induced loss measured from\nboth types of resonators agree well, with the multi-wave resonators achieving a\nfive-fold reduction in measurement uncertainty due to TLS fluctuations, down to\n5%. The $N\\lambda/4$ resonator also provides a measure of the fully unsaturated\nTLS-induced loss due to the improved measurement SNR at low intra-resonator\nenergy densities. Finally, measurements across seven harmonic resonances of the\n$N\\lambda/4$ resonator between 4GHz - 6.5GHz reveals no frequency dependence in\nthe TLS-induced loss over this range.",

    "abstract": "Alignment of large language models with explicit principles (such as\nhelpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) is crucial for ensuring safe and\nreliable AI systems. However, standard reward-based alignment methods typically\ncollapse diverse feedback into a single scalar reward, entangling multiple\nobjectives into one opaque training signal, which hinders interpretability. In\nthis work, we introduce QA-LIGN, an automatic symbolic reward decomposition\napproach that preserves the structure of each constitutional principle within\nthe reward mechanism. Instead of training a black-box reward model that outputs\na monolithic score, QA-LIGN formulates principle-specific evaluation questions\nand derives separate reward components for each principle, making it a drop-in\nreward model replacement. Experiments aligning an uncensored large language\nmodel with a set of constitutional principles demonstrate that QA-LIGN offers\ngreater transparency and adaptability in the alignment process. At the same\ntime, our approach achieves performance on par with or better than a DPO\nbaseline. Overall, these results represent a step toward more interpretable and\ncontrollable alignment of language models, achieved without sacrificing\nend-task performance.",

However, the emitted\nspectrum from a GRB photosphere, which includes prior dissipation of energy by\nradiation-mediated shocks (RMSs), can also produce such spectral features.\nHere, we analyze the bright GRB 211211A using the Kompaneets RMS Approximation\n(KRA). We find that the KRA can fit the time-resolved spectra well,\nsignificantly better than the traditionally used Band function in all studied\ntime bins. The analysis of GRB 211211A reveals a jet with a typical Lorentz\nfactor ($\\Gamma \\sim 300$), and a strong RMS (upstream dimensionless specific\nmomentum, $\\gamma_u \\beta_u \\sim 3$) occurring at a moderate optical depth\n($\\tau \\sim 35$) in a relatively cold upstream ($\\theta_u = k_{\\rm B} T_u / m_e\nc^2 \\sim 10^{-4}$). We conclude that broad GRB spectra that exhibit two breaks\ncan also be well explained by photospheric emission. This implies that, {in\nsuch cases}, the spectral shape in the MeV-band alone is not enough to\ndetermine the emission mechanism during the prompt phase in GRBs.",

However, they struggle with executing complex,\nlong-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating\nProcedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation.\nDespite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the\ncomplexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we\npresent three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data\ngeneration framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously\ntest the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents.\nSecond, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800\ntasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and\nhuman-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent\narchitectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing\naverage success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the\ntool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools\nnearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between\ncurrent agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world\nSOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the\nneed for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before\ndeployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at\nhttp://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an operator-theoretic framework Linear Operator Causality\nAnalysis (LOCA), for analysing causality in linearised dynamical systems,\nfocusing here on fluid flows. We demonstrate that the matrix exponential of the\nlinearised differential equations fundamentally encodes the causal\nrelationships between system modes at any future time. We further develop a\nglobal measure of causality that quantifies the presence and extent of global\ncausality across all time horizons. This approach provides a physics-based\nalternative to statistical and information-theoretic causality measures such as\nGranger causality and transfer entropy. Unlike these data-driven techniques\nthat infer causality from time-series data, LOCA leverages the linearised\ngoverning equations, yielding a more rigorous and interpretable measure of\ncausal interactions. We show that LOCA gives equivalent results to data-driven\nmethods under certain assumptions, and further discuss connections to key\nsystem properties such as controllability, observability, and graph-theoretic\ntransitive closure. To complement this operator-based approach, we introduce a\ndata-driven methodology akin to Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) that estimates\ncausal connections directly from time series data by approximating the matrix\nexponential. LOCA also mitigates common issues in data-driven causality\nanalyses, such as misleading inferences due to correlated variables or state\ntruncation. We demonstrate our method on linearised Couette flow, demonstrating\nhow our framework captures both direct and indirect causal interactions among\nflow structures. Through this example, we highlight the advantages of our\napproach, including its robustness to correlation-induced biases and its\nability to identify causally significant modes.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic bouncing\ncosmologies within the framework of $f(R)$ modified gravity theories. Building\nupon previous studies that explored hysteresis phenomena in braneworld and\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we analyze how scalar field dynamics coupled to\na modified gravitational background generates asymmetric pressure evolution\nduring expansion and contraction phases. This asymmetry manifests as a\nnon-vanishing work integral over complete cosmic cycles, $\\oint p\\,dV \\neq 0$,\nwhich we interpret as a fundamental thermodynamic signature of irreversible\ncyclic evolution. We derive the modified Friedmann equations for a\nrepresentative $f(R) = R + \\alpha R^2$ model, establish analytical conditions\nfor bounce and turnaround events, and quantify the thermodynamic work performed\nduring each cycle through comprehensive numerical analysis. Our findings\ndemonstrate that hysteresis effects are generic features of scalar-tensor\ndynamics in higher-curvature gravity theories and can drive cumulative\nevolution of the cosmic scale factor across multiple cycles, potentially\nproviding new insights into the resolution of cosmological singularities and\nthe thermodynamic arrow of time in modified gravity frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Accurate black hole mass (MBH) measurements in high-z galaxies are difficult\nyet crucial to constrain the growth of supermassive BHs, and to discriminate\nbetween competing BH seed models. Recent studies claimed the detection of\nmassive BHs in very distant AGN, implying extreme growth conditions. However,\nthese estimates are usually obtained by extrapolating indirect methods that are\ncalibrated for moderately accreting, low-luminosity AGN in the local universe.\nTo assess the reliability of the single epoch method (SE) in the distant\nuniverse, we compute the MBH for a sample of hyper-luminous distant quasars and\na sample of highly accreting AGN using the X-ray scaling method. We first\nverify that this X-ray method yields reliable MBH values for distant highly\naccreting objects. Then, we carry out a systematic comparison with the SE\nmethod and find that these two indirect methods yield consistent MBH over a\nbroad range of luminosities, intrinsic absorption, and accretion rates. The\nonly discrepancies are associated with AGN that are substantially absorbed\n(underestimated by the SE method), and AGN accreting well above the Eddington\nlimit (overestimated by the SE method). The latter result casts some doubts on\nthe claim of overmassive BHs in highly accreting AGN in the early universe. Our\nstudy also reveals that one of the frequently used AGN catalogs consistently\nunderestimates the MBH values by a factor of 2.5. Although this factor is of\nthe order of the uncertainty generally associated with the SE method, we\ndemonstrate that the use of underestimated values may result in potentially\nmisleading conclusions. Specifically, for this AGN sample we confirm strong\npositive correlations for Gamma vs. lambda_Edd and for the X-ray bolometric\ncorrection vs. lambda_Edd, as well as for Gamma vs. the soft excess strength,\nat odds with the conclusions inferred using underestimated MBH values.",

In this work, we generalize the notion of\ndivisibility of quantum dynamical maps from the Schr\\\"odinger to the Heisenberg\npicture. While the two pictures are equivalent at the level of physical\npredictions, we show that the divisibility properties of the corresponding dual\nmaps are, in general, not equivalent. This inequivalence originates from the\ndistinction between left and right generators of time-local master equations,\nwhich interchange roles under duality. We demonstrate that Schr\\\"odinger and\nHeisenberg divisibility are distinct concepts by constructing explicit dynamics\ndivisible only in one picture. Furthermore, we introduce a quantifier for the\nviolation of Heisenberg P-divisibility, analogous to the trace-distance-based\nmeasure of non-Markovianity, and provide it with an operational interpretation\nin terms of the guessing probability between effects. Our results show that\nHeisenberg divisibility is an independent witness of memory effects and\nhighlight the need to consider both pictures when characterizing non-Markovian\nquantum dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically measured masses have shown\nempirical correlations with host galaxy properties. These correlations are\noften the only method available to estimate SMBH masses and gather statistics\nfor large galaxy populations across a range of redshifts, even though the\nscaling relations themselves are derived from a small subset of nearby\ngalaxies. Depending on the scaling relation used, estimated SMBH masses can\nvary significantly. The most widely used scaling relations are the\nM$_{BH}-$M$_{\\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \\sigma$ relations, where\nM$_{\\mathrm{bulge}}$ is galaxy bulge mass and $\\sigma$ is the bulge velocity\ndispersion. In this paper, we determine how severely the choice of scaling\nrelation impacts SMBH mass estimates for different subsets of a large galaxy\npopulation. For this analysis we use a sample of $\\sim$ 400,000 galaxies,\nincluding 1,240 Type 1 AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculate SMBH\nmasses from M$_{BH}-$M$_{\\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \\sigma$ and compare to\nsingle-epoch virial SMBH masses from broad-line H$\\beta$, which are derived\nindependently of black hole-host galaxy scaling relations. We find that SMBH\nmasses derived from the single-epoch virial relation for H$\\beta$ are better\nreproduced by M$_{BH}- \\sigma$ than M$_{BH}-$M$_{\\mathrm{bulge}}$. Finally, in\ncases where $\\sigma$ and M$_{\\mathrm{bulge}}$ cannot be measured directly, we\nshow that it is possible to infer $\\sigma$ from photometry with more accuracy\nthan we can infer M$_{\\mathrm{bulge}}$.",

    "abstract": "Atomic defects underpin the properties of van der Waals materials, and their\nunderstanding is essential for advancing quantum and energy technologies.\nScanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for defect\nidentification in atomically thin materials, and extending it to multilayer and\nbeam-sensitive materials would accelerate their exploration. Here we establish\na comprehensive defect library in a bilayer of the magnetic quasi-1D\nsemiconductor CrSBr by combining atomic-resolution imaging, deep learning, and\nab-initio calculations. We apply a custom-developed machine learning work flow\nto detect, classify and average point vacancy defects. This classification\nenables us to uncover several distinct Cr interstitial defect complexes,\ncombined Cr and Br vacancy defect complexes and lines of vacancy defects that\nextend over many unit cells. We show that their occurrence is in agreement with\nour computed structures and binding energy densities, reflecting the intriguing\nlayer interlocked crystal structure of CrSBr. Our ab-initio calculations show\nthat the interstitial defect complexes give rise to highly localized electronic\nstates. These states are of particular interest due to the reduced electronic\ndimensionality and magnetic properties of CrSBr and are furthermore predicted\nto be optically active. Our results broaden the scope of defect studies in\nchallenging materials and reveal new defect types in bilayer CrSBr that can be\nextrapolated to the bulk and to over 20 materials belonging to the same FeOCl\nstructural family.",

Current memory systems\noften grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal\nawareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw\ninteraction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory\nframework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph\n(STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles\n(IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and\nsituational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs\nare interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving\nknowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive\nrefinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of\ninsight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived\nfrom identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental\nresults demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing\napproaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering\nscenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable\n34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean\nquery latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this\npaper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory\nsystems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines\npromising future research trajectories.",

The\nrecently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has emerged as\na compelling example of this class, garnering widespread interest for its\nremarkable temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram, which features a\nfield-induced first-order superconductor-to-superconductor phase transition\nwith nontrivial dependence on the field direction and high critical fields, as\nwell as antiferromagnetic and potentially higher multipole orders. To\ninvestigate the complex interplay of the ordered phases in CeRh$_2$As$_2$, we\ndevelop a theoretical framework based on symmetry analysis combined with\nBogoliubov--de Gennes and Landau methods. This approach allows us to propose\nprobable symmetries of the superconducting states and elucidate their close\nrelationship with magnetism. Intriguingly, we find that the first-order\ntransition can be interpreted as a transition between coexistence phases of the\nsame symmetry but with distinct admixtures of individual superconducting order\nparameters. This line may end in a critical endpoint below the superconducting\ncritical temperature. Our approach accurately reproduces current experimental\nphase diagrams for varying temperature as well as out-of-plane and in-plane\nmagnetic field, both if the transition to a magnetic phase occurs below the\nsuperconducting critical temperature and if it occurs above. Furthermore, we\ncalculate the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat and compare these\nquantities to recent experimental results.",

We promote the view that the main result of that work is best\nunderstood not as a claim about the relative merits of different\nrepresentations of quantum theory, but rather as a claim about the possibility\nof experimentally adjudicating between standard quantum theory and an\nalternative theory -- a foil theory -- known as real-amplitude quantum theory\n(RQT). In particular, the claim is that this adjudication can be achieved given\nonly an assumption about the causal structure of the experiment. Here, we aim\nto shed some light on why this is possible, by reconceptualizing the comparison\nof the two theories as an instance of a broader class of such theory\ncomparisons. By recasting RQT as the subtheory of quantum theory that arises by\nsymmetrizing with respect to the collective action of a time-reversal symmetry,\nwe can compare it to other subtheories that arise by symmetrization, but for\ndifferent symmetries. If the symmetry has a unitary representation, the\nresulting foil theory is termed a twirled quantum world, and if it does not (as\nis the case in RQT), the resulting foil theory is termed a swirled quantum\nworld. We show that, in contrast to RQT, there is no possibility of\ndistinguishing any twirled quantum world from quantum theory given only an\nassumption about causal structure. We also define analogues of twirling and\nswirling for an arbitrary generalized probabilistic theory and identify certain\nnecessary conditions on a causal structure for it to be able to support a\ncausal compatibility gap between the theory and its symmetrized version. We\ndraw out the implications of these analyses for the question of how a lack of a\nshared reference frame state features into the possibility of such a gap.",

Our model for scale-dependent bias and mode coupling, which is\nmotivated by model-agnostic arguments from peaks theory and the Zel'dovich\napproximation, lies in the class of `Laplace-Gauss' expansions, making it\nstraightforward to incorporate these effects in the model-agnostic inference\nframework mentioned above.",

This exploits the fact that cosmological observables\ncannot distinguish between neutrinos and dark radiation with the same abundance\nand free-streaming properties. Our mechanism, based on a simple Type-I seesaw\nframework along with a keV-scale scalar mediator, achieves two objectives: (1)\nit produces strongly self-interacting dark radiation that imitates neutrino\nself-interactions favored by cosmological data, and (2) it depletes the active\nneutrino energy density, relaxing cosmological neutrino mass bounds and easing\nthe tension with neutrino oscillation data. The model naturally evades\nlaboratory constraints through suppression of the neutrino-mediator coupling by\nthe squared mass ratio of active and sterile neutrinos. We demonstrate how this\nscenario is favored over $\\Lambda$CDM by the combined Planck and DESI data,\nwhile being consistent with all other constraints.

We use an attention-based ResUNet\n(HALO) to predict dark matter halo maps, which are then processed through a\ntrained conditional variational diffusion model (LODI) to produce 21 cm\nbrightness temperature maps.

This angular momentum distribution, in turn,\nalters the planetary orbits and rotational obliquities. In the case of giant\nplanets, their gravitational influence can also produce significant\nredistribution of volatiles, particularly those that lie beyond the snow line.\nHere, we present the results of dynamical simulations that investigate the role\nof cold giant planets in scattering material to inner terrestrial planets. We\nhighlight 10 exoplanetary systems with 2 or more known giant planets beyond the\nsnow line, and adopt a solar system analog template that investigates the\nscattering of material within the range 3-8~AU. We show that increasing the\neccentricity of a Jupiter analog from its present, near-circular, value to a\nmoderate range (0.2-0.3) results in an order of magnitude increase in scattered\nmaterial to the inner part of the system. The inclusion of a Saturn analog to\nthe dynamical model produces a similar increase, highlighting the importance of\nmultiple giant planets beyond the snow line.

    "abstract": "Recent rigorous results on black hole interiors clearly suggest that the\nstrong cosmic censorship conjecture fails in its most fundamental, i.e. weak,\nformulation: violations are expected for a class of spherically symmetric\ncharged black holes in the presence of a positive cosmological constant near\nextremality. These results require sufficiently regular solutions. Conversely,\nwhen non-smooth, finite-energy initial data are prescribed for linear waves\npropagating on a fixed black hole background belonging to the aforementioned\nfamily, it was shown that the local energy of these linear waves blows up at\nthe Cauchy horizon, hence hinting that non-smooth initial data may suppress the\npossible violations of the $H^1$ formulation of strong cosmic censorship. In\nline with this intuition, we prove that rough initial data can also trigger an\ninstability at the Cauchy horizon in the non-linear setting, via mass\ninflation. In particular, we analyse a characteristic initial value problem for\nthe spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar field system describing\nthe interior of a black hole. Our results show that, when prescribing 1)\ninitial data asymptotically approaching those of a sub-extremal\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-de Sitter solution, and 2) initial data belonging to\n$W^{1, 2}\\setminus W^{1, q}$, for every $q > 2$, along the initial ingoing\ncompact segment; then the Hawking mass diverges at the Cauchy horizon of the\nblack hole solution we construct, for every parameter choice of the reference\nblack hole. In this larger family of configurations, we prove that the smooth\ndata suggesting violations of strong cosmic censorship are non-generic in a\n``positive co-dimension'' sense, conditionally to the validity of the expected\nPrice law bounds. Moreover, we illustrate the transition between smooth and\nrough initial data.",

We employ\nthe time-dependent photoionization hydrodynamics code ATES to investigate the\nimpact of flares on atmospheric escape, focusing on an Earth-sized and a\nsub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting an early M-type star at distances of 0.01,\n0.1, and 0.18-0.36 AU-the inner and outer edges of the HZ. Stellar flaring is\nmodeled as a 1 Gyr-long high-activity phase followed by a 4 Gyr-long\nlow-activity phase, each characterized by an appropriate flare frequency\ndistribution. We find that flares have a modest impact-less than a factor of\ntwo-on the cumulative atmospheric mass loss, with the greatest absolute\nenhancement occurring when the planets are at their closest separation.\nHowever, the relative enhancement in mass loss between flaring and non-flaring\ncases is greater at larger orbital separations. This trend arises because, as\nstellar irradiation fluctuates between quiescent levels and peak flares, the\nproportion of time that a planet spends in the energy-limited versus\nrecombination-limited mass loss regimes depends on its orbital separation.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate the existence of a characteristic flare energy,\nintermediate between the minimum and maximum values, that maximizes the\nfractional contribution to flare-driven mass loss. Our results indicate that\nthe flaring activity of M-dwarfs does not significantly affect the atmospheric\nretention of close-in planets, including those within the HZ. The potential\noccurrence of rare super-flares, which current observational campaigns may be\nbiased against, does not alter our conclusions.",

A natural explanation is that mobile anyons give rise to\nsuperconductivity; however, this mechanism requires binding of minimally\ncharged anyons to establish an unusual energy hierarchy. This scenario has\nmostly been studied with effective theories, leaving open the question of how\nanyon superconductivity can arise from repulsive interactions. Here, we show\nthat such an energy hierarchy of anyons arises naturally in fractional Chern\ninsulators (FCIs) at fillings $\\nu = 2/(4p \\mp 1)$ when they are driven toward\na quantum phase transition into a ``semion crystal'' -- an exotic\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) insulator with semion topological order. Near the\ntransition, Cooper-pair correlations are enhanced, so that a conventional\ncharge-2e superconductor appears with doping. Guided by these insights, we\nanalyze a microscopic realization in a repulsive Hubbard-Hofstadter model.\nTensor network simulations at $\\nu = 2/3$ reveal a robust FCI that, with\nincreasing interactions, transitions into the semion crystal. Finding a stable\nsemion crystal in such a minimal model highlights it as a viable state\ncompeting with conventional CDW and FQH states. In the vicinity of this\ntransition, we find markedly enhanced Cooper pairing, consistent with our\ntheory that the 2e/3 anyon is cheaper than a pair of isolated e/3 anyons.\nDoping near the transition should in general lead to doping Cooper pairs and\ncharge-2e superconductivity, with chiral edge modes of alternating central\ncharge $c = \\pm2$, which can coexist with translation symmetry breaking. Our\nframework unifies recent approaches to anyon superconductivity, reconciles it\nwith strong repulsion and provides guidance for flat band moir\\'e materials\nsuch as recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in multimodal generation has increasingly combined\nautoregressive (AR) and diffusion-based approaches, leveraging their\ncomplementary strengths: AR models capture long-range dependencies and produce\nfluent, context-aware outputs, while diffusion models operate in continuous\nlatent spaces to refine high-fidelity visual details. However, existing hybrids\noften lack systematic guidance on how and why to allocate model capacity\nbetween these paradigms. In this work, we introduce MADFormer, a Mixed\nAutoregressive and Diffusion Transformer that serves as a testbed for analyzing\nAR-diffusion trade-offs. MADFormer partitions image generation into spatial\nblocks, using AR layers for one-pass global conditioning across blocks and\ndiffusion layers for iterative local refinement within each block. Through\ncontrolled experiments on FFHQ-1024 and ImageNet, we identify two key insights:\n(1) block-wise partitioning significantly improves performance on\nhigh-resolution images, and (2) vertically mixing AR and diffusion layers\nyields better quality-efficiency balances--improving FID by up to 75% under\nconstrained inference compute. Our findings offer practical design principles\nfor future hybrid generative models.",

    "abstract": "Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have\nrecently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These\napproaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to\ngenerate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work,\nwe examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model\nweights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during\ntraining. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely\nby memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple\ninterpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform\nsimple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight\nensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We\nfurther show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by\nmodifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image\ndiffusion models, or applying data augmentations.

    "abstract": "6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects.\nHowever, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed\n3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating\n6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's\nappearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose\nUA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online\nobject completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume\naccess to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a\nsingle 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model\nbased on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use\nimage-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method\nintegrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between\nseen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose\nestimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object\ncompletion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving\nobject completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and\nHO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots\nand human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance\nimprovements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are\nincomplete or partially captured.

As\nnatural invariants under the group, these structural properties of orbits alone\ncan reveal fundamental impossibilities of enacting certain unitary\ntransformations deterministically.

We also study genericity and robustness\nproperties of orbit dimensions, and propose approaches to efficiently evaluate\nthem experimentally. Besides, we highlight that the orbit dimension under the\nGaussian unitary group serves a non-Gaussianity witness, which we expect to be\nuniversal for multimode pure states.

Motivated by this experimental prospect,\nstudies have sought to elucidate the theoretical connections between the photon\nring -- an observable, classical effect -- and the putative holographic\ndescription of black holes in quantum gravity. General relativity predicts that\nthe detailed structure of the photon ring encodes the high-frequency (eikonal)\nspectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs) emitted by a perturbed black hole as it\nrings down, and also that the photon ring displays an emergent conformal\nsymmetry that acts upon this spectrum.

We propose a heuristic approach to determine the optimal\nnumber of structural breaks, with parameter estimation performed through an\niterative scheme that integrates a modified dynamic programming algorithm for\nbreak detection and a standard regression procedure with ARMA errors. The\nmodel's performance is evaluated through a case study on US Real GDP\n(2002-2025), where it accurately identifies breaks corresponding to major\neconomic events (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 shocks).\nAdditionally, LTSTA outperforms well-established univariate statistical models\n(SES, Theta, TBATS, ETS, ARIMA, and Prophet) on the CIF 2016 forecasting\ncompetition dataset across MAE, RMSE, sMAPE, and MASE metrics.

The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve\nthese goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development\nand conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting\nlung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT\n2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45\ndisease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a\nnew focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the\nprevious event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed\nclassification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a\nmanually annotated \"gold standard\" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization\nto five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of\nCXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating\nstate-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare\ndisease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and\nzero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases.

Spontaneous speech contains rich acoustic and linguistic\nmarkers that may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cognitive decline.\nFoundation models, pre-trained on large-scale audio or text data, produce\nhigh-dimensional embeddings encoding contextual and acoustic features.\n  Methods: We used the PREPARE Challenge dataset, which includes audio\nrecordings from over 1,600 participants with three cognitive statuses: healthy\ncontrol (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We\nexcluded non-English, non-spontaneous, or poor-quality recordings. The final\ndataset included 703 (59.13%) HC, 81 (6.81%) MCI, and 405 (34.06%) AD cases.

Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge\nmodeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems\nrequiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not\nadequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we\nintroduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark\nframework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions,\nincluding prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated\ncontent, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this\nbenchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers\nand practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of\nimage generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by\nallowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of\ngenerating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only\nfor the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the\ncorresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly\navailable to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model\ncomparisons within the T2I research community.",

    "abstract": "The current paradigm of test-time scaling relies on generating long reasoning\ntraces (\"thinking\" more) before producing a response. In agent problems that\nrequire interaction, this can be done by generating thinking traces before\nacting in the world. However, this process does not allow agents to acquire new\ninformation from the environment or adapt their behavior over time. In this\nwork, we propose to scale test-time interaction, an untapped dimension of\ntest-time scaling that increases the agent's interaction horizon to enable\nrunning rich behaviors such as exploration, backtracking, and dynamic\nre-planning within a single rollout. To demonstrate the promise of this scaling\ndimension, we study the domain of web agents. We first show that even\nprompting-based interaction scaling without any training can improve task\nsuccess on web benchmarks non-trivially. Building on this, we introduce TTI\n(Test-Time Interaction), a curriculum-based online reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach that trains agents by adaptively adjusting their rollout lengths.\nUsing a Gemma 3 12B model, TTI produces state-of-the-art open-source, open-data\nweb agents on WebVoyager and WebArena benchmarks. We further show that TTI\nenables agents to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively.

    "abstract": "A variety of pruning methods have been introduced for over-parameterized\nRecurrent Neural Networks to improve efficiency in terms of power consumption\nand storage utilization. These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed\n`hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for\na given network architecture and application. Unlike conventional\nhyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains\nuncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model\nsets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one. The goal, therefore, is to\ndiscover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.\nHowever, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally\nexpensive and lacks early performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early\ncomparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of\npost-training performance. By integrating this LS-based distance with standard\nhyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning\nframework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). LSH reduces search time by an\norder of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full\ntraining. Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn\nTreebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under\nfixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies\nsuperior pruned models. Remarkably, these pruned variants not only outperform\nthose selected by loss-based baseline but also exceed the performance of their\ndense counterpart.",

    "abstract": "The explosive growth of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) has revolutionized digital\nownership by enabling the creation, exchange, and monetization of unique assets\non blockchain networks. However, this surge in popularity has also given rise\nto a disturbing trend: the emergence of rug pulls - fraudulent schemes where\ndevelopers exploit trust and smart contract privileges to drain user funds or\ninvalidate asset ownership. Central to many of these scams are hidden backdoors\nembedded within NFT smart contracts. Unlike unintentional bugs, these backdoors\nare deliberately coded and often obfuscated to bypass traditional audits and\nexploit investor confidence. In this paper, we present a large-scale static\nanalysis of 49,940 verified NFT smart contracts using Slither, a static\nanalysis framework, to uncover latent vulnerabilities commonly linked to rug\npulls. We introduce a custom risk scoring model that classifies contracts into\nhigh, medium, or low risk tiers based on the presence and severity of rug pull\nindicators. Our dataset was derived from verified contracts on the Ethereum\nmainnet, and we generate multiple visualizations to highlight red flag\nclusters, issue prevalence, and co-occurrence of critical vulnerabilities.\nWhile we do not perform live exploits, our results reveal how malicious\npatterns often missed by simple reviews can be surfaced through static analysis\nat scale. We conclude by offering mitigation strategies for developers,\nmarketplaces, and auditors to enhance smart contract security. By exposing how\nhidden backdoors manifest in real-world smart contracts, this work contributes\na practical foundation for detecting and mitigating NFT rug pulls through\nscalable automated analysis.",

To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nframework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as\nadaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic\nresource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a\ncybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a\nController. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and\ncollects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the\ncontroller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate\nfeedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework\nenhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.\nExperiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B\nby 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive\nproprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%\nimprovement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.\nFurthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose\nbenchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and\ngeneralization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for\ndynamic video understanding.

Of these, 55 are\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs; $P<30$ ms), while 34 are binaries with orbital\nperiods spanning 0.12 days to 466.47 days. This paper describes GC FANS, a\ndeep, thorough search for pulsars in 41 GCs in the FAST sky ($-14^\\circ <\n\\delta < 65^\\circ$) and describes new discoveries in 14 of them. We present\nupdated timing solutions for M92A, NGC 6712A, M71A, and M71E, all of which are\n``spider'' pulsars with short orbital periods. We present new timing solutions\nfor M71B, C, and D. With orbital periods of $\\sim$466 and 378 days, M71B and\nM71C are the widest known GC binaries; these systems resemble the normal wide\nMSP-He WD systems in the Galactic disk. With a spin period of 101 ms, M71D is\nin an eccentric ($e\\sim$0.63) orbit with an 11-day period and a massive\ncompanion; the system has a total mass of $2.63 \\pm 0.08 \\, M_{\\odot}$. These\nfeatures and its large characteristic age suggest it is a double neutron star\nsystem (DNS) formed via massive binary evolution early in the cluster's\nhistory, akin to Galactic disk DNSs--unlike other candidate GC DNSs, which\ntypically form dynamically. A comparative analysis of GC pulsar populations\nwithin FAST's sky reveals that most clusters (10 of 14) resemble the Galactic\ndisk MSP population, likely due to lower stellar densities.",

    "abstract": "Recovering both amplitude and phase information from a system is a\nfundamental goal of optical imaging. At the same time, it is crucial to use a\nlow photon dose to avoid altering the system, particularly when dealing with\nbiological samples. Quantum imaging offers a powerful approach for extracting\nmore information per photon than classical techniques, which are ultimately\nlimited by shot-noise. However, the trade-off between quantum noise reduction\nand spatial resolution has been considered a major drawback to the application\nof quantum techniques to small cellular and sub-cellular structures, where they\ncould offer the most significant benefits. In this work, we overcome this\nlimitation by demonstrating a resolution-independent quantum advantage. We\nachieve high-resolution phase imaging limited only by the numerical aperture,\nwhile simultaneously attaining quantum noise reduction. This enables, for the\nfirst time, sub-shot-noise quantitative phase imaging of biological cells.\nUnlike other quantum imaging approaches, our method operates in a\nquasi-single-shot wide-field mode, retrieves both phase and amplitude\ninformation, and does not rely on interferometric measurements, making it\nintrinsically fast and stable. These results pave the way for the immediate\napplication of sub-shot-noise imaging in biology.",

    "abstract": "Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building\nvision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to\neffective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D\nsignals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the\nspatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In\nthis paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D\ninputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,\nand (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and\noutput spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a\nscalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability\nto predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments\nshow the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and\neffectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across\nthree simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate\nfrom 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better\nperformance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average\nsuccess rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing\nbaseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,\nBridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It\ngeneralizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual\ndisturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a\nsuccess rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,\nhighlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

However, their training\ndynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically\nand numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding\nof cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our\nobjective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout\ngradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We\nfirst derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend\nthe analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral\nproperties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and\nspectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz\nequation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations\ngoverned by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation\ninto the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order,\nsecond-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the\nresulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in\nthe context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also\nreveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel\nbehavior to convergence rates under different setups.

Emission in the low-loss C-band minimizes\ntransmission losses, making them ideal for long-distance quantum communication.\nIn this work, we present the first demonstration of both Stark tuning and\ncharge state control of individual InAs/InP QDs operating within the telecom\nC-band. These QDs are grown by droplet epitaxy and embedded in a InP-based\n$n^{++}$--$i$--$n^{+}$ heterostructure, fabricated using MOVPE. The gated\narchitecture enables the tuning of emission energy via the quantum confined\nStark effect, with a tuning range exceeding 2.4 nm. It also allows for control\nover the QD charge occupancy, enabling access to multiple discrete excitonic\nstates. Electrical tuning of the fine-structure splitting is further\ndemonstrated, opening a route to entangled photon pair generation at telecom\nwavelengths. The single-photon character is confirmed via second-order\ncorrelation measurements. These advances enable QDs to be tuned into resonance\nwith other systems, such as cavity modes and emitters, marking a critical step\ntoward scalable, fiber-compatible quantum photonic devices.",

    "abstract": "We study categories whose objects are the braid representations, that is,\nstrict monoidal functors from the braid category $B$ to the category of\nmatrices $Mat$. Braid representations are equivalent to solutions to the\n(constant) Yang-Baxter equation. So their classification problems are also\nequivalent. We consider both the categories $MoonFun(B,Mat)$ whose morphisms\nare natural transformations and the category $MonFun(B,Mat)$ whose morphisms\nare the monoidal natural transformations. This categorical contextualisation\nnaturally gives a three-fold focus to the problem: the source $B$; the target\n$Mat$; and the natural transformations and other symmetries between functors\nbetween them. Indeed the approach is mainly motivated by the recent\nclassification of charge conserving Yang-Baxter operators, in which $Mat$ is\nreplaced by a certain subcategory. One objective is to understand from the\ncategorical perspective how the solution was facilitated by this change (with\nthe aim of generalising). Another is to understand appropriate notions of\nequivalence - the restriction of target introduces new notions such as that of\ninner and outer equivalences. And another is to understand how universal such a\nrestricted target is (does it give a transversal of all equivalence classes for\na suitable notion of equivalence?). And then the aim is to complete the\nclassification with a suitably universal target.\n  With regard to the first part of the triple-focus, the category $B$, we\nreview several features. Work has already been done to generalise to similar\ncategories such as the loop braid category. But a significant part of our input\nhere is to recast $MonFun(B,-)$ as the isomorphic category of Yang-Baxter\nobjects - which manoeuvre leans heavily on the source being $B$ on the nose.",

In practice, rapid iteration often makes it necessary to rely on\nsynthetic annotation data because of the low cost, despite the potential for\nsubstantial bias. In this paper, we develop novel, cost-aware methods for\nactively balancing the use of a cheap, but often inaccurate, weak rater -- such\nas a model-based autorater that is designed to automatically assess the quality\nof generated content -- with a more expensive, but also more accurate, strong\nrater alternative such as a human.

Building on recent\nwork in active and prediction-powered statistical inference, we derive a family\nof cost-optimal policies for allocating a given annotation budget between weak\nand strong raters so as to maximize statistical efficiency. Using synthetic and\nreal-world data, we empirically characterize the conditions under which these\npolicies yield improvements over prior methods. We find that, especially in\ntasks where there is high variability in the difficulty of examples, our\npolicies can achieve the same estimation precision at a far lower total\nannotation budget than standard evaluation methods.",

It examines the effects of perturbations at the\ncharacter, word, and sentence levels to identify the most impactful\nvulnerabilities. We analyzed multiple projects (e.g., ReCode, OpenAttack) and\ndatasets (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP), establishing a taxonomy of adversarial\nattacks.

We adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining\nquantitative performance metrics with qualitative vulnerability analysis.\nLLM4Code models show varying robustness across perturbation types.\nSentence-level attacks were least effective, suggesting models are resilient to\nbroader contextual changes.

Such an excess requires that most\nstars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical\nprocessing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations.\nHowever, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational\nselection bias. Close binaries within a < 100 au clear out their dusty\ncircumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single\nstars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries\nthat have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We re-examine the\nseparation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately\ndense Upper Scorpius, and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By\nlimiting the samples to primary spectral type / mass instead of magnitude, the\nartificial excess across a = 10-100 au disappears in all three environments.\nAcross wider separations a = 100-4,000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of\ncompanions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Scorpius\nmatches the field MS population. The field derives from an amalgam of all three\nenvironments, where Upper Scorpius corresponds to the average birth environment\nof solar-type stars. The total binary fraction within a < 10,000 au in Taurus\nis only 52% +/- 7%, substantially lower than the 100% inferred from the biased\nobservations and only slightly higher than the field MS value of 45%. N-body\ninteractions preferentially disrupt outer tertiaries with only marginal\ndynamical processing of the inner binaries, especially those within a < 100 au.",

We present the Quantum Graph Transformer (QGT), a\nhybrid graph-based architecture that integrates a quantum self-attention\nmechanism into the message-passing framework for structured language modeling.\nThe attention mechanism is implemented using parameterized quantum circuits\n(PQCs), which enable the model to capture rich contextual relationships while\nsignificantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to classical\nattention mechanisms.

When\ncompared with an equivalent classical graph transformer, QGT yields an average\naccuracy improvement of 5.42% on real-world datasets and 4.76% on synthetic\ndatasets.

In scenarios with more than two agents, any\ndiffusion-free mechanism is an \"elected dictatorship'' where the agents elect a\nsingle agent to make a unilateral decision.\n  The technical results are obtained by defining a bisimulation of\ndecision-making mechanisms, proving that bisimulation preserves\nresponsibility-related properties, and establishing the results for a smallest\nbisimular mechanism.",

Our approach bridges the latent\nspaces between a pre-trained encoder and a pre-trained generation model through\ntrainable mapping networks. Any 3D model represented as a mesh, point cloud, or\na radiance field is first encoded by the pre-trained encoder and then\ntransformed (i.e. compressed) into a highly compact latent code. This latent\ncode can effectively be used as an extremely compressed representation of the\nmesh or point cloud. A mapping network transforms the compressed latent code\ninto the latent space of a powerful generative model, which is then conditioned\nto recreate the original 3D model (i.e. decompression). Squeeze3D is trained\nentirely on generated synthetic data and does not require any 3D datasets. The\nSqueeze3D architecture can be flexibly used with existing pre-trained 3D\nencoders and existing generative models. It can flexibly support different\nformats, including meshes, point clouds, and radiance fields. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that Squeeze3D achieves compression ratios of up to 2187x for\ntextured meshes, 55x for point clouds, and 619x for radiance fields while\nmaintaining visual quality comparable to many existing methods. Squeeze3D only\nincurs a small compression and decompression latency since it does not involve\ntraining object-specific networks to compress an object.",

Although\nonly partially relational -- the absolute structures of simultaneity and\nEuclidean geometry are still retained -- these models provide a useful testing\nground for ideas that will prove useful in the context of more realistic\nrelativistic theories. The fact that in ED the positions of particles have\ndefinite values, just as in classical mechanics, has allowed us to adapt to the\nquantum case some intuitions from Barbour and Bertotti's classical framework.\nHere, however, we propose a new measure of the mismatch between successive\nstates that is adapted to the information metric and the symplectic structures\nof the quantum phase space. We make explicit that ED is temporally relational\nand we construct non-relativistic quantum models that are spatially relational\nwith respect to rigid translations and rotations. The ED approach settles the\nlongstanding question of what form should the constraints of a classical theory\ntake after quantization: the quantum constraints that express relationality are\nto be imposed on expectation values. To highlight the potential impact of these\ndevelopments, the non-relativistic quantum model is parametrized into a\ngenerally covariant form and we show that the ED approach evades the analogue\nof what in quantum gravity has been called the problem of time.",

In this paper,\nwe present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general\npipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS\nrepresentations by reducing neural inference through two complementary\ntechniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that\nidentifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene\nreconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that\nimproves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses.\nSecond, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters\nGaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation\nper group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our\ntechniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\\times$, reduce model size by\n$7.71\\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset.\nSpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\\times$ and $58.23\\times$ on\nthe D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets.

This disparity between prior and updated\nenvironmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous\ndecision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain\nstakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time\nobservation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and\ncontext-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains\nan open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding\nand Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a\ndomain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making\narchitecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs)\ninto a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex\ntasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each\nfocused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike\ntraditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER\nintegrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring\nverbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence\ndecision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived\ninsights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration\nfacilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration.\nWe benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves\nexploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat,\ngoal-conditioned policies.

This is caused by a dominant quadratic-in-momentum\ndispersion, with the linear-in-momentum Dirac- or Weyl-like terms relegated to\na secondary status.

The intrinsic topological quantities in the forms of\nBerry curvature and orbital magnetic moment contribute to the linear response,\nwhich we determine by exactly solving the semiclassical Bolzmann equations.\nAnother crucial feature is that the two bands at the same KWN node carry actual\nspin-quantum numbers, thus providing an additional coupling to an external\nmagnetic field ($\\boldsymbol B$), and affecting the conductivity.

    "abstract": "Persistent homology is a topological data analysis tool that has been widely\ngeneralized, extending its scope outside the field of topology. Among its\nextensions, steady and ranging persistence was developed to study a wide\nvariety of graph properties. Precisely, given a feature of interest on graphs,\nit is possible to build two types of persistence (steady and ranging\npersistence) that follow the evolution of the feature along graph filtrations.\nThis study extends steady and ranging persistence to other objects using\ncategory theory and investigates the stability of such persistence. In\nparticular, a characterization of the features that induce balanced steady and\nranging persistence is provided. The main results of this study are illustrated\nusing a practical implementation for hypergraphs.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the causal effect of time-varying exposures on recurrent event\nprocesses is challenging in the presence of a terminating event. Our objective\nis to estimate both the short-term and delayed marginal causal effects of\nexposures on recurrent events while addressing the bias of a potentially\ncorrelated terminal event. Existing estimators based on marginal structural\nmodels and proportional rate models are unsuitable for estimating delayed\nmarginal causal effects for many reasons, and furthermore, they do not account\nfor competing risks associated with a terminating event. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a class of semiparametric structural nested recurrent\nevent models and two estimators of short-term and delayed marginal causal\neffects of exposures. We establish the asymptotic linearity of these two\nestimators under regularity conditions through the novel use of modern\nempirical process and semiparametric efficiency theory. We examine the\nperformance of these estimators via simulation and provide an R package sncure\nto apply our methods in real data scenarios. Finally, we present the utility of\nour methods in the context of a large epidemiological study of 299,661 Medicare\nbeneficiaries, where we estimate the effects of fine particulate matter air\npollution on recurrent hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Channel estimation is not only essential to highly reliable data transmission\nand massive device access but also an important component of the integrated\nsensing and communication (ISAC) in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile\ncommunication systems. In this paper, we consider a downlink channel estimation\nproblem for circular reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple\naccess (MIMO-NOMA) system in mobility scenarios. First, we propose a subframe\npartitioning scheme to facilitate the modeling of the received signal as a\nfourth-order tensor satisfying a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) form,\nthereby formulating the channel estimation problem as tensor decomposition and\nparameter extraction problems. Then, by exploiting both the global and local\nlow-rank properties of the received signal, we propose a double low-rank 4D\ntensor decomposition model to decompose the received signal into four factor\nmatrices, which is efficiently solved via alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM). Subsequently, we propose a two-stage parameter estimation\nmethod based on the Jacobi-Anger expansion and the special structure of\ncircular RIS to uniquely decouple the angle parameters. Furthermore, the time\ndelay, Doppler shift, and channel gain parameters can also be estimated without\nambiguities, and their estimation accuracy can be efficiently improved,\nespecially at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Finally, a concise closed-form\nexpression for the Cram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) is derived as a performance\nbenchmark. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method compared with the other discussed methods.",

    "abstract": "Dislocation motion -- the atomic-scale mechanism of crystal plasticity --\ngoverns the strength and ductility of materials. In functional materials,\nexternal stimuli beyond mechanical stress can also affect dislocation glide. In\nthe wide band gap semiconductor ZnS, optical illumination suppresses\nplasticity, whereas electric fields can enhance dislocation motion. Here, we\nshow that the common underlying mechanism for these phenomena is the charged\ndislocations that respond to the changes in carrier concentration. Our prior\ntheoretical work showed that locally charged dislocations in ZnS trap excess\ncarriers, triggering core reconstructions that modify their mobility, with the\npositively charged Zn-rich core dislocations showing the most drastic change.\nHere, we validate this prediction experimentally by showing that either optical\nexcitation or electronic doping selectively inhibits the glide of Zn-rich\ndislocations in epitaxially grown ZnS. First, imaging individual interface\nmisfit dislocations under different optical excitation conditions shows that\nZn-core glide is strongly reduced as optical power is increased, while the\nS-core dislocations show negligible sensitivity to light, marking the first,\nsingle dislocation imaging of the photoplastic effect. Next, we show that a\nsimilar behavior is observed with direct electron (n-type) doping of ZnS\nepitaxial layers grown beyond the critical thickness. As the n-type dopant\ndensity is increased, the resulting Zn-core dislocation density is reduced by\nmore than one order of magnitude, while the S-core density remains essentially\nunchanged, causing a sign reversal of the strain-anisotropy with n-type doping.\nThese results demonstrate a common origin for the opto-electronic sensitivity\nof dislocations in ZnS and provide a pathway for the engineering of dislocation\ncontent in compound semiconductors.",

    "abstract": "A novel measurement technique of strong-phase differences between the decay\namplitudes of $D^0$ and $\\bar{D}^0$ mesons is introduced which exploits\nquantum-correlated $D\\bar{D}$ pairs produced by $e^+e^-$ collisions at energies\nabove the $\\psi(3770)$ production threshold, where $D\\bar{D}$ pairs are\nproduced in both even and odd eigenstates of the charge-conjugation symmetry.\nEmploying this technique, the first determination of a $D^0$-$\\bar{D^0}$\nrelative strong phase is reported with such data samples. The strong-phase\ndifference between $D^0\\to K^-\\pi^+$ and $\\bar{D}^0\\to K^-\\pi^+$ decays,\n$\\delta^{D}_{K\\pi}$, is measured to be $\\delta^{D}_{K\\pi}=\\left(192.8^{+11.0 +\n1.9}_{-12.4 -2.4}\\right)^\\circ$, using a dataset corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 7.13 $\\text{fb}^{-1}$ collected at center-of-mass energies\nbetween $4.13-4.23 \\text{ GeV}$ by the BESIII experiment.",

    "abstract": "The study of meson pairs produced with quantum correlations gives direct\naccess to parameters that are challenging to measure in other systems. In this\nLetter, the existence of quantum correlations due to charge-conjugation\nsymmetry $C$ are demonstrated in $D\\bar{D}$ pairs produced through the\nprocesses $e^+e^-\\to D\\bar{D}$, $e^+e^- \\to D^{*}\\bar{D}$, and $e^+e^- \\to\nD^{*} \\bar{D}^*$, where the lack of charge superscripts refers to an admixture\nof neutral-charm-meson particle and antiparticle states, using $7.13 \\text{\nfb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data collected by the BESIII experiment between\ncenter-of-mass energies of $4.13-4.23 \\text{ GeV}$. Processes with either\n$C$-even or $C$-odd constraints are identified and separated. A procedure is\npresented that harnesses the entangled production process to enable\nmeasurements of $D^0$-meson hadronic parameters. This study provides the first\nconfirmation of quantum correlations in $e^+e^-\\to X D\\bar{D}$ processes and\nthe first observation of a $C$-even constrained $D\\bar{D}$ system. The\nprocedure is applied to measure $\\delta^{D}_{K\\pi}$, the strong phase between\nthe $D^0\\to K^-\\pi^+$ and $\\bar{D}^0\\to K^-\\pi^+$ decay amplitudes, which\nresults in the determination of $\\delta^{D}_{K\\pi}=\\left(192.8^{+11.0 +\n1.9}_{-12.4 -2.4}\\right)^\\circ$. The potential for measurements of other\nhadronic decay parameters and charm mixing with these and future datasets is\nalso discussed.",

    "abstract": "Building on the success of text-based reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1,\nextending these capabilities to multimodal reasoning holds great promise. While\nrecent works have attempted to adapt DeepSeek-R1-style reinforcement learning\n(RL) training paradigms to multimodal large language models (MLLM), focusing on\ndomain-specific tasks like math and visual perception, a critical question\nremains: How can we achieve the general-purpose visual-language reasoning\nthrough RL? To address this challenge, we make three key efforts: (1) A novel\nScalable Multimodal QA Synthesis pipeline that autonomously generates\ncontext-aware, reasoning-centric question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the\ngiven images. (2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K\nmultimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse\ndataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive\nexploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that\ncombines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL\ntraining efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances\nperformance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.\nMoreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase\ndata diversity to further improve model performance.",

At least 60 of 103\n(60\\%) OB bowshock stars are binaries, consistent with the multiplicity\nfraction of other OB samples.

On the contrary, the joint generation of multimodal data through\ndiffusion models is still in the early stages of exploration. Existing\napproaches heavily rely on external preprocessing protocols, such as tokenizers\nand variational autoencoders, to harmonize varied data representations into a\nunified, unimodal format. This process heavily demands the high accuracy of\nencoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited\ndata. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building\nmultimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native\ngeneration of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an\ninnovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both\nunconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model\nsimultaneously. We empirically validate our approach for text-image generation\nand mixed-type tabular data synthesis, demonstrating that it achieves\ncompetitive performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)\ndesigned explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through\nsystematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training\ndata, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of\nmodel architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention\nmechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context\nprocessing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and\naccurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,\na comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable\nsatisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training\ntokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient\npre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by\nintroducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and\ndata-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose\nCPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative\nsampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse\non-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B\nparameters, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid reasoning model,\nMiniCPM4.1, which can be used in both deep reasoning mode and non-reasoning\nmode. Evaluation results demonstrate that MiniCPM4 and MiniCPM4.1 outperform\nsimilar-sized open-source models across benchmarks, with the 8B variants\nshowing significant speed improvements on long sequence understanding and\ngeneration.",

However, editing such models\nefficiently and reliably-without retraining or forgetting previous\ninformation-remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model\nediting either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to\nscale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework\nthat injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter\nmodule, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By\nsparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines\neach edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing\ninterference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by\ncomparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during\nediting. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only\nthe relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for\nunrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction,\nand out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks for LLaMA-3 and Mistral\nbackbones demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nreliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of\nsequential edits with minimal forgetting.",

However, recent studies have shown that exchanged\nmodel gradients remain susceptible to inference attacks such as Deep Leakage\nfrom Gradients (DLG), which can reconstruct private training data. While\nexisting defenses like Differential Privacy (DP) and Secure Multi-Party\nComputation (SMPC) offer protection, they often compromise model accuracy. To\nthat end, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) offers a promising alternative by\nenabling lossless computation directly on encrypted data, thereby preserving\nboth privacy and model utility. However, HE introduces significant\ncomputational and communication overhead, which can hinder its practical\nadoption. To address this, we systematically evaluate various leveled HE\nschemes to identify the most suitable for FL in resource-constrained\nenvironments due to its ability to support fixed-depth computations without\nrequiring costly bootstrapping. Our contributions in this paper include a\ncomprehensive evaluation of HE schemes for real-world FL applications, a\nselective encryption strategy that targets only the most sensitive gradients to\nminimize computational overhead, and the development of a full HE-based FL\npipeline that effectively mitigates DLG attacks while preserving model\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Video generative models democratize the creation of visual content through\nintuitive instruction following, but they also inherit the biases and harmful\nconcepts embedded within their web-scale training data. This inheritance\ncreates a significant risk, as users can readily generate undesirable and even\nillegal content. This work introduces the first unlearning technique tailored\nexplicitly for video diffusion models to address this critical issue. Our\nmethod requires 5 multi-modal prompt pairs only. Each pair contains a \"safe\"\nand an \"unsafe\" example that differ only by the target concept. Averaging their\nper-layer latent differences produces a \"refusal vector\", which, once\nsubtracted from the model parameters, neutralizes the unsafe concept. We\nintroduce a novel low-rank factorization approach on the covariance difference\nof embeddings that yields robust refusal vectors. This isolates the target\nconcept while minimizing collateral unlearning of other semantics, thus\npreserving the visual quality of the generated video. Our method preserves the\nmodel's generation quality while operating without retraining or access to the\noriginal training data. By embedding the refusal direction directly into the\nmodel's weights, the suppression mechanism becomes inherently more robust\nagainst adversarial bypass attempts compared to surface-level input-output\nfilters. In a thorough qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we show that we\ncan neutralize a variety of harmful contents, including explicit nudity,\ngraphic violence, copyrights, and trademarks.

The ONH of one eye was imaged\nunder two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated\nto ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects\ninto four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:\n(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full\nsuperior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).\nAutomatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to\ncompute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.\nBiomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning\nmodel. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal\nstep, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For\neach task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area\nunder the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance.

Egocentric data are inherently heterogeneous, with\nlarge variations in modality coverage across devices and settings.

    "abstract": "Event cameras unlock new frontiers that were previously unthinkable with\nstandard frame-based cameras. One notable example is low-latency motion\nestimation (optical flow), which is critical for many real-time applications.\nIn such applications, the computational efficiency of algorithms is paramount.\nAlthough recent deep learning paradigms such as CNN, RNN, or ViT have shown\nremarkable performance, they often lack the desired computational efficiency.\nConversely, asynchronous event-based methods including SNNs and GNNs are\ncomputationally efficient; however, these approaches fail to capture sufficient\nspatio-temporal information, a powerful feature required to achieve better\nperformance for optical flow estimation. In this work, we introduce\nSpatio-Temporal State Space Model (STSSM) module along with a novel network\narchitecture to develop an extremely efficient solution with competitive\nperformance. Our STSSM module leverages state-space models to effectively\ncapture spatio-temporal correlations in event data, offering higher performance\nwith lower complexity compared to ViT, CNN-based architectures in similar\nsettings. Our model achieves 4.5x faster inference and 8x lower computations\ncompared to TMA and 2x lower computations compared to EV-FlowNet with\ncompetitive performance on the DSEC benchmark.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of underwater acoustic source tracking and\npursuit with a team of autonomous underwater vehicles. Producing distributed\ncontrol strategies in an underwater sensor network is not trivial since\ncommunication is primarily acoustic, which makes it intermittent and often\nplagued with major difficulties. For this reason, we propose an optimization\nscheme based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process for improving\nthe performance of underwater mobile sensor networks, in which autonomous\nunderwater vehicles (agents) play the role of moving nodes of a network. The\nkey idea is to adjust the agents' guidance strategies to achieve coordinated\nmotion planning, enabling optimal geometric configurations between the agents\nand the target to enhance tracking performance. Such a problem is cast as a\nmulti-objective optimization problem that is solved through a receding horizon\nlookahead optimization scheme since we are interested in long-term tracking\naccuracy. The planning strategy is distributed using the sequential multi-agent\ndecision-making paradigm to make the solving tractable since the optimization\ndepends on the joint action domain. A distributed control framework has been\nimplemented in a simulation environment to validate the proposed approach,\nwhich explicitly accounts for the major limitations imposed by acoustic\ncommunications.",

Yet, prior\nwork on loco-manipulation is often constrained to specific tasks or\npredetermined limb configurations. In this work, we present Reinforcement\nLearning for Interlimb Coordination (ReLIC), an approach that enables versatile\nloco-manipulation through flexible interlimb coordination. The key to our\napproach is an adaptive controller that seamlessly bridges the execution of\nmanipulation motions and the generation of stable gaits based on task demands.\nThrough the interplay between two controller modules, ReLIC dynamically assigns\neach limb for manipulation or locomotion and robustly coordinates them to\nachieve the task success. Using efficient reinforcement learning in simulation,\nReLIC learns to perform stable gaits in accordance with the manipulation goals\nin the real world. To solve diverse and complex tasks, we further propose to\ninterface the learned controller with different types of task specifications,\nincluding target trajectories, contact points, and natural language\ninstructions. Evaluated on 12 real-world tasks that require diverse and complex\ncoordination patterns, ReLIC demonstrates its versatility and robustness by\nachieving a success rate of 78.9% on average.

Under\ntransceiver hybrid arrays, we characterize the sensing performance by deriving\nthe posterior Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) of the mean-squared error which is a\nfunction of the transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming. We\nstudy joint transmit hybrid beamforming and receive analog beamforming\noptimization to minimize the PCRB subject to a communication rate requirement.\nWe first consider a sensing-only system and derive the optimal solution to each\nelement in the transmit/receive analog beamforming matrices that minimizes the\nPCRB in closed form. Then, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) based\nalgorithm. Next, we study a narrowband MIMO ISAC system and devise an efficient\nAO-based hybrid beamforming algorithm by leveraging weighted minimum\nmean-squared error and feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation\nmethods. Furthermore, we extend the results for narrowband systems to a MIMO\northogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. Numerical\nresults validate the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid beamforming designs.\nIt is revealed that the number of receive RF chains has more significant impact\non the sensing performance than its transmit counterpart.

    "abstract": "Recent works have started to theoretically investigate how we can protect\ndifferentially private programs against timing attacks, by making the joint\ndistribution the output and the runtime differentially private (JOT-DP).\nHowever, the existing approaches to JOT-DP have some limitations, particularly\nin the setting of unbounded DP (which protects the size of the dataset and\napplies to arbitrarily large datasets). First, the known conversion of pure DP\nprograms to pure JOT-DP programs in the unbounded setting (a) incurs a constant\nadditive increase in error probability (and thus does not provide vanishing\nerror as $n\\to\\infty$) (b) produces JOT-DP programs that fail to preserve the\ncomputational efficiency of the original pure DP program and (c) is analyzed in\na toy computational model in which the runtime is defined to be the number of\ncoin flips. In this work, we overcome these limitations. Specifically, we show\nthat the error required for pure JOT-DP in the unbounded setting depends on the\nmodel of computation. In a randomized RAM model where the dataset size $n$ is\ngiven (or can be computed in constant time) and we can generate random numbers\n(not just random bits) in constant time, polynomially small error probability\nis necessary and sufficient. If $n$ is not given or we only have a random-bit\ngenerator, an (arbitrarily small) constant error probability is necessary and\nsufficient. The aforementioned positive results are proven by efficient\nprocedures to convert any pure JOT-DP program $P$ in the upper-bounded setting\nto a pure JOT-DP program $P'$ in the unbounded setting, such that the output\ndistribution of $P'$ is $\\gamma$-close in total variation distance to that of\n$P$, where $\\gamma$ is either an arbitrarily small constant or polynomially\nsmall, depending on the model of computation.",

We collect a dataset of ping-pong game\nsequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized\nwith sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our\nsystem leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to\nprocess only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach\nimproves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational\nlatency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually\nrelevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected\ntrajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms,\nincluding computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based\n30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception.\nFinally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the\nball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from\nan egocentric perspective using event cameras.",

To mitigate this, a dual-spin stabilized satellite actuated via\nmagnetic torque rods reduces the space and power required of the attitude\ncontrol system, but may require advanced control policies. This paper explores\nthe attitude control of a magnetically actuated dual-spin stabilized CubeSat\nwith model predictive control using time-varying prediction dynamics. An\ninertial pointing objective is used as a representative mission, where the\nsatellite is able to deviate from its nominal orientation within some allowable\namount. Three time-varying MPC policies are developed and compared to ensure\nthe system does not violate constraints while minimizing control effort. These\npolicies include a prediction model that accounts for the orbital position of\nthe satellite and two iterative approaches that incorporate control inputs\nthrough either propagation of the linear dynamics, or nonlinear propagation\nwith successive linearization. Results demonstrate that the nonlinear\nprediction policy outperforms other prediction methods with regards to not only\nminimal actuation, but to constraint satisfaction as well while imparting\nminimal computational burden.",

Second, it uses Residual-Adaptive\nNonconformity Scores by training a secondary GNN on a held-out calibration set\nto estimate task-specific residuals, dynamically adjusting prediction intervals\naccording to node or edge uncertainty. Third, it adopts a Cross-Training\nProtocol, which alternates the optimization of the primary GNN and the residual\npredictor to prevent information leakage while maintaining graph dependencies.\nWe validate RR-GNN on 15 real-world graphs across diverse tasks, including node\nclassification, regression, and edge weight prediction.

    "abstract": "Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical\nchallenge, particularly in tracking the temporal evolution of their\nhierarchical components. While foundational conceptual frameworks like IFLA\nLRMoo provide a generic toolkit for bibliographic data, and encoding standards\nlike Akoma Ntoso offer a robust syntax for legal documents, a dedicated, formal\nmodeling pattern for granular, component-level versioning is still required.\nThis limitation hinders the deterministic point-intime reconstruction of legal\ntexts, a fundamental capability for reliable Legal Tech and AI applications.\nThis paper proposes a structured, temporal modeling pattern grounded in the\nLRMoo ontology to address this need. Our approach models the evolution of a\nlegal norm as a diachronic chain of F2 Expressions. We introduce a key\ndistinction between a language-agnostic Temporal Version (TV)-a semantic\nsnapshot of the norm's structure-and its concrete monolingual realizations, the\nLanguage Versions (LV). Both are modeled as F2 Expressions linked by the\ncanonical R76 is derivative of property. This paradigm is applied recursively\nto the legal text's internal structure, representing it as a parallel hierarchy\nof abstract Component Works (F1) and their versioned Component Expressions\n(F2). Furthermore, we formalize the legislative amendment process using the F28\nExpression Creation event, allowing changes to be traced from an amending act\nto its precise effect on the amended norm. Using the Brazilian Federal\nConstitution as a case study, we demonstrate how this event-centric\narchitecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of\nany part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date.

We present a detailed study of the link between\ngalaxy merger, AGN ignition, radio jet expansion and galactic-scale molecular\noutflow in IRAS 00183-7111, using high-resolution Atacama Large\nMillimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) and\n$^{12}$CO(3-2) lines and very deep $i$-band VLT Survey Telescope (VST) imaging.\nThe latter allows us to put - for the first time - tight constraints on the\nassembly history of the system, confirming that it formed through a major\nmerger between two gas-rich spirals, likely characterised by a prograde\nencounter and no older than 2 Gyr. The recent merger channelled about\n$(1.0\\pm0.1)\\times10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of molecular gas in the central regions\nof the remnant, as traced by the CO detections. The spatial correlation between\nthe CO distribution and the radio core suggests that this gas likely\ncontributed to the ignition of the AGN and thus to the launch of the radio\njets, which are no older than 2 Myr. Furthermore, by comparing the relative\nstrength of the two CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation (i.e.\n$T_{\\rm ex}\\gg50$ K) around the radio lobes, supporting the case for a jet-ISM\ninteraction.

We propose F2Net, a frequency-aware framework that decomposes UHR\nimages into high- and low-frequency components for specialized processing. The\nhigh-frequency branch preserves full-resolution structural details, while the\nlow-frequency branch processes downsampled inputs through dual sub-branches\ncapturing short- and long-range dependencies. A Hybrid-Frequency Fusion module\nintegrates these observations, guided by two novel objectives: Cross-Frequency\nAlignment Loss ensures semantic consistency between frequency components, and\nCross-Frequency Balance Loss regulates gradient magnitudes across branches to\nstabilize training. Evaluated on DeepGlobe and Inria Aerial benchmarks, F2Net\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with mIoU of 80.22 and 83.39,\nrespectively. Our code will be publicly available.",

EpiCast models transmission across a\nrealistic synthetic population, capturing individual-level interactions. In our\nmodel, fear propagates through both in-person contact and broadcast media,\nprompting individuals to adopt protective behaviors that reduce disease spread.\nIn order to better understand these coupled dynamics, we create and compare a\nrange of compartmental surrogate models to analyze the impact of including\nvarious disease states. Additionally, we compare a range of behavioral\nscenarios within EpiCast, varying the level and intensity of fear and\nbehavioral change. Our results show that the addition of asymptomatic, exposed,\nand pre-symptomatic disease states can impact both the rate at which an\noutbreak progresses and its overall trajectory. Moreover, the combination of\nnon-local fear spread via broadcasters and strong behavioral responses by\nfearful individuals generally leads to multiple epidemic waves, an outcome that\noccurs only within a narrow parameter range when fear spreads purely through\nlocal contact. Accounting for the coupled spread of fear and disease is\ncritical for understanding disease dynamics and designing timely, targeted\nresponses to emerging infectious threats.",

To address this\ngap, we systematically investigated the behavior of diffusion models under\nlow-noise diffusion dynamics, with implications for model robustness and\ninterpretability.

In this work, we first evaluate the\nelectrochemical stability of more than 3000 two-dimensional (2D) materials\nusing conventional Pourbaix diagrams (CPDs). Due to the complete neglect of\nthermodynamic barriers along the (often complex) reaction pathways, the vast\nmajority of the materials are predicted to be unstable even though some are\nknown to be stable in practice. We then introduce an analysis based on the\nsurface Pourbaix diagram (SPD) including 'early intermediate states' that\nrepresent the first steps of the key surface passivation and dissolution\nreactions. The SPD framework is applied to the 2D materials MoS$_2$,\nphosphorene, and the MXene Ti$_2$C, all of which are predicted to be unstable\nby the CPD. For MoS$_2$, our approach reproduces the experimental pH-U\nstability window as well as the experimental desulphurization potential. For\nphosphorene and Ti2$_C$, the SPD approach is used to investigate the\nspontaneous degradation mechanism and the potential-dependent surface\ntermination, respectively, again yielding good agreement with experiments. The\nSPD-based stability analysis emerges as a versatile and quantitative method for\nprediction of stability and investigation of surface structures in\nelectrochemical environments.",

    "abstract": "The term scientific workflow has evolved over the last two decades to\nencompass a broad range of compositions of interdependent compute tasks and\ndata movements. It has also become an umbrella term for processing in modern\nscientific applications. Today, many scientific applications can be considered\nas workflows made of multiple dependent steps, and hundreds of workflow\nmanagement systems (WMSs) have been developed to manage and run these\nworkflows. However, no turnkey solution has emerged to address the diversity of\nscientific processes and the infrastructure on which they are implemented.\nInstead, new research problems requiring the execution of scientific workflows\nwith some novel feature often lead to the development of an entirely new WMS. A\ndirect consequence is that many existing WMSs share some salient features,\noffer similar functionalities, and can manage the same categories of workflows\nbut also have some distinct capabilities. This situation makes researchers who\ndevelop workflows face the complex question of selecting a WMS. This selection\ncan be driven by technical considerations, to find the system that is the most\nappropriate for their application and for the resources available to them, or\nother factors such as reputation, adoption, strong community support, or\nlong-term sustainability. To address this problem, a group of WMS developers\nand practitioners joined their efforts to produce a community-based terminology\nof WMSs. This paper summarizes their findings and introduces this new\nterminology to characterize WMSs. This terminology is composed of fives axes:\nworkflow characteristics, composition, orchestration, data management, and\nmetadata capture. Each axis comprises several concepts that capture the\nprominent features of WMSs. Based on this terminology, this paper also presents\na classification of 23 existing WMSs according to the proposed axes and terms.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become the cornerstone of modern AI.\nHowever, the existing paradigm of next-token prediction fundamentally limits\ntheir ability to form coherent, high-level concepts, making it a critical\nbarrier to human-like understanding and reasoning. Take the phrase \"ribonucleic\nacid\" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,\nartificial text fragments (\"rib\", \"on\", ...), then learn each token\nsequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic\nentity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding\nand, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we\nintroduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method\nthat redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned. By enabling the learning of sequences\nthat span multiple tokens, this method fosters stronger concept-aware learning.\nOur experiments demonstrate significant improvements compared to conventional\nnext-token finetuning methods across diverse tasks, including traditional\napplications like text summarization and domain-specific ones like de novo\nprotein design. Multi-token prediction was previously only possible in the\nprohibitively expensive pretraining phase; CAFT, to our knowledge, is the first\nto bring the multi-token setting to the post-training phase, thus effectively\ndemocratizing its benefits for the broader community of practitioners and\nresearchers.

This kind of malware represents a significant threat in contemporany\nsystems. Despite the existence of kernel-space rootkits (i.e. rootkits that\ninfect the operating system kernel), user-space rootkits (i.e. rootkits that\ninfect the user-space operating system tools, commands and libraries) continue\nto pose a significant danger. However, kernel-space rootkits attract all the\nattention, implicitly assuming that user-space rootkits (malware that is still\nin existence) are easily detectable by well-known user-space tools that look\nfor anomalies. The primary objective of this work is to answer the following\nquestion: Is detecting user-space rootkits with user-space tools futile?\nContrary to the prevailing view that considers it effective, we argue that the\ndetection of user-space rootkits cannot be done in user-space at all. Moreover,\nthe detection results must be communicated to the user with extreme caution. To\nsupport this claim, we conducted different experiments focusing on process\nconcealing in Linux systems. In these experiments, we evade the detection\nmechanisms widely accepted as the standard solution for this type of user-space\nmalware, bypassing the most popular open source anti-rootkit tool for process\nhiding. This manuscript describes the classical approach to build user-space\nlibrary rootkits, the traditional detection mechanisms, and different evasion\ntechniques (it also includes understandable code snippets and examples).

Much like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative\nthought patterns, are executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and\naggregated step by step-enabling the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty\nand synthesize robust solutions.We evaluate Guideline Forest on four\nbenchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning mathematical and\nprogrammatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies further\nhighlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation,\nunderscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential.",

A periodic\nsystem of PTMs is expected to have low-energy bands that strongly reflect the\nproperties of the zero modes of PTMs as effective atoms. In this study, we show\nthat the low-energy Dirac bands in a class of honeycomb PTMs (H-PTM) can be\nrepresented by an effective honeycomb model which is determined only by the\nconnections between neighboring effective atoms.The hopping parameters of H-PTM\nin each direction take positive integer ratios according to the connection\norder between two PTMs.By structurally designing each PTM, we can change the\nconnection order of the PTMs and hence modulate the energy gap and the Fermi\nvelocity of the Dirac band of the H-PTM. Moreover, we confirm that Dirac bands\ncoexist with vacancy-localized zero modes in the H-PTM with vacancies.The\nresult indicates that the nanographene structure arranging PTMs as effective\natoms extends material design freedom that effectively generates a modulated\nDirac electron system with coexisting localized electron spins for\ngraphene-based electronic and quantum devices.",

To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based\nMamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image\nrestoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the\nmodel's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a\nCLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with\nCLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal\nfeature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various\ndegradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies\nand fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that\nintegrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range\nmodeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative\noptimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,\npreserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we\nintroduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances\nglobal modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention\nto degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient\nand precise restoration. Extensive experiments across multiple image\nrestoration benchmarks validate the superiority of M2Restore in both visual\nquality and quantitative performance.",

    "abstract": "In many settings in science and industry, such as drug discovery and clinical\ntrials, a central challenge is designing experiments under time and budget\nconstraints. Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design (BOED) is a paradigm to pick\nmaximally informative designs that has been increasingly applied to such\nproblems. During training, BOED selects inputs according to a pre-determined\nacquisition criterion. During testing, the model learned during training\nencounters a naturally occurring distribution of test samples. This leads to an\ninstance of covariate shift, where the train and test samples are drawn from\ndifferent distributions. Prior work has shown that in the presence of model\nmisspecification, covariate shift amplifies generalization error. Our first\ncontribution is to provide a mathematical decomposition of generalization error\nthat reveals key contributors to generalization error in the presence of model\nmisspecification. We show that generalization error under misspecification is\nthe result of, in addition to covariate shift, a phenomenon we term error\n(de-)amplification which has not been identified or studied in prior work. Our\nsecond contribution is to provide a detailed empirical analysis to show that\nmethods that result in representative and de-amplifying training data increase\ngeneralization performance. Our third contribution is to develop a novel\nacquisition function that mitigates the effects of model misspecification by\nincluding a term for representativeness and implicitly inducing\nde-amplification. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method\noutperforms traditional BOED in the presence of misspecification.",

Correspondingly, we introduce OPSA-AT\n(Adversarial Training), a defense strategy that integrates OPSA within a novel\nconformal training paradigm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our OPSA\nattack method induces greater uncertainty compared to baseline approaches for\nvarious defenses. Conversely, our OPSA-AT defensive model significantly\nenhances robustness not only against OPSA but also other adversarial attacks,\nand maintains reliable prediction.

Additionally, we derive the point spread function to analyze\nthe influences of different antenna, subcarrier, and resolution settings on the\nimaging performance.

    "abstract": "This work presents a unified fluid modeling framework for reacting flows\ncoupled with nonthermal plasmas (NTPs). Building upon the gas-plasma kinetics\nsolver, ChemPlasKin, and the CFD library, OpenFOAM, the integrated solver,\nreactPlasFOAM, allows simulation of fully coupled plasma-combustion systems\nwith versatility and high performance. By simplifying the governing equations\naccording to the dominant physical phenomena at each stage, the solver\nseamlessly switches between four operating modes: streamer, spark, reacting\nflow, and ionic wind, using coherent data structures. Unlike conventional\nstreamer solvers that rely on pre-tabulated or fitted electron transport\nproperties and reaction rates as functions of the reduced electric field or\nelectron temperature, our approach solves the electron Boltzmann equation (EBE)\non the fly to update the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) at the\ncell level. This enables a high-fidelity representation of evolving plasma\nchemistry and dynamics by capturing temporal and spatial variations in mixture\ncomposition and temperature. To improve computational efficiency for this\nmultiscale, multiphysics system, we employ adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in\nthe plasma channel, dynamic load balancing for parallelization, and time-step\nsubcycling for fast and slow transport processes. The solver is first verified\nagainst six established plasma codes for positive-streamer simulations and\nbenchmarked against Cantera for a freely propagating hydrogen flame, then\napplied to three cases: (1) spark discharge in airflow; (2) streamer\npropagation in a premixed flame; and (3) flame dynamics under non-breakdown\nelectric fields. These applications validate the model's ability to predict NTP\nproperties such as fast heating and radical production and demonstrate its\npotential to reveal two-way coupling between plasma and combustion.",

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel robust regression method, termed Heavy Lasso, which\nincorporates a loss function inspired by the Student's t-distribution within a\nLasso penalization framework. This loss retains the desirable quadratic\nbehavior for small residuals while adaptively downweighting large deviations,\nthus enhancing robustness to heavy-tailed noise and outliers. Heavy Lasso\nenjoys computationally efficient by leveraging a data augmentation scheme and a\nsoft-thresholding algorithm, which integrate seamlessly with classical Lasso\nsolvers. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic bounds under both $\\ell_1$\nand $\\ell_2 $ norms, by employing the framework of localized convexity, showing\nthat the Heavy Lasso estimator achieves rates comparable to those of the Huber\nloss. Extensive numerical studies demonstrate Heavy Lasso's superior\nperformance over classical Lasso and other robust variants, highlighting its\neffectiveness in challenging noisy settings.

In the considered storage system, the\n$M$ files are stored across the $N$ distributed servers in an $X$-secure\n$K$-coded manner such that any group of up to $X$ colluding servers learns\nnothing about the files; the storage overhead at each server is reduced by a\nfactor of $\\frac{1}{K}$ compared to the total size of the files; and the files\ncan be reconstructed from any $K+X$ servers. However, in practical scenarios,\nwhen the user retrieves the desired file from the distributed system, some\nservers may respond to the user very slowly or not respond at all. These\nservers are referred to as \\emph{stragglers}, and particularly their identities\nand numbers are unknown in advance and may change over time. This paper\nconsiders the adaptive PIR problem that can be capable of tolerating the\npresence of a varying number of stragglers. We propose a general coding method\nfor designing adaptive PIR schemes by introducing the concept of a\n\\emph{feasible PIR coding framework}.

Additionally, we provide an\nimplementation of the \\emph{feasible PIR coding framework}, ensuring that the\nadaptive PIR scheme operates over any finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ with size\n$q\\geq N+\\max\\{K, N-(K+X+T-1)\\}$.",

According to the Integrated Sensing And\nCommunication (ISAC) paradigm, DFL networks exploit Radio Frequency (RF)\ndevices, used for communication purposes, to evaluate also the excess\nattenuation due to targets moving in the monitored area, to estimate the target\npositions and movements. Several target models have been discussed in the\nliterature to evaluate the target positions by exploiting the RF signals\nreceived by networked devices. Among these models, Electromagnetic (EM) body\nmodels emerged as an interesting research field for excess attenuation\nprediction using commercial RF devices. While these RF devices are usually\nsingle-antenna boards, the availability of low-cost multi-antenna devices e.g.\nthose used in WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) scenarios, allow us to exploit\narray-based signal processing techniques for DFL applications as well. Using an\narray-capable EM body model, this paper shows how to employ array-based\nprocessing to improve angular detection of targets.

Our objective in this work is to test these numerical predictions\nwith observational data by comparing galaxies in voids with galaxies in\nnon-void environments. We used voids identified in SDSS data and galaxies from\nthe MaNGA survey, which provides galaxies with integral field spectroscopy\n(IFS). We separated the galaxies into void and non-void samples, mimicked the\nmagnitude distribution, and compared their integrated astrophysical properties\nas well as the metallicity and age profiles through a stacking technique, ETGs\nand LTGs separately. We find that void galaxies have younger and less\nmetal-rich stellar populations. Regarding gas mass, we do not find differences\nacross environments. When dividing galaxies into ETGs and LTGs, we observe that\nETGs show negative gradients in both age and metallicity, with void galaxies\nconsistently appearing younger and less metal-rich. For LTGs, age gradients are\nalso negative, showing younger populations in void galaxies. However, we do not\nfind statistically significant differences in stellar metallicity gradients\nbetween void and non-void environments. Our results show how the astrophysical\nproperties of galaxies in voids differ from those of galaxies in the rest of\nthe Universe.

This paper presents VLAgent, a vision-language\nagent system for vision-text compositional reasoning with three novel features.\nFirst, VLAgent leverages a pre-trained LLM with few-shot context learning to\ngenerate the planning script for each compositional reasoning task and provides\na backend engine to generate and perform executable runtime, which maps the\nplanning script into executable code using the VLAgent library for VLAgent\nexecutor. Second, VLAgent introduces the SS-parser, which identifies and\ncorrects logic errors embedded in the LLM-generated planning script, to further\nenhance the quality of script-executable mapping. Third, VLAgent introduces the\ncompositional reasoning output verifier, which validates and refines the output\nof complex compositional reasoning steps, by leveraging complementary reasoning\ntechniques, e.g., ensemble learning and caption analysis. Extensive experiments\nare conducted on six visual benchmarks and compared to a dozen of the SoTA\nvisual reasoning models. The results show that VLAgent outperforms existing\nrepresentative approaches for compositional text-visual reasoning. Our code and\ndatasets with outputs will be made available upon acceptance.",

These accessibility features may help to\naddress unique assemblage of accessibility needs an individual may accumulate\nthrough age. We adopt insights from gerontology, HCI, and disability studies\ninto the digital game design discourse for older adults, and we contribute\ninsight that can guide the integration of player-based accessibility features\nto supplement game-based counterparts. The accessibility of digital games for\nheterogenous older adult audience is paramount, as the medium offers short-term\nsocial, emotional, psychological, cognitive, and physical that support the\nlong-term goal of aging well.",

This has been proposed in the\npresent paper. Samples containing one or ten CdTe quantum wells with\nCd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te barriers are grown by a molecular beam epitaxy on a\nsemi-insulating GaAs substrate. Each well is modulation-doped with iodine\ndonors which leads to the creation of a two-dimensional electron gas in the\nwells. Polarization-resolved ($\\sigma^+/\\sigma^-$) photoluminescence spectra\nare measured at liquid helium temperatures and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The\nresults are interpreted on the basis of calculations of the energy of Landau\nlevels in the conduction and valence bands. In the latter case, we use the\nLuttinger Hamiltonian while the conduction band is described within a\nthree-level k$\\cdot$p model. Both models, originally formulated for bulk\nmaterials, are adapted for two-dimensional structures. We have found that the\nmajority of all observed transitions is well reproducede by this theory.\nHowever, some strong transitions are not which allows us to propose an enlarged\nscheme of selection rules of the photoluminescence transitions resulting from\nmixing of the conduction and valence bands. We observe transitions involving\nLandau levels in the valence band with the index up to 7. To understand the\norigin of occupation with photoexcited holes of these levels, lying deep in the\nvalence band, we carry out time-resolved measurements which show that the\nphotoexcited barrier is a source of long-lived holes tunneling into the quantum\nwells. Calculations of the conduction band electron effective g-factor show its\nstrong variation with the electron's energy and the external magnetic field.",

This property holds\nin quantum theory and features prominently in axiomatic reconstructions of the\ntheory, where it serves to rule out a wide class of alternatives. For instance,\nquantum theory with Hilbert spaces defined over the real field (rather than the\ncomplex field) is an example of a theory that is ruled out in this fashion.\nGiven its foundational importance, it is worthwhile to subject this principle\nto a direct experimental test. Specifically, we consider an experiment on the\npolarization degrees of freedom of a pair of photonic modes in a\nprepare-and-measure scenario and analyze the resulting data within the\nframework of generalized probabilistic theories. The signature of a failure of\ntomographic locality is that there are pairs of states on the bipartite system\nthat can only be distinguished by the statistics they yield for non-separable\nmeasurements. In the full quantum setting, we find no evidence of a violation\nof tomographic locality. As a test of our analysis method, we also verify that\nif we restrict attention to those states and measurements that lie within the\nfragment described by quantum theory over the real field, then a clear\nsignature of the failure of tomographic locality is observed.",

In one\ndimension, the arrangement of metal-halide octahedra in chains with corner-,\nedge-, or face-sharing connectivity allows for additional structural\nflexibility. This not only expands material design possibilities but also\nreflects quasi-one-dimensional motifs that arise during perovskite formation\nbut are poorly understood. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory\nwithin the $GW$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation framework, we provide a\ncomprehensive picture of how one-dimensional confinement, octahedral\nconnectivity and dielectric screening affect optical absorption and exciton\nphotophysics in these materials. Our calculations reveal that increasing\noctahedral connectivity leads to increased exciton binding and complex,\nanisotropic optical signatures. However, in experimentally synthesized\norganic-inorganic systems, pronounced dielectric screening effects can reduce\nexciton binding energies by several hundred meV, altering these trends. These\nfindings offer insights and design principles for excitonic properties, and aid\nthe interpretation of optical experiments on one-dimensional perovskites.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies like ChatGPT now threaten\nbibliometrics as the primary generators of research quality indicators. They\nare already used in at least one research quality evaluation system and\nevidence suggests that they are used informally by many peer reviewers. Since\nusing bibliometrics to support research evaluation continues to be\ncontroversial, this article reviews the corresponding advantages and\ndisadvantages of AI-generated quality scores. From a technical perspective,\ngenerative AI based on Large Language Models (LLMs) equals or surpasses\nbibliometrics in most important dimensions, including accuracy (mostly higher\ncorrelations with human scores), and coverage (more fields, more recent years)\nand may reflect more research quality dimensions. Like bibliometrics, current\nLLMs do not \"measure\" research quality, however. On the clearly negative side,\nLLM biases are currently unknown for research evaluation, and LLM scores are\nless transparent than citation counts. From a systemic perspective, the key\nissue is how introducing LLM-based indicators into research evaluation will\nchange the behaviour of researchers. Whilst bibliometrics encourage some\nauthors to target journals with high impact factors or to try to write highly\ncited work, LLM-based indicators may push them towards writing misleading\nabstracts and overselling their work in the hope of impressing the AI.\nMoreover, if AI-generated journal indicators replace impact factors, then this\nwould encourage journals to allow authors to oversell their work in abstracts,\nthreatening the integrity of the academic record.",

The reported results demonstrate that\nbandgap, valley polarization, and second harmonic generation can be tuned\neffectively by varying doping concentration of Germanium. The Berry curvature\nprofile is antisymmetric for corresponding K and K' valleys, thus leading to\nvalley-dependent transport properties and a potential valley Hall effect.\nFinally, the second-order susceptibilities exhibit corresponding optical\nabsorption peaks, indicating efficient second-harmonic generation due to the\nbroken inversion symmetry.

We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that\nformulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an\nexplicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance\nRepresentation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from\ndifferent trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition\nstitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal\nsequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the\nsubgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)\nmetric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly\nenhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across\nlocomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most\nstitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing\nthe previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0.

The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with\nlow-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this\nresearch. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose\nthe SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power\nmonocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will\ngenerate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared\nwith the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue,\ninspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose\na cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature\nrepresentation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated\nfiltering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the\nspeed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can\nmaintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection\nperformance.

    "abstract": "In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic\nsegmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of\nbuilding information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an\nautomatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on\nmultimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF).\nFirst, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction\nmechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the\nsemantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the\nsemantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an\nend-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the\nmapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the\ninfluence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the\nautomation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive\nexperiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF\noutperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF\nmodel can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse\ndatasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and\ngeneralization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected\nto provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision\ntechnology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application\nof multimodal learning in the architectural field.",

A prevalent solution is a dual-system\narchitecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a\nlarger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system\ndesigns often implement parallel architectures where inference is either\ndirectly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved\nfrom previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle\nto enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key\ninsight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous\ntime steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large\nmodels respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we\nintroduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system\ndesigned to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current\nframe using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame\nfeatures using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate\nthese dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes\naction-critical image regions.

The combined intensity and phase\nresponse of non-hyperbolic and hyperbolic SPs suggests that they are\ntopologically distinct. We predict analogous effects for hyperbolic surface\nphonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride. Our work suggests that organic\nmaterials can provide a new platform for the exploration of hyperbolic surface\npolaritonics at visible frequencies.",

Despite traditional authentication protocols, recent results showed\nthat attackers may steal energy through tailored relay attacks. One\ncountermeasure is leveraging the EV's fingerprint on the current exchanged\nduring charging. However, existing methods focus on the final charging stage,\nallowing malicious actors to consume substantial energy before being detected\nand repudiated. This underscores the need for earlier and more effective\nauthentication methods to prevent unauthorized charging. Meanwhile, profiling\nraises privacy concerns, as uniquely identifying EVs through charging patterns\ncould enable user tracking.\n  In this paper, we propose a framework for uniquely identifying EVs using\nphysical measurements from the early charging stages. We hypothesize that\nvoltage behavior early in the process exhibits similar characteristics to\ncurrent behavior in later stages. By extracting features from early voltage\nmeasurements, we demonstrate the feasibility of EV profiling.

One particular challenge in this task lies at the motion\ntransfer process from the source video to the edited one, where it requires the\nconsideration of the shape deformation in between, meanwhile maintaining the\ntemporal consistency in the generated video sequence. However, existing methods\nfail to model complicated motion patterns for video editing, and are\nfundamentally limited to object replacement, where tasks with non-rigid object\nmotions like multi-object and portrait editing are largely neglected. In this\npaper, we observe that optical flows offer a promising alternative in complex\nmotion modeling, and present FlowV2V to re-investigate video editing as a task\nof flow-driven Image-to-Video (I2V) generation. Specifically, FlowV2V\ndecomposes the entire pipeline into first-frame editing and conditional I2V\ngeneration, and simulates pseudo flow sequence that aligns with the deformed\nshape, thus ensuring the consistency during editing. Experimental results on\nDAVIS-EDIT with improvements of 13.67% and 50.66% on DOVER and warping error\nillustrate the superior temporal consistency and sample quality of FlowV2V\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art ones.

While effective for large models, we\nidentify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language\nmodels (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience\nsignificant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the\nQwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is\nwidespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT\nexamples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning.\nStrikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even\ntraining on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original\nperformance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error\naccumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step\nreasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we\nfind that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement\nlearning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT).

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to reconcile several apparently contradictory\nobservations in market microstructure: is the famous \"square-root law\" of\nmetaorder impact, which decays with time, compatible with the random-walk\nnature of prices and the linear impact of order imbalances? Can one entirely\nexplain the volatility of prices as resulting from the flow of uninformed\nmetaorders that mechanically impact them? We introduce a new theoretical\nframework to describe metaorders with different signs, sizes and durations,\nwhich all impact prices as a square-root of volume but with a subsequent time\ndecay. We show that, as in the original propagator model, price diffusion is\nensured by the long memory of cross-correlations between metaorders. In order\nto account for the effect of strongly fluctuating volumes q of individual\ntrades, we further introduce two q-dependent exponents, which allow us to\ndescribe how the moments of generalized volume imbalance and the correlation\nbetween price changes and generalized order flow imbalance scale with T. We\npredict in particular that the corresponding power-laws depend in a\nnon-monotonic fashion on a parameter a, which allows one to put the same weight\non all child orders or to overweight large ones, a behaviour that is clearly\nborne out by empirical data. We also predict that the correlation between price\nchanges and volume imbalances should display a maximum as a function of a,\nwhich again matches observations. Such noteworthy agreement between theory and\ndata suggests that our framework correctly captures the basic mechanism at the\nheart of price formation, namely the average impact of metaorders. We argue\nthat our results support the \"Order-Driven\" theory of excess volatility, and\nare at odds with the idea that a \"Fundamental\" component accounts for a large\nshare of the volatility of financial markets.",

However, most\nexisting neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without\nadequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for\nmotion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we\ndesign a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an\ninteractive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive\nquantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional\nmotion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and\nreconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an\ninteractive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between\nbi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging\npartitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a\nselective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to\nachieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal\ncontexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a\nhyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.\nBy treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent\nrepresentation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the\nfused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and\nachieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC\nreference software under random-access configurations.",

According to the theory of single star\nevolution they should not exist because, due to their large mass, they should\nhave already evolved to stellar remnants. Hence, they are suspected to be the\nresult of mass-enhancement processes, like mass-transfer activity in binary\nsystems, mergers in binary or higher order systems, or direct stellar\ncollisions, possibly mediated by dynamical interactions. Galactic globular\nclusters (GGCs) are templates of collisional stellar systems, where frequent\ngravitational interactions among stars occur on timescales shorter than their\nage. Thus, in these systems the number of BSSs originated by stellar collisions\nis expected to increase with the local stellar density and the collision rate.\nHere we analyse a sample of more than 3000 BSSs homogeneously observed in 48\nGGCs with different structures, and we find that the number of BSSs normalized\nto the sampled luminosity anti-correlates (instead of correlating) with the\ncentral density, the collision rate, and the dynamical age of the parent\ncluster. We also find strikingly similar trends between these environmental\nproperties and the cluster binary fraction, indicating that the latter\ndecreases in high density/high collisional regions. We finally demonstrate that\nthe correlations found between BSSs and the environmental parameters are\nexplained by an underlying dependence of the BSS specific frequency on binary\nfraction. Once inserted in the context of the current knowledge of the BSS\nphenomenon, these correlations indicate that low-density regions (possibly\nbecause of a higher binary production/survival rate) are the natural habitat of\nboth BSSs and binary systems, and the observed BSSs mostly have a\nbinary-related origin mediated by the environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Symmetries are important guiding principle for phase transitions. We\nsystematically construct field theory models with local quantum fields that\nexhibit the following phase transitions: (1) different symmetry protected\ntopological (SPT) phases with generalized symmetries; (2) different symmetry\nenriched topological (SET) phases with generalized symmetries differ by\nsymmetry fractionalizations; (3) spontaneously broken generalized symmetries,\nwhere the unbroken phases can have nontrivial SPT or SET. The models are\nordinary gauge theories with bosons or fermions in 3+1d and 2+1d. We focus on\none-form symmetries and symmetries generated by condensation defects, which do\nnot act on local operators. The phase transitions are protected from local\noperator perturbations which do not change the asymptotic phases.

    "abstract": "Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that\nrun more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite\nrules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance\nregressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query\nrewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite\nrules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques\ncannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts\nexhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and\nreasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL\nqueries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly\napplying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address\nthis issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and\nfeedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into\nsemantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a\nbroader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based\nmethods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite\nstate machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and\nenhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we\ndevelop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate\noptimized query equivalents.

In this paper, we systematically assess the strengths and\nlimitations of 11 benchmark prediction methods across 19 diverse benchmarks.\nFirst, we identify a highly competitive baseline: Take a random sample and fit\na regression model on the sample to predict missing entries. Outperforming most\nexisting methods, this baseline challenges the assumption that careful subset\nselection is necessary for benchmark prediction. Second, we discover that all\nexisting methods crucially depend on model similarity. They work best when\ninterpolating scores among similar models. The effectiveness of benchmark\nprediction sharply declines when new models have higher accuracy than\npreviously seen models. In this setting of extrapolation, none of the previous\nmethods consistently beat a simple average over random samples. To improve over\nthe sample average, we introduce a new method inspired by augmented inverse\npropensity weighting. This method consistently outperforms the random sample\naverage even for extrapolation. However, its performance still relies on model\nsimilarity and the gains are modest in general. This shows that benchmark\nprediction fails just when it is most needed: at the evaluation frontier, where\nthe goal is to evaluate new models of unknown capabilities.",

To address these challenges, in this\npaper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for\nhigh-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage\ninvolves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second\nstage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement\nmodel. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion\nmodel, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view\nInjection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI\nsupplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference\nview with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency\nusing epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer\ntraining strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through\njoint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K\ndatasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that\nProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent\nSOTA methods.",

A key assumption within the linear bias\napproximation of the halo model is that the halo bias between two halo\npopulations is a separable function of the mass of each population. In this\nwork, we test the validity of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear\nscales using both simulations and observational data. Unlike previous studies,\nwe explicitly disentangle the effects of scale dependence of the bias to assess\nthe robustness of bias separability across a broad range of halo masses and\nredshifts. In particular, we define a separability function based on halo or\ngalaxy cross-correlations to quantify deviations from halo bias separability,\nand measure it from N-body simulations. We find significant departures from\nseparability on quasi-linear scales ($\\sim$ 1-5 Mpc) at high redshifts ($z \\geq\n3$), leading to enhancements in halo cross-correlations by up to a factor of 2\n-- or even higher. In contrast, deviations at low redshifts remain modest.\nAdditionally, using high-redshift ($z \\sim 3.6$) galaxy samples, we detect\ndeviations from bias separability that closely align with simulation\npredictions. The breakdown of the separable bias approximation on quasi-linear\nscales at high redshifts underscore the importance to account for\nnon-separability in models of the galaxy-halo connection in this regime.\nFurthermore, these results highlight the potential of high-redshift galaxy\ncross-correlations as a probe for improving the galaxy-halo connection from\nupcoming large-scale surveys.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental question in modern machine learning is why large,\nover-parameterized models, such as deep neural networks and transformers, tend\nto generalize well, even when their number of parameters far exceeds the number\nof training samples.\n  We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of information theory,\ngrounded in universal learning theory. Specifically, we study a Bayesian\nmixture learner with log-loss and (almost) uniform prior over an expansive\nhypothesis class.\n  Our key result shows that the learner's regret is not determined by the\noverall size of the hypothesis class, but rather by the cumulative probability\nof all models that are close, in Kullback-Leibler divergence distance, to the\ntrue data-generating process. We refer to this cumulative probability as the\nweight of the hypothesis.\n  This leads to a natural notion of model simplicity: simple models are those\nwith large weight and thus require fewer samples to generalize, while complex\nmodels have small weight and need more data. This perspective provides a\nrigorous and intuitive explanation for why over-parameterized models often\navoid overfitting: the presence of simple hypotheses allows the posterior to\nconcentrate on them when supported by the data.\n  We further bridge theory and practice by recalling that stochastic gradient\ndescent with Langevin dynamics samples from the correct posterior distribution,\nenabling our theoretical learner to be approximated using standard machine\nlearning methods combined with ensemble learning.\n  Our analysis yields non-uniform regret bounds and aligns with key practical\nconcepts such as flat minima and model distillation. The results apply broadly\nacross online, batch, and supervised learning settings, offering a unified and\nprincipled understanding of the generalization behavior of modern AI systems.",

    "abstract": "The paper addresses two critical challenges in language model (LM)\nevaluation: creating reliable domain-specific benchmarks and understanding\nknowledge representation during domain adaptation. We introduce a deterministic\npipeline that converts raw domain corpora into completion-type benchmarks\nwithout relying on LMs or human curation, eliminating benchmark contamination\nissues while enabling evaluation on the latest domain data. Our approach\ngenerates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term\nTF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by\nmeasuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct\ndomain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with\nlow computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple\nmodels (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we\ndemonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated\nbenchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than\ntraditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens\nrapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to\ndomain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping.\nBy extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that\ninitial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while\nlater layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during\nadaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction\nhappens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical\nevaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into\nknowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more\nefficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting.",

For each roadmap,\nwe provide a framework containing key design steps as a guiding pipeline and\nseveral representative case studies of FM-empowered SoM system design.\nSpecifically, we propose LLM-based path loss generation (LLM4PG) and scatterer\ngeneration (LLM4SG) schemes, and wireless channel foundation model (WiCo) for\nSoM mechanism exploration, LLM-based wireless multi-task SoM transceiver\n(LLM4WM) and wireless foundation model (WiFo) for SoM-enhanced transceiver\ndesign, and wireless cooperative perception foundation model (WiPo) for\nSoM-enhanced cooperative perception, demonstrating the significant superiority\nof FMs over task-specific models. Finally, we summarize and highlight potential\ndirections for future research.",

Existing deep learning models often struggle to\nachieve the requisite localization accuracy for microscopic targets like\npollen, which are characterized by their minute size, indistinct edges, and\ncomplex backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we introduce HieraEdgeNet, a\nmulti-scale edge-enhancement framework. The framework's core innovation is the\nintroduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),\nwhich explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that\ncorresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic\nEdge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic\ninformation at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel\nModule (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers\nusing an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel\nconvolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally\nefficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset\ncomprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision\n(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline\nmodels such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms\nthat our approach generates feature representations that are more precisely\nfocused on object boundaries.

Current methods often miss fine-grained errors, being designed for\nshorter texts or lacking datasets with verified inaccuracies. We introduce\nDOCCI-Critique, a benchmark with 1,400 VLM-generated paragraph captions (100\nimages, 14 VLMs) featuring over 10,216 sentence-level human annotations of\nfactual correctness and explanatory rationales for errors, all within paragraph\ncontext. Building on this, we develop VNLI-Critique, a model for automated\nsentence-level factuality classification and critique generation. We highlight\nthree key applications: (1) VNLI-Critique demonstrates robust generalization,\nvalidated by state-of-the-art performance on the M-HalDetect benchmark and\nstrong results in CHOCOLATE claim verification. (2) The VNLI-Critique driven\nAutoRater for DOCCI-Critique provides reliable VLM rankings, showing excellent\nalignment with human factuality judgments (e.g., 0.98 Spearman). (3) An\ninnovative Critic-and-Revise pipeline, where critiques from VNLI-Critique guide\nLLM-based corrections, achieves substantial improvements in caption factuality\n(e.g., a 46% gain on DetailCaps-4870). Our work offers a crucial benchmark\nalongside practical tools, designed to significantly elevate the standards for\nfine-grained evaluation and foster the improvement of VLM image understanding.\nProject page: https://google.github.io/unblocking-detail-caption",

    "abstract": "To investigate the physical origin of red giants (RGs) and red supergiants\n(RSGs), we construct steady-state models of stellar envelopes by explicitly\nsolving the stellar structure equations, with boundary conditions set at the\nstellar surface and the hydrogen burning shell. For comparison, we consider\nboth polytropic and realistic models. Polytropic models adopt a polytropic\nequation of state (EOS) and neglect energy transport, while realistic models\nincorporate radiative and convective energy transport, along with tabulated EOS\nand opacities. Our steady-state solutions reproduce three key features relevant\nto the evolution toward the RG/RSG phase. First, the refined mirror principle\nof \\cite{Ou2024} is reproduced: the stellar radius varies inversely with the\nradius of the envelope's inner boundary, defined by the burning shell's\nsurface. This feature arises purely from hydrostatic equilibrium, as it appears\nin both polytropic and realistic models. Second, realistic models reveal an\nupper limit to envelope expansion, corresponding to an effective temperature of\n$\\sim4,000\\,{\\rm K}$, which is characteristic of RG/RSG stars and consistent\nwith the classical Hayashi limit. Approaching this limit, the envelope\nundergoes a structural transition marked by a significant change in the density\nprofile and the formation of an extended convective zone. The location of this\nlimit is governed by the sharp drop in H$^{-}$ opacity as the envelope cools\nbelow $\\sim10,000\\,{\\rm K}$. Finally, our solutions show that even a small\nshift in the envelope's inner boundary can induce substantial envelope\nexpansion throughout the yellow regime, naturally explaining the bifurcation of\ngiants and supergiants into red and blue branches.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have\nsubstantially extended the boundaries of visual understanding capabilities.\nHowever, their high computational demands hinder deployment on\nresource-constrained edge devices. A key source of inefficiency stems from the\nVLM's need to process dense and redundant visual information. Visual inputs\ncontain significant regions irrelevant to text semantics, rendering the\nassociated computations ineffective for inference. This paper introduces a\nnovel Event-Priori-Based Vision-Language Model, termed EP-VLM. Its core\ncontribution is a novel mechanism leveraging motion priors derived from dynamic\nevent vision to enhance VLM efficiency. Inspired by human visual cognition,\nEP-VLM first employs event data to guide the patch-wise sparsification of RGB\nvisual inputs, progressively concentrating VLM computation on salient regions\nof the visual input. Subsequently, we construct a position-preserving\ntokenization strategy for the visual encoder within the VLM architecture. This\nstrategy processes the event-guided, unstructured, sparse visual input while\naccurately preserving positional understanding within the visual input.\nExperimental results demonstrate that EP-VLM achieves significant efficiency\nimprovements while maintaining nearly lossless accuracy compared to baseline\nmodels from the Qwen2-VL series. For instance, against the original\nQwen2-VL-2B, EP-VLM achieves 50% FLOPs savings while retaining 98% of the\noriginal accuracy on the RealWorldQA dataset. This work demonstrates the\npotential of event-based vision priors for improving VLM inference efficiency,\npaving the way for creating more efficient and deployable VLMs for sustainable\nvisual understanding at the edge.",

Despite their\nsuccess, MPNNs are limited in their ability to capture long-range dependencies\nbetween nodes. This has led researchers to adapt MPNNs through rewiring or make\nuse of Graph Transformers, which compromises the computational efficiency that\ncharacterized early spatial message-passing architectures, and typically\ndisregards the graph structure. Almost a decade after its original\nintroduction, we revisit ChebNet to shed light on its ability to model distant\nnode interactions. We find that out-of-box, ChebNet already shows competitive\nadvantages relative to classical MPNNs and GTs on long-range benchmarks, while\nmaintaining good scalability properties for high-order polynomials. However, we\nuncover that this polynomial expansion leads ChebNet to an unstable regime\nduring training. To address this limitation, we cast ChebNet as a stable and\nnon-dissipative dynamical system, which we coin Stable-ChebNet. Our\nStable-ChebNet model allows for stable information propagation, and has\ncontrollable dynamics which do not require the use of eigendecompositions,\npositional encodings, or graph rewiring.

We created\na parallel corpus of 9852 dialect-to-standard Ukrainian sentence pairs and a\ndictionary of 7320 dialectal word mappings. We also addressed data shortage by\nproposing an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to generate\nsynthetic parallel translation pairs, expanding the corpus with 52142 examples.\nWe have fine-tuned multiple open-source LLMs using LoRA and evaluated them on a\nstandard-to-dialect translation task, also comparing with few-shot GPT-4o\ntranslation. In the absence of human annotators, we adopt a multi-metric\nevaluation strategy combining BLEU, chrF++, TER, and LLM-based judgment\n(GPT-4o). The results show that even small(7B) finetuned models outperform\nzero-shot baselines such as GPT-4o across both automatic and LLM-evaluated\nmetrics.

However, these methods face\nmultiple limitations, including high computational costs, low operational\nefficiency, and limited integration with observational data. With the rapid\nadvancement of artificial intelligence, there is an urgent need to develop a\nlow-cost, efficient air quality forecasting model for smart urban management.\nAn air quality forecasting model, named FuXi-Air, has been constructed in this\nstudy based on multimodal data fusion to support high-precision air quality\nforecasting and operated in typical megacities. The model integrates\nmeteorological forecasts, emission inventories, and pollutant monitoring data\nunder the guidance of air pollution mechanism. By combining an autoregressive\nprediction framework with a frame interpolation strategy, the model\nsuccessfully completes 72-hour forecasts for six major air pollutants at an\nhourly resolution across multiple monitoring sites within 25-30 seconds. In\nterms of both computational efficiency and forecasting accuracy, it outperforms\nthe mainstream numerical air quality models in operational forecasting work.\nAblation experiments concerning key influencing factors show that although\nmeteorological data contribute more to model accuracy than emission inventories\ndo, the integration of multimodal data significantly improves forecasting\nprecision and ensures that reliable predictions are obtained under differing\npollution mechanisms across megacities. This study provides both a technical\nreference and a practical example for applying multimodal data-driven models to\nair quality forecasting and offers new insights into building hybrid\nforecasting systems to support air pollution risk warning in smart city\nmanagement.",

However, it faces two key challenges:\n(\\emph{\\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and\ndifficult to align with users' intentions; (\\emph{\\textcolor{magenta}{ii}})\ncurrent DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision\nand point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce\nhigh-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new\nperspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of\nuser-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly\nspecify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity\nissue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed\n\\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region\nOptimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward\nSelf-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while\nfurther enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure\ninformation and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate\n\\textcolor{SkyBlue}{\\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform\nexisting approaches.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a bivariate mean $M$ near the\nfirst bisector by establishing, in several significant cases, an important\nexpansion of $M$ derived from the Taylor expansion of a single-variable\nfunction. These expansions are made explicit for a number of classical means.\nThis motivates the introduction of the concept of the characteristic function\n$Q_M$ of a mean $M$, defined as the second partial derivative of $M$ with\nrespect to its first variable, evaluated along the diagonal. The function $Q_M$\nmeasures the proximity of $M$ to the arithmetic mean near the first bisector\nand provides a univariate analytic framework for comparing and classifying\nmeans. We prove that inequalities between characteristic functions yield local\ninequalities between the corresponding means, and that in the case of\nhomogeneous means, such inequalities hold globally.\n  We also examine several important classes of means, both classical and novel,\nincluding: normal means, additive means, integral means of the first kind,\nintegral means of the second kind, weighted integral means of the first kind,\nand weighted integral means of the second kind. For each class, we determine\nthe specific form taken by the characteristic functions $Q_M$ of the means $M$\nit contains, and we then study the injectivity and the surjectivity of the\nmapping $M \\mapsto Q_M$ within the class. We also use characteristic functions\nto investigate intersections between certain classes of means, highlighting one\nof the key strengths of this concept. Finally, we introduce and study, for a\ngiven mean $M$, the class of $M$-means, and show, in particular, that the\narithmetic-geometric mean $\\mathrm{AGM}$ is an $M$-mean for a specific weighted\nintegral mean of the first kind $M$.",

However, in many cases, this\nguarantee can be much worse than $\\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$ as obtained by a\ndelayed version of online gradient descent, where $d_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the\ntotal delay. We bridge this gap by proposing a variant of\nfollow-the-regularized-leader that obtains regret of order\n$\\min\\{\\sigma_{\\max}\\ln T, \\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\}$, where $\\sigma_{\\max}$ is\nthe maximum number of missing observations.

However, several sources deviate from this\nparadigm, showing FRII morphologies and radiatively inefficient accretion.\nThree hypotheses have been proposed to explain the observations: (1) The\nevolutionary scenario: initially strong accretor FRIIs switch to having a hot\ninefficient flow due to the depletion of available material. (2) The\nenvironment scenario: radio structures are mainly shaped by the environment.\\\n(3) The engine scenario: both radiatively efficient (FRII-HERGs) and\ninefficient flows (FRII-LERGs) can expel jets powerful enough to maintain\ncollimation up to kiloparsec distances from the nucleus. We explored these\nscenarios by studying the jet properties of 3CR radio galaxies using very long\nbaseline interferometry data from the Fundamental Radio Catalog to investigate\nthe distinction between FRII-LERGs and FRII-HERGs. In particular, we analyzed\nthe 8 GHz luminosity ($L_{8GHz}$) distribution across different optical-radio\nclasses at milliarcsecond scales. Our results favor the engine scenario.

When applied in wireless networks, two issues\nconsistently affect the performance of FL, i.e., data heterogeneity of devices\nand limited bandwidth. Many papers have investigated device scheduling\nstrategies considering the two issues. However, most of them recognize data\nheterogeneity as a property of individual devices. In this paper, we prove that\nthe convergence speed of FL is affected by the sum of device-level and\nsample-level collective gradient divergence (CGD). The device-level CGD refers\nto the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of\nthe individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper\nbounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total\nnumber of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the\ndevice-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it\ninto the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution\nand the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the\nsum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within\npolynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases\nclassification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\\% while scheduling\n41.8\\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing\nsampling variance.",

In an attempt to address these\nchallenges, we introduce Uncertainty-o: (1) a model-agnostic framework designed\nto reveal uncertainty in LMMs regardless of their modalities, architectures, or\ncapabilities, (2) an empirical exploration of multimodal prompt perturbations\nto uncover LMM uncertainty, offering insights and findings, and (3) derive the\nformulation of multimodal semantic uncertainty, which enables quantifying\nuncertainty from multimodal responses. Experiments across 18 benchmarks\nspanning various modalities and 10 LMMs (both open- and closed-source)\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Uncertainty-o in reliably estimating LMM\nuncertainty, thereby enhancing downstream tasks such as hallucination\ndetection, hallucination mitigation, and uncertainty-aware Chain-of-Thought\nreasoning.",

First, we\nshow that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put\notherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ that finds an\n$\\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\\Pi$ in $T$\ncommunication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL\nalgorithm $\\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\\alpha$-approximation of $\\Pi$ in $T$\nrounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs,\nincluding the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the\nabove result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem\n(LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical\ndeterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to\nfinitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries\nof our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are\nincomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL\nproblem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and\nour work provides a separation in the opposite direction.",

Herein, we report direct hysteresis measurements of\npyrocurrent ($I_{\\rm p}$) and ECE-induced temperature change versus bias\nvoltage in 1-$\\mu$m-thick Pb(Zr$_{0.65}$Ti$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ capacitors.

This non-switchable polarization can be converted\ninto switchable polarization via poling with bipolar triangular pulses,\nconfirming the governing role of defect-induced domain pinning. After 100\npulses, time-dependent aging was observed for pyroelectric and electrocaloric\nresponses, with the switchable contribution markedly decaying and the\nnon-switchable component remaining nearly constant, indicating partial\nrepinning. The change in voltage-axis shift agrees well with the ratio of\nnon-switchable to switchable polarization, demonstrating that voltage shift\nalso arises from pinned domains.

To address this challenge, we introduce SIFLip, a\nspeaker-invariant visual feature learning framework that disentangles\nspeaker-specific attributes using two complementary disentanglement modules\n(Implicit Disentanglement and Explicit Disentanglement) to improve\ngeneralization. Specifically, since different speakers exhibit semantic\nconsistency between lip movements and phonetic text when pronouncing the same\nwords, our implicit disentanglement module leverages stable text embeddings as\nsupervisory signals to learn common visual representations across speakers,\nimplicitly decoupling speaker-specific features. Additionally, we design a\nspeaker recognition sub-task within the main lipreading pipeline to filter\nspeaker-specific features, then further explicitly disentangle these\npersonalized visual features from the backbone network via gradient reversal.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SIFLip significantly enhances\ngeneralization performance across multiple public datasets.

Using the pathology foundation model Gigapath's Tile Encoder,\nCCPL extracts dual-channel features from both the generated and real images and\nmeasures cross-channel correlations between nuclei and membranes. The features\nof the generated and real stained images, obtained through the Tile Encoder,\nare also used to calculate feature distillation loss, enhancing the model's\nfeature extraction capabilities without increasing the inference burden.\nAdditionally, CCPL performs statistical analysis on the focal optical density\nmaps of both single channels to ensure consistency in staining distribution and\nintensity. Experimental results, based on quantitative metrics such as PSNR,\nSSIM, PCC, and FID, along with professional evaluations from pathologists,\ndemonstrate that CCPL effectively preserves pathological features, generates\nhigh-quality virtual stained images, and provides robust support for automated\npathological diagnosis using multimedia medical data.",

However, existing DP image synthesis methods\nstruggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the\nstructure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,\nreferred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can\ngenerate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift\nthe challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by\nleveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes\neach private image into a concise textual description using image to text\nmodels, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP\ntext, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI\nrequires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a\nprivate dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality\nthan prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less\nthan or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private\nEvolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less\nthan or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine\ntuning baselines. Overall, our results demonstrate that Synthesis via Private\nTextual Intermediaries provides a resource efficient and proprietary model\ncompatible framework for generating high resolution DP synthetic images,\ngreatly expanding access to private visual datasets.",

    "abstract": "Deriving formulations for computing and estimating tight worst-case size\nincreases for conjunctive queries with various constraints has been at the core\nof theoretical database research. If the problem has no constraints or only one\nconstraint, such as functional dependencies or degree constraints, tight\nworst-case size bounds have been proven, and they are even practically\ncomputable. If the problem has more than one constraint, computing tight bounds\ncan be difficult in practice and may even require an infinite number of linear\ninequalities in its optimization formulation. While these challenges have been\naddressed with varying methods, no prior research has employed quantum\ninformation theory to address this problem. In this work, we establish a\nconnection between earlier work on estimating size bounds for conjunctive\nqueries with classical information theory and the field of quantum information\ntheory. We propose replacing the classical Shannon entropy formulation with the\nquantum R\\'enyi entropy. Whereas classical Shannon entropy requires infinitely\nmany inequalities to characterize the optimization space, R\\'enyi entropy\nrequires only one type of inequality, which is non-negativity. Although this is\na promising modification, optimization with respect to the quantum states\ninstead of classical distributions creates a new set of challenges that prevent\nus from finding a practically computable, tight worst-case size bound. In this\nline, we propose a quantum version to derive worst-case size bounds. The\nprevious tight classical worst-case size bound can be viewed as a special limit\nof this quantum bound.

However, most existing methods typically train\nagents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static\ndifficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments\nand often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum\nlearning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL\nthat employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism\ncontinuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training\nperformance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more\nchallenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability\ndue to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this\nchallenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA),\nwhich is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit\nsignals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA\nconstructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual\ncontributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates\nthroughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through\nconstructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic\nrewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under\nnon-stationary conditions.

Our research\nrevealed that the preprint citations exhibit significantly higher inequality\nthan journal citations, consistently among categories. This trend persisted\neven when controlling for age and the mean citation count of the journal\nmatched to each of the preprint categories. We also found that the citation\ninequality in preprints is not solely driven by a few highly cited papers or\nthose with no impact, but rather reflects a broader systemic effect. Whether\nthe preprint is subsequently published in a journal or not does not\nsignificantly affect the citation inequality. Further analyses of the\nstructural factors show that preferential attachment does not significantly\ncontribute to citation inequality in preprints, whereas author prestige plays a\nsubstantial role.

The states are used to compute velocity\ndifferentials at collision, which when combined with crash models, estimates\nseverity of loss in terms of probabilistic injury or property damage,\nhenceforth called fractional collisions. The probabilistic models may also be\nextended to include other uncertainties associated with the simulation,\nfeatures, and agents.

In recent years, most existing studies have focused\nsolely on either jamming recognition or anti-jamming strategy design. In this\npaper, we propose a unified framework that integrates interference recognition\nwith intelligent anti-jamming strategy selection. Specifically, time-frequency\n(TF) features of radar echoes are first extracted using both Short-Time Fourier\nTransform (STFT) and Smoothed Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD). A\nfeature fusion method is then designed to effectively combine these two types\nof time-frequency representations. The fused TF features are further combined\nwith time-domain features of the radar echoes through a cross-modal fusion\nmodule based on an attention mechanism. Finally, the recognition results,\ntogether with information obtained from the passive radar, are fed into a Deep\nQ-Network (DQN)-based intelligent anti-jamming strategy network to select\njamming suppression waveforms. The key jamming parameters obtained by the\npassive radar provide essential information for intelligent decision-making,\nenabling the generation of more effective strategies tailored to specific\njamming types. The proposed method demonstrates improvements in both jamming\ntype recognition accuracy and the stability of anti-jamming strategy selection\nunder complex environments. Experimental results show that our method achieves\nsuperior performance compared to Support Vector Machines (SVM), VGG-16, and\n2D-CNN methods, with respective improvements of 1.41%, 2.5%, and 14.51% in\noverall accuracy. Moreover, in comparison with the SARSA algorithm, the\ndesigned algorithm achieves faster reward convergence and more stable strategy\ngeneration.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive capabilities across\na wide range of robotics manipulation tasks. However, their growing model size\nposes significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic\nsystems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the\ninference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss,\nits application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present\nBitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every\nparameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint\nof the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that\ncompresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process,\na full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent\nrepresentations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA\nachieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with\n4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only\n29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on\nmemory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in\nhttps://github.com/ustcwhy/BitVLA.",

However, despite these successes, RL in its\ncurrent form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the\nlimitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing\nknowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new\ninformation. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nto learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and\nreasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze\nthe training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels\nat maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's\noriginal capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on\nquestions beyond the current scope of the model.

In ReLIFT, the model is primarily\ntrained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality\nsolutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates\nbetween RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT\nachieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five\ncompetition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to\nother zero-RL models.

While powerful, they often suffer\nfrom misinterpretation of user intent, leading to the agent's actions that\ndiverge from the user's intended goal, especially as external toolkits evolve.\nTraditional software testing assumes structured inputs and thus falls short in\nhandling the ambiguity of natural language. We introduce IntenTest, an\nAPI-centric stress testing framework that systematically uncovers intent\nintegrity violations in LLM agents. Unlike prior work focused on fixed\nbenchmarks or adversarial inputs, IntenTest generates realistic tasks based on\ntoolkits' documentation and applies targeted mutations to expose subtle agent\nerrors while preserving user intent. To guide testing, we propose semantic\npartitioning, which organizes natural language tasks into meaningful categories\nbased on toolkit API parameters and their equivalence classes. Within each\npartition, seed tasks are mutated and ranked by a lightweight predictor that\nestimates the likelihood of triggering agent errors. To enhance efficiency,\nIntenTest maintains a datatype-aware strategy memory that retrieves and adapts\neffective mutation patterns from past cases. Experiments on 80 toolkit APIs\ndemonstrate that IntenTest effectively uncovers intent integrity violations,\nsignificantly outperforming baselines in both error-exposing rate and query\nefficiency. Moreover, IntenTest generalizes well to stronger target models\nusing smaller LLMs for test generation, and adapts to evolving APIs across\ndomains.",

Despite growing evidence of this\ninconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high\ncost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small\ndatasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank\n(PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and\nmodels, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature\nimportance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely\ndiffer between correct and incorrect predictions.

To\novercome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more\neffectively captures variation in explanation quality.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for multi-talker automatic speech\nrecognition without the need for auxiliary information. Serialized Output\nTraining (SOT), a widely used approach, suffers from recognition errors due to\nspeaker assignment failures. Although incorporating auxiliary information, such\nas token-level timestamps, can improve recognition accuracy, extracting such\ninformation from natural conversational speech remains challenging. To address\nthis limitation, we propose Speaker-Distinguishable CTC (SD-CTC), an extension\nof CTC that jointly assigns a token and its corresponding speaker label to each\nframe. We further integrate SD-CTC into the SOT framework, enabling the SOT\nmodel to learn speaker distinction using only overlapping speech and\ntranscriptions. Experimental comparisons show that multi-task learning with\nSD-CTC and SOT reduces the error rate of the SOT model by 26% and achieves\nperformance comparable to state-of-the-art methods relying on auxiliary\ninformation.",

The first emulator works on scales $k \\in\n[0.015,1.8]\\,h/ \\rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ in terms of seven cosmological parameters: the\nmatter and baryon fraction of the energy density of the Universe $\\Omega_m$ and\n$\\Omega_b$, the reduced Hubble constant $h$, the scalar spectral index $n_s$,\nthe amplitude of matter density fluctuations $\\sigma_8$, the total neutrino\nmass $M_{\\nu}$ and the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$. The power\nspectra can be directly determined at redshifts 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, while for\nintermediate redshifts these can be interpolated. The second emulator is based\non five cosmological parameters, $\\Omega_m$, $h$, $n_s$, $\\sigma_8$ and the\namplitude of equilateral non-Gaussianity $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm equilateral}$, at\nredshifts 0, 0.503, 0.733, 0.997 for $k \\in [0.015,1.8]\\,h/ \\rm{Mpc^{-1}}$.

In both\nsettings, we establish the regularity of the trajectories near singularities:\nno spiraling occurs, and no two trajectories asymptotically converge to the\nsame direction.\n  Moreover, in the radial case with non-zero spin at the marked interior point,\nwe show that the spin induces a spiraling behavior at the marked interior\npoint.\n  However, this regularity breaks down when multiple interior marked points are\npresent. In such cases, trajectories may asymptotically approach the same\ndirection, and spiraling can occur even in the absence of spin.

We propose a multi-band\nobservation of lensed GWs from a compact binary to observe both geometrical\noptics (GO) and wave optics (WO) effects from the same source. This method is\nexpected to be advantageous in breaking parameter degeneracies between a GW\nsource and a dark matter halo acting as a lens. We assume DECIGO or B-DECIGO as\na space-based detector observing the early inspiral phase, and the ET as a\nground-based detector observing the merger phase. We perform a Fisher analysis\nof multi-band detection for a source with masses $m_1 = 30 M_{\\odot}, m_2 = 20\nM_{\\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.5$, and a lens with mass $3 \\times 10^{3}\nM_{\\odot}$ at redshift $z = 1.0$. With this setup, the GO effect appears in the\nET frequency band, and the WO effect in that of DECIGO. For the halo density\nprofile, we adopt Singular Isothermal Sphere, Cored Isothermal Sphere (CIS),\nand Navarro-Frenk-White models. We find that multi-band observation resolves\nparameter degeneracies and significantly reduces errors in estimated\nparameters. For the CIS model, in particular, we show that, by combining ET and\nDECIGO observations, the lens mass error improves by about 71 $\\%$ and 58 $\\%$\ncompared to ET and DECIGO alone, respectively. Similarly, the impact parameter\nerror is reduced by about 65 $\\%$ and 70 $\\%$, and the core size error by 34\n$\\%$ and 68 $\\%$, respectively. From these results, we conclude that the\nmulti-band observation of GWs from compact binaries improves the estimation of\nthe lens object properties by breaking the parameter degeneracy.",

    "abstract": "Modern neural networks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on numerous\nexisting benchmarks; however, their high computational requirements and energy\nconsumption prompt researchers to seek more efficient solutions for real-world\ndeployment. Logic gate networks (LGNs) learns a large network of logic gates\nfor efficient image classification. However, learning a network that can solve\na simple problem like CIFAR-10 can take days to weeks to train. Even then,\nalmost half of the network remains unused, causing a discretization gap. This\ndiscretization gap hinders real-world deployment of LGNs, as the performance\ndrop between training and inference negatively impacts accuracy. We inject\nGumbel noise with a straight-through estimator during training to significantly\nspeed up training, improve neuron utilization, and decrease the discretization\ngap. We theoretically show that this results from implicit Hessian\nregularization, which improves the convergence properties of LGNs. We train\nnetworks $4.5 \\times$ faster in wall-clock time, reduce the discretization gap\nby $98\\%$, and reduce the number of unused gates by $100\\%$.",

Nearly 50% of solar-type wide binaries with\nseparations >1000 au are actually higher-order multiples with one component\nbeing a close binary. Additionally, the higher-order multiplicity fraction\nappears to be correlated with the physical separation of the widest component.\nThese facts have motivated some of our current theories behind how the widest\nstellar systems formed, which can have separations on the order of or larger\nthan protostellar cores. However, it is unclear if the correlation between wide\nbinary separation and higher-order multiplicity extends to low-mass binaries.\nWe present initial results of an ongoing speckle imaging survey of nearby\nlow-mass wide binaries. We find an overall higher-order multiplicity fraction\nfor our sample of $42.0\\% \\pm 10.9\\%$. If we include systems where Gaia\nindicates that a companion is likely present, this fraction increases to\n$62.0\\% \\pm 14.2\\%$. This is consistent with previous results from both\nhigher-mass stars and a previous result for low-mass wide binaries. However, we\ndo not detect the expected increase in higher-order multiplicity fraction with\nseparation, as was seen with previous studies. We briefly explore why\nhigher-order multiplicity statistics could be different in low-mass stars, and\nwhat the significance might be for models of wide binary formation.",

This shows that the wave spectra\nand their dominant periods evolve between these two layers. We present\nobservational results that demonstrate variations of the dominant period with\nheights in the photosphere and chromosphere. Six photospheric absorption lines\nand one chromospheric line are analyzed by using the IRIS data, and the Doppler\nvelocity time series at seven different atmospheric heights are determined. The\nwavelet analysis is applied to these time series, and the resulting spectrum of\nwave periods and its dominant period are deduced at these heights, which gives\nheight variations of the dominant period. The obtained data shows that the\ndominant period decreases with height, and that there are also changes in the\nrange of wave periods within the spectrum.

As RLHF relies on a challenging training sequence, whereby a\nseparate reward model is independently learned and then later applied to LLM\npolicy updates, ongoing research effort has targeted more straightforward\nalternatives. In this regard, direct preference optimization (DPO) and its many\noffshoots circumvent the need for a separate reward training step. Instead,\nthrough the judicious use of a reparameterization trick that induces an\n\\textit{implicit} reward, DPO and related methods consolidate learning to the\nminimization of a single loss function. And yet despite demonstrable success in\nsome real-world settings, we prove that DPO-based objectives are nonetheless\nsubject to sub-optimal regularization and counter-intuitive interpolation\nbehaviors, underappreciated artifacts of the reparameterizations upon which\nthey are based. To this end, we introduce an \\textit{explicit} preference\noptimization framework termed EXPO that requires no analogous\nreparameterization to achieve an implicit reward. Quite differently, we merely\nposit intuitively-appealing regularization factors from scratch that\ntransparently avoid the potential pitfalls of key DPO variants, provably\nsatisfying regularization desiderata that prior methods do not.

    "abstract": "Automated test-generation research overwhelmingly assumes the correctness of\nfocal methods, yet practitioners routinely face non-regression scenarios where\nthe focal method may be defective. A baseline evaluation of EvoSuite and two\nleading Large Language Model (LLM)-based generators, namely ChatTester and\nChatUniTest, on defective focal methods reveals that despite achieving up to\n83% of branch coverage, none of the generated tests expose defects.\n  To resolve this problem, we first construct two new benchmarks, namely\nDefects4J-Desc and QuixBugs-Desc, for experiments. In particular, each focal\nmethod is equipped with an extra Natural Language Description (NLD) for code\nfunctionality understanding.\n  Subsequently, we propose DISTINCT, a Description-guided, branch-consistency\nanalysis framework that transforms LLMs into fault-aware test generators.\nDISTINCT carries three iterative components: (1) a Generator that derives\ninitial tests based on the NLDs and the focal method, (2) a Validator that\niteratively fixes uncompilable tests using compiler diagnostics, and (3) an\nAnalyzer that iteratively aligns test behavior with NLD semantics via\nbranch-level analysis.\n  Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods, DISTINCT achieves an average improvement of 14.64% in\nCompilation Success Rate (CSR) and 6.66% in Passing Rate (PR) across both\nbenchmarks. It notably enhances Defect Detection Rate (DDR) on both benchmarks,\nwith a particularly significant gain of 149.26% observed on Defects4J-Desc. In\nterms of code coverage, DISTINCT improves Statement Coverage (SC) by an average\nof 3.77% and Branch Coverage (BC) by 5.36%. These results set a new baseline\nfor non-regressive test generation and highlight how description-driven\nreasoning enables LLMs to move beyond coverage chasing toward effective defect\ndetection.",

The results\nshowed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped\nwith the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct\nsaccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked\napproximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms.

Specifically, we\npropose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous\ntext-video pairs. Initially, ARL detects ambiguous pairs based on two criteria:\nuncertainty and similarity. Uncertainty represents whether instances include\ncommonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates\npair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL\nhierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive\nlearning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained\nrelationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the\ntext-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the\ninherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often\ncontains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the\ntext-frame level. Lastly, we propose cross-model ambiguity detection to\nmitigate the error propagation that occurs when a single model is employed to\ndetect ambiguous pairs for its training.

We consider when\na valid prediction interval for the ITE is informative and when it can be\nbounded away from zero. The joint distribution over potential outcomes is only\npartially identified from a randomized trial. Consequently, to be valid, an ITE\nprediction interval must be valid for all joint distribution consistent with\nthe observed data and hence will in general be wider than that resulting from\nknowledge of this joint distribution. We characterize prediction intervals in\nthe binary treatment and outcome setting, and extend these insights to models\nwith continuous and ordinal outcomes. We derive sharp bounds on the probability\nmass function (pmf) of the individual treatment effect (ITE). Finally, we\ncontrast prediction intervals for the ITE and confidence intervals for the\naverage treatment effect (ATE). This also leads to the consideration of Fisher\nversus Neyman null hypotheses. While confidence intervals for the ATE shrink\nwith increasing sample size due to its status as a population parameter,\nprediction intervals for the ITE generally do not vanish, leading to scenarios\nwhere one may reject the Neyman null yet still find evidence consistent with\nthe Fisher null, highlighting the challenges of individualized decision-making\nunder partial identification.",

This sequential approach creates\na mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders\nperpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose\nSelf-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an\nattacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast\nsafety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates\nbetween attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and\nsafeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This\nenables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of\nzero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the\ndesign of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the\ndefender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.\nEmpirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared\nto attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on\nsafety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained\nagainst static attackers.

This study aims to propose a fuzzy\npermutation time irreversibility (fpTIR) by measuring the difference between\nvector elements based on a negative exponential function. The amplitude\npermutation of vector is constructed and its membership degree is calculated;\nthen, the difference in probability distribution between the forward and\nbackward sequences is measured for fpTIR. To compare and measure the system's\ncomplexity, the Shannon entropy is calculated as the average amount of\ninformation in the fuzzy permutation probability distribution, i.e., fuzzy\npermutation entropy (fPEn). According to the surrogate theory, mode series are\ngenerated using logistic, Henon, and first-order autoregressive systems to\nverify the fpTIR, which is then used to analyze the heartbeats of patients with\ncongestive heart failure and healthy elderly and young participants from the\nPhysioNet database. Results suggest that the fpTIR effectively measures the\nsystem's nonequilibrium characteristics, thus improving the accuracy of\nheartbeat analysis. However, in analyzing probability distributions, the fpTIR\nand fPEn exhibit discrepancies in the chaotic series and even opposite results\nin the heartbeats, wherein the results of fpTIR are consistent with the theory\nof complexity loss in aging and disease. Overall, the fpTIR accurately\ncharacterizes the structure of the sequences and enhances the accuracy of the\nnonequilibrium analysis of complex systems, providing a theoretical basis for\nexploring complex systems from the perspectives of nonequilibrium dynamics and\nentropy complexity.",

We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks,\nand find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success\nrate (ASR) for nearly all models.

    "abstract": "Heating mechanism in the solar atmosphere (from chromosphere to corona) is\none of the top-challenges in modern astronomy. The classic mechanisms can be\ndivided into two categories: wave heating (W) and magnetic reconnection heating\n(X). Both of them still face some problems currently difficult to overcome.\nRecently, we proposed a new mechanism, called magnetic-gradient pumping heating\n(MGP, or P) which seems to overcome those difficulties, but still lacks\nsufficient observational evidence. Which one really explained the physics of\nhot corona exactly? How can observations be used to identify and verify the\nheating mechanism? Since different heating mechanism will generate non-thermal\nparticles from different accelerations and experience different propagations,\nthey will have different response on the broadband spectral radio observations.\nAmong them, the non-thermal electrons from W mechanisms are closely related to\nshock-wave acceleration, and their radio response should be group of spike\nbursts with random distribution of drifting rates; the non-thermal electrons\nfrom X mechanisms are accelerated by reconnecting electric field with\nbidirectional flow, and their radio response should be type III pairs or spike\npairs; P mechanism will produce energetic particle upflows, and their radio\nresponse should be unidirectional fiber bursts with moderate negative drifting\nrates. Therefore, the heating mechanism can be identified and verified from the\nthe broadband dynamic spectral radio observations. Additionally, using\nhigh-resolution radioheliographs and spectral-imaging observations, the heating\nmechanisms in different regions can be identified and verified separately,\nthereby demonstrating the physical essence of hot corona.",

Recently, we developed the Imager of MPPC-based Optical photoN\ncounter from Yamagata (IMONY), an observation system utilizing a Geiger-mode\navalanche photodiode (GAPD) as a sensor. The sensor consists of 64 pixels, each\ncomprising a GAPD and a quenching resistor, with pixel sizes of 75, 100, 150,\nand 200\\,$\\mu$m. Each pixel signal is read out independently, enabling\nsingle-photon detection.

The new system incorporates an analog application-specific\nintegrated circuit (ASIC) developed at KEK for multi-purpose fast readout for\nsilicon photomultipliers. This ASIC features a fast transimpedance amplifier\nand a comparator, independently processing 16 channels. A Global Navigation\nSatellite System receiver and a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) provide\ntimestamps for each detected photon with a resolution of 100 ns.

We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated\ndensity matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the\ntranscorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and\ndemonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the\ntwo-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical\ninventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated\nHamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the\nentanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS\nrepresentation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller\ncorrelator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated\nmethod. We examine systems of size up to $12 \\times 12$ lattice sites, four\ntimes larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that\ntranscorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard\nnon-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated\nDMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\\times$-$17 \\times$,\nwith the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the\nlargest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.",

Unlike traditional computer vision models that rely on\ndomain-specific training and extensive datasets, modern LLMs can interpret and\ndescribe complex visual scenes using simple natural language prompts. However,\ndespite growing interest in their applications, there has been limited\ninvestigation into how different LLMs perform in safety-critical visual tasks\nwithin the construction domain. To address this gap, this study conducts a\ncomparative evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude-3 Opus, GPT-4.5,\nGPT-4o, GPT-o3, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, to assess their ability to identify\npotential hazards from real-world construction images. Each model was tested\nunder three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought\n(CoT). Zero-shot prompting involved minimal instruction, few-shot incorporated\nbasic safety context and a hazard source mnemonic, and CoT provided\nstep-by-step reasoning examples to scaffold model thinking. Quantitative\nanalysis was performed using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics across all\nconditions. Results reveal that prompting strategy significantly influenced\nperformance, with CoT prompting consistently producing higher accuracy across\nmodels. Additionally, LLM performance varied under different conditions, with\nGPT-4.5 and GPT-o3 outperforming others in most settings. The findings also\ndemonstrate the critical role of prompt design in enhancing the accuracy and\nconsistency of multimodal LLMs for construction safety applications. This study\noffers actionable insights into the integration of prompt engineering and LLMs\nfor practical hazard recognition, contributing to the development of more\nreliable AI-assisted safety systems.",

We find evidence for reduced thermal gas\npressure in dark matter halos with masses $M < 10^{14} \\, M_{\\odot}/h$,\nsupporting predictions of enhanced feedback from active galactic nuclei on gas\nthermodynamics. A comparison of the inferred matter power suppression reveals a\n$2-4\\sigma$ tension with hydrodynamical simulations that implement mild\nbaryonic feedback, as our constraints prefer a stronger suppression.

Relying on manual delineation introduces\nsignificant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models\nare designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt\nto ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly\nevident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image\nsegmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address\nthese challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent\nviewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were\ndesigned to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve\nthe fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized\nresidual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and\nenhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information\nand local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different\noptimizers to achieve the optimal solution.

Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant\ndifferences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly\nshare common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.\nTherefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining\nshared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise\nheterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa.

We model the cumulative galaxy number\nprofile of clusters, testing different halo density models and considering the\nimpact of cluster properties, such as center definitions, magnitude limits,\ngalaxy colors, and field contamination, on the estimation of splashback\nfeatures. Our results show that observed splashback radii, measured in\nprojection (2D), are consistently smaller than predicted by dark matter\nsimulations, with $R_\\text{sp}/R_{200m} \\approx 1$, supporting previous\ndiscrepancies in the literature.

    "abstract": "We report detection and analysis of the largest low-frequency (200 - 231.25\nMHz) sample of Crab giant pulses (GPs) reported in the literature. In total\nabout 95000 GPs were detected. The observations were performed in 2024/2025\nwith the EDA2, a prototype station of the SKA-Low telescope. The fluence\ndistribution of GPs in the entire sample is very well characterised with a\nsingle power law (no flattening at higher fluences) N(F) $\\propto$ F$^\\alpha$,\nwhere $\\alpha = -3.17\\pm0.02$ for all GPs, and $\\alpha_{MP} = -3.13\\pm0.02$ and\n$\\alpha_{IP} = -3.59\\pm0.06$ for GPs at the phases of the main pulse and\ninterpulse respectively. The index of the power law fluence distribution\nremained approximately constant over the observing period, but the\nnormalisation of the distribution was strongly correlated with the scatter\nbroadening time ($\\tau$). As a result, the measured fluence distribution\nincreased for lower ($\\tau \\approx$ 2 ms) and decreased for higher ($\\tau\n\\approx$ 5 ms) scatter broadening time $\\tau$ causing the GP rate to vary\nbetween 3000 and 100 per hour respectively. The timescale of variations (weeks)\nindicates refractive scintillation as the root cause. We also observe a strong\npositive correlation between the scatter broadening time and dispersion\nmeasure. Our modelling favours the screen of the size $\\sim10^{-5}$ pc and mean\nelectron density $\\sim 400$e$^{-}$cm$^{-3}$ located within 100 pc from the\npulsar. The frequency scaling of the scattering broadening time ($\\tau \\propto\n\\nu^{\\beta}$) with $\\beta \\approx -3.6\\pm0.1$ is in agreement with earlier\nmeasurements. Our results agree with the current views that GPs from\nextra-galactic Crab-like pulsars can be responsible for very weak repeating\nFRBs, but cannot explain the entire FRB population. Finally, these results\ndemonstrate an enormous scientific potential of individual SKA-Low stations.",

With the tremendous progress in deep\nlearning and communication technologies, cooperative perception with\nVehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technologies has emerged as a solution to overcome\nthe limitations of single-agent perception systems in perceiving distant\nobjects and occlusions. Despite the considerable advancements, V2X cooperative\nperception systems require thorough testing and continuous enhancement of\nsystem performance. Given that V2X driving scenes entail intricate\ncommunications with multiple vehicles across various geographic locations,\ncreating V2X test scenes for these systems poses a significant challenge.\nMoreover, current testing methodologies rely on manual data collection and\nlabeling, which are both time-consuming and costly.\n  In this paper, we design and implement V2XGen, an automated testing\ngeneration tool for V2X cooperative perception systems. V2XGen utilizes a\nhigh-fidelity approach to generate realistic cooperative object instances and\nstrategically place them within the background data in crucial positions.\nFurthermore, V2XGen adopts a fitness-guided V2X scene generation strategy for\nthe transformed scene generation process and improves testing efficiency.

Current OOD detection paradigms primarily focus on\nstatic graphs and confront two critical challenges: i) high bias and high\nvariance caused by single-point estimation, which makes the predictions\nsensitive to randomness in the data; ii) score homogenization resulting from\nthe lack of OOD training data, where the model only learns ID-specific\npatterns, resulting in overall low OOD scores and a narrow score gap between ID\nand OOD data. To tackle these issues, we first investigate OOD detection in\ndynamic graphs through the lens of Evidential Deep Learning (EDL).\nSpecifically, we propose EviSEC, an innovative and effective OOD detector via\nEvidential Spectrum-awarE Contrastive Learning. We design an evidential neural\nnetwork to redefine the output as the posterior Dirichlet distribution,\nexplaining the randomness of inputs through the uncertainty of distribution,\nwhich is overlooked by single-point estimation. Moreover, spectrum-aware\naugmentation module generates OOD approximations to identify patterns with high\nOOD scores, thereby widening the score gap between ID and OOD data and\nmitigating score homogenization.

The\ninnovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment\nmodeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration\nefficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same\ntime, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with\nreinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve\ncontinuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting.\nExperimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared\nwith the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system\nrecovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios.",

We hope our work can advance\nmore rigorous AI evaluation practices that can better serve both the research\ncommunity and policymakers.

    "abstract": "Smooth minimax optimization problems play a central role in a wide range of\napplications, including machine learning, game theory, and operations research.\nHowever, existing algorithmic frameworks vary significantly depending on the\nproblem structure -- whether it is convex-concave, nonconvex-concave,\nconvex-nonconcave, or even nonconvex-nonconcave with additional regularity\nconditions. In particular, this diversity complicates the tuning of step-sizes\nsince even verifying convexity (or concavity) assumptions is challenging and\nproblem-dependent. We introduce a universal and single-loop algorithm, Doubly\nSmoothed Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent (DS-OGDA), that applies to a broad\nclass of smooth minimax problems. Specifically, this class includes\nconvex-concave, nonconvex-concave, convex-nonconcave, and nonconvex-nonconcave\nminimax optimization problems satisfying a one-sided Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL)\nproperty. DS-OGDA works with a universal single set of parameters for all\nproblems in this class, eliminating the need for prior structural knowledge to\ndetermine step-sizes. Moreover, when a particular problem structure in our\nclass is specified, DS-OGDA achieves optimal or best-known performance\nguarantees. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive and versatile\nframework for smooth minimax optimization, bridging the gap between convex and\nnonconvex problem structures and simplifying the choice of algorithmic\nstrategies across diverse applications.",

Traditional defense approaches,\nwhich rely on fixed configurations or centralized decision-making, cannot\neffectively respond to the rapidly changing conditions in UAV swarm\nenvironments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel federated\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning (FMADRL)-driven moving target defense\n(MTD) framework for proactive DoS mitigation in low-altitude networks.\nSpecifically, we design lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including\nleader switching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, to disrupt attacker\nefforts and enhance network resilience. The defense problem is formulated as a\nmulti-agent partially observable Markov decision process, capturing the\nuncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV is equipped with a policy\nagent that autonomously selects MTD actions based on partial observations and\nlocal experiences. By employing a policy gradient-based algorithm, UAVs\ncollaboratively optimize their policies via reward-weighted aggregation.\nExtensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack\nmitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and\ndecreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,\nrespectively, under various DoS attack strategies.

Given a design mock-up and the\nimplementation of its application, GUIPilot reports both their screen\ninconsistencies as well as process inconsistencies. On the one hand, GUIPilot\ndetects the screen inconsistencies by abstracting every screen into a widget\ncontainer where each widget is represented by its position, width, height, and\ntype. By defining the partial order of widgets and the costs of replacing,\ninserting, and deleting widgets in a screen, we convert the screen-matching\nproblem into an optimizable widget alignment problem. On the other hand, we\ntranslate the specified GUI transition into stepwise actions on the mobile\nscreen (e.g., click, long-press, input text on some widgets). To this end, we\npropose a visual prompt for the vision-language model to infer widget-specific\nactions on the screen. By this means, we can validate the presence or absence\nof expected transitions in the implementation. Our extensive experiments on 80\nmobile applications and 160 design mock-ups show that (1) GUIPilot can achieve\n94.5% precision and 99.6% recall in detecting screen inconsistencies,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art approach, such as GVT, by 66.2% and 56.6%\nrespectively, and (2) GUIPilot reports zero errors in detecting process\ninconsistencies.

We find that intensity correlation measurements offer the best\nperformance compared to normalized intensity correlation and noise reduction\nfactor approaches. Under experimental imperfections modeled as linear photon\nlosses, the enhancements from intensity and noise reduction measurements are\nreduced. In contrast, the normalized intensity correlation remains robust to\nloss, though this comes at the cost of losing the enhancement from\nnon-classical light fields. This establishes a trade-off between robustness to\nloss and the achievable quantum advantage.",

Our results unify the rotation--activity relationship and\ngyrochonology for the stellar evolution of low-mass stars, for which we coined\nthe ``CgIW\" scenario.",

In this paper, we develop the\ntheory of moment alignment for DG.

To solve these challenges, we\nrevisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not\nexplored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of\ndownstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.\nThen, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's\ninherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.\nBuilding upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),\nwhich is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current\nworks, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's\nattention towards domain-agnostic knowledge.

This is achieved by combining the approximation error of the\ndirect problem, a priori estimates on the functional, and suitable conditional\nstability estimates of the continuous inverse problem.

    "abstract": "The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression,\nreshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability\nfor semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video\nCoding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could\ncharacterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream\ncompactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models\nto reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at\nthe decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable\nhigh-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far\nsurpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)\nstandard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of\nGFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,\nsystematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and\nindustrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of\nexisting GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization\nstrategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we\nconstruct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective\nMean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the\nmost appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the\nGFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a\nlow-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future\npractical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of\nGFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and\nfuture opportunities.",

    "abstract": "We propose SALT (Split-Adaptive Lightweight Tuning), a lightweight model\nadaptation framework for Split Computing under closed constraints, where the\nhead and tail networks are proprietary and inaccessible to users. In such\nclosed environments, conventional adaptation methods are infeasible since they\nrequire access to model parameters or architectures. SALT addresses this\nchallenge by introducing a compact, trainable adapter on the client side to\nrefine latent features from the head network, enabling user-specific adaptation\nwithout modifying the original models or increasing communication overhead. We\nevaluate SALT on user-specific classification tasks with CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100, demonstrating improved accuracy with lower training latency compared\nto fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, SALT facilitates model adaptation for\nrobust inference over lossy networks, a common challenge in edge-cloud\nenvironments. With minimal deployment overhead, SALT offers a practical\nsolution for personalized inference in edge AI systems under strict system\nconstraints.",

Tremendous efforts are\nbeing dedicated to realizing SDE in a wide variety of material platforms.\nDespite the diversity in the hosting materials and device designs, SDE is\nusually operated in a single mode which is enabled by either out-of-plane or\nin-plane magnetic field/magnetization. In this work, we report the realization\nof a dual-mode SDE in 2H-$\\mathrm{NbS_2}$/2H-$\\mathrm{NbSe_2}$ heterostructures\nwhere both the out-of-plane magnetic field $B_{\\perp}$ and in-plane magnetic\nfield $B_{||}$ can independently generate and manipulate SDE. The two modes\nshare similar diode efficiency but differ in two aspects: 1.\n$B_{\\perp}$-induced SDE is activated by a field on the order of 1 mT while\n$B_{||}$-induced SDE requires a field on the order of 100 mT; 2. $\\eta$ of\n$B_{\\perp}$-induced SDE exhibits a square-root like temperature dependence\nwhile $\\eta$ of $B_{||}$-induced SDE takes a more linear-like one.

The enhancement of the EC upon such superionic transition has not been\nexperimentally verified yet. Here, we measured the EC of Al-bearing SiO2\ncontaining 1750 ppm H2O at pressures up to 82 GPa and temperatures up to 2610 K\nby employing a recently developed technique designed for measuring transparent\nmaterials. Results demonstrate a sudden increase in EC to approximately 10 S/m\nat temperatures of 1100-2200 K, depending on pressure, which is several to ten\ntimes higher than that of the surrounding shallow to middle part of the lower\nmantle, which is attributed to a transition to the superionic state. If hydrous\nSiO2 is substantially weaker than other coexisting phases and thus forms an\ninterconnected film in subducted MORB crust, the EC of the bulk MORB materials\nis significantly enhanced by superionic SiO2 in the lower mantle up to ~1800 km\ndepth, which may explain the high EC anomalies observed at subduction zones\nunderneath northeastern China.

Existing\nmethods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not\ngeneralize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \\textbf{MapBERT},\na novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen\nspaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps\naligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first\ntime, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact\nbitwise tokens. Building on this, a masked transformer is employed to infer\nmissing regions and generate complete semantic maps from limited observations.\nTo enhance object-centric reasoning, we propose an object-aware masking\nstrategy that masks entire object categories concurrently and pairs them with\nlearnable embeddings, capturing implicit relationships between object\nembeddings and spatial tokens. By learning these relationships, the model more\neffectively captures indoor semantic distributions crucial for practical\nrobotic tasks. Experiments on Gibson benchmarks show that MapBERT achieves\nstate-of-the-art semantic map generation, balancing computational efficiency\nwith accurate reconstruction of unobserved regions.",

    "abstract": "We present space-efficient linear sketches for estimating trimmed statistics\nof an $n$-dimensional frequency vector $x$, e.g., the sum of $p$-th powers of\nthe largest $k$ frequencies (i.e., entries) in absolute value, or the\n$k$-trimmed vector, which excludes the top and bottom $k$ frequencies. This is\ncalled the $F_p$ moment of the trimmed vector. Trimmed measures are used in\nrobust estimation, as seen in the R programming language's `trim.var' function\nand the `trim' parameter in the mean function. Linear sketches improve time and\nmemory efficiency and are applicable to streaming and distributed settings. We\ninitiate the study of sketching these statistics and give a new condition for\ncapturing their space complexity. When $k \\ge n/poly\\log n$, we give a linear\nsketch using $poly(1/\\varepsilon, \\log n)$ space which provides a $(1 \\pm\n\\varepsilon)$ approximation to the top-$k$ $F_p$ moment for $p \\in [0,2]$. For\ngeneral $k$, we give a sketch with the same guarantees under a condition\nrelating the $k$-th largest frequency to the tail mass, and show this condition\nis necessary. For the $k$-trimmed version, our sketch achieves optimal error\nguarantees under the same condition. We extend our methods to $p > 2$ and also\naddress related problems such as computing the $F_p$ moment of frequencies\nabove a threshold, finding the largest $k$ such that the $F_p$ moment of the\ntop $k$ exceeds $k^{p+1}$, and the $F_p$ moment of the top $k$ frequencies such\nthat each entry is at least $k$. Notably, our algorithm for this third\napplication improves upon the space bounds of the algorithm of Govindan,\nMonemizadeh, and Muthukrishnan (PODS '17) for computing the $h$-index. We show\nempirically that our top $k$ algorithm uses much less space compared to\nCount-Sketch while achieving the same error.",

    "abstract": "Neural systems process information across a broad range of intrinsic\ntimescales, both within and across cortical areas. While such diversity is a\nhallmark of biological networks, its computational role in nonlinear\ninformation processing remains elusive. In this study, we examine how\nheterogeneity in intrinsic neural timescales within the frontal cortex - a\nregion central to cognitive control - enhances performance in a\ncontext-dependent working memory task. We develop a recurrent neural network\n(RNN) composed of units with distinct time constants to model a delayed\nmatch-to-sample task with contextual cues. This task demands nonlinear\nintegration of temporally dispersed inputs and flexible behavioral adaptation.\nOur analysis shows that task performance is optimized when fast and slow\ntimescales are appropriately balanced. Intriguingly, slow neurons, despite\nweaker encoding of task-relevant inputs, play a causal role in sustaining\nmemory and improving performance. In contrast, fast neurons exhibit strong but\ntransient encoding of input signals. These results highlight a division of\ncomputational roles among neurons with different timescales: slow dynamics\nsupport stable internal states, while fast dynamics enable rapid signal\nencoding. Our findings provide a mechanistic account of how temporal\nheterogeneity contributes to nonlinear information processing in neural\ncircuits, shedding light on the dynamic architecture underlying cognitive\nflexibility.",

However, the high latency of\nstate-of-the-art generalist models, including recent vision-language action\nmodels (VLAs), poses a significant challenge. While action chunking has enabled\ntemporal consistency in high-frequency control tasks, it does not fully address\nthe latency problem, leading to pauses or out-of-distribution jerky movements\nat chunk boundaries. This paper presents a novel inference-time algorithm that\nenables smooth asynchronous execution of action chunking policies.

It generates the next action chunk while\nexecuting the current one, \"freezing\" actions guaranteed to execute and\n\"inpainting\" the rest. To test RTC, we introduce a new benchmark of 12 highly\ndynamic tasks in the Kinetix simulator, as well as evaluate 6 challenging\nreal-world bimanual manipulation tasks.

    "abstract": "Modern large language models (LLMs) are inherently auto-regressive, requiring\ninput to be serialized into flat sequences regardless of their structural\ndependencies. This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage\nstructural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where\ninter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the\npotential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text\nsegments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through\nstructural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively\nattend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than\nall preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a\ngraph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a\nmessage-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated\npositional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and\ncontext window consumption. We evaluate Graph-KV across three scenarios: (1)\nseven RAG benchmarks spanning direct inference, multi-hop reasoning, and\nlong-document understanding; (2) Arxiv-QA, a novel academic paper QA task with\nfull-text scientific papers structured as citation ego-graphs; and (3) paper\ntopic classification within a citation network.

The results indicate that both the\nmagnetic field and non-inertial effects modify the energy levels, with\nadditional contributions depending on the coupling between the rotation\nparameter and the quantum numbers. A numerical analysis is also presented,\nillustrating the behavior of the solutions for two characteristic magnetic\nfield scales: one that may be considered extreme, of the order of the ones\nproposed to be produced in heavy-ion collisions and another near the Planck\nscale.",
