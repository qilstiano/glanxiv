    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of machine learning (ML) has brought about groundbreaking\ndevelopments in numerous industries, not the least of which is in the area of\nundersea communication. This domain is critical for applications like ocean\nexploration, environmental monitoring, resource management, and national\nsecurity. Bangladesh, a maritime nation with abundant resources in the Bay of\nBengal, can harness the immense potential of ML to tackle the unprecedented\nchallenges associated with underwater communication. Beyond that, environmental\nconditions are unique to the region: in addition to signal attenuation,\nmultipath propagation, noise interference, and limited bandwidth. In this\nstudy, we address the necessity to bring ML into communication via undersea; it\ninvestigates the latest technologies under the domain of ML in that respect,\nsuch as deep learning and reinforcement learning, especially concentrating on\nBangladesh scenarios in the sense of implementation. This paper offers a\ncontextualized regional perspective by incorporating region-specific needs,\ncase studies, and recent research to propose a roadmap for deploying ML-driven\nsolutions to improve safety at sea, promote sustainable resource use, and\nenhance disaster response systems. This research ultimately highlights the\npromise of ML-powered solutions for transforming undersea communication,\nleading to more efficient and cost-effective technologies that subsequently\ncontribute to both economic growth and environmental sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Quantum circuit simulations are essential for the verification of quantum\nalgorithms on behalf of real quantum devices. However, the memory requirements\nfor such simulations grow exponentially with the number of qubits involved in\nquantum programs. Moreover, a substantial number of computations in quantum\ncircuit simulations cause low locality data accesses, as they require extensive\ncomputations across the entire table of the full state vector. These\ncharacteristics lead to significant latency and energy overheads during data\ntransfers between the CPU and main memory. Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which\nintegrates computational logic near DRAM banks, could present a promising\nsolution to address these challenges. In this paper, we introduce PIMutation\n(PIM framework for qUanTum circuit simulATION) for achieving fast and\nenergy-efficient quantum circuit simulation. PIMutation is the first attempt to\nleverage UPMEM, a publicly available PIM-integrated DIMM, to implement quantum\ncircuit simulations. PIMutation incorporates three optimization strategies to\novercome the overhead of quantum circuit simulation using the real PIM system:\n(i) gate merging, (ii) row swapping, and (iii) vector partitioning. Our\nevaluations show that PIMutation achieves an average speedup of 2.99x and\n16.51x with a reduction of energy of 25.23% and 75.29% over the QuEST simulator\non CPU in 16- and 32-qubit benchmarks, respectively.",

The training dataset consisted of\nover 400 DRR-FPD image pairs, and the final model was evaluated on an\nindependent set of 100 FPD images. Mean absolute error (MAE), peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and\nKernel Inception Distance (KID) were used to quantify the similarity between\nsynthetic and ground-truth FPD images. Computation time for generating\nsynthetic images was also measured.\n  Results Despite some positional mismatches in the DRR-FPD pairs, the\nsynthetic FPD images closely resembled the ground-truth FPD images. The\nproposed DNN achieved notable improvements over both input DRR images and a\nU-Net-based method in terms of MAE, PSNR, SSIM, and KID. The average image\ngeneration time was on the order of milliseconds per image, indicating its\npotential for real-time application. Qualitative evaluations showed that the\nDNN successfully reproduced image noise patterns akin to real FPD images,\nreducing the need for manual noise adjustments.\n  Conclusions The proposed DNN effectively converted DRR images into realistic\nFPD images for thoracic cases, offering a fast and practical method that could\nstreamline patient setup verification and enhance overall clinical workflow.\nFuture work should validate the model across different imaging systems and\naddress remaining challenges in marker visualization, thereby fostering broader\nclinical adoption.",

On the other hand,\nperiod changes on much shorter time scales ($\\sim$10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$days),\nattributed to non-evolutionary effects are often detected and lack detailed\nexplanation. We aim to provide a systematic and quantitative description of\nirregular or non-linear period changes in Cepheids. We aim to provide a\nsystematic and quantitative description of irregular or non-linear period\nchanges in Cepheids. We analysed part of the OGLE data for classical Cepheids\nin the Magellanic Clouds (MCs; from both Large Magellanic Cloud, LMC, and the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud, SMC) using the modified Hertzsprung $O-C$ technique. A\nsample of 3658 stars, with the best quality data and void of additional\nlow-amplitude periodicities (e.g. due to non-radial pulsations), that could\nimpact the results, was selected for analysis. Based on $O-C$ shapes, stars\nwere classified into three categories: no period change (class 1), linear\nperiod change (class 2), and irregular change (class 3). In our investigation,\n$33.5\\pm0.7$\\% of analysed stars show irregular period changes. Considering the\npulsation mode, irregular period changes were detected in $16.5\\pm0.7$\\% of the\nanalysed fundamental mode stars and in $68.1\\pm1.2$\\% of the first overtone\nstars. The amplitude of variability in the $O-C$ diagrams increases with the\npulsation period, and at a given pulsation period, it is larger for first\novertone stars.

Accurate\nestimation of the source wavelet is essential for effective data fitting,\nalongside the need for low-frequency data and a reasonable initial model to\nprevent cycle skipping. Additionally, wave equation solvers often struggle to\naccurately simulate the amplitude of observed data in real applications.

An automatic\nmulti-label classifier of diseases in CXR images can benefit by incorporating\naspects of the radiologists' approach. Recorded visual scanpaths of\nradiologists on CXR images can be used for the said purpose. But, such\nscanpaths are not available for most CXR images, which creates a gap even for\nmodern deep learning based classifiers. This paper proposes to mitigate this\ngap by generating effective artificial visual scanpaths using a visual scanpath\nprediction model for CXR images. Further, a multi-class multi-label classifier\nframework is proposed that uses a generated scanpath and visual image features\nto classify diseases in CXR images.

Insights into this problem have led to the design\nand development of artificial neural networks that learn representations by\nincorporating brain-like learning abilities. Recently, learning representations\nby capturing similarity between input samples has been studied to tackle this\nproblem. This approach, however, has thus far been used to only learn\ndownstream features from an input and has not been studied in the context of a\ngenerative paradigm, where one can map the representations back to the input\nspace, incorporating not only bottom-up interactions (stimuli to latent) but\nalso learning features in a top-down manner (latent to stimuli). We investigate\na kernel similarity matching framework for generative modeling. Starting with a\nmodified sparse coding objective for learning representations proposed in prior\nwork, we demonstrate that representation learning in this context is equivalent\nto maximizing similarity between the input kernel and a latent kernel. We show\nthat an implicit generative model arises from learning the kernel structure in\nthe latent space and show how the framework can be adapted to learn manifold\nstructures, potentially providing insights as to how task representations can\nbe encoded in the brain. To solve the objective, we propose a novel Alternate\nDirection Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm and discuss the\ninterpretation of the optimization process. Finally, we discuss how this\nrepresentation learning problem can lead towards a biologically plausible\narchitecture to learn the model parameters that ties together representation\nlearning using similarity matching (a bottom-up approach) with predictive\ncoding (a top-down approach).",

However, advanced\ncontrollers like Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), despite proven\ncapabilities, face adoption challenges due to their computational complexity\nand unpredictable closed-loop performance in complex validation systems. This\npaper introduces ExAMPC, a methodology bridging classical control and\nexplainable AI by augmenting the NMPC with data-driven insights to improve the\ntrustworthiness and reveal the optimization solution and closed-loop\nperformance's sensitivities to physical variables and system parameters. By\nemploying a low-order spline embedding to reduce the open-loop trajectory\ndimensionality by over 95%, and integrating it with SHAP and Symbolic\nRegression from eXplainable AI (XAI) for an approximate NMPC, we enable\nintuitive physical insights into the NMPC's optimization routine. The\nprediction accuracy of the approximate NMPC is enhanced through\nphysics-inspired continuous-time constraints penalties, reducing the predicted\ncontinuous trajectory violations by 93%. ExAMPC enables accurate forecasting of\nthe NMPC's computational requirements with explainable insights on worst-case\nscenarios.

An effective binding between T-cell receptors (TCRs)\nand pathogen-derived peptides presented on Major Histocompatibility Complexes\n(MHCs) mediate an immune response.

Despite no direct training on TCR-pMHC data, the implicit\nphysical reasoning in HERMES enables us to make accurate predictions of both\nTCR-pMHC binding affinities and T-cell activities across diverse viral epitopes\nand cancer neoantigens, achieving up to 0.72 correlation with experimental\ndata.

Through experimental validation in\nthree TCR-MHC systems targeting viral and cancer peptides, we demonstrate that\nour designs -- with up to five substitutions from the native sequence --\nactivate T-cells at success rates of up to 50%.

Our approach is first tested on the simple\nharmonic oscillator. We then move on to the Henon-Heiles system, i.e. a\ntwo-degree-of-freedom system of nonlinear oscillators. The integrability of the\nHenon-Heiles system is critically dependent on a set of three parameters within\nits Hamiltonian, a fact that we leverage to assess the robustness of our\napproach in detecting the integrability of this system with respect to the\nparameter dependence of the Hamiltonian. We then adapt our method to canonical\nexamples of Hamiltonian partial differential equations, including the\nKorteweg-de Vries and cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations, again testing\nrobustness against nonintegrable perturbations of their respective\nHamiltonians. In all examples, our approach reliably confirms or denies the\nintegrability of the equations of interest. Moreover, by appropriately\nadjusting the loss function and applying thresholded $l^0$ regularization to\nenforce sparsity in the operator weights, we successfully recover accurate\nforms of the Lax pairs despite wide initial hypotheses on the operators.

Interestingly, we find that these two seemingly unrelated assumptions\ncan actually complement each other to achieve identifiability. Specifically,\nwhen conditioned on auxiliary variables, the sparse mixing procedure assumption\nprovides structural constraints on the mapping from estimated to true latent\nvariables and hence compensates for potentially insufficient distribution\nchanges. Building on this insight, we propose an identifiability theory with\nless restrictive constraints regarding distribution changes and the sparse\nmixing procedure, enhancing applicability to real-world scenarios.\nAdditionally, we develop an estimation framework incorporating a domain\nencoding network and a sparse mixing constraint and provide two implementations\nbased on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks,\nrespectively. Experiment results on synthetic and real-world datasets support\nour theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "Counterfeiting poses a significant challenge across multiple industries,\nleading to financial losses and health risks. While DNA-based molecular tagging\nhas emerged as a promising anti-counterfeiting strategy, existing methods rely\non predefined DNA sequences, making them vulnerable to replication as\nsequencing and synthesis technologies advance. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce POSERS (Position-Oriented Scattering of Elements among a Randomized\nSequence), a steganographic tagging system embedded within DNA sequences.\nPOSERS ensures copy- and forgery-proof authentication by adding restrictions\nwithin randomized DNA libraries, enhancing security against counterfeiting\nattempts. The POSERS design allows the complexity of the libraries to be\nadjusted based on the customer's needs while ensuring they withstand the\nongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. We\nmathematically validate its security properties and experimentally demonstrate\nits effectiveness using Next-Generation Sequencing and an authentication test,\nsuccessfully distinguishing genuine POSERS tags from counterfeit ones. Our\nresults highlight the potential of POSERS as a long-term, adaptable solution\nfor secure product authentication.",

In addition, a new\nphotovoltaic array will supply most of the observatory's power. The LAT survey\nwill cover about 60% of the sky at a regular observing cadence, with five times\nthe angular resolution and ten times the map depth of Planck. The science goals\nare to: (1) determine the physical conditions in the early universe and\nconstrain the existence of new light particles; (2) measure the integrated\ndistribution of mass, electron pressure, and electron momentum in the late-time\nuniverse, and, in combination with optical surveys, determine the neutrino mass\nand the effects of dark energy via tomographic measurements of the growth of\nstructure at $z < 3$; (3) measure the distribution of electron density and\npressure around galaxy groups and clusters, and calibrate the effects of energy\ninput from galaxy formation on the surrounding environment; (4) produce a\nsample of more than 30,000 galaxy clusters, and more than 100,000 extragalactic\nmillimeter sources, including regularly sampled AGN light-curves, to study\nthese sources and their emission physics; (5) measure the polarized emission\nfrom magnetically aligned dust grains in our Galaxy, to study the properties of\ndust and the role of magnetic fields in star formation; (6) constrain asteroid\nregoliths, search for Trans-Neptunian Objects, and either detect or eliminate\nlarge portions of the phase space in the search for Planet 9; and (7) provide a\npowerful new window into the transient universe on time scales of minutes to\nyears, concurrent with observations from Rubin of overlapping sky.",

    "abstract": "A striking example of frustration in physics is Hofstadter's butterfly, a\nfractal structure that emerges from the competition between a crystal's lattice\nperiodicity and the magnetic length of an applied field. Current methods for\npredicting the topological invariants associated with Hofstadter's butterfly\nare challenging or impossible to apply to a range of materials, including those\nthat are disordered or lack a bulk spectral gap. Here, we demonstrate a\nframework for predicting a material's local Chern markers using its\nposition-space description and validate it against experimental observations of\nquantum transport in artificial graphene in a semiconductor heterostructure,\ninherently accounting for fabrication disorder strong enough to close the bulk\nspectral gap. By resolving local changes in the system's topology, we reveal\nthe topological origins of antidot-localized states that appear in artificial\ngraphene in the presence of a magnetic field. Moreover, we show the breadth of\nthis framework by simulating how Hofstadter's butterfly emerges from an\ninitially unpatterned 2D electron gas as the system's potential strength is\nincreased, and predict that artificial graphene becomes a topological insulator\nat the critical magnetic field. Overall, we anticipate that a position-space\napproach to determine a material's Chern invariant without requiring prior\nknowledge of its occupied states or bulk spectral gaps will enable a broad\narray of fundamental inquiries and provide a novel route to material discovery,\nespecially in metallic, aperiodic, and disordered systems.",

    "abstract": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a key approach for scaling large\nlanguage models efficiently by activating only a subset of experts during\ntraining and inference. Typically, the number of activated experts presents a\ntrade-off: fewer experts reduce computational costs, while more experts improve\nperformance. Recent studies reveal that not all activated experts contribute\nequally to model performance, with some providing minimal utility, particularly\nwhen finetuning pretrained MoE models for specialized downstream tasks. The\nco-existence of significant and redundant parameters in experts provides us an\nopportunity to reduce the number of activated experts while maintaining model\nperformance. In this work, we propose the concept of compressed experts,\nlightweight modules that serve as compact representations of full experts. Our\napproach preserves the most important experts while replacing other auxiliary\nactivated experts with compressed experts. The reduction of active parameters\nsignificantly lowers inference costs while achieving comparable performance.\nExtensive experiments on models including Phi-MoE and OLMoE demonstrate that\ncompressed experts recover over 90% of full expert performance across various\ntasks while reducing more than 30% active parameters and saving 20% in\ninference costs. This approach enables efficient deployment of MoE models in\nresource-constrained settings and facilitates scaling to larger models with\nmanageable overhead.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a full discretization procedure to solve wave beam\npropagation in random media modeled by a paraxial wave equation or an\nIt\\^o-Schr\\\"odinger stochastic partial differential equation. This method bears\nsimilarities with the phase screen method used routinely to solve such\nproblems. The main axis of propagation is discretized by a centered splitting\nscheme with step $\\Delta z$ while the transverse variables are treated by a\nspectral method after appropriate spatial truncation. The originality of our\napproach is its theoretical validity even when the typical wavelength $\\theta$\nof the propagating signal satisfies $\\theta\\ll\\Delta z$. More precisely, we\nobtain a convergence of order $\\Delta z$ in mean-square sense while the errors\non statistical moments are of order $(\\Delta z)^2$ as expected for standard\ncentered splitting schemes. This is a surprising result as splitting schemes\ntypically do not converge when $\\Delta z$ is not the smallest scale of the\nproblem.

    "abstract": "Improving social welfare is a complex challenge requiring policymakers to\noptimize objectives across multiple time horizons. Evaluating the impact of\nsuch policies presents a fundamental challenge, as those that appear suboptimal\nin the short run may yield significant long-term benefits. We tackle this\nchallenge by analyzing the long-term dynamics of two prominent policy\nframeworks: Rawlsian policies, which prioritize those with the greatest need,\nand utilitarian policies, which maximize immediate welfare gains. Conventional\nwisdom suggests these policies are at odds, as Rawlsian policies are assumed to\ncome at the cost of reducing the average social welfare, which their\nutilitarian counterparts directly optimize. We challenge this assumption by\nanalyzing these policies in a sequential decision-making framework where\nindividuals' welfare levels stochastically decay over time, and policymakers\ncan intervene to prevent this decay. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove\nthat interventions following Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian\npolicies in the long run, even when the latter dominate in the short run. We\ncharacterize the exact conditions under which Rawlsian policies can outperform\nutilitarian policies. We further illustrate our theoretical findings using\nsimulations, which highlight the risks of evaluating policies based solely on\ntheir short-term effects. Our results underscore the necessity of considering\nlong-term horizons in designing and evaluating welfare policies; the true\nefficacy of even well-established policies may only emerge over time.",

    "abstract": "The study of primordial black holes (PBHs) and the Hawking radiation they\nproduce represents a significant step toward understanding the role of these\nphenomena in the cosmological evolution of the Universe. PBHs could be a\ncomponent of dark matter, the seeds of supermassive black holes, and sources of\nHawking radiation, which, unlike the radiation from other black holes, might be\nobservable. Over the course of the evolution of the Universe from the Big Bang\nto the present day, PBHs have lost a substantial portion of their mass through\nneutrino radiation. This occurs because, for black holes with masses\n$M\\lesssim10^{23}\\,$g, the radiation of the lightest massive particles -\nneutrinos - becomes significant alongside the emission of photons. This\nneutrino radiation eventually dominates the emission process. By the present\ntime ($t_0=13.8$ Gyr), only black holes with masses $\\lesssim 10^{15}\\,$g have\nlargely evaporated, meaning that the total emission spectrum of PBHs is now\ndominated by the neutrino component. In this paper, we present new estimates of\nthe neutrino spectra emitted by PBHs of various masses, with a particular focus\non low-energy radiation ($E_{kin} \\in [0.01 \\div 1]\\, $eV) for the first time.\nOur calculations demonstrate that black holes in the mass range\n$[10^{9}\\div10^{11}]\\,$g emit neutrinos with intensities that exceed the\nbackground fluxes from known astrophysical sources in the low-energy range. In\ncontrast, in the high-energy range, the emission remains below the background\nlevel, consistent with observational constraints. These findings open new\navenues for the potential detection of PBH radiation and could stimulate\nadvancements in neutrino detection technologies, particularly in the low-energy\nregime. The observation of neutrinos in this energy range represents one of the\nfew opportunities to confirm the existence of Hawking radiation.",

Over the past decade,\nthere have been several works establishing robust connections between skein\nalgebras and DAHAs. Particularly, Samuelson proved that a spherical subalgebra\nof the type $A_1$ DAHA can be realized as a quotient of the Kauffman bracket\nskein algebra of the torus with boundary, $K_q(T^2 \\setminus D^2)$. Since the\n$A_1$ double affine Hecke algebra is Morita equivalent to its spherical\nsubalgebra, discovering modules for $K_q(T^2 \\setminus D^2)$ immediately\nprovides us with modules for the $A_1$ DAHA.\n  Stated skein theory enhances traditional Kauffman bracket skein theory by\nincorporating the boundary components of manifolds, thereby offering additional\nproperties such as excision that enrich the algebraic structure. Furthermore,\nKauffman bracket skein algebras embed into their stated counterparts, showing\nthat stated skein algebras are extensions of Kauffman bracket skein algebras.\nWe use this extended framework to further develop the representation theory of\nthe $A_1$ DAHA.\n  After identifying generators for the stated skein algebra of $T^2 \\setminus\nD^2$, we embed this algebra into a quantum $6$-torus and leverage the nice\nrepresentation-theoretic properties of quantum tori to construct a module of\nLaurent polynomials. Additionally, as $T^2$ is the boundary of any knot\ncomplement, we discuss how to construct a more topologically-defined module\nfrom various knots and provide an explicit example for the unknot.

This differs from classical notions of\ncompression in that the distortion is not measured directly at the level of\nbits, but rather in an abstract semantic space. In order to make this precise,\nwe take inspiration from cognitive neuroscience and machine learning and model\nsemantic space as a continuous Euclidean vector space. In such a space, stimuli\nlike speech, images, or even ideas, are mapped to high-dimensional real\nvectors, and the location of these embeddings determines their meaning relative\nto other embeddings. This suggests that a natural metric for semantic\nsimilarity is just the Euclidean distance, which is what we use in this work.\nWe map the optimization problem of determining the minimal-length,\nmeaning-preserving message to a spin glass Hamiltonian and solve the resulting\nstatistical mechanics problem using replica theory. We map out the replica\nsymmetric phase diagram, identifying distinct phases of semantic compression: a\nfirst-order transition occurs between lossy and lossless compression, whereas a\ncontinuous crossover is seen from extractive to abstractive compression. We\nconclude by showing numerical simulations of compressions obtained by simulated\nannealing and greedy algorithms, and argue that while the problem of finding a\nmeaning-preserving compression is computationally hard in the worst case, there\nexist efficient algorithms which achieve near optimal performance in the\ntypical case.",

Traditional approaches usually\nrely on embedding-based machine learning models to capture user preferences,\nand then reduce the final optimization task to nearest-neighbors, which can be\nperformed extremely fast. However, these models struggle to capture complex\nuser behaviors, which are essential for making accurate recommendations.\nTransformer-based models, on the other hand, are known for their practical\nability to model sequential behaviors, and hence have been intensively used in\npersonalization recently to overcome these limitations.

We formulate a safety-critical controller for\nacceleration-controlled unicycle robots as a mixed-integer quadratic\nprogramming (MIQP), integrating state-feedback-based CLFs for navigation and\nVOCBFs for collision avoidance. To enhance the efficiency of solving the MIQP,\nwe split the MIQP into multiple sub-optimization problems and employ a decision\nnetwork to reduce computational costs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that\nour approach effectively guides the robot to its target while avoiding\ncollisions. Compared to HOCBFs, VOCBFs exhibit significantly improved dynamic\nobstacle avoidance performance, especially when obstacles are fast-moving and\nclose to the robot. Furthermore, we extend our method to distributed\nmulti-robot systems.",

We consider the\nthree-wave, four-wave, five-wave and six-wave kinetic equations, introducing\nmeasures of locality of general wave turbulence system and of median step size\nin wave-wave scattering. We then use the proposed method to study the\nMajda-McLaughlin-Tabak one-dimensional model and examine the characteristics of\nenergy and action transport. We show that energy in the direct energy cascade\nis dominated by local interactions, but shows a nonlocal inverse \"return flow\"\nthat counters the direction of the cascade. The inverse action cascade is\ninstead ruled by more nonlocal interactions, but shows a highly local direct\n\"return flow\". We also show that for both cascades a scale separation of over\nan order of magnitude is necessary to ensure a negligible interaction rate with\nforcing or dissipation regions, hinting at why in numerical simulations of the\nmodel an extremely large box size is necessary in order to realize the\ntheoretical Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectra.",

Results show that\nusing all five profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST) minimizes voltage output\nerror, while {C/5, C/2, Pulse, DST} minimizes parameter estimation error. The\nshortest time cost is achieved with {1C}. When considering both model voltage\noutput and parameter errors, {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST} is optimal.

Such topics may give the impression that they are\norganically popular among the public, even though they are astroturfing\ncampaigns that are centrally managed. It is challenging to predict if a topic\nis organic or a coordinated campaign due to the lack of reliable ground truth.\nIn this paper, we create such ground truth by detecting the campaigns promoted\nby ephemeral astroturfing attacks. These attacks push any topic to Twitter's\n(X) trends list by employing bots that tweet in a coordinated manner in a short\nperiod and then immediately delete their tweets. We manually curate a dataset\nof organic Twitter trends. We then create engagement networks out of these\ndatasets which can serve as a challenging testbed for graph classification task\nto distinguish between campaigns and organic trends. Engagement networks\nconsist of users as nodes and engagements as edges (retweets, replies, and\nquotes) between users. We release the engagement networks for 179 campaigns and\n135 non-campaigns, and also provide finer-grain labels to characterize the type\nof the campaigns and non-campaigns. Our dataset, LEN (Large Engagement\nNetworks), is available in the URL below. In comparison to traditional graph\nclassification datasets, which are small with tens of nodes and hundreds of\nedges at most, graphs in LEN are larger. The average graph in LEN has ~11K\nnodes and ~23K edges. We show that state-of-the-art GNN methods give only\nmediocre results for campaign vs. non-campaign and campaign type classification\non LEN. LEN offers a unique and challenging playfield for the graph\nclassification problem.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel backdoor threat attacking the LLM-as-a-Judge\nevaluation regime, where the adversary controls both the candidate and\nevaluator model. The backdoored evaluator victimizes benign users by unfairly\nassigning inflated scores to adversary. A trivial single token backdoor\npoisoning 1% of the evaluator training data triples the adversary's score with\nrespect to their legitimate score. We systematically categorize levels of data\naccess corresponding to three real-world settings, (1) web poisoning, (2)\nmalicious annotator, and (3) weight poisoning. These regimes reflect a weak to\nstrong escalation of data access that highly correlates with attack severity.\nUnder the weakest assumptions - web poisoning (1), the adversary still induces\na 20% score inflation. Likewise, in the (3) weight poisoning regime, the\nstronger assumptions enable the adversary to inflate their scores from 1.5/5 to\n4.9/5. The backdoor threat generalizes across different evaluator\narchitectures, trigger designs, evaluation tasks, and poisoning rates. By\npoisoning 10% of the evaluator training data, we control toxicity judges\n(Guardrails) to misclassify toxic prompts as non-toxic 89% of the time, and\ndocument reranker judges in RAG to rank the poisoned document first 97% of the\ntime. LLM-as-a-Judge is uniquely positioned at the intersection of ethics and\ntechnology, where social implications of mislead model selection and evaluation\nconstrain the available defensive tools. Amidst these challenges, model merging\nemerges as a principled tool to offset the backdoor, reducing ASR to near 0%\nwhilst maintaining SOTA performance. Model merging's low computational cost and\nconvenient integration into the current LLM Judge training pipeline position it\nas a promising avenue for backdoor mitigation in the LLM-as-a-Judge setting.",

Second, the\nrandom forest is employed to sort the importance of each feature. Third, the\ntraining set is divided into three subsets according to the reference blood\nglucose values. Fourth, the feature vectors and the corresponding blood glucose\nvalues in the same group are employed to build an individual model.

    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for intervention\nbefore irreversible neurodegeneration occurs. Structural MRI (sMRI) is widely\nused for AD diagnosis, but conventional deep learning approaches primarily rely\non intensity-based features, which require large datasets to capture subtle\nstructural changes. Jacobian determinant maps (JSM) provide complementary\ninformation by encoding localized brain deformations, yet existing multimodal\nfusion strategies fail to fully integrate these features with sMRI. We propose\na cross-attention fusion framework to model the intrinsic relationship between\nsMRI intensity and JSM-derived deformations for AD classification. Using the\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we compare\ncross-attention, pairwise self-attention, and bottleneck attention with four\npre-trained 3D image encoders. Cross-attention fusion achieves superior\nperformance, with mean ROC-AUC scores of 0.903 (+/-0.033) for AD vs.\ncognitively normal (CN) and 0.692 (+/-0.061) for mild cognitive impairment\n(MCI) vs. CN. Despite its strong performance, our model remains highly\nefficient, with only 1.56 million parameters--over 40 times fewer than\nResNet-34 (63M) and Swin UNETR (61.98M). These findings demonstrate the\npotential of cross-attention fusion for improving AD diagnosis while\nmaintaining computational efficiency.",

Although this remarkable outcome enables them to\nread and write, they report difficulty with perceiving faces. This paper\nprovides a novel, non-pixelated algorithm for simulating prosthetic vision the\nway it is experienced by PRIMA patients, compares the algorithm's predictions\nto clinical perceptual outcomes, and offers computer vision and machine\nlearning (ML) methods to improve face representation. Approach. Our simulation\nalgorithm integrates a grayscale filter, spatial resolution filter, and\ncontrast filter. This accounts for the limited sampling density of the retinal\nimplant, as well as the reduced contrast sensitivity of prosthetic vision.\nPatterns of Landolt C and faces created using this simulation algorithm are\ncompared to reports from actual PRIMA users. To recover the facial features\nlost in prosthetic vision, we apply an ML facial landmarking model as well as\ncontrast adjusting tone curves to the face image prior to its projection onto\nthe implant. Main results. Simulated prosthetic vision matches the maximum\nletter acuity observed in clinical studies as well as patients' subjective\ndescriptions. Application of the inversed contrast filter helps preserve the\ncontrast in prosthetic vision. Identification of the facial features using an\nML facial landmarking model and accentuating them further improve face\nrepresentation. Significance. Spatial and contrast constraints of prosthetic\nvision limit resolvable features and degrade natural images. ML based methods\nand contrast adjustments mitigate some limitations and improve face\nrepresentation. Even though higher spatial resolution can be expected with\nimplants having smaller pixels, contrast enhancement still remains essential\nfor face recognition.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, pretrained large language models have demonstrated\noutstanding performance across various natural language processing tasks.\nHowever, full-parameter fine-tuning methods require adjusting all model\nparameters, leading to immense computational resource demands. Although\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA have significantly reduced\nthe number of parameters, they still face challenges such as gradient vanishing\nand the potential for further parameter reduction. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called LoR2C\n(Low-Rank Residual Connection Adaptation). LoR2C introduces residual\nconnections with low-rank matrices within the model layers, which not only\nreduces the number of fine-tuning parameters but also effectively alleviates\nthe gradient vanishing problem. Additionally, this paper presents three\noptimization variants of LoR2C: ShareLoR2C, MergeLoR2C, and InjectLoR2C. These\nvariants further improve parameter efficiency and model performance through\nparameter sharing, module merging, and injection mechanisms, respectively.\nExperimental results on multiple natural language understanding and natural\nlanguage generation tasks demonstrate that LoR2C and its optimized variants\nsignificantly reduce parameter overhead while maintaining or even improving\nperformance, outperforming existing mainstream parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nmethods.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Oblivioniss/LoR2C.",

Moreover, in many practical\napplications, such as personalized medicine and recommendation systems,\nfeedback is provided in batches, contextual information is available at the\ntime of decision-making, and rewards from different arms are related rather\nthan independent. We propose a novel semi-parametric framework for batched\nbandits with covariates and a shared parameter across arms, leveraging the\nsingle-index regression (SIR) model to capture relationships between arm\nrewards while balancing interpretability and flexibility. Our algorithm,\nBatched single-Index Dynamic binning and Successive arm elimination (BIDS),\nemploys a batched successive arm elimination strategy with a dynamic binning\nmechanism guided by the single-index direction. We consider two settings: one\nwhere a pilot direction is available and another where the direction is\nestimated from data, deriving theoretical regret bounds for both cases. When a\npilot direction is available with sufficient accuracy, our approach achieves\nminimax-optimal rates (with $d = 1$) for nonparametric batched bandits,\ncircumventing the curse of dimensionality.

Second, we simulate dialogues where the system requests necessary\ninformation from the user based on API documentation and seeks additional APIs\nif the user fails to provide the required information. To facilitate this\nprocess, we introduce a method for generating an API graph that represents\ninput and output compatibility between APIs.

We assume that two\ndifferent types of agents make decisions in this problem.

To address this gap, we\nanalyse a month-long dataset of 3.1~billion voice-call records from Brazil's\n100 most populous cities, providing a continental-scale test of urban scaling\nlaws. We measure interactions using two complementary proxies: the number of\nphone-based contacts (voice-call degrees) and the number of trips inferred from\nconsecutive calls in distinct locations.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the most popular architecture for\ngraph-level learning, including graph classification and regression tasks,\nwhich frequently arise in areas such as biochemistry and drug discovery.\nAchieving good performance in practice requires careful model design. Due to\ngaps in our understanding of the relationship between model and data\ncharacteristics, this often requires manual architecture and hyperparameter\ntuning. This is particularly pronounced in graph-level tasks, due to much\nhigher variation in the input data than in node-level tasks. To work towards\nclosing these gaps, we begin with a systematic analysis of individual\nperformance in graph-level tasks. Our results establish significant performance\nheterogeneity in both message-passing and transformer-based architectures. We\nthen investigate the interplay of model and data characteristics as drivers of\nthe observed heterogeneity. Our results suggest that graph topology alone\ncannot explain heterogeneity. Using the Tree Mover's Distance, which jointly\nevaluates topological and feature information, we establish a link between\nclass-distance ratios and performance heterogeneity in graph classification.\nThese insights motivate model and data preprocessing choices that account for\nheterogeneity between graphs. We propose a selective rewiring approach, which\nonly targets graphs whose individual performance benefits from rewiring. We\nfurther show that the optimal network depth depends on the graph's spectrum,\nwhich motivates a heuristic for choosing the number of GNN layers.

Additionally, we introduce a retrieval method that\nleverages an external retriever or the parameters within Video-LLMs to retrieve\nonly query-relevant KV-Caches, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy in\nquestion answering. ReKV enables the separation of video encoding and\nquestion-answering across different processes and GPUs, significantly enhancing\nthe efficiency of StreamingVQA. Through comprehensive experimentation, we\nvalidate the efficacy and practicality of our approach, which significantly\nboosts efficiency and enhances applicability over existing VideoQA models.",

However,\nexisting RLHF methods are non-robust, and their performance deteriorates if the\ndownstream task differs significantly from the preference dataset used in\nfine-tuning. In order to mitigate this problem, we introduce a distributionally\nrobust RLHF for fine-tuning LLMs. In particular, our goal is to ensure that a\nfine-tuned model retains its performance even when the distribution of prompts\nsignificantly differs from the distribution encountered during fine-tuning. We\nformulate distributionally robust optimization (DRO) version of two popular\nfine-tuning methods -- (1) reward-based RLHF and (2) reward-free DPO (direct\npreference optimization). We propose a minibatch gradient descent based\nalgorithms for both of them, and theoretically prove convergence guarantees for\nthe algorithms. Subsequently, we evaluate our algorithms on an\nout-of-distribution (OOD) task by first training the model on the\nUnified-Feedback dataset and evaluating its performance on two different\ndatasets. The experimental results show that our robust training improves the\naccuracy of the learned reward models on average, and markedly on some tasks,\nsuch as reasoning.

We describe the observations and data reduction of\n~214 hours of interferometric data from NOEMA, ~55 hours of tailored new\nobservations with the IRAM-30m telescope and the combination of NOEMA, new and\n~14 hours of archival 30m observations. We detect widespread emission from 9\nmolecular transition lines. The J=1-0 transitions of CO isotopologues 13CO and\nC18O are detected at high significance across the full observed field-of-view\n(FoV). HCN, HNC, HCO+, and N2H+(1-0) are detected in the center, molecular ring\nand spiral arms of the galaxy, while the shock tracer HNCO(4-3), (5-4) and PDR\ntracer C2H(1-0) are detected in the central ~1 kpc and molecular ring only. For\nmost of the lines that we detect, average line ratios with respect to CO are\nincreased by up to a factor of ~3 in the central 1 kpc, where an AGN and its\nlow-inclination outflow are present, compared to the disk.

In\nthe proposed controller, the RL policy focuses on upper-level tasks, outputting\ntask-oriented high-level commands that the S-surface controller then converts\ninto control signals, ensuring cancellation of nonlinear effects and\nunpredictable external disturbances in extreme sea conditions. Under extreme\nsea conditions involving complex terrain, waves, and currents, the proposed\ncontroller demonstrates superior performance and adaptability in high-level\ntasks such as underwater target tracking and data collection, outperforming\ntraditional PID and SMC controllers.",

The Mamba architecture provides an\nappealing alternative, offering linear complexity and high parallelism.\nHowever, its inherent 1D processing structure causes a loss of spatial\ninformation in 2D vision tasks.

    "abstract": "Despite encouraging progress in 3D scene understanding, it remains\nchallenging to develop an effective Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) that is\ncapable of understanding and reasoning in complex 3D environments. Most\nprevious methods typically encode 3D point and 2D image features separately,\nneglecting interactions between 2D semantics and 3D object properties, as well\nas the spatial relationships within the 3D environment. This limitation not\nonly hinders comprehensive representations of 3D scene, but also compromises\ntraining and inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a\nunified Instance-aware 3D Large Multi-modal Model (Inst3D-LMM) to deal with\nmultiple 3D scene understanding tasks simultaneously. To obtain the\nfine-grained instance-level visual tokens, we first introduce a novel\nMulti-view Cross-Modal Fusion (MCMF) module to inject the multi-view 2D\nsemantics into their corresponding 3D geometric features. For scene-level\nrelation-aware tokens, we further present a 3D Instance Spatial Relation\n(3D-ISR) module to capture the intricate pairwise spatial relationships among\nobjects. Additionally, we perform end-to-end multi-task instruction tuning\nsimultaneously without the subsequent task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods across 3D scene understanding, reasoning and grounding tasks.

    "abstract": "The internal model principle, originally proposed in the theory of control of\nlinear systems, nowadays represents a more general class of results in control\ntheory and cybernetics. The central claim of these results is that, under\nsuitable assumptions, if a system (a controller) can regulate against a class\nof external inputs (from the environment), it is because the system contains a\nmodel of the system causing these inputs, which can be used to generate signals\ncounteracting them. Similar claims on the role of internal models appear also\nin cognitive science, especially in modern Bayesian treatments of cognitive\nagents, often suggesting that a system (a human subject, or some other agent)\nmodels its environment to adapt against disturbances and perform goal-directed\nbehaviour. It is however unclear whether the Bayesian internal models discussed\nin cognitive science bear any formal relation to the internal models invoked in\nstandard treatments of control theory. Here, we first review the internal model\nprinciple and present a precise formulation of it using concepts inspired by\ncategorical systems theory. This leads to a formal definition of ``model''\ngeneralising its use in the internal model principle. Although this notion of\nmodel is not a priori related to the notion of Bayesian reasoning, we show that\nit can be seen as a special case of possibilistic Bayesian filtering. This\nresult is based on a recent line of work formalising, using Markov categories,\na notion of ``interpretation'', describing when a system can be interpreted as\nperforming Bayesian filtering on an outside world in a consistent way.",

The main focus of this\npaper is to explore the saturation effects for a large class of spectral\nalgorithms (including the KRR, gradient descent, etc.) in large dimensional\nsettings where $n \\asymp d^{\\gamma}$. More precisely, we first propose an\nimproved minimax lower bound for the kernel regression problem in large\ndimensional settings and show that the gradient flow with early stopping\nstrategy will result in an estimator achieving this lower bound (up to a\nlogarithmic factor). Similar to the results in KRR, we can further determine\nthe exact convergence rates (both upper and lower bounds) of a large class of\n(optimal tuned) spectral algorithms with different qualification $\\tau$'s. In\nparticular, we find that these exact rate curves (varying along $\\gamma$)\nexhibit the periodic plateau behavior and the polynomial approximation barrier.\nConsequently, we can fully depict the saturation effects of the spectral\nalgorithms and reveal a new phenomenon in large dimensional settings (i.e., the\nsaturation effect occurs in large dimensional setting as long as the source\ncondition $s>\\tau$ while it occurs in fixed dimensional setting as long as\n$s>2\\tau$).",

The performance\nof the reward model plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of alignment.\nPrevious reward models operate at a coarse-grained level, requiring the\ngeneration of a complete response to obtain a reward value. The sparse reward\nmay present challenges for downstream reinforcement learning. While recent\nefforts have attempted to learn token-level reward models, the lack of explicit\nsemantic information makes it difficult to model the credit of every individual\ntoken. In this paper, we propose assigning scores to every sentence,\nintroducing an intermediate-grained reward model.

HPL systems are instrumental in\nhigh-energy physics, leveraging ultra-short impulse durations to yield\nextremely high intensities, which are essential for both practical applications\nand theoretical advancements in light-matter interactions. Traditionally, the\nparameters regulating HPL optical performance have been manually tuned by human\nexperts, or optimized using black-box methods that can be computationally\ndemanding. Critically, black box methods rely on stationarity assumptions\noverlooking complex dynamics in high-energy physics and day-to-day changes in\nreal-world experimental settings, and thus need to be often restarted. Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by enabling\nsequential decision making in non-static settings. This work explores the\nfeasibility of applying DRL to HPL systems, extending the current research by\n(1) learning a control policy relying solely on non-destructive image\nobservations obtained from readily available diagnostic devices, and (2)\nretaining performance when the underlying dynamics vary. We evaluate our method\nacross various test dynamics, and observe that DRL effectively enables\ncross-domain adaptability, coping with dynamics' fluctuations while achieving\n90\\% of the target intensity in test environments.",

    "abstract": "Enhancing the transport of oxygen anions in the cathode while maintaining\nsurface stability is essential for improving the performance of\nintermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT-SOFCs). This study\ninvestigates a novel cathode material candidate, Sr2CoNbO6-delta (SCNO), using\ndensity functional theory, molecular dynamics, and experimental\ncharacterization. The redox active Co cation at B-site and less reducible Nb\ncation at the B'-site together enhance both surface stability and\nelectrocatalytic performance. SCNO is observed to have a higher concentration\nof oxygen vacancies and increased oxygen diffusivity on the surface. The\nsurface stability of SCNO is further improved when simulated under compressive\nstrain due to the GDC electrolyte substrate. These findings offer new insights\ninto controlling Sr segregation in SCNO, contributing to a better understanding\nof its enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and high surface\nstability. Subsequently, SCNO was synthesized to evaluate its potential as a\ncathode material in SOFCs. To assess its performance, symmetric cells with\nuniform dense thin films of varying thicknesses (40 and 80 nm) were fabricated\nusing the pulsed laser deposition technique. Electrochemical impedance\nspectroscopy and distributed relaxation time analysis indicate that bulk oxygen\nion diffusion is a limiting factor for the ORR in SCNO. The polarization\nresistance for the 40 and 80 nm dense thin film symmetric cells ranged between\n0.329 - 0.241 ohm cm2 and 1.095 - 0.438 ohm cm2, respectively, within the\ntemperature range of 773 - 973 K in an air atmosphere. The full cell\nconfiguration of NiO-GDC|GDC|SCNO demonstrated a significantly high peak power\ndensity of 0.633 W/cm2 at 973 K. This theory-guided design and experimental\nstudy suggest that SCNO is a promising candidate for IT-SOFC cathode materials.",

Consequently, we can evaluate ansatz fitness for small\nsystems, which is computationally efficient, while favouring structures that\ncontinue to perform well with increasing system size.

Remarkably, we\nfind analytically tractable ansatzes with a degree of universality, which\nencode correlations, capture finite-size effects, accurately predict\nground-state energies, and offer a good description of critical phenomena. We\ndemonstrate this method on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) and the quantum\ntransverse-field Ising model (TFIM), where the same ansatz was independently\ngenerated for both.

In\nthis paper, we combine onboard 3D lidar sensing and sim-to-real reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to enable autonomous flight in cluttered environments. Compared\nto vision sensors, lidars appear to be more straightforward and accurate for\ngeometric modeling of surroundings, which is one of the most important cues for\nsuccessful obstacle avoidance.

The key to successfully learn the policy in a lightweight way lies in a\nspecialized surrogate of the lidar's raw point clouds, which simplifies\nlearning while retaining a fine-grained perception to detect narrow free space\nand thin obstacles. Simulation statistics demonstrate the advantages of the\nproposed system over alternatives, such as performing easier maneuvers and\nhigher success rates at different speed constraints.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource\nallocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term\nobjectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints.\nUnlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource\nallocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal\nworst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by\nintegrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk\ncontrol (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The\neffectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference\ntargeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture.\nSpecifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability\nconstraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation\ndecisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted\nsum of energy consumption and precision loss, with the latter accounting for\nthe rate of false positives.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI reasoning models provide unprecedented transparency\ninto their decision-making processes, transforming them from traditional\nblack-box systems into models that articulate step-by-step chains of thought\nrather than producing opaque outputs. This shift has the potential to improve\nsoftware quality, explainability, and trust in AI-augmented development.\nHowever, software engineers rarely have the time or cognitive bandwidth to\nanalyze, verify, and interpret every AI-generated thought in detail. Without an\neffective interface, this transparency could become a burden rather than a\nbenefit.\n  In this paper, we propose a vision for structuring the interaction between AI\nreasoning models and software engineers to maximize trust, efficiency, and\ndecision-making power. We argue that simply exposing AI's reasoning is not\nenough -- software engineers need tools and frameworks that selectively\nhighlight critical insights, filter out noise, and facilitate rapid validation\nof key assumptions. To illustrate this challenge, we present motivating\nexamples in which AI reasoning models state their assumptions when deciding\nwhich external library to use and produce divergent reasoning paths and\nrecommendations about security vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for an\ninterface that prioritizes actionable insights while managing uncertainty and\nresolving conflicts. We then outline a research roadmap for integrating\nautomated summarization, assumption validation, and multi-model conflict\nresolution into software engineering workflows.

CJ aligns with real-world evaluations, where\noverall quality emerges from the interplay of various elements. However,\nrubrics remain widely used in education, offering structured criteria for\ngrading and detailed feedback. This creates a gap between CJ's holistic ranking\nand the need for criterion-based performance breakdowns.\n  This paper addresses this gap using a Bayesian approach.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce an innovative convolutional module, Adaptive\nRectangular Convolution (ARConv).

This approach enables ARConv to\neffectively capture scale-specific features of various objects within an image,\noptimizing kernel sizes and sampling locations.

These properties are highly material-dependent, requiring detailed\nexploration of electronic, optical, excitonic, transport, and polaronic\ncharacteristics. However, the absence of comprehensive studies continues to\nimpede the rational design of high-performance materials. In this work, we\ninvestigate the excitonic and polaronic effects in A$_{n+1}$Hf$_n$S$_{3n+1}$ (A\n= Ca, Sr, and Ba; n = 1-3) RP phases, examining their relative stability and\noptoelectronic properties using several first-principles based methodologies\nwithin the framework of density functional theory and many-body perturbation\ntheory (GW and BSE). Our study suggests that these compounds are mechanically\nstable and feature G$_0$W$_0$@PBE bandgaps ranging from 1.43 to 2.14 eV, which\nare smaller than those of their bulk counterparts. BSE and model-BSE (mBSE)\ncalculations indicate that these RP phases display notable optical anisotropy,\nwith the exciton binding energy decreasing as the thickness of the perovskite\nlayer increases. In addition, intermediate to strong carrier-phonon scattering\nis observed in these compounds, confirmed through the Fr\\\"ohlich mechanism near\nroom temperature. Using the Feynman polaron model, the polaron parameters of\nthese RP phases are also computed, and it is found that charge-separated\npolaronic states are less stable than bound excitons. Finally, a significant\nincrease in electron mobilities is observed in RP phases compared to their bulk\ncounterparts. Overall, the insights gained from this study will enable the\nrational design of layered perovskite phases for applications in solar cells\nand other optoelectronic devices.",

This issue is further exacerbated\nby the fact that the MAR assumption may not always be realistic, introducing an\nadditional source of potential misspecification through the missingness\nmechanism. To address this, we propose a novel M-estimation procedure based on\nthe Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which is provably robust to both model\nmisspecification and deviations from the assumed missingness mechanism. Our\napproach offers strong theoretical guarantees and improved reliability in\ncomplex settings. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the\nestimator under missingness completely at random (MCAR), provide an efficient\nstochastic gradient descent algorithm, and derive error bounds that explicitly\nseparate the contributions of model misspecification and missingness bias.\nFurthermore, we analyze missing not at random (MNAR) scenarios where our\nestimator maintains controlled error, including a Huber setting where both the\nmissingness mechanism and the data model are contaminated. Our contributions\nrefine the understanding of the limitations of the MLE and provide a robust and\nprincipled alternative for handling missing data.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs), extensively pre-trained on large-scale datasets,\nhave become essential to foundation models, allowing excellent performance on\ndiverse downstream tasks with minimal adaptation. Consequently, there is\ngrowing interest in adapting pre-trained ViTs across various fields, including\nprivacy-sensitive domains where clients are often reluctant to share their\ndata. Existing adaptation methods typically require direct data access,\nrendering them infeasible under these constraints. A straightforward solution\nmay be sending the pre-trained ViT to clients for local adaptation, which poses\nissues of model intellectual property protection and incurs heavy client\ncomputation overhead. To address these issues, we propose a novel split\nadaptation (SA) method that enables effective downstream adaptation while\nprotecting data and models. SA, inspired by split learning (SL), segments the\npre-trained ViT into a frontend and a backend, with only the frontend shared\nwith the client for data representation extraction. But unlike regular SL, SA\nreplaces frontend parameters with low-bit quantized values, preventing direct\nexposure of the model. SA allows the client to add bi-level noise to the\nfrontend and the extracted data representations, ensuring data protection.\nAccordingly, SA incorporates data-level and model-level out-of-distribution\nenhancements to mitigate noise injection's impact on adaptation performance.\nOur SA focuses on the challenging few-shot adaptation and adopts patch\nretrieval augmentation for overfitting alleviation. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple datasets validate SA's superiority over state-of-the-art methods and\ndemonstrate its defense against advanced data reconstruction attacks while\npreventing model leakage with minimal computation cost on the client side.

    "abstract": "Multipole moments are related to the physical properties of compact\ngravitating objects; therefore, understanding their structure is useful in\naccessing the nature of compact objects. We look into gravitational wave\nobservables for black holes with charge, black holes on the brane, black holes\nwith torsion, and regular black holes to see if and how they are correlated to\nthe black hole hairs, which are related to the multipole moments. We find that\nthe gravitational wave observables are indeed related to the hairs of\nnon-vacuum spacetimes (for instance, charge $Q$ in the case of Kerr-Newman\nblack holes). We also constrain the black hole hairs for change in\ngravitational wave phasing to see if the dependencies are significant and can\nbe observed. The results from the analysis imply that the charge $Q$ in\nKerr-Newman black holes should be detectable; thus, we provide a constraint to\n$Q^2/M^2$ given the spin and mass ratio of an ideal EMRI system for which\nfuture detectors like LISA can detect the change in gravitational wave\nobservables. We also look into an analytical approach to find multipole moments\nof non-vacuum black hole spacetimes, mainly using the Improved Twist Vector\napproach for the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments and the Thorne formalism. The\nnecessary analytics are computed, and the multipole moments are obtained for\nvarious non-vacuum spacetimes.

    "abstract": "Finding Lyapunov functions to certify the stability of control systems has\nbeen an important topic for verifying safety-critical systems. Most existing\nmethods on finding Lyapunov functions require access to the dynamics of the\nsystem. Accurately describing the complete dynamics of a control system however\nremains highly challenging in practice. Latest trend of using learning-enabled\ncontrol systems further reduces the transparency. Hence, a method for black-box\nsystems would have much wider applications.\n  Our work stems from the recent idea of sampling and exploiting Lipschitz\ncontinuity to approximate the unknown dynamics. Given Lipschitz constants, one\ncan derive a non-statistical upper bounds on approximation errors; hence a\nstrong certification on this approximation can certify the unknown dynamics. We\nsignificantly improve this idea by directly approximating the Lie derivative of\nLyapunov functions instead of the dynamics. We propose a framework based on the\nlearner-verifier architecture from Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis\n(CEGIS). Our insight of combining regional verification conditions and\ncounterexample-guided sampling enables a guided search for samples to prove\nstability region-by-region. Our CEGIS algorithm further ensures termination.\n  Our numerical experiments suggest that it is possible to prove the stability\nof 2D and 3D systems with a few thousands of samples.

The intuition\nbehind it is that leveraging multiple modalities can uncover more intrinsic\nspoofing traces. However, this approach presents more risk of misalignment. We\nidentify two main types of misalignment: (1) \\textbf{Intra-domain modality\nmisalignment}, where the importance of each modality varies across different\nattacks. For instance, certain modalities (e.g., Depth) may be non-defensive\nagainst specific attacks (e.g., 3D mask), indicating that each modality has\nunique strengths and weaknesses in countering particular attacks. Consequently,\nsimple fusion strategies may fall short. (2) \\textbf{Inter-domain modality\nmisalignment}, where the introduction of additional modalities exacerbates\ndomain shifts, potentially overshadowing the benefits of complementary fusion.\nTo tackle (1), we propose a alignment module between modalities based on mutual\ninformation, which adaptively enhances favorable modalities while suppressing\nunfavorable ones. To address (2), we employ a dual alignment optimization\nmethod that aligns both sub-domain hyperplanes and modality angle margins,\nthereby mitigating domain gaps.

We argue that the embedding alignment is only at the\nsurface level of multimodal alignment. In this paper, we propose a grand\nchallenge of \\textit{language model mapping} (LMM), i.e., how to map the\nessence implied in the LM of one domain to the LM of another domain under the\nassumption that LMs of different modalities are tracking the same underlying\nphenomena. We first introduce a basic setup of LMM, highlighting the goal to\nunveil a deeper aspect of cross-modal alignment as well as to achieve more\nsample-efficiency learning. We then discuss why music is an ideal domain in\nwhich to conduct LMM research. After that, we connect LMM in music with a more\ngeneral and challenging scientific problem of \\textit{learning to take actions\nbased on both sensory input and abstract symbols}, and in the end, present an\nadvanced version of the challenge problem setup.",

The\nuse of graph autoencoders - with both encoder and decoder implemented as\nmessage passing networks - is intriguing due to their ability to generate\npermutation-invariant graph representations. However, this approach faces\ndifficulties because decoding a graph structure from a single vector is\nchallenging, and comparing input and output graphs requires an effective\npermutation-invariant similarity measure. As a result, many studies rely on\napproximate methods.\n  In this work, we explore the effect of graph matching precision on the\ntraining behavior and generation capabilities of a Variational Autoencoder\n(VAE). Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we propose a transformer-based message\npassing graph decoder as an alternative to a graph neural network decoder, that\nis more robust and expressive by leveraging global attention mechanisms.

    "abstract": "The electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is crucial for cosmology and particle\nphysics, with a profound impact on electroweak baryogenesis, symmetry breaking,\nand gravitational wave (GW) signals. However, many studies overlook key aspects\nof EWPT dynamics, leading to misidentified patterns and overestimated GW\nsignals. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive framework for\nanalyzing EWPTs, focusing on the vacuum's thermal history and dynamics from\nbubble nucleation to percolation. Using the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd real scalar\nsinglet model, we demonstrate the occurrence of spontaneous $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry breaking in the high-temperature vacuum, leading to diverse EWPT\nprocesses, including multi-step transitions and inverse symmetry breaking. We\nidentify four distinct EWPT patterns, each characterized by unique\nsymmetry-breaking mechanisms and associated with bubbles exhibiting distinct\nfield configurations, which can be analyzed using a formalism based on energy\ndensity distributions developed here. A key finding is that bubble nucleation\nfails in extremely strong phase transitions (PTs) with low nucleation rates, or\nin ultra-fast PTs involving inverse $s$-bubbles that collapse instantly upon\nformation, both of which lead to false vacuum trapping and the absence of\nobservable GW signals. In first-order PTs where nucleation succeeds, stronger\ntransitions occur later in the universe's evolution, while weaker transitions\nproceed more rapidly. Multi-step transitions involving (inverse) $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry breaking give rise to complex transition sequences and exotic bubble\ndynamics, such as sequential nucleation or the coexistence of bubbles from\ndifferent vacua -- phenomena with significant implications for GW spectra, dark\nmatter, and baryogenesis.

Significant computational gains were\nachieved using the new PIBO-MESA approach, which is 45% faster than existing\nstochastic methods, such as the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II\n(NSGA-II). The FEM results confirm that the new design optimization process and\nkeystone shaped wires lead to a higher SFF (i.e. by 20%) and electromagnetic\nimprovements (e.g. maximum torque by 12%) with similar resistivity.

    "abstract": "Transmit beamforming is one of the key techniques used in the existing IEEE\n802.11 WiFi standards and future generations such as 11be and 11bn, a.k.a.,\nultra high reliability (UHR). The paper gives an overview of the current\nstandardization activities regarding the artificial intelligence and machine\nlearning (AIML) enabled beamforming channel state information (CSI) feedback\ncompression technique, defined by the 802.11 AIML topic interest group (TIG).\nTwo key challenges the AIML TIG is going to tackle in the future beamforming\nstandards and four defined key performance indicators (KPIs) for the AIML\nenabled schemes are discussed in the paper. The two challenges are the CSI\nfeedback overhead and the compression complexity, and the four KPIs are\nfeedback overhead, AIML model sharing overhead, packet error rate and\ncomplexity. Moreover, the paper presents a couple of AIML enabled compression\nschemes accepted by the TIG, such as the K-means and autoencoder based schemes,\nand uses simulated and analyzed data to explain how these schemes are designed\naccording to the KPIs. Finally, future research directions are indicated for\nencouraging more researchers and engineers to contribute to this technique and\nthe standardization of the next generation WiFi beamforming.",

However, due to absence of large and high-quality high dynamic\nrange (HDR) video training data, LVC on HDR video is still unexplored. In this\npaper, we are the first to collect a large-scale HDR video benchmark dataset,\nnamed HDRVD2K, featuring huge quantity, diverse scenes and multiple motion\ntypes. HDRVD2K fills gaps of video training data and facilitate the development\nof LVC on HDR videos. Based on HDRVD2K, we further propose the first learned\nbit-depth scalable video compression (LBSVC) network for HDR videos by\neffectively exploiting bit-depth redundancy between videos of multiple dynamic\nranges. To achieve this, we first propose a compression-friendly bit-depth\nenhancement module (BEM) to effectively predict original HDR videos based on\ncompressed tone-mapped low dynamic range (LDR) videos and dynamic range prior,\ninstead of reducing redundancy only through spatio-temporal predictions. Our\nmethod greatly improves the reconstruction quality and compression performance\non HDR videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HDRVD2K\non learned HDR video compression and great compression performance of our\nproposed LBSVC network.

Federated Learning\noffers a privacy preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training\nacross decentralized devices without centralizing sensitive data. However,\nstatistical heterogeneity from non-independent and identically distributed\ndatasets and system heterogeneity due to client dropouts particularly those\nwith monopolistic classes severely degrade the global model's performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose the Asynchronous Personalized Federated\nLearning framework, which empowers clients to develop personalized models using\na server side semantic generator. This generator, trained via data free\nknowledge transfer under global model supervision, enhances client data\ndiversity by producing both seen and unseen samples, the latter enabled by\nZero-Shot Learning to mitigate dropout-induced data loss. To counter the risks\nof synthetic data impairing training, we introduce a decoupled model\ninterpolation method, ensuring robust personalization.

However, a large batch size leads to significant degradation in\nsearch accuracy.\n  This work aims to improve the performance of graph-based ANNS systems in\nsmall-batch update scenarios, while maintaining high search efficiency and\naccuracy. We identify two key issues in existing batch update systems for\nsmall-batch updates. First, the system needs to scan the entire index file to\nidentify and update the affected vertices, resulting in excessive unnecessary\nI/O. Second, updating the affected vertices introduces many new neighbors,\nfrequently triggering neighbor pruning. To address these issues, we propose a\ntopology-aware localized update strategy for graph-based ANN index. We\nintroduce a lightweight index topology to identify affected vertices\nefficiently and employ a localized update strategy that modifies only the\naffected vertices in the index file. To mitigate frequent heavy neighbor\npruning, we propose a similar neighbor replacement strategy, which connects the\naffected vertices to only a small number (typically one) of the most similar\noutgoing neighbors of the deleted vertex during repair. Based on extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets, our update strategy achieves 2.47X-6.45X\nhigher update throughput than the state-of-the-art system FreshDiskANN while\nmaintaining high search efficiency and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Floorplan reconstruction provides structural priors essential for reliable\nindoor robot navigation and high-level scene understanding. However, existing\napproaches either require time-consuming offline processing with a complete\nmap, or rely on expensive sensors and substantial computational resources. To\naddress the problems, we propose Floorplan-SLAM, which incorporates floorplan\nreconstruction tightly into a multi-session SLAM system by seamlessly\ninteracting with plane extraction, pose estimation, and back-end optimization,\nachieving real-time, high-accuracy, and long-term floorplan reconstruction\nusing only a stereo camera. Specifically, we present a robust plane extraction\nalgorithm that operates in a compact plane parameter space and leverages\nspatially complementary features to accurately detect planar structures, even\nin weakly textured scenes. Furthermore, we propose a floorplan reconstruction\nmodule tightly coupled with the SLAM system, which uses continuously optimized\nplane landmarks and poses to formulate and solve a novel optimization problem,\nthereby enabling real-time incremental floorplan reconstruction. Note that by\nleveraging the map merging capability of multi-session SLAM, our method\nsupports long-term floorplan reconstruction across multiple sessions without\nredundant data collection. Experiments on the VECtor and the self-collected\ndatasets indicate that Floorplan-SLAM significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of plane extraction robustness, pose\nestimation accuracy, and floorplan reconstruction fidelity and speed, achieving\nreal-time performance at 25-45 FPS without GPU acceleration, which reduces the\nfloorplan reconstruction time for a 1000 square meters scene from over 10 hours\nto just 9.44 minutes.",

However, serving long-context LLMs comes with\nsignificant inference costs due to the high memory overhead of the key-value\n(KV) cache. Existing work leverages dynamic sparse attention algorithms (DSAes)\nto mitigate the KV cache overhead, but these algorithms rely on top-$k$ KV\ncache selection, which results in a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.\nA larger $k$ improves accuracy but decreases efficiency, while a smaller $k$\nboosts efficiency but compromises accuracy.

The PSA algorithm adaptively adjusts the KV cache\nbudget of different tokens and layers according to their real attention weight\ndistributions, rather than relying on a fixed budget $k$. This enables high\naccuracy while minimizing KV cache usage. To further enhance execution\nefficiency, we introduce a pipelined iteration scheme that reduces CPU-GPU\ninterleaving and synchronization overhead during PSA computation.

These attacks have a varied level of potency and can be\nimplemented in both white box and black box approaches. Practical attacks\ninclude methods to manipulate the physical world and enforce adversarial\nbehaviour by the corresponding target neural network models. Multiple different\napproaches to mitigate different kinds of such attacks are available in the\nliterature, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this survey, we\npresent a comprehensive systematization of knowledge on adversarial defenses,\nfocusing on two key computer vision tasks: image classification and object\ndetection.

In addition, we provide a schematic\nrepresentation of these categories within the context of the overall machine\nlearning pipeline, facilitating clearer understanding and benchmarking of\ndefenses. Furthermore, we map these defenses to the types of adversarial\nattacks and datasets where they are most effective, offering practical insights\nfor researchers and practitioners. This study is necessary for understanding\nthe scope of how the available defenses are able to address the adversarial\nthreats, and their shortcomings as well, which is necessary for driving the\nresearch in this area in the most appropriate direction, with the aim of\nbuilding trustworthy AI systems for regular practical use-cases.",

However, recent studies have\nrevealed that these intermediate features may not sufficiently preserve\nprivacy, as information can be leaked and raw data can be reconstructed via\nmodel inversion attacks (MIAs). Obfuscation-based methods, such as noise\ncorruption, adversarial representation learning, and information filters,\nenhance the inversion robustness by obfuscating the task-irrelevant redundancy\nempirically. However, methods for quantifying such redundancy remain elusive,\nand the explicit mathematical relation between this redundancy minimization and\ninversion robustness enhancement has not yet been established. To address that,\nthis work first theoretically proves that the conditional entropy of inputs\ngiven intermediate features provides a guaranteed lower bound on the\nreconstruction mean square error (MSE) under any MIA.

Existing\ntext-to-HOI synthesis methods mainly deploy a direct mapping from texts to\nobject-specific 3D body motions, which may encounter a performance bottleneck\nsince the huge cross-modality gap. In this paper, we observe that those HOI\nsamples with the same interaction intention toward different targets, e.g.,\n\"lift a chair\" and \"lift a cup\", always encapsulate similar action-specific\nbody motion patterns while characterizing different object-specific interaction\nstyles. Thus, learning effective action-specific motion priors and\nobject-specific interaction priors is crucial for a text-to-HOI model and\ndominates its performances on text-HOI semantic consistency and body-object\ninteraction realism. In light of this, we propose a novel body pose generation\nstrategy for the text-to-HOI task: infer object-agnostic canonical body action\nfirst and then enrich object-specific interaction styles. Specifically, the\nfirst canonical body action inference stage focuses on learning intra-class\nshareable body motion priors and mapping given text-based semantics to\naction-specific canonical 3D body motions. Then, in the object-specific\ninteraction inference stage, we focus on object affordance learning and enrich\nobject-specific interaction styles on an inferred action-specific body motion\nbasis. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed text-to-HOI synthesis\nsystem significantly outperforms other SOTA methods on three large-scale\ndatasets with better semantic consistency and interaction realism performances.",

A challenge in federated learning is\nmanaging heterogeneous data distributions across clients, which can hinder\nmodel convergence and performance due to the need for the global model to\ngeneralize well across diverse local datasets. We propose to use local\ncharacteristic statistics, by which we mean some statistical properties\ncalculated independently by each client using only their local training\ndataset. These statistics, such as means, covariances, and higher moments, are\nused to capture the characteristics of the local data distribution. They are\nnot shared with other clients or a central node. During training, these local\nstatistics help the model learn how to condition on the local data\ndistribution, and during inference, they guide the client's predictions.

This study is the\nfirst to explore physical adversarial attacks on event-driven pedestrian\ndetectors, specifically investigating whether certain clothing patterns worn by\npedestrians can cause these detectors to fail, effectively rendering them\nunable to detect the person. To address this, we developed an end-to-end\nadversarial framework in the digital domain, framing the design of adversarial\nclothing textures as a 2D texture optimization problem. By crafting an\neffective adversarial loss function, the framework iteratively generates\noptimal textures through backpropagation.

Using high-resolution\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations that incorporate gas dynamics and star\nformation, we quantify the rate at which these effects drive non-conservation\nof the actions of young stars from Myr to Gyr timescales. We find that action\nevolution is well described as a logarithmic random walk, with vertical action\nevolving more rapidly than radial action; the diffusion rate associated with\nthis random walk is weakly dependent on the stellar birth environment and\nscales approximately linearly with the galactic orbital frequency at a star's\nposition.

However, strategically serving online and offline tasks through a\npreemption mechanism fails to fully leverage the flexibility of offline tasks\nand suffers from KV cache recomputation and irregular workloads.\n  In this paper, we introduce Echo, a collaborative online-offline task serving\nsystem, including a scheduler, a KV cache manager, and estimation toolkits. The\nscheduler and KV cache manager work tightly to maximize the throughput of\noffline tasks, while the estimator further predicts execution time to ensure\nonline task SLOs. The scheduler leverages the batch information of last\niteration to reduce the search space for finding the optimal schedule. The KV\ncache manager sets the priority of the KV cache based on the type of tasks and\nthe opportunity of prefix sharing to reduce the recomputation. Finally, the\nestimation toolkits predict the execution time, future memory consumption, and\nthe throughput of offline tasks to guide the scheduler, KV cache manager, and\nthe system deployer. Evaluation based on real-world workloads demonstrates that\nEcho can increase offline task throughput by up to $3.3\\times$, while\nsatisfying online task SLOs.",

This study investigates the impact of three\ndata augmentation strategies including Stable Diffusion (SD), Flow Matching\n(FM), and Conventional Augmentation (CA), on enhancing the performance of a\nResNet18 classifier.\n  Methods: Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,954 patients across nine\nmedical centers were classified into four categories: Diffuse Goiter (DG),\nNodular Goiter (NG), Normal (NL), and Thyroiditis (TI). Data augmentation was\nperformed using various SD and FM models, resulting in 18 distinct augmentation\nscenarios.

SD1, combining\nimage and prompt inputs in the inference process, was the most effective SD\nvariant, suggesting that physician-generated prompts provide meaningful\nclinical context.

First, existing methods inadequately fuse information from\ndifferent modalities and cannot effectively utilize modality-unique features.\nSecond, most multi-modal methods focus on video and text modalities, neglecting\nthe audio modality, despite the fact that audio information can be very useful\nin certain types of videos.

CFSum\nexploits video, text, and audio modal features as input, and incorporates a\ntwo-stage transformer-based feature fusion framework to fully utilize\nmodality-unique information. In the first stage, multi-modal features are fused\nsimultaneously to perform initial coarse-grained feature fusion, then, in the\nsecond stage, video and audio features are explicitly attended with the text\nrepresentation yielding more fine-grained information interaction. The CFSum\narchitecture gives equal importance to each modality, ensuring that each modal\nfeature interacts deeply with the other modalities.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising 3D\nrepresentation. Much research has been focused on reducing its storage\nrequirements and memory footprint. However, the needs to compress and transmit\nthe 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application\ncalls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and\nentropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely\nunexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned\nimage compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra\ncorrelation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work,\ntermed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their\nrate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented\naccording to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to\ncapture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial\nautoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving\nas the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to\nleverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our\nCAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively\nskips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact\non the rendering quality. When trained end-to-end to strike a good\nrate-distortion trade-off, our CAT-3DGS achieves the state-of-the-art\ncompression performance on the commonly used real-world datasets.",

It includes a three-point quark-gluon vertex which obscures the\nprecise disentangled manner in which spin and momentum are interchanged during\nthese interactions. An unambiguous understanding of this interchange is\ninsightful for efficiently extracting physically relevant information from\nvarious Green's functions. To separate the scalar and spin degrees of freedom\nand gain physical insight from the outset, we examine the quark-gluon vertex\nusing the less commonly employed second-order formalism of QCD. We compute this\noff-shell vertex in arbitrary space-time dimensions and covariant gauges by\nusing scalar integrals with shifted dimensions, which include higher powers of\nthe propagators, within a combined first- and second-order formalism. This\napproach naturally identifies the transverse components of the quark-gluon\nvertex, even before evaluating the tensor Feynman integrals. We also compute\nthe on-shell version of this vertex using exclusively the second-order\nformalism, facilitating a precise identification of spin and momentum\ninterchange. Through analyzing the Pauli form factor at $k^2=0$ (where $k$\nrepresents the momentum of the external gluon), we find that only a specific\nset of second-order Feynman diagrams are relevant for calculating the\nelectromagnetic and chromomagnetic dipole moments. These diagrams represent\nquantum processes in which the spin of the incoming quark changes only once due\nto interactions with the virtual gluons that form the quark-gluon vertex. All\nother interactions involve only momentum interchange (scalar interactions). Our\nresults are in complete agreement with those obtained from the first-order\nformalism.",

To address\nthis issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter\nwith an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator.\nFurthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure\nto ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented\nKalman Filter (InNKF). The proposed algorithm offers improved state estimation\nperformance by combining the strengths of model-based and learning-based\napproaches.

However, the multiple\nsampling steps required for action generation significantly harm real-time\ninference efficiency, which limits their applicability in real-time\ndecision-making scenarios. Existing acceleration techniques either require\nretraining or degrade performance under low sampling steps. Here we propose\nFalcon, which mitigates this speed-performance trade-off and achieves further\nacceleration. The core insight is that visuomotor tasks exhibit sequential\ndependencies between actions. Falcon leverages this by reusing partially\ndenoised actions from historical information rather than sampling from Gaussian\nnoise at each step. By integrating current observations, Falcon reduces\nsampling steps while preserving performance. Importantly, Falcon is a\ntraining-free algorithm that can be applied as a plug-in to further improve\ndecision efficiency on top of existing acceleration techniques. We validated\nFalcon in 48 simulated environments and 2 real-world robot experiments.\ndemonstrating a 2-7x speedup with negligible performance degradation, offering\na promising direction for efficient visuomotor policy design.",

    "abstract": "How human cognitive abilities are formed has long captivated researchers.\nHowever, a significant challenge lies in developing meaningful methods to\nmeasure these complex processes. With the advent of large language models\n(LLMs), which now rival human capabilities in various domains, we are presented\nwith a unique testbed to investigate human cognition through a new lens. Among\nthe many facets of cognition, one particularly crucial aspect is the concept of\nsemantic size, the perceived magnitude of both abstract and concrete words or\nconcepts. This study seeks to investigate whether LLMs exhibit similar\ntendencies in understanding semantic size, thereby providing insights into the\nunderlying mechanisms of human cognition. We begin by exploring metaphorical\nreasoning, comparing how LLMs and humans associate abstract words with concrete\nobjects of varying sizes. Next, we examine LLMs' internal representations to\nevaluate their alignment with human cognitive processes. Our findings reveal\nthat multi-modal training is crucial for LLMs to achieve more human-like\nunderstanding, suggesting that real-world, multi-modal experiences are\nsimilarly vital for human cognitive development. Lastly, we examine whether\nLLMs are influenced by attention-grabbing headlines with larger semantic sizes\nin a real-world web shopping scenario. The results show that multi-modal LLMs\nare more emotionally engaged in decision-making, but this also introduces\npotential biases, such as the risk of manipulation through clickbait headlines.\nUltimately, this study offers a novel perspective on how LLMs interpret and\ninternalize language, from the smallest concrete objects to the most profound\nabstract concepts like love.

    "abstract": "Multilingual large language models (LLMs) face an often-overlooked challenge\nstemming from intrinsic semantic differences across languages. Linguistic\ndivergence can sometimes lead to cross-linguistic disagreements--disagreements\npurely due to semantic differences about a relevant concept. This paper\nidentifies such disagreements as conflicts between two fundamental alignment\nnorms in multilingual LLMs: cross-linguistic consistency (CL-consistency),\nwhich seeks universal concepts across languages, and consistency with folk\njudgments (Folk-consistency), which respects language-specific semantic norms.\nThrough examining responses of conversational multilingual AIs in English and\nJapanese with the cases used in philosophy (cases of knowledge-how\nattributions), this study demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs provide\ndivergent and internally inconsistent responses. Such findings reveal a novel\nqualitative limitation in crosslingual knowledge transfer, or conceptual\ncrosslingual knowledge barriers, challenging the assumption that universal\nrepresentations and cross-linguistic transfer capabilities are inherently\ndesirable. Moreover, they reveal conflicts of alignment policies of their\ndevelopers, highlighting critical normative questions for LLM researchers and\ndevelopers. The implications extend beyond technical alignment challenges,\nraising normative, moral-political, and metaphysical questions about the ideals\nunderlying AI development--questions that are shared with philosophers and\ncognitive scientists but for which no one yet has definitive answers, inviting\na multidisciplinary approach to balance the practical benefits of\ncross-linguistic consistency and respect for linguistic diversity.",

    "abstract": "While many advanced statistical methods for the design of experiments exist,\nit is still typical for physical experiments to be performed adaptively based\non human intuition. As a consequence, experimental resources are wasted on\nsub-optimal experimental designs. Conversely, in the simulation-based design\ncommunity, Bayesian optimization (BO) is often used to adaptively and\nefficiently identify the global optimum of a response surface. However,\nadopting these methods directly for the optimization of physical experiments is\nproblematic due to the existence of experimental noise and the typically more\nstringent constraints on the experimental budget. Consequently, many\nsimplifying assumptions need to be made in the BO framework, and it is\ncurrently not fully understood how these assumptions influence the performance\nof the method and the optimality of the final design. In this paper, we present\nan experimental study to investigate the influence of the controllable (e.g.,\nnumber of samples, acquisition function, and covariance function) and noise\nfactors (e.g., problem dimensionality, experimental noise magnitude, and\nexperimental noise form) on the efficiency of the BO framework. The findings in\nthis study include, that the Mat\\'{e}r covariance function shows superior\nperformance over all test problems and that the available experimental budget\nis most consequential when selecting the other settings of the BO scheme.

In this work, we integrate DeepONets with RaNNs to propose\nRaNN-DeepONets, a hybrid architecture designed to balance accuracy and\nefficiency. Furthermore, to mitigate the need for extensive data preparation,\nwe introduce the concept of physics-informed RaNN-DeepONets. Instead of relying\non data generated through other time-consuming numerical methods, we\nincorporate PDE information directly into the training process. We evaluate the\nproposed model on three benchmark PDE problems: diffusion-reaction dynamics,\nBurgers' equation, and the Darcy flow problem.

    "abstract": "Signal processing makes extensive use of point estimators and accompanying\nerror bounds. These work well up until the likelihood function has two or more\nhigh peaks. When it is important for an estimator to remain reliable, it\nbecomes necessary to consider alternatives, such as set estimators. An obvious\nfirst choice might be confidence intervals or confidence regions, but there can\nbe difficulties in computing and interpreting them (and sometimes they might\nstill be blind to multiple peaks in the likelihood). Bayesians seize on this to\nargue for replacing confidence regions with credible regions. Yet Bayesian\nstatistics require a prior, which is not always a natural part of the problem\nformulation. This paper demonstrates how a re-interpretation of the prior as a\nweighting function makes an otherwise Bayesian estimator meaningful in the\nfrequentist context. The weighting function interpretation also serves as a\nreminder that an estimator should always be designed in the context of its\nintended application; unlike a prior which ostensibly depends on prior\nknowledge, a weighting function depends on the intended application. This paper\nuses the time-of-arrival (TOA) problem to illustrate all these points. It also\nderives a basic theory of region-based estimators distinct from confidence\nregions.",

Each\n'player' represents two active decision makers, namely a scheduler and a remote\ncontroller, which cooperate to optimize over a global objective while competing\nwith the other player. Each player's scheduler can only intermittently relay\nstate information to its respective controller due to associated\ncost/constraint to communication. The scheduler's policy determines the\ninformation structure at the controller, thereby affecting the quality of the\ncontrol inputs. Consequently, it leads to the classical communication-control\ntrade-off problem. A high communication frequency improves the control\nperformance of the player on account of a higher communication cost, and vice\nversa. Under suitable information structures of the players, we first compute\nthe Nash controller policies for both players in terms of the conditional\nestimate of the state. Consequently, we reformulate the problem of computing\nNash scheduler policies (within a class of parametrized randomized policies)\ninto solving for the steady-state solution of a generalized Sylvester equation.\nSince the above-mentioned reformulation involves infinite sum of powers of the\npolicy parameters, we provide a projected gradient descent-based algorithm to\nnumerically compute a Nash equilibrium using a truncated polynomial\napproximation.

However, they are trained on static corpora and their\nknowledge can become outdated quickly in the fast-changing world. This\nmotivates the development of knowledge editing methods designed to update\ncertain knowledge in LLMs without changing unrelated others. To make selective\nedits, previous efforts often sought to update a small amount of parameters in\nsome specific layer(s) of a LLM. Nonetheless, in challenging scenarios, they\nstill fall short in making successful edits while preserving knowledge\nirrelevant to the updates simultaneously, resulting in a notable\nediting-locality trade-off. In this work, we question if the trade-offs are\ncaused by the fact that parameter-based updates have a global effect, i.e.,\nedited parameters affect all inputs indiscriminately. In light of this, we\nexplore the feasibility of representation fine-tuning, which applied some\nlinear update to a few representations in a learned subspace, for knowledge\nediting. While being effective to enhance an LLM's general ability as\ndemonstrated in the previous work, we theoretically show that this linear\nupdate imposes a tension in editing-locality trade-off. Subsequently, BaFT is\nproposed to break the linearity. BaFT computes a weight for each basis that\nspans a dimension of the subspace based on the input representation. This\ninput-dependent weighting mechanism allows BaFT to manage different types of\nknowledge in an adaptive way, thereby achieving a better editing-locality\ntrade-off. Experiments on three LLMs with five editing benchmarks in diverse\nscenarios show the superiority of our method.",

While most\nprogress in this area has been driven by variants of deep neural networks such\nas the Deep Operator Network and Fourier Neural Operator, the theoretical\nguarantees are often in the form of a universal approximation property.\nHowever, the existence theorems do not guarantee that an accurate operator\nnetwork is obtainable in practice. Motivated by the recent kernel-based\noperator learning framework, we propose a random feature operator learning\nmethod with theoretical guarantees and error bounds. The random feature method\ncan be viewed as a randomized approximation of a kernel method, which\nsignificantly reduces the computation requirements for training. We provide a\ngeneralization error analysis for our proposed random feature operator learning\nmethod along with comprehensive numerical results. Compared to kernel-based\nmethod and neural network methods, the proposed method can obtain similar or\nbetter test errors across benchmarks examples with significantly reduced\ntraining times. An additional advantages it that our implementation is simple\nand does require costly computational resources, such as GPU.",

    "abstract": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a foundational technique in machine\nlearning for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional datasets. However,\nPCA could lead to biased outcomes that disadvantage certain subgroups of the\nunderlying datasets. To address the bias issue, a Fair PCA (FPCA) model was\nintroduced by Samadi et al. (2018) for equalizing the reconstruction loss\nbetween subgroups. The semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based approach proposed by\nSamadi et al. (2018) is computationally expensive even for suboptimal\nsolutions. To improve efficiency, several alternative variants of the FPCA\nmodel have been developed. These variants often shift the focus away from\nequalizing the reconstruction loss. In this paper, we identify a hidden\nconvexity in the FPCA model and introduce an algorithm for convex optimization\nvia eigenvalue optimization. Our approach achieves the desired fairness in\nreconstruction loss without sacrificing performance. As demonstrated in\nreal-world datasets, the proposed FPCA algorithm runs $8\\times$ faster than the\nSDR-based algorithm, and only at most 85% slower than the standard PCA.",

In this paper, we propose a novel\nenergy-efficient ISCC framework for AI inference at resource-constrained edge\ndevices, where adjustable split inference, model pruning, and feature\nquantization are jointly designed to adapt to diverse task requirements. A\njoint resource allocation design problem for the proposed ISCC framework is\nformulated to minimize the energy consumption under stringent inference\naccuracy and latency constraints. To address the challenge of characterizing\ninference accuracy, we derive an explicit approximation for it by analyzing the\nimpact of sensing, communication, and computation processes on the inference\nperformance. Building upon the analytical results, we propose an iterative\nalgorithm employing alternating optimization to solve the resource allocation\nproblem. In each subproblem, the optimal solutions are available by\nrespectively applying a golden section search method and checking the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, thereby ensuring the convergence to a\nlocal optimum of the original problem.

Policies without passivity guarantees can result in system\ninstability, posing risks to robots, their environments, and human operators.\nIn this work, we investigate the limitations of traditional RL policies when\ndeployed in contact-rich tasks and explore the combination of energy-based\npassive control with safe RL in both training and deployment to answer these\nchallenges. Firstly, we reveal the discovery that standard RL policy does not\nsatisfy stability in contact-rich scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a\n\\textit{passivity-aware} RL policy training with energy-based constraints in\nour safe RL formulation. Lastly, a passivity filter is exerted on the policy\noutput for \\textit{passivity-ensured} control during deployment. We conduct\ncomparative studies on a contact-rich robotic maze exploration task, evaluating\nthe effects of learning passivity-aware policies and the importance of\npassivity-ensured control. The experiments demonstrate that a\npassivity-agnostic RL policy easily violates energy constraints in deployment,\neven though it achieves high task completion in training. The results show that\nour proposed approach guarantees control stability through passivity filtering\nand improves the energy efficiency through passivity-aware training.

Although the\nfixed point loci of these symmetries are projective special K\\\"ahler, we show\nthat a simultaneous stabilisation of multiple moduli on the intersection of\nthese loci need not be guaranteed without the existence of symmetries between\nthem. We furthermore consider F-theory vacua along conifolds and use mirror\nsymmetry to perform a complete analysis of the two-parameter moduli space of an\nelliptic Calabi-Yau four-fold fibred over $\\mathbb{P}^3$. We use the relation\nbetween Calabi-Yau period geometries in various dimensions and, in particular,\nthe fact that the antisymmetric products of one-parameter Calabi-Yau three-fold\noperators yield four-fold operators to establish pairs of flux vacua on the\nmoduli spaces of the three- and four-fold compactifications. We give a\nsplitting of the period matrix into a semisimple and nilpotent part by\nutilising the Frobenius structure. This helps bringing $\\epsilon$-dimensional\nregulated integration by parts relations between Feynman integrals into\n$\\epsilon$-factorised form and solve them by iterated integrals of the periods.",

    "abstract": "Software signing is the most robust method for ensuring the integrity and\nauthenticity of components in a software supply chain. Traditional signing\ntools burdened practitioners with key management and signer identification,\ncreating both usability challenges and security risks. A new class of\nnext-generation signing tools has automated many of these concerns, but little\nis known about their usability and its effect on adoption and effectiveness in\npractice. A usability evaluation can clarify the extent to which\nnext-generation designs succeed and highlight priorities for improvement.\n  To fill this gap, we conducted a usability study of Sigstore, a pioneering\nand widely adopted exemplar of next-generation signing. Through interviews with\n17 industry experts, we examined (1) the problems and advantages associated\nwith practitioners' tooling choices, (2) how and why their signing-tool usage\nhas evolved over time, and (3) the contexts that cause usability concerns. Our\nfindings illuminate the usability factors of next-generation signing tools and\nyield recommendations for toolmakers, adopting organizations, and the research\ncommunity. Notably, components of next-generation tooling exhibit different\nlevels of maturity and readiness for adoption, and integration flexibility is a\ncommon pain point, but potentially mitigable through plugins and APIs.

However, their widespread adoption in medicine, particularly in\nhealthcare, is hindered by their propensity to generate false or misleading\noutputs, known as hallucinations. In high-stakes domains such as women's health\n(obstetrics & gynaecology), where errors in clinical reasoning can have\nprofound consequences for maternal and neonatal outcomes, ensuring the\nreliability of AI-generated responses is critical. Traditional methods for\nquantifying uncertainty, such as perplexity, fail to capture meaning-level\ninconsistencies that lead to misinformation. Here, we evaluate semantic entropy\n(SE), a novel uncertainty metric that assesses meaning-level variation, to\ndetect hallucinations in AI-generated medical content. Using a clinically\nvalidated dataset derived from UK RCOG MRCOG examinations, we compared SE with\nperplexity in identifying uncertain responses. SE demonstrated superior\nperformance, achieving an AUROC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.75-0.78), compared to 0.62\n(0.60-0.65) for perplexity. Clinical expert validation further confirmed its\neffectiveness, with SE achieving near-perfect uncertainty discrimination\n(AUROC: 0.97). While semantic clustering was successful in only 30% of cases,\nSE remains a valuable tool for improving AI safety in women's health. These\nfindings suggest that SE could enable more reliable AI integration into\nclinical practice, particularly in resource-limited settings where LLMs could\naugment care.

    "abstract": "The black-box nature of neural networks limits the ability to encode or\nimpose specific structural relationships between inputs and outputs. While\nvarious studies have introduced architectures that ensure the network's output\nadheres to a particular form in relation to certain inputs, the majority of\nthese approaches impose constraints on only a single set of inputs. This paper\nintroduces a novel neural network architecture, termed the Input Specific\nNeural Network (ISNN), which extends this concept by allowing scalar-valued\noutputs to be subject to multiple constraints. Specifically, the ISNN can\nenforce convexity in some inputs, non-decreasing monotonicity combined with\nconvexity with respect to others, and simple non-decreasing monotonicity or\narbitrary relationships with additional inputs. The paper presents two distinct\nISNN architectures, along with equations for the first and second derivatives\nof the output with respect to the inputs. These networks are broadly\napplicable.\n  In this work, we restrict their usage to solving problems in computational\nmechanics. In particular, we show how they can be effectively applied to\nfitting data-driven constitutive models. We then embed our trained data-driven\nconstitutive laws into a finite element solver where significant time savings\ncan be achieved by using explicit manual differentiation using the derived\nequations as opposed to automatic differentiation. We also show how ISNNs can\nbe used to learn structural relationships between inputs and outputs via a\nbinary gating mechanism. Particularly, ISNNs are employed to model an\nanisotropic free energy potential to get the homogenized macroscopic response\nin a decoupled multiscale setting, where the network learns whether or not the\npotential should be modeled as polyconvex, and retains only the relevant layers\nwhile using the minimum number of inputs.",

To answer\nthis question, we leverage fine-grained conflict data, which we map to climate,\ngeography, infrastructure, economics, raw demographics, and demographic\ncomposition in Africa. With an unsupervised learning model, we find three\noverarching conflict types representing ``major unrest,'' ``local conflict,''\nand ``sporadic and spillover events.'' Major unrest predominantly propagates\naround densely populated areas with well-developed infrastructure and flat,\nriparian geography. Local conflicts are in regions of median population\ndensity, are diverse socio-economically and geographically, and are often\nconfined within country borders. Finally, sporadic and spillover conflicts\nremain small, often in low population density areas, with little infrastructure\nand poor economic conditions. The three types stratify into a hierarchy of\nfactors that highlights population, infrastructure, economics, and geography,\nrespectively, as the most discriminative indicators. Specifying conflict type\nnegatively impacts the predictability of conflict intensity such as fatalities,\nconflict duration, and other measures of conflict size.

For\nCartesian geometries in one dimension, SI is parallel over the number of angles\nbut not spatial cells; this is a disadvantage for many-core compute\narchitectures like graphics processing units. One-cell inversion (OCI) is a\nclass of alternative iterative methods that allow space-parallel radiation\ntransport on heterogeneous compute architectures. For OCI, previous studies\nhave shown that, in steady-state computations, spectral radius tends to unity\nwhen cells are optically thin regardless of the scattering ratio. In this work,\nwe analyze how the convergence rate of an OCI scheme behaves when used for\ntime-dependent neutron transport computations. We derive a second-order\nspace-time discretization method from the simple corner balance and multiple\nbalance time discretization schemes and show via Fourier analysis that it is\nunconditionally stable through time. Then, we derive and numerically solve the\nFourier systems for both OCI and SI splittings of our discretization, showing\nthat small mean-free times improve the spectral radius of OCI more than SI, and\nthat spectral radius for OCI tends to zero as mean free time gets smaller. We\nextend both solvers to be energy dependent (using the multigroup assumption)\nand implement on an AMD MI250X using vendor-supplied batched LAPACK solvers.\nSmaller time steps improve the relative performance of OCI over SI, and, even\nwhen OCI requires more iterations to converge a problem, those iterations can\nbe done much faster on a GPU.

Due to their intricacy, miniature scenes with objects\nsized in millimeters are difficult to reconstruct, yet miniatures are common in\nlife and their 3D digitalization is desirable. We design a catadioptric imaging\nsystem with a single camera and eight pairs of planar mirrors for snapshot 3D\nreconstruction from a dollhouse perspective. We place paired mirrors on nested\npyramid surfaces for capturing surrounding multi-view images in a single shot.\nOur mirror design is customizable based on the size of the scene for optimized\nview coverage. We use the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation for scene\nreconstruction and novel view synthesis. We overcome the challenge posed by our\nsparse view input by integrating visual hull-derived depth constraint. Our\nmethod demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a variety of synthetic and\nreal miniature scenes.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for wireless connectivity, ensuring the efficient\ncoexistence of multiple radio access technologies in shared unlicensed spectrum\nhas become an important issue. This paper focuses on optimizing Medium Access\nControl (MAC) parameters to enhance the coexistence of 5G New Radio in\nUnlicensed Spectrum (NR-U) and Wi-Fi networks operating in unlicensed spectrum\nwith multiple priority classes of traffic that may have varying\nquality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In this context, we tackle the\ncoexistence parameter management problem by introducing a QoS-aware\nState-Augmented Learnable (QaSAL) framework, designed to improve network\nperformance under various traffic conditions. Our approach augments the state\nrepresentation with constraint information, enabling dynamic policy adjustments\nto enforce QoS requirements effectively. Simulation results validate the\neffectiveness of QaSAL in managing NR-U and Wi-Fi coexistence, demonstrating\nimproved channel access fairness while satisfying a latency constraint for\nhigh-priority traffic.",

This\nstudy systematically analyses 379 of these gadgets, categorising them into 33\nsubcategories within 10 high-level groupings, to examine the fundamental human\nneeds they address, their parallels to contemporary technologies, and their\npotential insights for HCI design. The findings reveal that while human needs\nremain constant, the ways in which technology fulfils them differ.

    "abstract": "Coexistence of 5G new radio unlicensed (NR-U) and Wi-Fi is highly prone to\nthe collisions among NR-U gNBs (5G base stations) and Wi-Fi APs (access\npoints). To improve performance and fairness for both networks, various\ncollision resolution mechanisms have been proposed to replace the simple\nlisten-before-talk (LBT) scheme used in the current 5G standard. We address two\ngaps in the literature: first, the lack of a comprehensive performance\ncomparison among the proposed collision resolution mechanisms and second, the\nimpact of multiple traffic priority classes. Through extensive simulations, we\ncompare the performance of several recently proposed collision resolution\nmechanisms for NR-U/Wi-Fi coexistence. We extend one of these mechanisms to\nhandle multiple traffic priorities. We then develop a traffic-aware\nmulti-objective deep reinforcement learning algorithm for the scenario of\ncoexistence of high-priority traffic gNB user equipment (UE) with multiple\nlower-priority traffic UEs and Wi-Fi stations. The objective is to ensure low\nlatency for high-priority gNB traffic while increasing the airtime fairness\namong the NR-U and Wi-Fi networks. Our simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm lowers the channel access delay of high-priority traffic\nwhile improving the fairness among both networks.",

    "abstract": "Quantum tomography is crucial for characterizing the quantum states of\nmultipartite systems, but its practicality is often limited by the\nexponentially large dimension of the Hilbert space. Most existing approaches,\nsuch as compressed sensing and tensor network-based tomography, impose\nstructural constraints on the state to enable more resource-efficient\ncharacterization. However, not all physical states can be well-approximated\nwith highly structured states. Here, we develop a partial quantum tomography\nmethod based on direct fidelity estimation (DFE) that focuses on a neighborhood\nsubspace -- the subspace spanned by states physically close to a given target\nstate. Using this generalized DFE method, we estimate elements of the density\noperator within this subspace in a self-verifying manner. We investigate the\nefficiency of this approach under different sets of available measurements for\nvarious states and find that the set of available measurements significantly\nimpacts the cost of DFE. For example, we show that Pauli measurements alone are\ninsufficient for performing efficient DFE on all product states, whereas the\nfull set of product measurements is sufficient. This method can be applied in\nmany situations, including characterizing quantum systems with confined\ndynamics and verifying preparations of quantum states and processes.",

    "abstract": "Growth curve analysis (GCA) has a wide range of applications in various\nfields where growth trajectories need to be modeled. Heteroscedasticity is\noften present in the error term, which can not be handled with sufficient\nflexibility by standard linear fixed or mixed-effects models. One situation\nthat has been addressed is where the error variance is characterized by a\nlinear predictor with certain covariates. A frequently encountered scenario in\nGCA, however, is one in which the variance is a smooth function of the mean\nwith known shape restrictions. A naive application of standard linear\nmixed-effects models would underestimate the variance of the fixed effects\nestimators and, consequently, the uncertainty of the estimated growth curve. We\npropose to model the variance of the response variable as a shape-restricted\n(increasing/decreasing; convex/concave) function of the marginal or conditional\nmean using shape-restricted splines. A simple iteratively reweighted fitting\nalgorithm that takes advantage of existing software for linear mixed-effects\nmodels is developed. For inference, a parametric bootstrap procedure is\nrecommended. Our simulation study shows that the proposed method gives\nsatisfactory inference with moderate sample sizes. The utility of the method is\ndemonstrated using two real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Geoscientific applications of ensemble Kalman filters face several\ncomputational challenges arising from the high dimensionality of the forecast\ncovariance matrix, particularly when this matrix incorporates localization. For\nsquare-root filters, updating the perturbations of the ensemble members from\ntheir mean is an especially challenging step, one which generally requires\napproximations that introduce a trade-off between accuracy and computational\ncost. This paper describes an ensemble square-root filter which achieves a\nfavorable trade-off between these factors by discretizing an integral\nrepresentation of the Kalman filter update equations, and in doing so, avoids a\ndirect evaluation of the matrix square-root in the perturbation update stage.\nThis algorithm, which we call InFo-ESRF (\"Integral-Form Ensemble Square-Root\nFilter\"), is parallelizable and uses a preconditioned Krylov method to update\nperturbations to a high degree of accuracy. Through numerical experiments with\nboth a Gaussian forecast model and a multi-layer Lorenz-type system, we\ndemonstrate that InFo-ESRF is competitive or superior to several existing\nlocalized square-root filters in terms of accuracy and cost.",
