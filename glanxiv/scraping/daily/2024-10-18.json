    "abstract": "This article explores a flexible and coordinated control design for an\naggregation of heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs) in a dynamic\nvirtual power plant (DVPP). The control design aims to provide a desired\naggregate grid-forming (GFM) response based on the coordination of power\ncontributions between different DERs. Compared to existing DVPP designs with an\nAC-coupled AC-output configuration, a more generic modular DVPP design is\nproposed in this article, which comprises four types of basic DVPP modules,\ninvolving AC- or DC-coupling and AC- or DC-output, adequately accommodating\ndiverse DER integration setups, such as AC, DC, AC/DC hybrid microgrids and\nrenewable power plants. The control design is first developed for the four\nbasic modules by the aggregation of DERs and the disaggregation of the control\nobjectives, and then extended to modular DVPPs through a systematic top-down\napproach. The control performance is comprehensively validated through\nsimulation. The modular DVPP design offers scalable and standardizable advanced\ngrid interfaces (AGIs) for building and operating AC/DC hybrid power grids.",

    "abstract": "The robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP is critical for\ntheir deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving,\nhealthcare diagnostics, and security systems, where accurate interpretation of\nvisual and textual data is essential. However, these models are highly\nsusceptible to adversarial attacks, which can severely compromise their\nperformance and reliability in real-world scenarios. Previous methods have\nprimarily focused on improving robustness through adversarial training and\ngenerating adversarial examples using models like FGSM, AutoAttack, and\nDeepFool. However, these approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as\nfixed perturbation norms or predefined attack patterns, and involve high\ncomputational complexity, making them challenging to implement in practical\nsettings. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training framework that\nintegrates multiple attack strategies and advanced machine learning techniques\nto significantly enhance the robustness of VLMs against a broad range of\nadversarial attacks. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets, including\nCIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly\nenhances model robustness. The fine-tuned CLIP model achieved an accuracy of\n43.5% on adversarially perturbed images, compared to only 4% for the baseline\nmodel. The neural network model achieved a high accuracy of 98% in these\nchallenging classification tasks, while the XGBoost model reached a success\nrate of 85.26% in prediction tasks.",

Residential buildings consume about\n35% of the electricity in U.S. and are co-located with rooftop solar PV. Thus,\nthey present an opportunity to mitigate these fluctuations locally, while\nbenefiting both the grid and building owners.

Crucially, buyers are forward looking with a discounted\nutility and will choose to not purchase now if they expect to face a discounted\nprice in the near future. We show that forward-looking demand introduces bias\nin naive estimators of the demand gradient, due to intertemporal interference.\nFurthermore, we prove that there is no estimator that uses data from price\nexperiments with only two price points that can recover the correct demand\ngradient, even in the limit of an infinitely long experiment with an\ninfinitesimal price discount. Moreover, we characterize the form of the bias of\nnaive estimators.

Here an\nill-posed ideal system is regularized at small scales and the vanishing\nregularization (inviscid) limit is considered. By relating the inviscid limit\nto the dynamics of the RG operator acting on the flow maps, we explain the\nexistence and universality (regularization independence) of the limiting\nsolutions as a consequence of the fixed-point RG attractor. Considering the\nlocal linearized dynamics, we show that the convergence to the inviscid limit\nis governed by the universal RG eigenmode. We also demonstrate that the RG\nattractor undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation with parameter variation,\nthereby changing the nature of the inviscid limit. In the case of chaotic RG\ndynamics, we introduce the stochastic RG operator acting on Markov kernels.\nThen the RG attractor becomes stochastic, which explains the existence and\nuniversality of spontaneously stochastic solutions in the limit of vanishing\nnoise.

Traditional CBCT\nreconstruction methods for arbitrary orbits, like iterative reconstruction\nalgorithms, are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. The proposed\nmethod addresses these challenges by employing a shift-variant FBP algorithm\noptimized for arbitrary trajectories through a deep learning approach that\nadapts to a specific orbit geometry. This approach overcomes the limitations of\nexisting techniques by integrating known operators into the learning model,\nminimizing the number of parameters, and improving the interpretability of the\nmodel. The proposed method is a significant advancement in interventional\nmedical imaging, particularly for robotic C-arm CT systems, enabling faster and\nmore accurate CBCT reconstructions with customized orbits. Especially this\nmethod can also be used for the analytical reconstruction of non-continuous\norbits like circular plus arc. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method significantly accelerates the reconstruction process compared\nto conventional iterative algorithms. It achieves comparable or superior image\nquality, as evidenced by metrics such as the mean squared error (MSE), the peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity index measure\n(SSIM). The validation experiments show that the method can handle data from\ndifferent trajectories, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness across\ndifferent scan geometries.

    "abstract": "We investigate how the formation and structure of circumplanetary disks\n(CPDs) varies with planet mass and protoplanetary disk aspect ratio. Using\nstatic mesh refinement and a near-isothermal equation of state, we perform a\nsmall parameter survey of hydrodynamic simulations with parameters appropriate\nfor disk-embedded protoplanets at moderate to large orbital radii. We find that\nCPD formation occurs along a continuum, with ``diskiness'' increasing smoothly\nwith planetary mass and decreasing disk aspect ratio. As expected from disk\nhydrostatic equilibrium arguments, the transition from envelope-dominated to\ndisk-dominated structures is determined to first order by the ratio of the\nplanetary Hill sphere radius to the disk scale height, but planets need to be\nsignificantly super-thermal to host classical rotationally supported CPDs. The\ncircularization radius of inflowing gas (as a fraction of the Hill sphere\nradius) shows an approximately quadratic power-law scaling with the ratio of\nplanetary mass to the thermal mass. Compared to more physically complete\nradiation hydrodynamic simulations, our runs almost maximize the possibility\nfor classical CPD formation, and hence define a plausible necessary condition\nfor CPDs. The low abundance of detected CPDs in disks where planetary\ncompanions are inferred from substructure data may be due to a combination of\nthe large scale height of the protoplanetary disk, and a low frequency of\nsufficiently massive protoplanets. Unless their CPDs cool below the local\nprotoplanetary disk temperature, most of the wide-orbit giant planet population\nwill be embedded in quasi-spherical envelopes that are hard to detect. Disks,\nand satellite systems, are more likely to form around smaller orbital\nseparation planets.",

    "abstract": "Consistency models have recently been introduced to accelerate sampling from\ndiffusion models by directly predicting the solution (i.e., data) of the\nprobability flow ODE (PF ODE) from initial noise. However, the training of\nconsistency models requires learning to map all intermediate points along PF\nODE trajectories to their corresponding endpoints. This task is much more\nchallenging than the ultimate objective of one-step generation, which only\nconcerns the PF ODE's noise-to-data mapping. We empirically find that this\ntraining paradigm limits the one-step generation performance of consistency\nmodels. To address this issue, we generalize consistency training to the\ntruncated time range, which allows the model to ignore denoising tasks at\nearlier time steps and focus its capacity on generation. We propose a new\nparameterization of the consistency function and a two-stage training procedure\nthat prevents the truncated-time training from collapsing to a trivial\nsolution. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\\times64$ datasets show that\nour method achieves better one-step and two-step FIDs than the state-of-the-art\nconsistency models such as iCT-deep, using more than 2$\\times$ smaller\nnetworks.

We show that\nLUCI can be used to adapt surface code circuits to lattices with imperfect\nqubit and coupler yield, a key challenge for fault-tolerant quantum computers\nusing solid-state architectures. These circuits preserve spacelike distance for\nisolated broken couplers or isolated broken measure qubits in exchange for\nhalving timelike distance, substantially reducing the penalty for dropout\ncompared to the state of the art and creating opportunities in device\narchitecture design. For qubit and coupler dropout rates of 1% and a patch\ndiameter of 15, LUCI achieves an average spacelike distance of 13.1, compared\nto 9.1 for the best method in the literature. For a SI1000(0.001) circuit noise\nmodel, this translates to a 36x improvement in median logical error rate per\nround, a factor which increases with device performance.

It is well-known that all NP-problems can\nbe coded as SAT problems and therefore SAT is important both practically and\ntheoretically. From both of these perspectives, better understanding the\npatterns and structure implicit in SAT data is of significant value. In this\npaper, we describe several advances that we believe will help open the door to\nsuch understanding: we introduce hardware accelerated algorithms for fast SAT\nproblem generation, a geometric SAT encoding that enables the use of\ntransformer architectures typically applied to vision tasks, and a simple yet\neffective technique we term head slicing for reducing sequence length\nrepresentation inside transformer architectures. These advances allow us to\nscale our approach to SAT problems with thousands of variables and tens of\nthousands of clauses. We validate our architecture, termed Satisfiability\nTransformer (SaT), on the SAT prediction task with data from the SAT\nCompetition (SATComp) 2022 problem sets. Prior related work either leveraged a\npure machine learning approach, but could not handle SATComp-sized problems, or\nwas hybrid in the sense of integrating a machine learning component in a\nstandard SAT solving tool. Our pure machine learning approach achieves\nprediction accuracies comparable to recent work, but on problems that are an\norder of magnitude larger than previously demonstrated.

In this task, differences between safe and unsafe inputs\nare often extremely subtle, making it difficult for classifiers (and indeed,\neven humans) to properly distinguish violating vs. benign samples without\ncontext or explanation. Scaling risk discovery and mitigation through\ncontinuous model fine-tuning is also slow, challenging and costly, preventing\ndevelopers from being able to respond quickly and effectively to emergent\nharms.

Compared to\nmodel fine-tuning, Class-RAG demonstrates flexibility and transparency in\ndecision-making, outperforms on classification and is more robust against\nadversarial attack, as evidenced by empirical studies.

These works study how much a trained DNN relies on image cues,\npredominantly shape and texture. In this work, we switch the perspective,\nposing the following questions: What can a DNN learn from each of the image\ncues, i.e., shape, texture and color, respectively? How much does each cue\ninfluence the learning success? And what are the synergy effects between\ndifferent cues? Studying these questions sheds light upon cue influences on\nlearning and thus the learning capabilities of DNNs. We study these questions\non semantic segmentation which allows us to address our questions on pixel\nlevel. To conduct this study, we develop a generic procedure to decompose a\ngiven dataset into multiple ones, each of them only containing either a single\ncue or a chosen mixture. This framework is then applied to two real-world\ndatasets, Cityscapes and PASCAL Context, and a synthetic data set based on the\nCARLA simulator. We learn the given semantic segmentation task from these cue\ndatasets, creating cue experts. Early fusion of cues is performed by\nconstructing appropriate datasets. This is complemented by a late fusion of\nexperts which allows us to study cue influence location-dependent on pixel\nlevel. Our study on three datasets reveals that neither texture nor shape\nclearly dominate the learning success, however a combination of shape and color\nbut without texture achieves surprisingly strong results. Our findings hold for\nconvolutional and transformer backbones.

In contrast, flux emergence models of\nfast-rotating stars predict strong poleward deflection of radially rising\nmagnetic flux as the Coriolis effect dominates over buoyancy, leaving a\nspot-free band around the equator. To resolve this discrepancy, we consider a\nflux tube near the base of the convection zone in a solar-type star rotating\neight times faster than the Sun, assuming field intensification by weak-tube\nexplosions. For the intensification to continue into to the buoyancy-dominated\nregime, the upper convection zone must have a significantly steeper temperature\ngradient than in the Sun, by a factor that is comparable with that found in 3D\nsimulations of rotating convection. Within the hypothesis that stellar active\nregions stem from the base of the convection zone, flux emergence between 1-20\ndegree latitudes requires highly supercritical field strengths of up to 500 kG\nin rapidly rotating stars. These field strengths require explosions of 100-kG\ntubes within the convection zone, compatible with reasonable values of the\nsuperadiabatic temperature gradient associated with the more rapid rotation.",

A key component of the CMS\nBeam Radiation Instrumentation and Luminosity detector system is a stand-alone\nluminometer, the Fast Beam Condition Monitor (FBCM), which is able to operate\nindependently at all times with a triggerless asynchronous readout. FBCM\nutilizes a dedicated front-end ASIC to amplify the signals from CO$_2$-cooled\nsilicon-pad sensors with 1 ns timing resolution. Front-end (FE) electronics are\nsubject to high-radiation conditions, thus all components are radiation\nhardened: sensors, ASICs, transceivers, etc. The FBCM ASIC contains 6 channels,\neach outputting a high-speed binary signal carrying the time-of-arrival and\ntime-over-threshold information. This signal is sent via a gigabit optical link\nto the back-end electronics for analysis. A dedicated test system is designed\nfor the FBCM FE electronics with a modular setup for all testing needs of the\nproject from initial ASIC validation test to system-level testing with the full\nread-out chain. The paper reports on the design, read-out architecture, and\ntesting program for the FBCM electronics.",

We propose to evaluate a local test\nstatistic on a triplet of time points, for each such triplet in a particular\ncollection. This collection is sparse enough so that the results of the local\ntests can simply be combined with a weighted Bonferroni correction. This\nresults in a simple and fast method, {\\sl Lean Bonferroni Changepoint\ndetection} (LBD), that provides finite sample guarantees for the existance of\nchangepoints as well as simultaneous confidence intervals for their locations.\nLBD is free of tuning parameters, and we show that LBD allows optimal inference\nfor the detection of changepoints. To this end, we provide a lower bound for\nthe critical constant that measures the difficulty of the changepoint detection\nproblem, and we show that LBD attains this critical constant. We illustrate LBD\nfor a number of distributional settings, namely when the observations are\nhomoscedastic normal with known or unknown variance, for observations from a\nnatural exponential family, and in a nonparametric setting where we assume only\nexchangeability for segments without a changepoint.",

A\nsignificant gap remains between the language models' outputs and verifiable\nexecutions of plans. We develop a method to generate executable plans and\nformally verify them against task-relevant safety specifications. Given a\nhigh-level task description in natural language, the proposed method queries a\nlanguage model to generate plans in the form of executable robot programs.

Since these\ntwo estimates tend to be very noisy in practice, first-price auction\nparticipants need a bid shading policy that is robust against relatively\nsignificant estimation errors. In this work, we provide a max-min formulation\nin which we maximize the surplus against an adversary that chooses a\ndistribution both for the value and the competitive landscape, each from a\nKullback-Leibler-based ambiguity set. As we demonstrate, the two ambiguity sets\nare essential to adjusting the shape of the bid-shading policy in a principled\nway so as to effectively cope with uncertainty.

We\nverify that the answer is \"no\" if one performs calculations within a spin-only\nlow-energy effective spin model with non-interacting magnons. However, by\nperforming determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show the single-band\n$t$-$t'$-$U$ Hubbard model coupled to an orbital magnetic field does support a\nfinite thermal Hall effect when $t' \\neq 0$ and $B \\neq 0$ in the Mott\ninsulating phase. We argue that the (carrier agnostic) necessary conditions for\nobserving a finite thermal Hall effect are time-reversal and particle-hole\nsymmetry breaking. By considering magnon-magnon scattering using a\nsemi-classical Boltzmann analysis, we illustrate a physical mechanism by which\nfinite transverse thermal conductivity may arise, consistent with our symmetry\nargument and numerical results. Our results contradict the conventional wisdom\nthat square and triangular lattices with SU(2) symmetry do not support a finite\nthermal Hall effect and call for a critical re-examination of thermal Hall\neffect data in insulating magnets, as the magnon contribution should not be\nexcluded a priori.",

In this paper, we introduce two core modules of IntelliMove: IntelliMap,\na generic hierarchical semantic topometric map framework developed through an\nanalysis of current technologies strengths and weaknesses, and Semantic\nPlanning, which utilizes the semantic maps from IntelliMap. We showcase use\ncases that highlight IntelliMove's adaptability and effectiveness. Through\nexperiments in simulated environments, we further demonstrate IntelliMove's\ncapability in semantic navigation.",

    "abstract": "The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a leading mode of atmospheric\nvariability, affecting the North Atlantic Ocean on sub-seasonal to\nmulti-decadal timescales. The NAO changes the atmospheric forcing at the\nocean's surface, including winds and surface buoyancy fluxes, both of which are\nknown to impact large-scale gyre circulation. However, the relative role of\nother physical processes (such as mesoscale eddies and topography) in\ninfluencing gyre circulation under NAO variability is not fully understood.\nHere, we analyze a series of ocean--sea ice simulations using a barotropic\nvorticity budget to understand the long-term response of the North Atlantic\ngyre circulation to NAO forcing. We find that for each standard deviation\nincrease in the NAO index, the subtropical and subpolar gyres intensify by 0.90\nSv and 3.41 Sv (1 Sv = 10$^6$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$) respectively. The NAO-induced\nwind stress anomalies drive approximately 90\\% of the change in the subtropical\ngyre's interior flow. However, in the subpolar gyre's interior, in addition to\nwind stress, flow-topography interactions, stratification (influenced by\nsurface heat fluxes), and non-linear advection significantly influence the\ncirculation. Along the western boundary the bottom pressure torque plays a key\nrole in steering the flow, and the vorticity input by the bottom pressure\ntorque is partly redistributed by non-linear advection. Our study highlights\nthe importance of both atmospheric forcing and oceanic dynamical processes in\ndriving long-term gyre circulation responses to the NAO.",

    "abstract": "Non-reciprocal propagation of energy and information is fundamental to a wide\nrange of quantum technology applications. In this work, we explore the quantum\nmany-body dynamics of a qubit ensemble coupled to a shared bath that mediates\ncoherent and dissipative inter-qubit interactions with both symmetric and\nanti-symmetric components. We find that the interplay between anti-symmetric\n(symmetric) coherent and symmetric (anti-symmetric) dissipative interactions\nresults in non-reciprocal couplings, which, in turn, generate a spatially\nasymmetric emission pattern. We demonstrate that this pattern arises from\nnon-reciprocal interactions coupling different quantum many-body states within\na specific excitation manifold. Focusing on solid-state baths, we show that\ntheir lack of time-reversal and inversion symmetry is a key ingredient for\ngenerating non-reciprocal dynamics in the qubit ensemble. With the plethora of\nquantum materials that exhibit this symmetry breaking at equilibrium, our\napproach paves the way for realizing cooperative non-reciprocal transport in\nqubit ensembles without requiring time-modulated external drives or complex\nengineering. Using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers coupled to a\ngeneric non-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic bath as a concrete example, we\ndemonstrate that our predictions can be tested in near-future experiments. As\nthe spatial asymmetry in the relaxation dynamics of the qubit ensemble is a\ndirect probe of symmetry breaking in the solid-state bath, our work also opens\nthe door to developing model-agnostic quantum sensing schemes capable of\ndetecting bath properties invisible to current state-of-the-art protocols,\nwhich operate solid-state defects as single-qubit sensors.",

The authors focus on a U.S.\nequity investment universe comprising seven long-only indices representing the\nmarket and six style factors: value, size, momentum, quality, low volatility,\nand growth. Their approach integrates factor-specific regime inferences of each\nfactor index's active performance relative to the market into the\nBlack-Litterman model to construct a fully-invested, long-only multi-factor\nportfolio. First, the authors apply the sparse jump model (SJM) to identify\nbull and bear market regimes for individual factors, using a feature set based\non risk and return measures from historical factor active returns, as well as\nvariables reflecting the broader market environment. The regimes identified by\nthe SJM exhibit enhanced stability and interpretability compared to traditional\nmethods. A hypothetical single-factor long-short strategy is then used to\nassess these regime inferences and fine-tune hyperparameters, resulting in a\npositive Sharpe ratio of this strategy across all factors with low correlation\namong them. These regime inferences are then incorporated into the\nBlack-Litterman framework to dynamically adjust allocations among the seven\nindices, with an equally weighted (EW) portfolio serving as the benchmark.\nEmpirical results show that the constructed multi-factor portfolio\nsignificantly improves the information ratio (IR) relative to the market,\nraising it from just 0.05 for the EW benchmark to approximately 0.4. When\nmeasured relative to the EW benchmark itself, the dynamic allocation achieves\nan IR of around 0.4 to 0.5. The strategy also enhances absolute portfolio\nperformance across key metrics such as the Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown.",

A consequence of\nthis is the stabilisation of long-range translational order in two dimensions,\nin clear violation of the celebrated Mermin-Wagner theorem, and the emergence\nof hyperuniformity with a structure factor $S(q) \\sim q^2$ in the $q \\to 0$\nlimit. We then introduce two numerical cell tissue models which feature these\npair-wise active forces. First a vertex model, in which the cell tissue is\nrepresented by a tiling of polygons where the edges represent cell junctions\nand with activity provided by stochastic junctional contractions. Second an\nactive disk model, derived from active Brownian particles, but with pairs of\nequal and opposite stochastic forces between particles. We study the melting\ntransition of these models and find a first-order phase transition between an\nordered and a disordered phase in the disk model with active stresses. We\nconfirm our analytical prediction of long-range order in both numerical models\nand show that hyperuniformity survives in the disordered phase, thus\nconstituting a hidden order in our model tissue. Owing to the generality of\nthis mechanism, we expect our results to be testable in living organisms, and\nto also apply to artificial systems with the same symmetry.",

We propose\nthe Two-Stage Multi-Task (TSMT) algorithm: first, an unregularized MLE over\npooled data to obtain a coarse parameter estimate; second, a regularized MLE on\nindividual securities to refine the parameters. We show that the TSMT achieves\na regret bounded by $\\tilde{O} ( \\delta_{\\max} \\sqrt{T M d} + M d ) $,\noutperforming both fully individual and fully pooled baselines, where $M$ is\nthe number of securities and $\\delta_{\\max}$ quantifies their heterogeneity.",

In our paper, we considered various settings of open-quantum system\ndynamics, including non-commuting, non-diagonalizable system-bath coupling, and\nbosonic/spin/fermionic baths. For these, we showed a direct and explicit\nrelationship between the discrete-time memory kernel ($\\mathcal K$) of the\ngeneralized quantum master equation (GQME) and the discrete-time influence\nfunctions ($I$) of the path integrals. As an application of this, we showed one\ncan construct $\\mathcal K$ without projection-free dynamics inputs that\nconventional methods require, and we also presented a quantum sensing protocol\nthat characterizes the bath spectral density from reduced system dynamics. As\nthe Comment focused on the relationship between ($\\mathcal K$) and $I$ in one\nspecific setup (i.e., commuting, diagonalizable system-bath coupling with a\nbosonic bath), we focus on that aspect in this response. In summary, we could\nnot find a set of equations that explicitly connect $I$ and $\\mathcal K$ from\nMakri's 2020 paper [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 4038 (2020)]. Furthermore,\nwhile our analysis is specific to the choice of discretization of path-integral\nand GQME, we have not found issues with the GQME discretization employed. As\nper critiques on citations, in our paper, we note that we had acknowledged\nMakri's driven SMatPI work and Wang and Cai's tree-based SMatPI work for the\nnumber of Dyck paths needed for the computation of the memory kernel.",

    "abstract": "Determining the appropriate rank in Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)\nis a critical challenge that often requires extensive parameter tuning and\ndomain-specific knowledge. Traditional methods for rank determination focus on\nidentifying a single optimal rank, which may not capture the complex structure\ninherent in real-world datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel approach\ncalled Residual Sensitivity to Intial Conditions (RSIC) that suggests\npotentially multiple ranks of interest by analyzing the sensitivity of the\nrelative residuals (e.g. relative reconstruction error) to different\ninitializations. By computing the Mean Coordinatewise Interquartile Range (MCI)\nof the residuals across multiple random initializations, our method identifies\nregions where the NMF solutions are less sensitive to initial conditions and\npotentially more meaningful. We evaluate RSIC on a diverse set of datasets,\nincluding single-cell gene expression data, image data, and text data, and\ncompare it against current state-of-the-art existing rank determination\nmethods. Our experiments demonstrate that RSIC effectively identifies relevant\nranks consistent with the underlying structure of the data, outperforming\ntraditional methods in scenarios where they are computationally infeasible or\nless accurate. This approach provides a more scalable and generalizable\nsolution for rank determination in NMF that does not rely on domain-specific\nknowledge or assumptions.",

Traditional funding\nmodels are often governed by standardized processes, but Web3 grants lack such\nconsistency, making it difficult for grant operators to measure the long-term\nsuccess of their programs.The Grant Maturity Index (GMI) was created through\nexploratory applied research to address this gap.

The primary objectives of this research are to,\nfirst, identify the structural indicators that adequately describe Web3 grant\nprograms.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in many\nscenarios, but their performance depends, in part, on the choice of prompt.\nPast research has focused on optimizing prompts specific to a task. However,\nmuch less attention has been given to optimizing the general instructions\nincluded in a prompt, known as a system prompt. To address this gap, we propose\nSPRIG, an edit-based genetic algorithm that iteratively constructs prompts from\nprespecified components to maximize the model's performance in general\nscenarios. We evaluate the performance of system prompts on a collection of 47\ndifferent types of tasks to ensure generalizability. Our study finds that a\nsingle optimized system prompt performs on par with task prompts optimized for\neach individual task. Moreover, combining system and task-level optimizations\nleads to further improvement, which showcases their complementary nature.\nExperiments also reveal that the optimized system prompts generalize\neffectively across model families, parameter sizes, and languages. This study\nprovides insights into the role of system-level instructions in maximizing LLM\npotential.",

Current literature addressing domain gaps in modality changes has\nfocused primarily on natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be\ndirectly applied to endoscopic data, as visual cues in such data are more\nlimited compared to natural scenes. In this work, we exploit both style and\ncontent information in images by performing instance normalization and feature\ncovariance mapping techniques to preserve robust and generalizable feature\nrepresentations. Additionally, to avoid the risk of removing salient feature\nrepresentations associated with objects of interest, we introduce a restitution\nmodule within the feature-learning ResNet backbone that retains useful\ntask-relevant features.

In\nAI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of\nout-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to\nnovel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions\nabout what compositionality is, we lack satisfying formal definitions for it\nthat are measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which\nwe call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our\nintuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple,\nquantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any\nrepresentation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a\ncompositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be\nexpressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a\nfunction of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to\nsentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic\nsequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language,\nmust be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we\nvalidate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate\nintuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also\nshow that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable,\ncan be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools.

Drawing on the principle of\nomitted variable bias, we provide measures for evaluating the quality of both\nnon-focal language approximations and isolated effect estimates themselves. We\nfind that poor approximation of non-focal language can lead to bias in the\ncorresponding isolated effect estimates due to omission of relevant variables,\nand we show how to assess the sensitivity of effect estimates to such bias\nalong the two key axes of fidelity and overlap.

As a starting point to address these limitations, we define a\nclass of bandit alignment problems as an extension of classic multi-armed\nbandit problems. A bandit alignment problem involves an agent tasked with\nmaximizing long-run expected reward by interacting with an environment and a\nhuman, both involving details/preferences initially unknown to the agent.

    "abstract": "Currently, cortical surface registration techniques based on classical\nmethods have been well developed. However, a key issue with classical methods\nis that for each pair of images to be registered, it is necessary to search for\nthe optimal transformation in the deformation space according to a specific\noptimization algorithm until the similarity measure function converges, which\ncannot meet the requirements of real-time and high-precision in medical image\nregistration. Researching cortical surface registration based on deep learning\nmodels has become a new direction. But so far, there are still only a few\nstudies on cortical surface image registration based on deep learning.\nMoreover, although deep learning methods theoretically have stronger\nrepresentation capabilities, surpassing the most advanced classical methods in\nregistration accuracy and distortion control remains a challenge. Therefore, to\naddress this challenge, this paper constructs a deep learning model to study\nthe technology of cortical surface image registration. The specific work is as\nfollows: (1) An unsupervised cortical surface registration network based on a\nmulti-scale cascaded structure is designed, and a convolution method based on\nspherical harmonic transformation is introduced to register cortical surface\ndata. This solves the problem of scale-inflexibility of spherical feature\ntransformation and optimizes the multi-scale registration process. (2)By\nintegrating the attention mechanism, a graph-enhenced module is introduced into\nthe registration network, using the graph attention module to help the network\nlearn global features of cortical surface data, enhancing the learning ability\nof the network. The results show that the graph attention module effectively\nenhances the network's ability to extract global features, and its registration\nresults have significant advantages over other methods.",

However, current algorithms, while very\neffective under certain conditions, face significant challenges in complex\nscenarios, as their accuracy and motor unit yield are highly dependent on\nanatomical differences among individuals. This can limit the number of\ndecomposed motor units, particularly in challenging conditions. To address this\nissue, we recently introduced Swarm-Contrastive Decomposition (SCD), which\ndynamically adjusts the separation function based on the distribution of the\ndata and prevents convergence to the same source. Initially applied to\nintramuscular EMG signals, SCD is here adapted for HD-sEMG signals. We\ndemonstrated its ability to address key challenges faced by existing methods,\nparticularly in identifying low-amplitude motor unit action potentials and\neffectively handling complex decomposition scenarios, like high-interference\nsignals. We extensively validated SCD using simulated and experimental HD-sEMG\nrecordings and compared it with current state-of-the-art decomposition methods\nunder varying conditions, including different excitation levels, noise\nintensities, force profiles, sexes, and muscle groups. The proposed method\nconsistently outperformed existing techniques in both the quantity of decoded\nmotor units and the precision of their firing time identification.

Second, a deep\nlearning-based detector is trained on the dynamic grid to infer the presence of\ndynamic objects of any type, which is a prerequisite for safe automated\nvehicles in arbitrary, edge-case scenarios. The Rotation-equivariant Detector\n(ReDet) - originally designed for oriented object detection on aerial images -\nwas chosen due to its high detection performance. Experiments are conducted\nbased on real sensor data and the benefits in comparison to classic dynamic\ncell clustering strategies are highlighted. The false positive object detection\nrate is strongly reduced by the proposed approach.",

In this work, we\nexplore the impact of the EBL absorption effect on photon to axionlike particle\n(ALP) conversions from the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral irregularities.\nFor our purpose, we select four BL Lac blazars: Markarian 501, 1ES 0229+200,\nPKS 0301-243, and PKS 0447-439 for analysis. Their redshifts range from\napproximately 0.03 to 0.34.

Then we consider the\nphoton-ALP conversions in astrophysical magnetic fields. The best-fit\nchi-square distributions of these EBL models under the ALP assumption in the\nALP parameter $\\{m_a, g_{a\\gamma}\\}$ plane are provided, showing similar\ndistributions.

Combined with deep Very Large Telescope\n(VLT) SINFONI observations of the H$\\alpha$ line, we characterize the molecular\ngas and star formation activity on kiloparsec scales. Our analysis reveals that\nthe excitation of the molecular gas, as traced by the $L'_{\\rm CO ~ (4-3)} /\nL'_{\\rm [CI] ~ (1-0)}$ line luminosity ratio, decreases with increasing\ngalactocentric radius. While the line luminosity ratios in the outskirts are\nsimilar to those typically found in main-sequence galaxies at $z \\sim 1$, the\nratios in the central regions of BX610 are comparable to those observed in\nlocal starbursts. There is also a giant extra-nuclear star-forming clump in the\nsouthwest of BX610 that exhibits high star formation activity, molecular gas\nabundance, and molecular gas excitation. Furthermore, the central region of\nBX610 is rich in molecular gas $(M_{\\rm mol} / M_{\\rm \\star} \\approx 1)$;\nhowever, at the current level of star formation activity, such molecular gas is\nexpected to be depleted in $\\sim$ 450 Myr. This, along with recent evidence for\nrapid inflow toward the center, suggests that BX610 may be experiencing an\nevolutionary phase often referred to as wet compaction, which is expected to\nlead to central gas depletion and subsequent inside-out quenching of star\nformation activity.",

Observations are now piecing together the puzzle of\nembedded protostellar accretion, in particular with new facilities in the\nnear-infrared. However, high-resolution theoretical models are still lacking,\nwith a stark paucity of detailed simulations of these early phases. Here we\npresent high-resolution non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a Solar\nmass protostar accreting at rates exceeding 10$^{-6} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We\nshow the results of the accretion flow for four different protostellar magnetic\nfields, 10 G, 500 G, 1 kG, and 2 kG, combined with a disk magnetic field. For\nweaker (10 G and 500 G) protostar magnetic fields, accretion occurs via a\nturbulent boundary layer mode, with disk material impacting across the\nprotostellar surface. In the 500 G model, the presence of a magnetically\ndominated outflow focuses the accretion towards the equator, slightly enhancing\nand ordering the accretion. For kG magnetic fields, the disk becomes truncated\ndue to the protostellar dipole and exhibits magnetospheric accretion, with the\n2 kG model having accretion bursts induced by the interchange instability. We\npresent bolometric light curves for the models and find that they reproduce\nobservations of Class I protostars from YSOVAR, with high bursts followed by an\nexponential decay possibly being a signature of instability-driven accretion.\nFinally, we present the filling fractions of accretion and find that 90\\% of\nthe mass is accreted in a surface area fraction of 10-20\\%. These simulations\nwill be extended in future work for a broader parameter space, with their high\nresolution and high temporal spacing able to explore a wide range of\ninteresting protostellar physics.",

    "abstract": "Some of the most stringent constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model\n(BSM) arise from considerations of particle emission from astrophysical\nplasmas. However, many studies assume that particle production occurs in an\nisotropic plasma environment. This condition is rarely (if ever) met in\nastrophysical settings, for instance due to the ubiquitous presence of magnetic\nfields. In anisotropic plasmas, the equations of motion are not diagonal in the\nusual polarization basis of transverse and longitudinal modes, causing a mixing\nof these modes and breaking the degeneracy in the dispersion relation of the\ntwo transverse modes. This behavior is captured by a $3\\times3$ mixing matrix\n$\\pi^{IJ}$, determined by projecting the response tensor of the plasma\n$\\Pi^{\\mu\\nu}$ into mode space, whose eigenvectors and eigenvalues are related\nto the normal modes and their dispersion relations. In this work, we provide a\ngeneral formalism for determining the normal modes of propagation that are\ncoupled to axions and dark photons in an anisotropic plasma. As a key part of\nthis formalism, we present detailed derivations of $\\Pi^{\\mu\\nu}$ for\nmagnetized plasmas in the long-wavelength limit using the real-time formalism\nof finite-temperature field theory. We provide analytic approximations for the\nnormal modes and their dispersion relations assuming various plasma conditions\nthat are relevant to astrophysical environments.

Following up on previous work that introduced causal discovery to\nthe field for the first time, here we solve a long standing conundrum by\nidentifying the direction of the causal relation between supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) mass and their host galaxy properties. This leverages a score-based\ncausal discovery approach with an exact posterior calculation. Causal relations\nbetween SMBHs and their host galaxies are further clarified by Independent\nComponent Analysis (ICA). The astrophysical problem we focus on is one of the\nmost important open issues in the field and one that has not seen a definitive\nresolution in decades. We consider the space of six physical properties of\ngalaxies, subdivided by morphology: elliptical, lenticular, and spiral, plus\nSMBH mass. We calculate an exact posterior over the space of directed acyclic\ngraphs for these variables based on a flat prior and the Bayesian Gaussian\nequivalent score. The nature of the causal relation between galaxy properties\nand SMBH mass is found to vary smoothly with morphology, with galaxy properties\ndetermining SMBH mass in ellipticals and vice versa in spirals. This settles a\nlong-standing debate and is compatible with our theoretical understanding of\ngalaxy evolution. ICA reveals a decreasing number of meaningful Independent\nComponents (ICs) from ellipticals and lenticular to spiral. Moreover, we find\nthat only one IC correlates with SMBH mass in spirals while multiple ones do in\nellipticals, further confirming our finding that SMBH mass causes galaxy\nproperties in spirals, but the reverse holds in ellipticals.",

We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate\nsituated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external\ninformation based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the\nexternal context to resolve knowledge conflicts. To benchmark this capability,\nwe evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset\nfeaturing in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show\nthat when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source\nand proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless\nof its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two\napproaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence\nReasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-assess the confidence of external\ninformation relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most\naccurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from\nthe LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results\nshow that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and\nGPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2% over a\ndirect input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like\nLlama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence\nReasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance\non both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9% on\nLlama-3-8B. In addition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the\nrelative strengths of SCR and RCR.",

Surprisingly, we find that much\nof SAE dark matter -- about half of the error vector itself and >90% of its\nnorm -- can be linearly predicted from the initial activation vector.\nAdditionally, we find that the scaling behavior of SAE error norms at a per\ntoken level is remarkably predictable: larger SAEs mostly struggle to\nreconstruct the same contexts as smaller SAEs. We build on the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis to propose models of activations that might lead to\nthese observations. These insights imply that the part of the SAE error vector\nthat cannot be linearly predicted (\"nonlinear\" error) might be fundamentally\ndifferent from the linearly predictable component. To validate this hypothesis,\nwe empirically analyze nonlinear SAE error and show that 1) it contains fewer\nnot yet learned features, 2) SAEs trained on it are quantitatively worse, and\n3) it is responsible for a proportional amount of the downstream increase in\ncross entropy loss when SAE activations are inserted into the model.

However, are these models truly effective? In this\nwork, we show that VLMs still struggle with natural images and questions that\nhumans can easily answer, which we term natural adversarial samples. We also\nfind it surprisingly easy to generate these VQA samples from natural image-text\ncorpora using off-the-shelf models like CLIP and ChatGPT. We propose a\nsemi-automated approach to collect a new benchmark, NaturalBench, for reliably\nevaluating VLMs with 10,000 human-verified VQA samples. Crucially, we adopt a\n$\\textbf{vision-centric}$ design by pairing each question with two images that\nyield different answers, preventing blind solutions from answering without\nusing the images. This makes NaturalBench more challenging than previous\nbenchmarks that can be solved with commonsense priors. We evaluate 53\nstate-of-the-art VLMs on NaturalBench, showing that models like\nLLaVA-OneVision, Cambrian-1, Llama3.2-Vision, Molmo, Qwen2-VL, and even GPT-4o\nlag 50%-70% behind human performance (over 90%). We analyze why NaturalBench is\nhard from two angles: (1) Compositionality: Solving NaturalBench requires\ndiverse visio-linguistic skills, including understanding attribute bindings,\nobject relationships, and advanced reasoning like logic and counting. To this\nend, unlike prior work that uses a single tag per sample, we tag each\nNaturalBench sample with 1 to 8 skill tags for fine-grained evaluation. (2)\nBiases: NaturalBench exposes severe biases in VLMs, as models often choose the\nsame answer regardless of the image. Lastly, we apply our benchmark curation\nmethod to diverse data sources, including long captions (over 100 words) and\nnon-English languages like Chinese and Hindi, highlighting its potential for\ndynamic evaluations of VLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in designing\nreward functions for Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. However, obtaining\nhigh-quality reward code often involves human intervention, numerous LLM\nqueries, or repetitive RL training. To address these issues, we propose CARD, a\nLLM-driven Reward Design framework that iteratively generates and improves\nreward function code. Specifically, CARD includes a Coder that generates and\nverifies the code, while a Evaluator provides dynamic feedback to guide the\nCoder in improving the code, eliminating the need for human feedback. In\naddition to process feedback and trajectory feedback, we introduce Trajectory\nPreference Evaluation (TPE), which evaluates the current reward function based\non trajectory preferences. If the code fails the TPE, the Evaluator provides\npreference feedback, avoiding RL training at every iteration and making the\nreward function better aligned with the task objective. Empirical results on\nMeta-World and ManiSkill2 demonstrate that our method achieves an effective\nbalance between task performance and token efficiency, outperforming or\nmatching the baselines across all tasks. On 10 out of 12 tasks, CARD shows\nbetter or comparable performance to policies trained with expert-designed\nrewards, and our method even surpasses the oracle on 3 tasks.",

A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times.\nThe transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. All\nactions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the\nbag. For example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day\ncollectively affect a user's daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to\ndevelop an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the\nbag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we\nutilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the\nDAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the\nobserved history, which results in Markov state transitions within and across\nbags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process\n(MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm\nbased on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle\nperiodic MDPs. We show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal\nvalue function among all state constructions for a periodic MDP.

However, during inference\ntime, they are utilized differently, generating text sequentially and\nauto-regressively by using previously generated tokens as input to predict the\nnext one. Marginal differences in predictions at each step can cascade over\nsuccessive steps, resulting in different distributions from what the models\nwere trained for and potentially leading to unpredictable behavior. This paper\nproposes two simple approaches based on model own generation to address this\ndiscrepancy between the training and inference time. Our first approach is\nBatch-Scheduled Sampling, where, during training, we stochastically choose\nbetween the ground-truth token from the dataset and the model's own generated\ntoken as input to predict the next token. This is done in an offline manner,\nmodifying the context window by interleaving ground-truth tokens with those\ngenerated by the model. Our second approach is Reference-Answer-based\nCorrection, where we explicitly incorporate a self-correction capability into\nthe model during training. This enables the model to effectively self-correct\nthe gaps between the generated sequences and the ground truth data without\nrelying on an external oracle model. By incorporating our proposed strategies\nduring training, we have observed an overall improvement in performance\ncompared to baseline methods, as demonstrated by our extensive experiments\nusing summarization, general question-answering, and math question-answering\ntasks.",

The remaining 40% are hypotheses generated in a\nprincipled way for further experimental investigations. We also develop an\nalgorithm to find the minimum set of spices needed to cover a target group of\nhealth conditions. Drawing on spice usage patterns in several regional Indian\ncuisines, and a copy-mutate model for regional cuisine evolution, we\ncharacterize the spectrum of health conditions covered by existing regional\ncuisines. The spectrum of health conditions can expand through the\nnationalization/globalization of culinary practice.",

While most known events show evidence for dense nearby\nCSM identified via peak-light spectroscopy (as SNe Ia-CSM), targeted late-time\nsearches have revealed a handful of cases exhibiting delayed CSM interaction\nwith detached shells. Here, we present the first all-sky search for late CSM\ninteraction in SNe Ia using a new image-subtraction pipeline for mid-infrared\ndata from the NEOWISE space telescope. Analyzing a sample of $\\approx8500$ SNe\nIa, we report evidence for late-time mid-infrared brightening in five\npreviously overlooked events spanning sub-types SNe Iax, SNe Ia-91T and\nsuper-Chandra SNe Ia. Our systematic search doubles the known sample, and\nsuggests that $\\gtrsim 0.05$\\% of SNe Ia exhibit mid-infrared signatures of\ndelayed CSM interaction. The mid-infrared light curves ubiquitously indicate\nthe presence of multiple (or extended) detached CSM shells located at $\\gtrsim\n10^{16}-10^{17}$ cm, containing $10^{-6}-10^{-4}$~$M_\\odot$ of dust, with some\nsources showing evidence for new dust formation, possibly within the cold,\ndense shell of the ejecta.

If the\ninput consists of uniform blocks: either all 1s or all 0s, then sampling a\nwhole block at a time does not reduce the number of samples needed for\nestimation. On the other hand, if bits are randomly permuted, then getting a\nblock of $B$ bits is as good as getting $B$ independent bit samples. However,\nwe do not want to make any such assumptions on the input. Instead, our goal is\nto have an algorithm with instance-dependent performance guarantees which stops\nsampling blocks as soon as we know that we have a probabilistically reliable\nestimate. We prove our algorithms to be instance-optimal among algorithms\noblivious to the order of the blocks, which we argue is the strongest form of\ninstance optimality we can hope for.

The results of this study show a\nsignificant improvement in data standardization, with accuracy rates of our\ntrained LLM peaking at over 92% with datasets consisting of thousands of\npatient data. Additionally, our LLM demonstrated an accuracy rate of 87% for\nSNOMED-CT, 90% for LOINC, and 84% for RxNorm codes. This trumps the current\nstatus quo, with LLMs such as GPT-4 and Claude's 3.5 peaking at an average of\n77%. This paper successfully underscores the potential of our standardization\nand interoperability framework, paving the way for more efficient and\npersonalized cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "In forecasting multiple time series, accounting for the individual features\nof each sequence can be challenging. To address this, modern deep learning\nmethods for time series analysis combine a shared (global) model with local\nlayers, specific to each time series, often implemented as learnable\nembeddings. Ideally, these local embeddings should encode meaningful\nrepresentations of the unique dynamics of each sequence. However, when these\nare learned end-to-end as parameters of a forecasting model, they may end up\nacting as mere sequence identifiers. Shared processing blocks may then become\nreliant on such identifiers, limiting their transferability to new contexts. In\nthis paper, we address this issue by investigating methods to regularize the\nlearning of local learnable embeddings for time series processing.\nSpecifically, we perform the first extensive empirical study on the subject and\nshow how such regularizations consistently improve performance in widely\nadopted architectures. Furthermore, we show that methods attempting to prevent\nthe co-adaptation of local and global parameters by means of embeddings\nperturbation are particularly effective in this context. In this regard, we\ninclude in the comparison several perturbation-based regularization methods,\ngoing as far as periodically resetting the embeddings during training. The\nobtained results provide an important contribution to understanding the\ninterplay between learnable local parameters and shared processing layers: a\nkey challenge in modern time series processing models and a step toward\ndeveloping effective foundation models for time series.",

We show that major political advertisers\ncircumvented these mitigations by targeting proxy attributes: seemingly\ninnocuous targeting criteria that closely correspond to political and racial\ndivides in American society. We introduce novel methods for directly measuring\nthe skew of various targeting criteria to quantify their effectiveness as\nproxies, and then examine the scale at which those attributes are used. Our\nfindings have crucial implications for the ongoing discussion on the regulation\nof political advertising and emphasize the urgency for increased transparency.",

Experimental\nobservation of quantum many-body scars has so far been limited to models with\nmultiple scar states evenly spaced in energy. It is thus an interesting\nquestion whether even single isolated scars, which theoretically embody the\nweakest possibile violation of eigenstate thermalization and may be thought to\nhave no detectable impact in experiments, can leave a trace in measurable\nquantities. Moreover, single scars offer an interesting scenario for exploring\nthe connection between quantum many-body scars and the original notion of\nscarring in quantum dynamical systems theory.

We\ndevelop protocols for the implementation of these models, through trotterized\nsequences of two-qubit cross-resonance interactions, and verify the existence\nof the approximate scar state in the stroboscopic effective Hamiltonian.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nsignificantly enhanced CS by enabling query rewriting based on conversational\ncontext. However, employing LLMs during inference poses efficiency challenges.\nExisting solutions mitigate this issue by distilling embeddings derived from\nhuman-rewritten queries, focusing primarily on learning the context modeling\ntask. These methods, however, often separate the contrastive retrieval task\nfrom the distillation process, treating it as an independent loss term. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce DiSCo (Distillation of Sparse\nConversational retrieval), a novel approach that unifies retrieval and context\nmodeling through a relaxed distillation objective. Instead of relying\nexclusively on representation learning, our method distills similarity scores\nbetween conversations and documents, providing more freedom in the\nrepresentation space and better leveraging the contrastive nature of document\nrelevance. Extensive experiments on Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) across five\nCS datasets demonstrate that DiSCo achieves substantial improvements in both\nin-domain and out-of-domain retrieval tasks, achieving up to a six-point gain\nin recall for out-of-domain datasets over state-of-the-art methods.\nAdditionally, DiSCo employs a multi-teacher distillation strategy, using\nmultiple LLMs as teachers, further enhancing performance and surpassing the\nindividual teachers in in-domain settings.

    "abstract": "The pioneering work of Oono and Suzuki [ICLR, 2020] and Cai and Wang\n[arXiv:2006.13318] initializes the analysis of the smoothness of graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) features. Their results reveal an intricate\nempirical correlation between node classification accuracy and the ratio of\nsmooth to non-smooth feature components. However, the optimal ratio that favors\nnode classification is unknown, and the non-smooth features of deep GCN with\nReLU or leaky ReLU activation function diminish. In this paper, we propose a\nnew strategy to let GCN learn node features with a desired smoothness --\nadapting to data and tasks -- to enhance node classification. Our approach has\nthree key steps: (1) We establish a geometric relationship between the input\nand output of ReLU or leaky ReLU. (2) Building on our geometric insights, we\naugment the message-passing process of graph convolutional layers (GCLs) with a\nlearnable term to modulate the smoothness of node features with computational\nefficiency. (3) We investigate the achievable ratio between smooth and\nnon-smooth feature components for GCNs with the augmented message-passing\nscheme. Our extensive numerical results show that the augmented message-passing\nschemes significantly improve node classification for GCN and some related\nmodels.",

We show that optimizing models for only\none side results in poor performance on the other. In order to balance positive\nand negative persuasion, we introduce Persuasion-Training (or PBT), which\nleverages multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create data and trains models\nvia preference optimization to accept persuasion when appropriate. PBT allows\nus to use data generated from dialogues between smaller 7-8B models for\ntraining much larger 70B models. Moreover, PBT consistently improves resistance\nto misinformation and resilience to being challenged while also resulting in\nthe best overall performance on holistic data containing both positive and\nnegative persuasion. Crucially, we show that PBT models are better teammates in\nmulti-agent debates across two domains (trivia and commonsense QA). We find\nthat without PBT, pairs of stronger and weaker models have unstable\nperformance, with the order in which the models present their answers\ndetermining whether the team obtains the stronger or weaker model's\nperformance.

Their algorithms are designed to minimize a\ndistance function between the surfaces by rotating and reparametrizing one of\nthe surfaces, the minimization for reparametrizing based on a gradient descent\napproach that may terminate at a local solution. On the other hand, Bernal and\nLawrence have proposed a similar algorithm, the minimization for\nreparametrizing based on dynamic programming thus producing a partial not\nnecessarily optimal elastic shape registration of the surfaces. Accordingly,\nBernal and Lawrence have proposed to use the rotation and reparametrization\ncomputed with their algorithm as the initial solution to any algorithm based on\na gradient descent approach for reparametrizing.

For instance,\nevaluative work in variation-oriented NLP for English often works with Indian\nEnglish or African-American Venacular English as homogeneous categories (Faisal\net al., 2024; Ziems et al., 2023), yet even within one variety there is\nsubstantial variation. We examine within-dialect variation and show that\nperformance critically varies within categories. We measure speech-to-text\nperformance on Italian dialects, and empirically observe a geographical\nperformance disparity. This disparity correlates substantially (-0.5) with\nlinguistic similarity to the highest performing dialect variety. We\ncross-examine our results against dialectometry methods, and interpret the\nperformance disparity to be due to a bias towards dialects that are more\nsimilar to the standard variety in the speech-to-text model examined.

    "abstract": "A canonical desideratum for prediction problems is that performance\nguarantees should hold not just on average over the population, but also for\nmeaningful subpopulations within the overall population. But what constitutes a\nmeaningful subpopulation? In this work, we take the perspective that relevant\nsubpopulations should be defined with respect to the clusters that naturally\nemerge from the distribution of individuals for which predictions are being\nmade. In this view, a population refers to a mixture model whose components\nconstitute the relevant subpopulations. We suggest two formalisms for capturing\nper-subgroup guarantees: first, by attributing each individual to the component\nfrom which they were most likely drawn, given their features; and second, by\nattributing each individual to all components in proportion to their relative\nlikelihood of having been drawn from each component. Using online calibration\nas a case study, we study a multi-objective algorithm that provides guarantees\nfor each of these formalisms by handling all plausible underlying subpopulation\nstructures simultaneously, and achieve an $O(T^{1/2})$ rate even when the\nsubpopulations are not well-separated. In comparison, the more natural\ncluster-then-predict approach that first recovers the structure of the\nsubpopulations and then makes predictions suffers from a $O(T^{2/3})$ rate and\nrequires the subpopulations to be separable. Along the way, we prove that\nproviding per-subgroup calibration guarantees for underlying clusters can be\neasier than learning the clusters: separation between median subgroup features\nis required for the latter but not the former.",

The agent's goal\nis to simultaneously learn the unknown reward functions and choose the\nhighest-reward arms. For example, the \"reward\" may represent a user's\nprobability of clicking on one of the recommended products. Conventional bandit\nmodels, however, employ restrictive reward function models in order to obtain\nperformance guarantees. We make use of deep neural networks to estimate and\nlearn the unknown reward functions and propose Neural UCB Clustering\n(NeUClust), which adopts a clustering approach to select the super arm in every\nround by exploiting underlying structure in the context space. Unlike prior\nneural bandit works, NeUClust uses a neural network to estimate the super arm\nreward and select the super arm, thus eliminating the need for a known\noptimization oracle. We non-trivially extend prior neural combinatorial bandit\nworks to prove that NeUClust achieves\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\widetilde{d}\\sqrt{T}\\right)$ regret, where $\\widetilde{d}$\nis the effective dimension of a neural tangent kernel matrix, $T$ the number of\nrounds.

We theoretically prove and numerically demonstrate\nthat MomentumSMoE is more stable and robust than SMoE. In particular, we verify\nthe advantages of MomentumSMoE over SMoE on a variety of practical tasks\nincluding ImageNet-1K object recognition and WikiText-103 language modeling. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of MomentumSMoE to many types of SMoE models,\nincluding those in the Sparse MoE model for vision (V-MoE) and the Generalist\nLanguage Model (GLaM). We also show that other advanced momentum-based\noptimization methods, such as Adam, can be easily incorporated into the\nMomentumSMoE framework for designing new SMoE models with even better\nperformance, almost negligible additional computation cost, and simple\nimplementations.",

    "abstract": "This thesis presents an innovative approach to automate video thumbnail\nselection for traditional broadcast content. Our methodology establishes\nstringent criteria for diverse, representative, and aesthetically pleasing\nthumbnails, considering factors like logo placement space, incorporation of\nvertical aspect ratios, and accurate recognition of facial identities and\nemotions. We introduce a sophisticated multistage pipeline that can select\ncandidate frames or generate novel images by blending video elements or using\ndiffusion models. The pipeline incorporates state-of-the-art models for various\ntasks, including downsampling, redundancy reduction, automated cropping, face\nrecognition, closed-eye and emotion detection, shot scale and aesthetic\nprediction, segmentation, matting, and harmonization. It also leverages large\nlanguage models and visual transformers for semantic consistency. A GUI tool\nfacilitates rapid navigation of the pipeline's output. To evaluate our method,\nwe conducted comprehensive experiments. In a study of 69 videos, 53.6% of our\nproposed sets included thumbnails chosen by professional designers, with 73.9%\ncontaining similar images. A survey of 82 participants showed a 45.77%\npreference for our method, compared to 37.99% for manually chosen thumbnails\nand 16.36% for an alternative method. Professional designers reported a\n3.57-fold increase in valid candidates compared to the alternative method,\nconfirming that our approach meets established criteria. In conclusion, our\nfindings affirm that the proposed method accelerates thumbnail creation while\nmaintaining high-quality standards and fostering greater user engagement.",

However, existing\nGCL-based text classification methods often suffer from negative sampling bias,\nwhere similar nodes are incorrectly paired as negative pairs. This can lead to\nover-clustering, where instances of the same class are divided into different\nclusters. To address the over-clustering issue, we propose an innovative\nGCL-based method of graph contrastive learning via cluster-refined negative\nsampling for semi-supervised text classification, namely ClusterText. Firstly,\nwe combine the pre-trained model Bert with graph neural networks to learn text\nrepresentations. Secondly, we introduce a clustering refinement strategy, which\nclusters the learned text representations to obtain pseudo labels. For each\ntext node, its negative sample set is drawn from different clusters.\nAdditionally, we propose a self-correction mechanism to mitigate the loss of\ntrue negative samples caused by clustering inconsistency. By calculating the\nEuclidean distance between each text node and other nodes within the same\ncluster, distant nodes are still selected as negative samples. Our proposed\nClusterText demonstrates good scalable computing, as it can effectively extract\nimportant information from from a large amount of data.

The strong correlation between the particle force and dilatational\nvelocities indicates that particles are accelerated/decelerated while\ntravelling through these travelling wave packets composed of expansive and\ncompressive events, and in return, leading to the weakened dilatational motions\nof the fluid during this process. This correlation further supports the\nelucidation by Yu et al. (J. Fluid.

This issue is relevant to LLMs, which are becoming popular as\nAI co-pilots but suffer from a lack of accessibility due to high computational\ndemand. In this study, we evaluate whether quantization is a viable approach\ntoward enabling LLMs on generic consumer devices. The study assesses the\nperformance of five quantized code LLMs in Lua code generation tasks. To\nevaluate the impact of quantization, the models with 7B parameters were tested\non a consumer laptop at 2-, 4-, and 8-bit integer precisions and compared to\nnon-quantized code LLMs with 1.3, 2, and 3 billion parameters. Lua is chosen as\na low-level resource language to avoid models' biases related to high-resource\nlanguages. The results suggest that the models quantized at the 4-bit integer\nprecision offer the best trade-off between performance and model size. These\nmodels can be comfortably deployed on an average laptop without a dedicated\nGPU. The performance significantly drops at the 2-bit integer precision. The\nmodels at 8-bit integer precision require more inference time that does not\neffectively translate to better performance. The 4-bit models with 7 billion\nparameters also considerably outperform non-quantized models with lower\nparameter numbers despite having comparable model sizes with respect to storage\nand memory demand. While quantization indeed increases the accessibility of\nsmaller LLMs with 7 billion parameters, these LLMs demonstrate overall low\nperformance (less than 50\\%) on high-precision and low-resource tasks such as\nLua code generation.

Additionally, we examine the impact of filtering utilized\nin large eddy simulations (LES) by applying a sharp spectral filter to the DNS\nfields. Our analysis reveals that while instantaneous clustering through the\ncentrifuge mechanism explains clustering at early times, the path history\neffect--the sampling of fluid flow along particle trajectories--becomes\nimportant later on. The filtered fields expose small-scale fractal clustering\nthat cannot be predicted by the instantaneous flow field.

Minimizing the distillation overhead, i.e., the amount of noisy source\nstates required to produce some desired output state within some target error,\nis crucial for the scalability of quantum computation and communication. Here,\nwe show that quantum catalysts -- an additional resource that facilitates the\ntransformation but remains unchanged before and after the process -- can help\nsurpass previously known fundamental limitations on distillation overhead.\nSpecifically, we show that multi-shot distillation protocols can be converted\ninto one-shot catalytic protocols, which hold significant practical benefits,\nwhile maintaining the distillation overhead. In particular, in the context of\nmagic state distillation, our result indicates that the code-based low-overhead\ndistillation protocols that rely on divergingly large batches can be promoted\nto the one-shot setting where the batch volume can be arbitrarily small for any\naccuracy. Combining with very recent results on asymptotically good quantum\ncodes with transversal non-Clifford gates, we demonstrate that magic state\ndistillation with constant overhead can be achieved with controllable output\nsize using catalytic protocols. Furthermore, we demonstrate that catalysis\nenables a spacetime trade-off between overhead and success probability.\nNotably, we show that the optimal constant for constant-overhead catalytic\nmagic state distillation can be reduced to $1$ at the price of compromising the\nsuccess probability by a constant factor. Finally, we present an illustrative\nexample that extends the catalysis techniques to the study of dynamic quantum\nresources. This provides the channel mutual information with a one-shot\noperational interpretation, thereby addressing an open question posed by\nWilming.",

However, their high computational cost is\na significant obstacle for running simulations that probe cosmological volumes\ncomparable to those analyzed by contemporary large-scale structure experiments.\nIn this work, we explore the possibility of obtaining high-precision galaxy\nclustering predictions from small-volume hydrodynamical simulations such as\nMilleniumTNG and FLAMINGO via control variates. In this approach, the\nhydrodynamical full-physics simulation is paired with a matched low-resolution\ngravity-only simulation. By learning the galaxy-halo connection from the\nhydrodynamical simulation and applying it to the gravity-only counterpart, one\nobtains a galaxy population that closely mimics the one in the more expensive\nsimulation. One can then construct an estimator of galaxy clustering that\ncombines the clustering amplitudes in the small-volume hydrodynamical and\ngravity-only simulations with clustering amplitudes in a large-volume\ngravity-only simulation. Depending on the galaxy sample, clustering statistic,\nand scale, this galaxy clustering estimator can have an effective volume of up\nto around $100$ times the volume of the original hydrodynamical simulation in\nthe non-linear regime. With this approach, we can construct galaxy clustering\npredictions from existing simulations that are precise enough for mock analyses\nof next-generation large-scale structure surveys such as the Dark Energy\nSpectroscopic Instrument and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",

Thus, IRS13 appears to be an incidental present-day clumping of\nstars. Furthermore, we show that the velocity dispersion of tidally disrupted\nSCs (the likely origin of IRS13) can be fully accounted for by the tidal forces\nof the central SMBH; the IMBH's influence is not essential.",

To help CSRs regulate their emotions while interacting with uncivil\nclients, we designed Care-Pilot, an LLM-powered assistant, and evaluated its\nefficacy, perception, and use. Our comparative analyses between 665 human and\nCare-Pilot-generated support messages highlight Care-Pilot's ability to adapt\nto and demonstrate empathy in various incivility incidents. Additionally, 143\nCSRs assessed Care-Pilot's empathy as more sincere and actionable than human\nmessages. Finally, we interviewed 20 CSRs who interacted with Care-Pilot in a\nsimulation exercise. They reported that Care-Pilot helped them avoid negative\nthinking, recenter thoughts, and humanize clients; showing potential for\nbridging gaps in coworker support. Yet, they also noted deployment challenges\nand emphasized the indispensability of shared experiences. We discuss future\ndesigns and societal implications of AI-mediated emotional labor, underscoring\nempathy as a critical function for AI assistants for worker mental health.",

The fire-induced wind is introduced by way of a\npiecewise continuous function that ``switches'' in space.

Using geometric methods, we determine the range of\nallowable speeds, refine this range to only those fronts which will persist in\nnature, and develop a selection mechanism to identify the specific wind\nconfiguration corresponding to the most stable solution. For this spectrally\npreferred front, we find that the wind switch occurs ahead of the fireline in a\nmanner consistent with the physics of air entrainment.

Multistable plasticity in the network\nconnections originates from brain dynamics and is based on the idea that neural\ncells may transmit inhibitory or excitatory signals depending on various\nfactors, such as local connectivity, influence of neighboring cells etc. During\nthe system/network integration, the link weights adapt and, in the case of\nmultistability, they may organize in coexisting excitatory and/or inhibitory\ndomains.

In the case of bump and chimera co-existence,\nconfinement effects are developed: the different domains stay localized and do\nnot travel around the network.

The results show a 30% decrease in booking variations together with\ngreater data synchronization as a result of consensus processes and resistant\ndata formations. The approach to the implementation of a blockchain technology\nfor the purpose of this paper includes many APIs for the automatic\nmulti-faceted record-keeping system including the smart contract execution and\ncontrollable end-users approach. Smart contracts organized the processes\nimproving the cycle times by 40% on the average while guaranteeing no breach of\nagreements.

While existing forecasting models offer\nvaluable point predictions, they often lack individual-level uncertainty\nestimates, limiting their usefulness for decision-making. Several approaches\nexist to estimate uncertainty, such as parametric and Bayesian prediction\nintervals, bootstrapping, quantile regression, but these methods often rely on\nrestrictive assumptions, struggle to provide well-calibrated intervals across\nthe full range of outcomes, or are computationally intensive.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first comprehensive interpretability analysis of a\nTransformer-based Sign Language Translation (SLT) model, focusing on the\ntranslation from video-based Greek Sign Language to glosses and text.\nLeveraging the Greek Sign Language Dataset, we examine the attention mechanisms\nwithin the model to understand how it processes and aligns visual input with\nsequential glosses. Our analysis reveals that the model pays attention to\nclusters of frames rather than individual ones, with a diagonal alignment\npattern emerging between poses and glosses, which becomes less distinct as the\nnumber of glosses increases. We also explore the relative contributions of\ncross-attention and self-attention at each decoding step, finding that the\nmodel initially relies on video frames but shifts its focus to previously\npredicted tokens as the translation progresses. This work contributes to a\ndeeper understanding of SLT models, paving the way for the development of more\ntransparent and reliable translation systems essential for real-world\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are no learning-free or neural techniques for real-time\nrecalibration of infrared multi-camera systems. In this paper, we address the\nchallenge of real-time, highly-accurate calibration of multi-camera infrared\nsystems, a critical task for time-sensitive applications. Unlike traditional\ncalibration techniques that lack adaptability and struggle with on-the-fly\nrecalibrations, we propose a neural network-based method capable of dynamic\nreal-time calibration. The proposed method integrates a differentiable\nprojection model that directly correlates 3D geometries with their 2D image\nprojections and facilitates the direct optimization of both intrinsic and\nextrinsic camera parameters. Key to our approach is the dynamic camera pose\nsynthesis with perturbations in camera parameters, emulating realistic\noperational challenges to enhance model robustness. We introduce two model\nvariants: one designed for multi-camera systems with onboard processing of 2D\npoints, utilizing the direct 2D projections of 3D fiducials, and another for\nimage-based systems, employing color-coded projected points for implicitly\nestablishing correspondence. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate\nour method is more accurate than traditional calibration techniques with or\nwithout perturbations while also being real-time, marking a significant leap in\nthe field of real-time multi-camera system calibration.

In this work,\nwe have performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical shearing-box\nnumerical simulations of accretion disc with a hot corona above the cool disc.\nSuch a two-layer, piece-wise isothermal system is vertically stratified under\nlinear gravity and initial conditions here include a strong azimuthal magnetic\nfield with a ratio between the thermal and magnetic pressures being of order\nunity in the disc region. Instabilities in this magnetized system lead to the\ngeneration of turbulence, which, in turn, governs the further evolution of\nmagnetic fields in a self-sustaining manner. Remarkably, the mean toroidal\nmagnetic field undergoes a complete reversal in time by changing its sign, and\nit is predominantly confined within the disc. This is a rather unique class of\nevolution of the magnetic field which has not been reported earlier. Solutions\nof mean magnetic fields here are thus qualitatively different from the\nvertically migrating dynamo waves that are commonly seen in previous works\nwhich model a single layer of an isothermal gas. Effective $\\alpha$ is found to\nhave values between 0.01 and 0.03. We have also made a comparison between\nmodels with Smagorinsky and explicit schemes for the kinematic viscosity\n($\\nu$).

According to our statistics, attacks on cross-chain\nbridges have resulted in losses of nearly 4.3 billion dollars since 2021.\nTherefore, it is particularly necessary to understand and detect attacks on\ncross-chain bridges. In this paper, we collect the largest number of\ncross-chain bridge attack incidents to date, including 49 attacks that occurred\nbetween June 2021 and September 2024. Our analysis reveal that attacks against\ncross-chain business logic cause significantly more damage than those that do\nnot. These cross-chain attacks exhibit different patterns compared to normal\ntransactions in terms of call structure, which effectively indicates potential\nattack behaviors. Given the significant losses in these cases and the scarcity\nof related research, this paper aims to detect attacks against cross-chain\nbusiness logic, and propose the BridgeGuard tool. Specifically, BridgeGuard\nmodels cross-chain transactions from a graph perspective, and employs a\ntwo-stage detection framework comprising global and local graph mining to\nidentify attack patterns in cross-chain transactions. We conduct multiple\nexperiments on the datasets with 203 attack transactions and 40,000 normal\ncross-chain transactions.

One major area of concern relates\nto biased behaviors of LLMs in medical applications, leading to unfair\ntreatment of individuals. To pave the way for the responsible and impactful\ndeployment of Med LLMs, rigorous evaluation is a key prerequisite. Due to the\nhuge complexity and variability of different medical scenarios, existing work\nin this domain has primarily relied on using manually crafted datasets for bias\nevaluation. In this study, we present a new method to scale up such bias\nevaluations by automatically generating test cases based on rigorous medical\nevidence.

To\nthat end, we offer new methods to address these challenges integrated with our\ngenerative pipeline, using medical knowledge graphs, medical ontologies, and\ncustomized general LLM evaluation frameworks in our method. Through a series of\nextensive experiments, we show that the test cases generated by our proposed\nmethod can effectively reveal bias patterns in Med LLMs at larger and more\nflexible scales than human-crafted datasets.

Specifically, for any new unseen\ntask, the goal is to use a successful demonstration of this task by an expert\nagent in its action space to enable a learner agent learn an optimal policy in\nits own different action space with fewer samples than those required if the\nlearner was learning on its own. Existing transfer learning methods across\ndifferent action spaces either require handcrafted mappings between those\naction spaces provided by human experts, which can induce bias in the learning\nprocedure, or require the expert agent to share its policy parameters with the\nlearner agent, which does not generalize well to unseen tasks. In this work, we\npropose a method that learns a subgoal mapping between the expert agent policy\nand the learner agent policy. Since the expert agent and the learner agent have\ndifferent action spaces, their optimal policies can have different subgoal\ntrajectories. We learn this subgoal mapping by training a Long Short Term\nMemory (LSTM) network for a distribution of tasks and then use this mapping to\npredict the learner subgoal sequence for unseen tasks, thereby improving the\nspeed of learning by biasing the agent's policy towards the predicted learner\nsubgoal sequence. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the\nproposed learning scheme can effectively find the subgoal mapping underlying\nthe given distribution of tasks.

Our experiments reveal that corpus poisoning can\nachieve significant attack success rates through the injection of a small\nnumber of compromised documents into the retriever corpus. In contrast,\nbackdoor attacks demonstrate even higher success rates but necessitate a more\ncomplex setup, as the victim must fine-tune the retriever using the attacker\npoisoned dataset.",

The X-rays from XFELs enable Coherent X-ray Diffraction\nImaging (CXDI), where coherent X-rays irradiate a sample, and a far-field\ndiffraction pattern is captured by an imaging detector. By the nature of the\nunderlying physics, the resolution, at which the sample can be probed with the\nCXDI technique, is limited by the wavelength of the X-ray radiation and the\nexposure time if a detector can record the diffraction pattern to very large\nscattering angles. The resolution that can be achieved under real experimental\nconditions, depends strongly on additional parameters. The Shannon pixel size,\nlinked to the detector resolution, the coherent dose that can be deposited in\nthe sample without changing its structure, the image contrast, and the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the detected scattered radiation at high $q$, i.e. at\nhigh scattering angles $2\\Theta$, have a strong influence on the resolution.\nThe signal-to-noise ratio at high $q$ defines the \"effective\" maximum solid\nangle in a specific experiment setup up to which a detector can efficiently\ndetect a signal and in consequence determines the achievable resolution.

Bosonic quantum systems constitute the mathematical model for the\nelectromagnetic radiation in the quantum regime, which provides the most\npromising platform for quantum communication and quantum key distribution.

However, the complexity of driving environments limits the\neffectiveness of many rule-based and machine learning approaches. Reinforcement\nLearning (RL), with its robust self-learning capabilities and environmental\nadaptability, offers a promising solution to these challenges. Nevertheless,\nsafety and efficiency concerns during training hinder its widespread\napplication. To address these concerns, we propose a novel RL framework, Simple\nto Complex Collaborative Decision (S2CD). First, we rapidly train the teacher\nmodel in a lightweight simulation environment. In the more complex and\nrealistic environment, teacher intervenes when the student agent exhibits\nsuboptimal behavior by assessing actions' value to avert dangers. We also\nintroduce an RL algorithm called Adaptive Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization\nPlus, which combines samples from both teacher and student policies and employs\ndynamic clipping strategies based on sample importance. This approach improves\nsample efficiency while effectively alleviating data imbalance. Additionally,\nwe employ the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a policy constraint, transforming\nit into an unconstrained problem with the Lagrangian method to accelerate the\nstudent's learning. Finally, a gradual weaning strategy ensures that the\nstudent learns to explore independently over time, overcoming the teacher's\nlimitations and maximizing performance. Simulation experiments in highway\nlane-change scenarios show that the S2CD framework enhances learning\nefficiency, reduces training costs, and significantly improves safety compared\nto state-of-the-art algorithms. This framework also ensures effective knowledge\ntransfer between teacher and student models, even with suboptimal teachers, the\nstudent achieves superior performance, demonstrating the robustness and\neffectiveness of S2CD.",

The scarcity of labeled ECG data coupled with the\ndiverse nature of clinical inquiries presents a significant challenge for\ndeveloping robust and adaptable ECG diagnostic systems. This work introduces a\nnovel multimodal meta-learning method for few-shot ECG question answering,\naddressing the challenge of limited labeled data while leveraging the rich\nknowledge encoded within large language models (LLMs). Our LLM-agnostic\napproach integrates a pre-trained ECG encoder with a frozen LLM (e.g., LLaMA\nand Gemma) via a trainable fusion module, enabling the language model to reason\nabout ECG data and generate clinically meaningful answers. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate superior generalization to unseen diagnostic tasks\ncompared to supervised baselines, achieving notable performance even with\nlimited ECG leads. For instance, in a 5-way 5-shot setting, our method using\nLLaMA-3.1-8B achieves an accuracy of 84.6%, 77.3%, and 69.6% on single verify,\nchoose and query question types, respectively.

Various methods exist which have potential shortcomings\nor limitations. As a flexible alternative, we propose a flexible empirical\nBayes factor (EBF) for testing for the presence of random effects. Rather than\ntesting whether a variance component equals zero or not, the proposed EBF tests\nthe equivalent assumption of whether all random effects are zero. The Bayes\nfactor is `empirical' because the distribution of the random effects on the\nlower level, which serves as a prior, is estimated from the data as it is part\nof the model. Empirical Bayes factors can be computed using the output from\nclassical (MLE) or Bayesian (MCMC) approaches. Analyses on synthetic data were\ncarried out to assess the general behavior of the criterion. To illustrate the\nmethodology, the EBF is used for testing random effects under various models\nincluding logistic crossed mixed effects models, spatial random effects models,\ndynamic structural equation models, random intercept cross-lagged panel models,\nand nonlinear regression models.",

As the amount\nof vector data grows continuously, it becomes important to support updates to\nvector index, the enabling technique that allows for efficient and accurate\nANNS on vectors. Because of the curse of high dimensionality, it is often\ncostly to identify the right neighbors of a single new vector, a necessary\nprocess for index update. To amortize update costs, existing systems maintain a\nsecondary index to accumulate updates, which are merged by the main index by\nglobal rebuilding the entire index periodically.

At the heart\nof SPFresh is LIRE, a lightweight incremental rebalancing protocol to split\nvector partitions and reassign vectors in the nearby partitions to adapt to\ndata distribution shift. LIRE achieves low-overhead vector updates by only\nreassigning vectors at the boundary between partitions, where in a high-quality\nvector index the amount of such vectors are deemed small. With LIRE, SPFresh\nprovides superior query latency and accuracy to solutions based on global\nrebuild, with only 1% of DRAM and less than 10% cores needed at the peak\ncompared to the state-of-the-art, in a billion scale vector index with 1% of\ndaily vector update rate.",

In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in\na transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change\nfrom a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However,\nsignificant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic\nReynolds number occur depending on the physical properties of the external\nlayers surrounding the flow active domain. The strong influence of the\nelectromagnetic properties of outer layers with the large variation of the\ncritical magnetic Reynolds number can be related to the existence of two\ndifferent branches with dynamo action. In contrast to the kinematic models, the\nnonlinear MHD simulations reveal a small scale dynamo solution with the\nmagnetic energy remaining significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the\nflow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local\nconcentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the\nmagnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5.

Despite the great progress, one critical limitation of current\nbrain decoding research lies in the lack of generalization capability to unseen\nsubjects. Prior works typically focus on decoding brain activity of individuals\nbased on the observation that different subjects exhibit different brain\nactivities, while it remains unclear whether brain decoding can be generalized\nto unseen subjects. This study aims to answer this question. We first\nconsolidate an image-fMRI dataset consisting of stimulus-image and\nfMRI-response pairs, involving 177 subjects in the movie-viewing task of the\nHuman Connectome Project (HCP). This dataset allows us to investigate the brain\ndecoding performance with the increase of participants. We then present a\nlearning paradigm that applies uniform processing across all subjects, instead\nof employing different network heads or tokenizers for individuals as in\nprevious methods, which can accommodate a large number of subjects to explore\nthe generalization capability across different subjects. A series of\nexperiments are conducted and we have the following findings. First, the\nnetwork exhibits clear generalization capabilities with the increase of\ntraining subjects. Second, the generalization capability is common to popular\nnetwork architectures (MLP, CNN and Transformer). Third, the generalization\nperformance is affected by the similarity between subjects. Our findings reveal\nthe inherent similarities in brain activities across individuals. With the\nemerging of larger and more comprehensive datasets, it is possible to train a\nbrain decoding foundation model in the future.

This stretches quantum fluctuations from the onset of inflation to\ncosmological scales, which seed the temperature, polarization and matter\nanisotropies that we observe. However, this paradigm ignores pre-inflationary\nphysics, as shortly before inflation there is the initial big-bang singularity.\nLoop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) is a promising approach to quantum cosmology. Its\nmost outstanding result is that of the resolution of the classical initial\nsingularity in terms of a quantum bounce that connects a contracting branch of\nthe Universe with an expanding one. Consequently, it provides singularity-free\npre-inflationary dynamics. Within this context, it is no longer justified to\nconsider that every mode of the cosmological perturbations reaches the onset of\ninflation in the natural vacuum state of standard cosmology. In fact, some\nmodes might reach it in an excited state, which may leave imprints in their\npower spectra at the end of inflation and therefore in observations of the\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The goal of this thesis is to search for\nsuch imprints from LQC in the CMB. We work in the hybrid approach to\ncosmological perturbations in LQC.",

Identifying the molecular mechanisms and biomarkers linked to\nGBC progression has been a significant challenge in scientific research. Few\nrecent studies have explored the roles of biomarkers in GBC. Our study aimed to\nidentify biomarkers in GBC using machine learning (ML) and bioinformatics\ntechniques. We compared GBC tumor samples with normal samples to identify\ndifferentially expressed genes (DEGs) from two microarray datasets (GSE100363,\nGSE139682) obtained from the NCBI GEO database. A total of 146 DEGs were found,\nwith 39 up-regulated and 107 down-regulated genes. Functional enrichment\nanalysis of these DEGs was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) terms and\nREACTOME pathways through DAVID. The protein-protein interaction network was\nconstructed using the STRING database. To identify hub genes, we applied three\nranking algorithms: Degree, MNC, and Closeness Centrality. The intersection of\nhub genes from these algorithms yielded 11 hub genes. Simultaneously, two\nfeature selection methods (Pearson correlation and recursive feature\nelimination) were used to identify significant gene subsets. We then developed\nML models using SVM and RF on the GSE100363 dataset, with validation on\nGSE139682, to determine the gene subset that best distinguishes GBC samples.\nThe hub genes outperformed the other gene subsets. Finally, NTRK2, COL14A1,\nSCN4B, ATP1A2, SLC17A7, SLIT3, COL7A1, CLDN4, CLEC3B, ADCYAP1R1, and MFAP4 were\nidentified as crucial genes, with SLIT3, COL7A1, and CLDN4 being strongly\nlinked to GBC development and prediction.",

The planet formation process\ntakes place in the interior of dusty disks, which offer us only limited\nobservational constraints. Historically, the two main paradigms describing\nplanet formation are the disk instability and core accretion models. In the\nformer giant planets condense directly form a disk massive enough to fragments\nunder its own self-gravity. In contrast, the core accretion model follows a\nbottom-up approach driven by the growth of solid bodies. The core accretion\nmodel includes the direct growth phase, where pebble and possibly planetesimal\nsized bodies form by surface-driven processes. Alternatively, planetesimal\nbodies can emerge from instabilities in the solid population, leading to the\nformation of clumps that ultimately collapse. The later stages of the core\naccretion model involve the emergence of protoplanets from the planetesimal\npopulation, which accretes smaller bodies|planetesimals or pebbles|before\nultimately accreting freely the gas of the disk.

In the absence of superconductivity, its\nground state is a non-Fermi liquid, whose properties are controlled by the HK\ninteraction. Our protocol involves quantum quenching the HK interaction but\nleaving the interaction responsible for superconductivity unchanged. We map out\nthe non-equilibrium dynamical phase diagram of the interacting model which\ncontains three phases where, at long times, the order parameter amplitude\nvanishes, approaches a constant value or persistently oscillates. We also\ninvestigate the Loschmidt echo in searching for dynamical quantum phase\ntransition, and find that its non-analytic temporal behaviour is close but does\nnot match exactly the vanishing of the order parameter.

    "abstract": "Early identification of patients at risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is\ncrucial for effective preventive care, reducing healthcare burden, and\nimproving patients' quality of life. This study demonstrates the potential of\nretinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging combined with fundus\nphotographs for identifying future adverse cardiac events. We used data from\n977 patients who experienced CVD within a 5-year interval post-image\nacquisition, alongside 1,877 control participants without CVD, totaling 2,854\nsubjects. We propose a novel binary classification network based on a\nMulti-channel Variational Autoencoder (MCVAE), which learns a latent embedding\nof patients' fundus and OCT images to classify individuals into two groups:\nthose likely to develop CVD in the future and those who are not. Our model,\ntrained on both imaging modalities, achieved promising results (AUROC 0.78 +/-\n0.02, accuracy 0.68 +/- 0.002, precision 0.74 +/- 0.02, sensitivity 0.73 +/-\n0.02, and specificity 0.68 +/- 0.01), demonstrating its efficacy in identifying\npatients at risk of future CVD events based on their retinal images. This study\nhighlights the potential of retinal OCT imaging and fundus photographs as\ncost-effective, non-invasive alternatives for predicting cardiovascular disease\nrisk. The widespread availability of these imaging techniques in optometry\npractices and hospitals further enhances their potential for large-scale CVD\nrisk screening. Our findings contribute to the development of standardized,\naccessible methods for early CVD risk identification, potentially improving\npreventive care strategies and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "When tracking maneuvering targets, model-driven approaches encounter\ndifficulties in comprehensively delineating complex real-world scenarios and\nare prone to model mismatch when the targets maneuver. Meanwhile, contemporary\ndata-driven methods have overlooked measurements' confidence, markedly\nescalating the challenge of fitting a mapping from measurement sequences to\ntarget state sequences. To address these issues, this paper presents a deep\nmaneuvering target tracking methodology based on target state space projection.\nThe proposed methodology initially establishes a projection from the target\nmeasurement sequence to the target state space by formulating the probability\ndensity function of measurement error and samples the distribution information\nof measurement noise within the target state space as a measurement\nrepresentation. Under this representation, the sequential regression task of\ntarget state estimation can be transmuted into a task of detecting the target\nlocation in the state space. Subsequently, a deep detection network is devised\nto accomplish target location detection in the target state space. Finally, a\nloss function is designed to facilitate the network's training for attaining\nthe desired network performance. Simulation experiments suggest that the\nproposed method can maintain satisfactory tracking performance even when the\ntarget maneuvers, and can rapidly converge and achieve higher estimation\naccuracy compared with existing methods after the target maneuvers.",

While in reality, the set of agents and items may vary,\nprevious works have studied static settings, where no change can occur in the\nsystem. We initiate and develop a formal model to understand fair division\nunder the variable input setting: here, there is an EF1 allocation that gets\ndisrupted because of the loss/deletion of an item, or the arrival of a new\nagent, resulting in a near-EF1 allocation. The objective is to perform a\nsequence of transfers of items between agents to regain EF1 fairness by\ntraversing only via near-EF1 allocations. We refer to this as the\nEF1-Restoration problem.\n  In this work, we present algorithms for the above problem when agents have\nidentical monotone valuations, and items are either all goods or all chores.\nBoth of these algorithms achieve an optimal number of transfers (at most $m/n$,\nwhere $m$ and $n$ are the number of items and agents respectively) for\nidentical additive valuations. Next, we consider a valuation class with\ngraphical structure, introduced by Christodoulou et al. (EC'23), where each\nitem is valued by at most two agents, and hence can be seen as an edge between\nthese two agents in a graph. Here, we consider EF1 orientations on\n(multi)graphs - allocations in which each item is allocated to an agent who\nvalues it. While considering EF1 orientations on multi-graphs with additive\nbinary valuations, we present an optimal algorithm for the EF1-Restoration\nproblem. Finally, for monotone binary valuations, we show that the problem of\ndeciding whether EF1-Restoration is possible is PSPACE-complete.",

We demonstrate the robustness of joint extraction\nby comparing the link lengths extracted on real cattle mobbing and walking\nwithin a race.

However, operating a bubble curtain is costly.\nTherefore optimizing the acoustic effect of the available air is important. An\ninteresting approach is to split the airflow rate into two separate bubble\ncurtains, rather than one single curtain. This concept is tested experimentally\nand numerically. The experiments and the model show an increase in performance\nof the compressed air when it is split between two manifolds. An increased\ninsertion loss of up to 11dB is measured. This increase in performance is\npossibly due to the fact that the reflective properties of the bubble curtains\nare maintained when halving the airflow rate. In effect, by splitting the\nairflow a second acoustic barrier is added. Additionally, the variations in the\nbubble curtain performance between individual measurements are shown to be\nlargely caused by temporal variations in the air distribution. The\napplicability of equivalent fluid models for bubble curtains is discussed, and\nit is shown that accounting for a gap in the bubble curtain, close to the\nmanifold where the bubble curtain is not fully developed, results in better\nagreement between the modelled and the measured insertion loss.",

A key\ndifficulty that arises in sampling from the model is the existence of a\nmetastability window $(\\beta_u,\\beta_u')$ where the distribution has two\ncompeting modes, the so-called disordered and ordered phases, causing\nMCMC-based algorithms to be slow mixing from worst-case initialisations.\n  To this end, Helmuth, Jenssen and Perkins designed a sampling algorithm that\nworks for all $\\beta$ when $q$ is large, using cluster expansion methods; more\nrecently, their analysis technique has been adapted to show that random-cluster\ndynamics mixes fast when initialised more judiciously. However, a bottleneck\nbehind cluster-expansion arguments is that they inherently only work for large\n$q$, whereas it is widely conjectured that sampling is possible for all\n$q,d\\geq 3$. The only result so far that applies to general $q,d\\geq 3$ is by\nBlanca and Gheissari who showed that the random-cluster dynamics mixes fast for\n$\\beta<\\beta_u$. For $\\beta>\\beta_u$, certain correlation phenomena emerge\nbecause of the metastability which have been hard to handle, especially for\nsmall $q$ and $d$.\n  Our main contribution is to perform a delicate analysis of the Potts\ndistribution and the random-cluster dynamics that goes beyond the threshold\n$\\beta_u$. We use planting as the main tool in our proofs, and combine it with\nthe analysis of random-cluster dynamics. We are thus able to show that the\nrandom-cluster dynamics initialised from all-out mixes fast for all integers\n$q,d\\geq 3$ beyond the uniqueness threshold $\\beta_u$; our analysis works all\nthe way up to the threshold $\\beta_c\\in (\\beta_u,\\beta_u')$ where the dominant\nmode switches from disordered to ordered. We also obtain an algorithm in the\nordered regime $\\beta>\\beta_c$ that refines significantly the range of $q,d$.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an integrated framework for coordinating multiple\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a distributed manner to persistently enclose\nand track a moving target without relying on external localization systems. The\nproposed framework consists of three modules: cooperative state estimators,\ncircular formation pattern generators, and formation tracking controllers. In\nthe cooperative state estimation module, a recursive least squares estimator\n(RLSE) for estimating the relative positions between UAVs is integrated with a\ndistributed Kalman filter (DKF), enabling a persistent estimation of the\ntarget's state. When a UAV loses direct measurements of the target due to\nenvironmental occlusion, measurements from neighbors are aligned into the UAV's\nlocal frame to provide indirect measurements. The second module focuses on\nplanning a desired circular formation pattern using a coupled oscillator model.\nThis pattern ensures an even distribution of UAVs around a circle that encloses\nthe moving target. The persistent excitation property of the circular formation\nis crucial for achieving convergence in the first module. Finally, a\nconsensus-based formation controller is designed to enable multiple UAVs to\nasymptotically track the planned circular formation pattern while ensuring\nbounded control inputs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed\nframework ensures asymptotic tracking of a target with constant velocity. For a\ntarget with varying velocity, the tracking error converges to a bounded region\nrelated to the target's maximum acceleration. Simulations and experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

A significant population of these baryons,\nfor a long time referred to as `missing', resides in a low density, warm-hot\nintergalactic medium (WHIM) outside galaxy clusters, tracing the ``cosmic\nweb'', a network of large scale dark matter filaments. Various studies have\ndetected this inter-cluster gas, both by stacking and by observing individual\nfilaments in compact, massive systems. In this paper, we study short filaments\n(< 10 Mpc) connecting massive clusters ($M_{500} \\approx 3\\times 10^{14}\nM_{\\odot}$) detected by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) using the\nscattering of CMB light off the ionised gas, a phenomenon known as the thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect. The first part of this work is a search for\nsuitable candidates for high resolution follow-up tSZ observations. We identify\nfour cluster pairs with an intercluster signal above the noise floor (S/N $>$\n2), including two with a tentative $>2\\sigma$ statistical significance for an\nintercluster bridge from the ACT data alone. In the second part of this work,\nstarting from the same cluster sample, we directly stack on ${\\sim}100$ cluster\npairs and observe an excess SZ signal between the stacked clusters of\n$y=(7.2^{+2.3}_{-2.5})\\times 10^{-7}$ with a significance of $3.3\\sigma$.

We compare this to the\nsignal from simulated cluster pairs with similar redshifts and separations in\nthe THE300 and MAGNETICUM Pathfinder cosmological simulations and find broad\nconsistency.

Collisions between the plasma and the\nmolecules play an important role in the detachment process. Studies of\nplasma-molecular kinetics indicate that the gas temperature is increased during\ndetachment for a wide range of conditions on the MAST-U and TCV tokamaks. This\nis related to an increased $\\mathrm{D}_2$ lifetime during detachment, leading\nto more plasma-molecule collisions that raise the molecular temperature. Such\ncollisions subsequently result in significant power and momentum losses to the\ndivertor plasma during detachment. Using a simplified inference, these losses\nare estimated using the rotational temperature, neutral pressure and ionisation\nfront position. Significant power losses (about $10\\%$ of $P_{SOL}$) and\ndominant momentum losses (majority of the upstream pressure) from\nplasma-molecule collisions are inferred experimentally in long-legged, strongly\nbaffled, detached divertors (MAST-U Super-X divertor), consistent with\nSOLPS-ITER simulations. The vibrational distribution obtained is compared to a\ncollisional-radiative model setup using the same rate data as SOLPS-ITER,\nindicating some qualitative agreements and disagreements, potentially\nhighlighting model gaps with regard to the default rates used.\n  These interpretations highlight the importance of plasma-molecular\ncollisions, leading to power and momentum losses during detachment.

Further nonlinear transformation is\nfound to consist of two phases: fast partner separation, resulting in a\ndeceleration of the eastward drift, and subsequent slow separation with a\nsaturated asymmetric mode accompanied by much weaker, shorter Rossby waves.\nThis weakly radiating phase -- with pulsating partners and homogenized\npotential vorticity between the core and the separatrix -- can be considered as\na new type of long-lived dipole. Conversely, when no $\\beta$-effect is present\nin the upper layer, the dipoles remain nearly symmetric, even when the\ntopographic $\\beta$-effect is present in the active lower layer.

However, achieving satisfactory bokeh effect usually\npresents significant challenge, since mobile cameras with restricted optical\nsystems are constrained, while expensive high-end DSLR lens with large aperture\nshould be needed. Therefore, many deep learning-based computational photography\nmethods have been developed to mimic the bokeh effect in recent years.\nNevertheless, most of these methods were limited to rendering bokeh effect in\ncertain single aperture. There lacks user-friendly bokeh rendering method that\ncan provide precise focal plane control and customised bokeh generation.

Experimental results on\npublic EBB! benchmark dataset and our constructed dataset VABD have\ndemonstrated that the customized focal plane together aperture prompt can\nbootstrap model to simulate realistic bokeh effect.

    "abstract": "Model merging-based multitask learning (MTL) offers a promising approach for\nperforming MTL by merging multiple expert models without requiring access to\nraw training data. However, in this paper, we examine the merged model's\nrepresentation distribution and uncover a critical issue of \"representation\nbias\". This bias arises from a significant distribution gap between the\nrepresentations of the merged and expert models, leading to the suboptimal\nperformance of the merged MTL model. To address this challenge, we first\npropose a representation surgery solution called Surgery. Surgery is a\nlightweight, task-specific module that aligns the final layer representations\nof the merged model with those of the expert models, effectively alleviating\nbias and improving the merged model's performance. Despite these improvements,\na performance gap remains compared to the traditional MTL method. Further\nanalysis reveals that representation bias phenomena exist at each layer of the\nmerged model, and aligning representations only in the last layer is\ninsufficient for fully reducing systemic bias because biases introduced at each\nlayer can accumulate and interact in complex ways. To tackle this, we then\npropose a more comprehensive solution, deep representation surgery (also called\nSurgeryV2), which mitigates representation bias across all layers, and thus\nbridges the performance gap between model merging-based MTL and traditional\nMTL. Finally, we design an unsupervised optimization objective to optimize both\nthe Surgery and SurgeryV2 modules. Our experimental results show that\nincorporating these modules into state-of-the-art (SOTA) model merging schemes\nleads to significant performance gains. Notably, our SurgeryV2 scheme reaches\nalmost the same level as individual expert models or the traditional MTL model.\nThe code is available at \\url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/SurgeryV2}.",

Next, through patching intermediate representations,\nwe localize the role of language during recall, finding that subject enrichment\nis language-independent, while object extraction is language-dependent.\nAdditionally, we discover that the last token representation acts as a Function\nVector (FV), encoding both the language of the query and the content to be\nextracted from the subject. Furthermore, in decoder-only LLMs, FVs compose\nthese two pieces of information in two separate stages. These insights reveal\nunique mechanisms in multilingual LLMs for recalling information, highlighting\nthe need for new methodologies -- such as knowledge evaluation, fact editing,\nand knowledge acquisition -- that are specifically tailored for multilingual\nLLMs.",

During training, missing labels are\nimputed as part of the forward propagation process, while during inference,\nlabels are predicted jointly as unknowns of a bivariate system of equations.\nOur theoretical analysis guarantees the feasibility of DLL, and extensive\nexperiments are conducted to verify that by explicitly modeling label\ncorrelation and maximizing label utility, our method makes consistently better\nprediction than baseline approaches by up to 9.6% gain in F1-score or 10.2%\nreduction in MAPE. Remarkably, DLL maintains robust performance at a label\nmissing rate of up to 60%, achieving even better results than baseline\napproaches at lower missing rates down to only 10%.",

    "abstract": "Recently, multi-class anomaly classification has garnered increasing\nattention. Previous methods directly cluster anomalies but often struggle due\nto the lack of anomaly-prior knowledge. Acquiring this knowledge faces two\nissues: the non-prominent and weak-semantics anomalies. In this paper, we\npropose AnomalyNCD, a multi-class anomaly classification network compatible\nwith different anomaly detection methods. To address the non-prominence of\nanomalies, we design main element binarization (MEBin) to obtain\nanomaly-centered images, ensuring anomalies are learned while avoiding the\nimpact of incorrect detections. Next, to learn anomalies with weak semantics,\nwe design mask-guided representation learning, which focuses on isolated\nanomalies guided by masks and reduces confusion from erroneous inputs through\ncorrected pseudo labels. Finally, to enable flexible classification at both\nregion and image levels, we develop a region merging strategy that determines\nthe overall image category based on the classified anomaly regions. Our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art works on the MVTec AD and MTD datasets.\nCompared with the current methods, AnomalyNCD combined with zero-shot anomaly\ndetection method achieves a 10.8% $F_1$ gain, 8.8% NMI gain, and 9.5% ARI gain\non MVTec AD, and 12.8% $F_1$ gain, 5.7% NMI gain, and 10.8% ARI gain on MTD.\nCode is available at https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/AnomalyNCD.",

In this study, we post-process high-resolution\nsimulations of outflows from the QED simulation suite to generate synthetic\nX-ray spectra from galactic winds, which we then analyse using standard\nobservational procedures, in order to search for detectable markers of wind\nmixing.

We explore how this\nsignature results from imperfect mixing and the extent to which measurements of\nit can be used to diagnose the level of mixing in winds. We determine the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements for such measurements to be reliable,\nand provide a simple quantitative model that can be used to connect metallicity\ngradients to mixing between the hot ($T>10^{6}$ K) and cold ($T<10^{4}$ K)\nphases in observations that reach the required SNR, providing a framework to\ninterpret current and future observations.",

Since its discovery, it has been mainly studied from the\nperspective of dynamics, but a detailed chemical study is necessary to\nunderstand its nature and the composition of the natal clouds that gave rise to\nit. In this paper we used some of the connected young open clusters (age\n$\\lesssim$ 100 Myr) as tracers of the molecular clouds. We performed\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy with GIARPS at the TNG of 53 stars that are bona\nfide members of seven clusters located at different positions along the\nRadcliffe Wave. We provide radial velocities and atmospheric parameters for all\nof them. For a subsample consisting of 41 FGK stars we also studied the\nchromospheric activity and the content of Li, from which we inferred the age of\nthe parent clusters. These values agree with the evolutionary ages reported in\nthe literature. For these FGK stars we determined the chemical abundances for\n25 species.

These angular guidance inputs employ a bearing\nangle bisector term and an elliptic shaping angle term, which directs the\nquadrotor towards the centroid of the window. Detailed stability analysis of\nthe resulting kinematics demonstrates that all quadrotor trajectories lead to\nthe centroid of the window along a direction which is normal to the window\nplane. A qualitative comparison with existing traversal methodologies showcases\nthe superiority of the proposed guidance approach with regard to the nature of\ninformation, computations for generating the guidance commands, and flexibility\nof replanning the traversal path. Realistic simulations considering six\ndegree-of-freedom quadrotor model and Monte Carlo studies validate the\neffectiveness, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed guidance solution.\nRepresentative flight validation trials are carried out using an indoor motion\ncapture system.",

Our focus is on photon spheres, which serve as markers for\nstable and unstable photon spheres. We confirm the validity of the WGC by\ndemonstrating that quantum corrections do not alter the essential\ncharge-to-mass ratio, thereby supporting the conjecture's universality. Our\nanalysis reveals that black holes with a charge greater than their mass ($Q >\nM$) possess photon spheres or exhibit a total topological charge of the photon\nsphere (PS = -1), which upholds the WGC. This finding is significant as it\nreinforces the conjecture's applicability even in the presence of quantum\ncorrections. Furthermore, we examine various parameter configurations to\nunderstand their impact on the WGC. Specifically, we find that configurations\nwith $\\omega = -\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\omega = -1$ maintain the conjecture,\nindicating that these values do not disrupt the charge-to-mass ratio required\nby the WGC. However, for $\\omega = -\\frac{4}{3}$, the conjecture does not hold,\nsuggesting that this particular parameter value leads to deviations from the\nexpected behavior. These results open new directions for research in quantum\ngravity, as they highlight the importance of specific parameter values in\nmaintaining the WGC. The findings suggest that while the WGC is robust under\ncertain conditions, there are scenarios where it may be challenged, prompting\nfurther investigation into the underlying principles of quantum gravity",

The inherent\ndynamism and stochastic characteristics of edge and cloud computing, along with\nIoT applications, necessitate solutions that are highly adaptive.

However, they require a large amount of\nexperience and training time to reach a suitable solution. Moreover, many IoT\napplications contain multiple interdependent tasks, imposing additional\nconstraints on the scheduling problem. To overcome these challenges, we propose\na Transformer-enhanced Distributed DRL scheduling technique, called TF-DDRL, to\nadaptively schedule heterogeneous IoT applications. This technique follows the\nActor-Critic architecture, scales efficiently to multiple distributed servers,\nand employs an off-policy correction method to stabilize the training process.\nIn addition, Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) and Transformer techniques are\nintroduced to reduce exploration costs and capture long-term dependencies for\nfaster convergence.

A\nsmall subgroup that exhibits both hydrogen and helium lines in their spectra,\nthe so-called hybrid (or DAO) WDs, represents the majority of hydrogen-rich WDs\nat effective temperatures $T_{eff}$ $\\approx$ 100 kK. We aim to understand the\nspectral evolution of hot hybrid WDs. Although small in number, they represent\nan evolutionary phase for most ($\\approx$ 75 %) WDs. We conducted a nonlocal\nthermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) analysis with fully metal line blanketed model\natmospheres for the ultraviolet (UV) and optical spectra of a sample of 19 DA\nand 13 DAO WDs with $T_{eff}$ $>$ 60 kK. The UV spectra allow us to precisely\nmeasure the temperature through model fits to metal lines in different\nionization stages. This enables us to place the WDs accurately on the cooling\nsequence. In contrast to earlier studies that typically relied on temperature\nmeasurements made from hydrogen lines alone, all DAOs in our sample are clearly\nhotter than the DAs. DAOs transform into DAs when they cool to $T_{eff}$\n$\\approx$ 75$-$85 kK, depending on their mass. Along the cooling sequence, we\nwitness a gradual decrease in the abundance of helium and the CNO elements in\nthe DAOs due to gravitational settling. Simultaneously, iron and nickel\nabundances increase up to the transition region because radiative forces act\nmore efficiently on them. This is followed by a steady decline.

The magnetic properties of a multilayer of an\narbitrary number of Kitaev honeycomb layers stacked on top of each other\ncoupled through a Heisenberg interaction, J, is analyzed through Abrikosov\nfermion mean-field theory. The system sustains quantum spin liquid (QSL)\nsolutions which have different character depending on parity of the number of\nlayers. While in even layered Kitaev models a gapped QSL emerges, odd-layered\nmodels host gapless QSLs. The projective symmetry group analysis of these\nsolutions unravel a layer-to-layer inversion symmetry rather than an expected\nreflection. Although these QSLs retain features of the single layer Kitaev spin\nliquid (KSL), they should be regarded hybrid QSLs consisting on several KSLs.\nThe good agreement at large-J between the energy of the Gutzwiller projected\nmean-field QSL and the exact energy indicates that such QSL Ansatz is\nadiabatically connected to the exact ground state.

Lastly, within the constraint of\nonly the eye region being visible, robots with more human-like features\nsignificantly enhance emotion recognition.",

In\norder to circumvent these issues, we propose a new task, namely, Critical\nQuestions Generation, consisting of processing an argumentative text to\ngenerate the critical questions (CQs) raised by it. In argumentation theory CQs\nare tools designed to lay bare the blind spots of an argument by pointing at\nthe information it could be missing. Thus, instead of trying to deploy LLMs to\nproduce knowledgeable and relevant counterarguments, we use them to question\narguments, without requiring any external knowledge. Research on CQs Generation\nusing LLMs requires a reference dataset for large scale experimentation. Thus,\nin this work we investigate two complementary methods to create such a\nresource: (i) instantiating CQs templates as defined by Walton's argumentation\ntheory and (ii), using LLMs as CQs generators. By doing so, we contribute with\na procedure to establish what is a valid CQ and conclude that, while LLMs are\nreasonable CQ generators, they still have a wide margin for improvement in this\ntask.",

To fill this research gap, this\nwork aims to automatically generate charts to accurately convey the underlying\ndata and ideas to readers, which is essentially a challenging task. The\nchallenges originate from text ambiguities, intrinsic sparsity and uncertainty\nof data in text documents, and subjective sentiment differences. Specifically,\nwe propose ChartifyText, a novel fully-automated approach that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to convert complex data-involved texts to expressive\ncharts. It consists of two major modules: tabular data inference and expressive\nchart generation. The tabular data inference module employs systematic prompt\nengineering to guide the LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to infer table data, where data\nranges, uncertainties, missing data values and corresponding subjective\nsentiments are explicitly considered. The expressive chart generation module\naugments standard charts with intuitive visual encodings and concise texts to\naccurately convey the underlying data and insights. We extensively evaluate the\neffectiveness of ChartifyText on real-world data-involved text documents\nthrough case studies, in-depth interviews with three visualization experts, and\na carefully-designed user study with 15 participants.

However, the Jeffreys centroid is not available in\nclosed-form for sets of categorical or normal distributions, two widely used\nstatistical models, and thus need to be approximated numerically in practice.\nIn this paper, we first propose the new Jeffreys-Fisher-Rao center defined as\nthe Fisher-Rao midpoint of the sided Kullback-Leibler centroids as a plug-in\nreplacement of the Jeffreys centroid. This Jeffreys-Fisher-Rao center admits a\ngeneric formula for uni-parameter exponential family distributions, and\nclosed-form formula for categorical and normal distributions, matches exactly\nthe Jeffreys centroid for same-mean normal distributions, and is experimentally\nobserved in practice to be close to the Jeffreys centroid. Second, we define a\nnew type of inductive centers generalizing the principle of Gauss\narithmetic-geometric double sequence mean for pairs of densities of any given\nexponential family. This center is shown experimentally to approximate very\nwell the Jeffreys centroid and is suggested to use when the Jeffreys-Fisher-Rao\ncenter is not available in closed form. Moreover, this Gauss-Bregman inductive\ncenter always converges and matches the Jeffreys centroid for sets of same-mean\nnormal distributions. We report on our experiments demonstrating the use of the\nJeffreys-Fisher-Rao and Gauss-Bregman centers instead of the Jeffreys centroid.\nFinally, we conclude this work by reinterpreting these fast proxy centers of\nJeffreys centroids under the lens of dually flat spaces in information\ngeometry.",

However, the\nsecurity issues of generated code have not been fully addressed, and the\nusability of LLMs in code generation still requires further exploration.\n  This work introduces SecCode, a framework that leverages an innovative\ninteractive encouragement prompting (EP) technique for secure code generation\nwith \\textit{only NL} prompts. This approach ensures that the prompts can be\neasily shared and understood by general users. SecCode functions through three\nstages: 1) Code Generation using NL Prompts; 2) Code Vulnerability Detection\nand Fixing, utilising our proposed encouragement prompting; 3) Vulnerability\nCross-Checking and Code Security Refinement. These stages are executed in\nmultiple interactive iterations to progressively enhance security. By using\nboth proprietary LLMs (i.e., GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 and GPT-4o) and open-source\nLLMs (i.e., Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, DeepSeek Coder V2 Lite Instruct) evaluated\non three benchmark datasets, extensive experimental results show that our\nproposed SecCode greatly outperforms compared baselines, generating secure code\nwith a high vulnerability correction rate. For example, SecCode exhibits a high\nfix success rate of over 76\\% after running 5 automated EP interactive\niterations and over 89\\% after running 10 automated EP interactive iterations.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to formulate secure code\ngeneration with NL prompts only.

In this paper, we compute and\nanalyze Complete-Information Optimal policy Solutions (CIOSs), of an exact\nperfect anticipation algorithm with full knowledge of future customer orders'\narrival times and items, for picking operations in picker-to-parts warehouses.\nWe provide analytical properties and leverage CIOSs to uncover decision\npatterns that enhance simpler algorithms, improving both makespan (costs) and\norder turnover (delivery speed). Using a metric similar to the gap to\noptimality, we quantify the gains from optimization elements and the\nimprovements remaining for advanced anticipation mechanisms. To compute CIOSs,\nwe design the first exact algorithm for the Order Batching, Sequencing, and\nRouting Problem with Release Times (OBSRP-R), based on dynamic programming. Our\nanalysis advises on the largely overlooked intervention - the dynamic\nadjustment of started batches, and the strategic relocation of an idle picker\ntowards future picking locations. The former affected over 60% of CIOS orders\nand triggered consistent improvements across warehousing policies. The latter\noccurred before 39%-62% CIOS orders and could decrease a myopic policy's gap to\noptimal turnover by 4.3% on average (up to 14%).

While\nthese determinations have primarily focused on the Galactic plane, the Gaia DR3\ndata also offer information about off-plane velocity components. By assuming\nthe Milky Way is in a state of Jeans equilibrium, we derived the generalized\nrotation curve for radial distances spanning from 8.5 kpc to 25 kpc and\nvertical heights ranging from -2 kpc to 2 kpc. These measurements were employed\nto constrain the matter distribution using two distinct mass models. The first\nis the canonical NFW halo model, while the second, the dark matter disk (DMD)\nmodel, posits that dark matter is confined to the Galactic plane and follows\nthe distribution of neutral hydrogen.

However, despite their initial success, most latent diffusion\nmethods rely on fixed pretrained embeddings, limiting the benefits of joint\ntraining with the diffusion model. While jointly learning the embedding (via\nreconstruction loss) and the latent diffusion model (via score matching loss)\ncould enhance performance, end-to-end training risks embedding collapse,\ndegrading generation quality. To mitigate this issue, we introduce VQ-LCMD, a\ncontinuous-space latent diffusion framework within the embedding space that\nstabilizes training. VQ-LCMD uses a novel training objective combining the\njoint embedding-diffusion variational lower bound with a consistency-matching\n(CM) loss, alongside a shifted cosine noise schedule and random dropping\nstrategy. Experiments on several benchmarks show that the proposed VQ-LCMD\nyields superior results on FFHQ, LSUN Churches, and LSUN Bedrooms compared to\ndiscrete-state latent diffusion models. In particular, VQ-LCMD achieves an FID\nof 6.81 for class-conditional image generation on ImageNet with 50 steps.",

Next, Tone\n(2002) developed the SBM super-efficiency model in order to differentiate and\nrank efficient DMUs, whose SBM efficiency scores are always $1$. However, as\npointed out by Chen (2013), some interpretation problems arise when the\nso-called super-efficiency projections are weakly efficient, leading to an\noverestimation of the SBM super-efficiency score. Moreover, this overestimation\nis closely related to discontinuity issues when implementing SBM\nsuper-efficiency in conjunction with SBM efficiency. Chen (2013) and Chen et\nal. (2019) treated these problems, but they did not arrive to a fully\nsatisfactory solution. In this paper, we review these papers and propose a new\ncomplementary score, called composite SBM, that actually fixes the\ndiscontinuity problems by counteracting the overestimation of the SBM\nsuper-efficiency score.

The initial superfluid state is described approximately using both the\nBogoliubov theory and the Gaussian variational principle. The subsequent time\nevolution remains Gaussian, and we compare the results from each approximation\nof the initial state by examining different aspects of the dynamics. First, we\nanalyze the entanglement entropy and observe that, in both cases, it increases\nlinearly with time before reaching a saturation point. This behavior is\nattributed to the propagation of entangled pairs of quantum depletions in the\nsuperfluid state. Next, we explore the fate of particle-number symmetry, which\nis spontaneously broken in the superfluid phase. To do so, we use the\nentanglement asymmetry, a recently introduced observable that enables us to\ntrack symmetry breaking within a subsystem. We observe that its evolution\nvaries qualitatively depending on the theory used to describe the initial\nstate. However, in both cases, the symmetry remains broken and is never\nrestored in the stationary state. Finally, we assess the time it takes to reach\nthe stationary state by evaluating the quantum fidelity between the stationary\nreduced density matrix and the time-evolved one. Interestingly, within the\nGaussian variational principle, we find that an initial state further from the\nstationary state can relax more quickly than one closer to it, indicating the\npresence of the recently discovered quantum Mpemba effect.

    "abstract": "Peer grading is an educational system in which students assess each other's\nwork. It is commonly applied under Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and\noffline classroom settings. With this system, instructors receive a reduced\ngrading workload, and students enhance their understanding of course materials\nby grading others' work. Peer grading data have a complex dependence structure,\nfor which all the peer grades may be dependent. This complex dependence\nstructure is due to a network structure of peer grading, where each student can\nbe viewed as a vertex of the network, and each peer grade serves as an edge\nconnecting one student as a grader to another student as an examinee. This\npaper introduces a latent variable model framework for analyzing peer grading\ndata and develops a fully Bayesian procedure for its statistical inference.\nThis framework has several advantages. First, when aggregating multiple peer\ngrades, the average score and other simple summary statistics fail to account\nfor grader effects and, thus, can be biased. The proposed approach produces\nmore accurate model parameter estimates and, therefore, more accurate\naggregated grades, by modeling the heterogeneous grading behavior with latent\nvariables. Second, the proposed method provides a way to assess each student's\nperformance as a grader, which may be used to identify a pool of reliable\ngraders or generate feedback to help students improve their grading. Third, our\nmodel may further provide insights into the peer grading system by answering\nquestions such as whether a student who performs better in coursework also\ntends to be a more reliable grader. Finally, thanks to the Bayesian approach,\nuncertainty quantification is straightforward when inferring the\nstudent-specific latent variables as well as the structural parameters of the\nmodel. The proposed method is applied to two real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "We propose a bound-preserving (BP) Point-Average-Moment\nPolynomiAl-interpreted (PAMPA) scheme by blending third-order and first-order\nconstructions. The originality of the present construction is that it does not\nneed any explicit reconstruction within each element, and therefore the\nconstruction is very flexible. The scheme employs a classical blending approach\nbetween a first-order BP scheme and a high-order scheme that does not\ninherently preserve bounds. The proposed BP PAMPA scheme demonstrates\neffectiveness across a range of problems, from scalar cases to systems such as\nthe Euler equations of gas dynamics. We derive optimal blending parameters for\nboth scalar and system cases, with the latter based on the recent geometric\nquasi-linearization (GQL) framework of [Wu \\& Shu, {\\em SIAM Review}, 65\n(2023), pp. 1031--1073]. This yields explicit, optimal blending coefficients\nthat ensure positivity and control spurious oscillations in both point values\nand cell averages. This framework incorporates a convex blending of fluxes and\nresiduals from both high-order and first-order updates, facilitating a rigorous\nBP property analysis. Sufficient conditions for the BP property are\nestablished, ensuring robustness while preserving high-order accuracy.\nNumerical tests confirm the effectiveness of the BP PAMPA scheme on several\nchallenging problems.",

The\ndust-reddened quasar, F2M110648.35$+$480712 at $z = 0.4352$ is one of the few\ncases at its redshift that exhibits powerful quasar feedback through bipolar\noutflows. Our new observation with the integral field unit mode of\nNear-infrared Spectrograph onboard JWST opens a new window to examine this\nspectacular outflow through Pa$\\alpha$ emission line with $\\sim$3$\\times$\nbetter spatial resolution than previous work. The morphology and kinematics of\nthe Pa$\\alpha$ nebula confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow extending on a\nscale of $\\sim$17$\\times$14 kpc and with a velocity reaching $\\sim$1100 km\ns$^{-1}$. The higher spatial resolution of our new observation leads to more\nreliable measurements of outflow kinematics. Considering only the spatially\nresolved outflow and assuming an electron density of 100 cm$^{-2}$, the mass,\nmomentum and kinetic energy outflow rates are $\\sim$50-210 M$_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$, $\\sim$0.3-1.7$\\times$10$^{36}$ dynes ($\\sim$14-78\\% of the quasar\nphoton momentum flux) and $\\sim$0.16-1.27$\\times$10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$\n($\\sim$0.02-0.20\\% of the quasar bolometric luminosity), respectively. The\nlocal instantaneous outflow rates generally decrease radially. We infer that\nthe quasar is powerful enough to drive the outflow, while stellar processes\ncannot be overlooked as a contributing energy source. The mass outflow rate is\n$\\sim$0.4-1.5 times the star formation rate, and the ratio of kinetic energy\noutflow rate to the quasar bolometric luminosity is comparable to the minimum\nvalue required for negative quasar feedback in simulations. This outflow may\nhelp regulate the star formation activity within the system to some extent.",

However,\nissues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse\ntrajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the\nmissing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is\nthus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the\nlack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a\ntrajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal\ncorrelations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across\ndifferent sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information\ncomplicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model\ncalled PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model\n(PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To\nhandle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert\neach trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language\nrepresentations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce\na trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single\ninterval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road\nconditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit\ntrajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in\neach region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses\nobserved points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points.\nExperiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals\neach demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of\nPLMTrajRec.",

In\naddition, we also propose an inference strategy that imposes constraints in the\nlatent space using LR information, allowing for the simultaneous improvement of\nfidelity and generative ability. Experiments demonstrate that our model can\nachieve better performance across multiple metrics on several test sets and\ngenerate more consistent SR results with LR images than existing methods.

Graphical valuations were introduced by Christodoulou et.\nal.(2023) as a structured class of valuations that admit allocations that are\nenvy-free up to any item (EFX). These are valuations where every item is valued\nby two agents, lending a (simple) graph structure to the utilities, where the\nagents are vertices and are adjacent if and only if they value a (unique)\ncommon item. Finding envy-free allocations for general valuations is known to\nbe computationally intractable even for very special cases: in particular, even\nfor binary valuations, and even for identical valuations with two agents. We\nshow that, for binary graphical valuations, the existence of envy-free\nallocations can be determined in polynomial time. In contrast, we also show\nthat allowing for even slightly more general utilities {0, 1, d} leads to\nintractability even for graphical valuations. This motivates other approaches\nto tractability, and to that end, we exhibit the fixed-parameter tractability\nof the problem parameterized by the vertex cover number of the graph when the\nnumber of distinct utilities is bounded. We also show that, all graphical\ninstances that admit EF allocations also admit one that is non-wasteful. Since\nEFX allocations are possibly wasteful, we also address the question of\ndetermining the price of fairness of EFX allocations. We show that the price of\nEFX with respect to utilitarian welfare is one for binary utilities, but can be\narbitrarily large {0, 1, d} valuations. We also show the hardness of deciding\nthe existence of an EFX allocation which is also welfare-maximizing and of\nfinding a welfare-maximizing allocation within the set of EFX allocations.",

Unfortunately, the current\nprominent diffusion-based finetuning technique falls short in maintaining the\nforeground object consistency while being constrained to produce diverse\nbackgrounds in the image outcome. In the worst scenario, the overfitting issue\nmay occur, meaning that the foreground object is less controllable due to the\ncondition above, for example, the input prompt information is transferred\nambiguously to both foreground and background regions, instead of the supposed\nbackground region only. To tackle the issues above, we proposed Hypnos, a\nhighly precise foreground-focused diffusion finetuning technique.

The utilized module is connected with\nthe diffusion model and finetuned with our proposed set of supervision\nmechanism. Combining the strategies above yielded to the foreground-background\ndisentanglement capability of the diffusion model. Our experimental results\nshowed that the proposed strategy gave a more robust performance and visually\npleasing results compared to the former technique.

Hybrid localization shares characteristics and strengths of both\nabsolute and viewpoint localization.

Therefore, this paper introduces a general approach to\nanalyzing error sources in hybrid localization systems.

The\nerror components can then be leveraged to, e.g., improve localization\npredictions, correct map data, or calibrate sensor setups. Theoretical\nderivations and evaluations show that the algorithm presents a promising\napproach to improve hybrid localization and counter the weaknesses of the\nsystem's individual components.",

Under smoothness\nconditions on $F$ in a neighborhood of $x$, in \\cite{21} it is shown that the\nIsotonic Inverse Estimator (IIE) is asymptotically efficient and attains rate\nof convergence $\\sqrt{n / \\log n}$. If $F$ is constant on an interval\ncontaining $x$, the optimal rate of convergence increases to $\\sqrt{n}$ and the\nIIE attains this rate adaptively, i.e.\\ without explicitly using the knowledge\nof local constancy. However, in this case, the asymptotic distribution is not\nnormal. In this paper, we introduce three \\textit{informed} projection-type\nestimators of $F$, which use knowledge on the interval of constancy and show\nthese are all asymptotically equivalent and normal. Furthermore, we establish a\nlocal asymptotic minimax lower bound in this setting, proving that the three\n\\textit{informed} estimators are asymptotically efficient and a convolution\nresult showing that the IIE is not efficient. We also derive the asymptotic\ndistribution of the difference of the IIE with the efficient estimators,\ndemonstrating that the IIE is \\textit{not} asymptotically equivalent to the\n\\textit{informed} estimators. Through a simulation study, we provide evidence\nthat the performance of the IIE closely resembles that of its competitors.",

While detecting\nLLM-generated content is crucial for mitigating these risks, current methods\noften focus on binary classification, failing to address the complexities of\nreal-world scenarios like human-LLM collaboration. To move beyond binary\nclassification and address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm for\ndetecting LLM-generated content. This approach introduces two novel tasks: LLM\nRole Recognition (LLM-RR), a multi-class classification task that identifies\nspecific roles of LLM in content generation, and LLM Influence Measurement\n(LLM-IM), a regression task that quantifies the extent of LLM involvement in\ncontent creation. To support these tasks, we propose LLMDetect, a benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate detectors' performance on these new tasks. LLMDetect\nincludes the Hybrid News Detection Corpus (HNDC) for training detectors, as\nwell as DetectEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite that considers five\ndistinct cross-context variations and two multi-intensity variations within the\nsame LLM role. This allows for a thorough assessment of detectors'\ngeneralization and robustness across diverse contexts. Our empirical validation\nof 10 baseline detection methods demonstrates that fine-tuned PLM-based models\nconsistently outperform others on both tasks, while advanced LLMs face\nchallenges in accurately detecting their own generated content. Our\nexperimental results and analysis offer insights for developing more effective\ndetection models for LLM-generated content.

The asynchronous\ndomains travel in the network in a direction predetermined by the initial\nconditions. In the present study we investigate the occurrence of bump states\nin networks of leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons in two-dimensions using\nnonlocal toroidal connectivity and we explore possible mechanisms for\nstabilizing the moving asynchronous domains. Our findings indicate that I)\nincorporating a refractory period can effectively anchor the position of these\ndomains in the network, and II) the switching off of some randomly preselected\nnodes (i.e., making them permanently idle/inactive) can likewise contribute to\nstabilizing the positions of the asynchronous domains. In particular, in case\nII for large values of the coupling strength and a large percentage of idle\nelements, all nodes acquire different fixed (frozen) values in the quiescent\nregion and oscillations cease throughout the network due to self-organization.\nFor the special case of stationary bump states, we propose an analytical\napproach to predict their properties.

    "abstract": "Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires an agent to execute actions\nfollowing human instructions. Existing VLN models are optimized through expert\ndemonstrations by supervised behavioural cloning or incorporating manual reward\nengineering. While straightforward, these efforts overlook the accumulation of\nerrors in the Markov decision process, and struggle to match the distribution\nof the expert policy. Going beyond this, we propose an Energy-based Navigation\nPolicy (ENP) to model the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based\nmodel. At each step, low energy values correspond to the state-action pairs\nthat the expert is most likely to perform, and vice versa.

    "abstract": "Aerial robots are a well-established solution for exploration, monitoring,\nand inspection, thanks to their superior maneuverability and agility. However,\nin many environments of interest, they risk crashing and sustaining damage\nfollowing collisions. Traditional methods focus on avoiding obstacles entirely\nto prevent damage, but these approaches can be limiting, particularly in\ncomplex environments where collisions may be unavoidable, or on weight and\ncompute-constrained platforms. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance\nthe robustness and autonomy of drones in such scenarios by developing a path\nrecovery and adjustment method for a high-speed collision-resistant drone\nequipped with binary contact sensors. The proposed system employs an estimator\nthat explicitly models collisions, using pre-collision velocities and rates to\npredict post-collision dynamics, thereby improving the drone's state estimation\naccuracy. Additionally, we introduce a vector-field-based path representation\nwhich guarantees convergence to the path. Post-collision, the contact point is\nincorporated into the vector field as a repulsive potential, enabling the drone\nto avoid obstacles while naturally converging to the original path. The\neffectiveness of this method is validated through Monte Carlo simulations and\ndemonstrated on a physical prototype, showing successful path following and\nadjustment through collisions as well as recovery from collisions at speeds up\nto 3.7 m / s.",

Due to its\ntransparency, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is widely used to\nmeasure the performance of these models through accuracy. However, existing\nMCQA benchmarks fail to capture the full reasoning capabilities of VLMs due to\nselection bias, when models disproportionately favor certain answer options\nbased on positional patterns observed during training. In this work, we conduct\na comprehensive empirical analysis of several VLM architectures across major\ndatasets designed to assess complex video-focused reasoning. We identify where\nthe bias is most pronounced and demonstrate to what extent model responses\nreflect genuine understanding of video content and related questions, as\nopposed to reliance on arbitrary patterns or superficial cues, such as answer\nposition. By decomposing the MCQA task and adapting fairness bias metrics to\nVLMs, we introduce a post-processing calibration technique BOLD to balance this\nbias. Our results show that reducing selection bias improves not only debiasing\nmetrics but also overall model performance, including Accuracy and F1 Mean\nscore.

However, recent popular DMs often rely on the assumption\nof local linearization, where the noise injected during the inversion process\nis expected to approximate the noise removed during the inference process.\nWhile DM efficiently generates images under this assumption, it can also\naccumulate errors during the diffusion process due to the assumption,\nultimately negatively impacting the quality of real image reconstruction and\nediting. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, referred to as\nERDDCI (Exact Reversible Diffusion via Dual-Chain Inversion). ERDDCI uses the\nnew Dual-Chain Inversion (DCI) for joint inference to derive an exact\nreversible diffusion process. By using DCI, our method effectively avoids the\ncumbersome optimization process in existing inversion approaches and achieves\nhigh-quality image editing. Additionally, to accommodate image operations under\nhigh guidance scales, we introduce a dynamic control strategy that enables more\nrefined image reconstruction and editing.

It has\nbeen of great interest whether PFs have a bound of the error from the exact\ntime evolution, which is expressed by commutators among local terms (called\ncommutator scaling), since it brings the substantial suppression of the\ncomputational cost in the system size. Although recent studies have revealed\nthe presence and the explicit formulas of the PF error bounds for\ntime-independent systems, those for time-dependent Hamiltonians remain to be a\ndifficult problem except for low-order PFs. In this paper, we derive an\nexplicit error bound of generic PFs for smooth time-dependent Hamiltonians,\nwhich is expressed by commutators among local terms and their time derivatives.\nThis error bound can also host the substantial suppression in the system size\nfor generic local Hamiltonians with finite-, short-, and long-ranged\ninteractions, thereby giving a much better estimate of gate counts. Our\nderivation employs Floquet theory; Embedding generic smooth time-dependent\nHamiltonians into time-periodic ones, we map the time-dependent PF error to the\ntime-independent one defined on an infinite-dimensional space. This approach\nallows to obtain the error bounds not only for the ordinary time-dependent PF\nbut also for its various family.

In this work, we propose a\npseudo-label refinement (SLR) algorithm to address this issue.

Recent advances in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have led to impressive linguistic capabilities and\nemergent reasoning behaviors, fueling widespread adoption across application\ndomains.

However, their\nwidespread use raises concerns about authorship, originality, and ethics, even\npotentially threatening scholarly integrity. Existing detection methods, which\nmainly rely on single-feature analysis and binary classification, often fail to\neffectively identify LLM-generated text in academic contexts. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Multi-level Fine-grained Detection (MFD)\nframework that detects LLM-generated text by integrating low-level structural,\nhigh-level semantic, and deep-level linguistic features, while conducting\nsentence-level evaluations of lexicon, grammar, and syntax for comprehensive\nanalysis. To improve detection of subtle differences in LLM-generated text and\nenhance robustness against paraphrasing, we apply two mainstream evasion\ntechniques to rewrite the text. These variations, along with original texts,\nare used to train a text encoder via contrastive learning, extracting\nhigh-level semantic features of sentence to boost detection generalization.\nFurthermore, we leverage advanced LLM to analyze the entire text and extract\ndeep-level linguistic features, enhancing the model's ability to capture\ncomplex patterns and nuances while effectively incorporating contextual\ninformation. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that the MFD model\noutperforms existing methods, achieving an MAE of 0.1346 and an accuracy of\n88.56%.

Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is a suitable\napproach to modeling the placement problem for AMS ICs.

In this paper, we study how to improve the results of our previous\nILP model, first by introducing additional constraints and second by using\nmatheuristics. Given the initial solution we obtain using our original ILP\nmodel, we use the solver to perform a local search. We try to improve the\ncriterion by considering only a few spatially close rectangles while keeping\nthe rest of the placement fixed. This local search approach enables us to\nsignificantly improve the quality of instances whose solution space we could\nnot sufficiently explore before, even when the computation time reserved for\nthe matheuristic is limited.

In a dual manner,\na Morse sequence may be obtained by considering only collapses and\nperforations. Such a sequence is another way to represent the gradient vector\nfield of an arbitrary discrete Morse function. To each Morse sequence, we\nassign a reference map and an extension map. A reference map associates a set\nof critical simplexes to each simplex of a given complex, and an extension map\nassociates a set of simplexes to each critical simplex. By considering the\nboundary of each critical simplex, we obtain a chain complex from these maps,\nwhich corresponds precisely to the Morse complex. We show that, when restricted\nto homology, an extension map is the inverse of a reference map. Also we show\nthat these two maps allow us to recover directly the isomorphism theorem\nbetween the homology of an object and the homology of its Morse complex.

A year earlier, St\\'ephane Lamass\\'e\nand Philippe Rygiel spoke of the 'new frontiers of the historian', frontiers\nopened a few years earlier by the realisation of the unprecedented impact of\nnew technologies on historical practices, leading to a 'mutation des conditions\nde production et de diffusion des connaissances historiques, voire de la nature\nde celles-ci' ('transformation of the conditions of production and\ndissemination of historical knowledge, and even the nature of this knowledge').\n3 It was in this fertile ground, conducive to the cross-fertilisation of\napproaches, that the TIME-US project was born in 2016. TIME-US is directly the\nresult of this awareness and reflects the transformations induced by major\ntechnological advancements, disrupting not only our daily practices but also\nour historical practices. 1 Annales 2015, 216. 2 For example, convolutional\nneural networks, which have revolutionised the field of artificial\nintelligence, began to gain popularity just before the 2010s. 3 Translated by\nthe author.

As Maria {\\AA}gren points out, the invisibility of women's\nparticipation in the labour market does not mean non-existence 8 ; there must\ntherefore be traces of it. To quantify women's economic activity, Sara Horrell\nand Jane Humphries, for example, turned to household budgets from 59 different\nsources (from Parliamentary Papers to autobiographical texts), which had never\nbefore been systematically used to identify women's work patterns and their\ncontribution to family income. 9 In her study A Bitter Living: Women, Markets,\nand Social Capital in Early Modern Germany published in 2003, Sheilagh Ogilvie\nused information contained in court records to identify activities carried out\nby women and the time spent on these activities. Court records were not\nintended to record such information; yet, in their testimonies, witnesses often\ndescribed in detail the activities they were engaged in while a crime was\nunfolding before their eyes. Sheilagh Ogilvie thus identified nearly 3000 such\nobservations. 10 These works have opened two main avenues for the TIME-US\nproject. First, making already digitised sources accessible in homogeneous\ncorpora. 11 Following the example of previous research, TIME-US mobilised\nvaried sources containing traces of professional activities carried out by\nwomen in France during the period studied: these include both printed (posters\nand petitions, working-class newspapers, and contemporary surveys on workers)\nand handwritten sources (labour court decisions, police reports, company\narchives, personal archives, surveys, petitions). 12 One of the project's\nobjectives was to gather and 8 {\\AA}gren 2018a, 144. 9 Horrell and Humphries\n1995.",

This study employs the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit\nGeant4 to evaluate various configurations and materials of detector crystals.\nWe concentrate on three critical parameters: sensitivity, intrinsic coincidence\ntime resolution (CTR), and energy resolution across three crystal designs:\n1)standard LYSO crystals as the baseline; 2)0.1% Mg, 1% Ce doped\n$Gd_3Al_2Ga_3O_{12}$ (Mg,Ce:GAGG) as an alternative material; and\n3)pyramid-shaped LYSO crystals, which maintain the same dimensions as the\nstandard LYSO.

    "abstract": "Despite the practical success of Artificial Intelligence (AI), current neural\nAI algorithms face two significant issues. First, the decisions made by neural\narchitectures are often prone to bias and brittleness. Second, when a chain of\nreasoning is required, neural systems often perform poorly. Neuro-symbolic\nartificial intelligence is a promising approach that tackles these (and other)\nweaknesses by combining the power of neural perception and symbolic reasoning.\nMeanwhile, the success of AI has made it critical to understand its behaviour,\nleading to the development of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While\nneuro-symbolic AI systems have important advantages over purely neural AI, we\nstill need to explain their actions, which are obscured by the interactions of\nthe neural and symbolic components. To address the issue, this paper proposes a\nformal approach to explaining the decisions of neuro-symbolic systems. The\napproach hinges on the use of formal abductive explanations and on solving the\nneuro-symbolic explainability problem hierarchically. Namely, it first computes\na formal explanation for the symbolic component of the system, which serves to\nidentify a subset of the individual parts of neural information that needs to\nbe explained. This is followed by explaining only those individual neural\ninputs, independently of each other, which facilitates succinctness of\nhierarchical formal explanations and helps to increase the overall performance\nof the approach. Experimental results for a few complex reasoning tasks\ndemonstrate practical efficiency of the proposed approach, in comparison to\npurely neural systems, from the perspective of explanation size, explanation\ntime, training time, model sizes, and the quality of explanations reported.",

HD 28185 c has an orbital\nperiod of $24.9^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ years, a semi-major axis of\n$8.50^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$ AU, and a modest eccentricity of $0.15\\pm0.04$,\nresulting in one of the most Saturn-like orbits of any known exoplanet.

    "abstract": "Over recent years, Federated Learning (FL) has proven to be one of the most\npromising methods of distributed learning which preserves data privacy. As the\nmethod evolved and was confronted to various real-world scenarios, new\nchallenges have emerged. One such challenge is the presence of highly\nheterogeneous (often referred as non-IID) data distributions among participants\nof the FL protocol. A popular solution to this hurdle is Clustered Federated\nLearning (CFL), which aims to partition clients into groups where the\ndistribution are homogeneous. In the literature, state-of-the-art CFL\nalgorithms are often tested using a few cases of data heterogeneities, without\nsystematically justifying the choices. Further, the taxonomy used for\ndifferentiating the different heterogeneity scenarios is not always\nstraightforward. In this paper, we explore the performance of two\nstate-of-theart CFL algorithms with respect to a proposed taxonomy of data\nheterogeneities in federated learning (FL). We work with three image\nclassification datasets and analyze the resulting clusters against the\nheterogeneity classes using extrinsic clustering metrics. Our objective is to\nprovide a clearer understanding of the relationship between CFL performances\nand data heterogeneity scenarios.",

Knowledge\nGraphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer\na reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. However, existing KG-based LLM\nreasoning methods face challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning,\nmulti-entity questions, and effectively utilizing graph structures. To address\nthese issues, we propose Paths-over-Graph (PoG), a novel method that enhances\nLLM reasoning by integrating knowledge reasoning paths from KGs, improving the\ninterpretability and faithfulness of LLM outputs. PoG tackles multi-hop and\nmulti-entity questions through a three-phase dynamic multi-hop path\nexploration, which combines the inherent knowledge of LLMs with factual\nknowledge from KGs. In order to improve the efficiency, PoG prunes irrelevant\ninformation from the graph exploration first and introduces efficient\nthree-step pruning techniques that incorporate graph structures, LLM prompting,\nand a pre-trained language model (e.g., SBERT) to effectively narrow down the\nexplored candidate paths. This ensures all reasoning paths contain highly\nrelevant information captured from KGs, making the reasoning faithful and\ninterpretable in problem-solving. PoG innovatively utilizes graph structure to\nprune the irrelevant noise and represents the first method to implement\nmulti-entity deep path detection on KGs for LLM reasoning tasks. Comprehensive\nexperiments on five benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate PoG outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art method ToG across GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, achieving an\naverage accuracy improvement of 18.9%.

Its progression, marked by shrinkage in the cerebral cortex, is\nirreversible. Numerous machine learning algorithms have been proposed for the\nearly diagnosis of AD. However, they often struggle with the issues of noise,\noutliers, and class imbalance. To tackle the aforementioned limitations, in\nthis article, we introduce a novel, robust, and flexible membership scheme\ncalled Flexi-Fuzz. This scheme integrates a novel flexible weighting mechanism,\nclass probability, and imbalance ratio. The proposed flexible weighting\nmechanism assigns the maximum weight to samples within a specific proximity to\nthe center, with a gradual decrease in weight beyond a certain threshold. This\napproach ensures that samples near the class boundary still receive significant\nweight, maintaining their influence in the classification process. Class\nprobability is used to mitigate the impact of noisy samples, while the\nimbalance ratio addresses class imbalance. Leveraging this, we incorporate the\nproposed Flexi-Fuzz membership scheme into the least squares support vector\nmachines (LSSVM) framework, resulting in a robust and flexible model termed\nFlexi-Fuzz-LSSVM. We determine the class-center using two methods: the\nconventional mean approach and an innovative median approach, leading to two\nmodel variants, Flexi-Fuzz-LSSVM-I and Flexi-Fuzz-LSSVM-II. To validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed Flexi-Fuzz-LSSVM models, we evaluated them on\nbenchmark UCI and KEEL datasets, both with and without label noise.\nAdditionally, we tested the models on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) dataset for AD diagnosis.

Therefore, continuously monitoring and evaluating these\nmodels for fairness is important. To address this issue, we propose\nText-to-Image (TTI) Representativity Fairness Evaluation Framework. In this\nframework, we evaluate three aspects of a TTI system; diversity, inclusion, and\nquality. For each aspect, human-based and model-based approaches are proposed\nand evaluated for their ability to capture the bias and whether they can\nsubstitute each other. The framework starts by suggesting the prompts for\ngenerating the images for the evaluation based on the context and the sensitive\nattributes under study. Then the three aspects are evaluated using the proposed\napproaches. Based on the evaluation, a decision is made regarding the\nrepresentativity bias within the TTI system. The evaluation of our framework on\nStable Diffusion shows that the framework can effectively capture the bias in\nTTI systems. The results also confirm that our proposed model based-approaches\ncan substitute human-based approaches in three out of four components with high\ncorrelation, which could potentially reduce costs and automate the process. The\nstudy suggests that continual learning of the model on more inclusive data\nacross disadvantaged minorities such as Indians and Middle Easterners is\nessential to mitigate current stereotyping and lack of inclusiveness.",

    "abstract": "Histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis serves as the gold standard\nfor clinical cancer diagnosis in the daily routines of doctors. To develop\ncomputer-aided diagnosis model for WSIs, previous methods typically employ\nMulti-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level\nlabels. Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise\ninteractions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model\ncontextual information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized\nto address this issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long\nsequences in large WSIs, methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL\nemploys approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from\nsuboptimal performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use\nof absolute positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long\ncontextual dependencies in shape-varying WSIs. In this paper, we first analyze\nhow the low-rank nature of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the\nrepresentation ability of WSI modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of\nattention matrix can be improved by focusing on local interactions via a local\nattention mask. Our analysis shows that the local mask aligns with the\nattention patterns in the lower layers of the Transformer. Furthermore, the\nlocal attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation,\nreducing the quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local\nbandwidth. Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for\nboth computational acceleration and local-global information interactions\nmodelling. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through\nextensive experiments on various WSI tasks to validate its superiority.

Behaviour cloning approaches to learning from demonstration\ncommonly rely on mixture density network output heads to predict robot actions.\nIn this work, we first reinterpret the mixture density network as a library of\nfeedback controllers (or skills) conditioned on latent states. This arises from\nthe observation that a one-layer linear network is functionally equivalent to a\nclassical feedback controller, with network weights corresponding to controller\ngains. We use this insight to derive a probabilistic graphical model that\ncombines these elements, describing the skill acquisition process as\nsegmentation in a latent space, where each skill policy functions as a feedback\ncontrol law in this latent space.

Although 3DGS provides a promising neural rendering option, it is\nstill hard to infer SDFs for surface reconstruction with 3DGS due to the\ndiscreteness, the sparseness, and the off-surface drift of 3D Gaussians. To\nresolve these issues, we propose a method that seamlessly merge 3DGS with the\nlearning of neural SDFs. Our key idea is to more effectively constrain the SDF\ninference with the multi-view consistency. To this end, we dynamically align 3D\nGaussians on the zero-level set of the neural SDF using neural pulling, and\nthen render the aligned 3D Gaussians through the differentiable rasterization.\nMeanwhile, we update the neural SDF by pulling neighboring space to the pulled\n3D Gaussians, which progressively refine the signed distance field near the\nsurface. With both differentiable pulling and splatting, we jointly optimize 3D\nGaussians and the neural SDF with both RGB and geometry constraints, which\nrecovers more accurate, smooth, and complete surfaces with more geometry\ndetails.

We apply our method to a 1.77 deg$^2$\nfield located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the VISTA survey of the\nMagellanic Clouds (VMC), which surveyed the LMC in the $YJK_\\text{s}$ bands.\nOur approach first models the position-dependent PSF to detect and remove point\nsources from deep $K_\\text{s}$ images; this leaves behind extended objects such\nas star clusters and background galaxies. We then analyse the isophotes of\nthese extended objects to characterise their properties, perform integrated\nphotometry, and finally remove any spurious objects this procedure identifies.\nWe demonstrate our approach in practice on a deep VMC $K_\\text{s}$ tile that\ncontains the most active star-forming regions in the LMC: 30 Doradus, N158,\nN159, and N160. We select this tile because it is the most challenging for\nautomated techniques due both to crowding and nebular emission. We detect 682\ncandidate star clusters, with an estimated contamination rate of 13% from\nbackground galaxies and chance blends of physically unrelated stars. We compare\nour candidates to publicly available James Webb Space Telescope data and find\nthat at least 80% of our detections appear to be star clusters.",

Retrieval and ranking models serve as the foundation for numerous\napplications, including web search, open domain QA, enterprise domain QA, and\ntext-based recommender systems. Typically, these models undergo training on\ntriplets consisting of binary relevance assignments, comprising one positive\nand one negative passage. However, their utilization involves a context where a\nsignificantly more nuanced understanding of relevance is necessary, especially\nwhen re-ranking a large pool of potentially relevant passages. Although\ncollecting positive examples through user feedback like impressions or clicks\nis straightforward, identifying suitable negative pairs from a vast pool of\npossibly millions or even billions of documents possess a greater challenge.\nGenerating a substantial number of negative pairs is often necessary to\nmaintain the high quality of the model. Several approaches have been suggested\nin literature to tackle the issue of selecting suitable negative pairs from an\nextensive corpus. This study focuses on explaining the crucial role of hard\nnegatives in the training process of cross-encoder models, specifically aiming\nto explain the performance gains observed with hard negative sampling compared\nto random sampling.

The\nunderlying assumption is that since cricket is fundamentally a team sport, the\nperformance of players compared to their peers plays a crucial role in their\nselection. To accomplish this, a network is generated using ball-by-ball data\nfrom previous PSL matches (2016-2022), and social network analysis (SNA)\ntechniques such as centrality and clustering coefficient measures, are employed\nto quantify the level of belongingness among Pakistani cricket players within\nthe PSL network.

    "abstract": "Assessing cognitive workload is crucial for human performance as it affects\ninformation processing, decision making, and task execution. Pupil size is a\nvaluable indicator of cognitive workload, reflecting changes in attention and\narousal governed by the autonomic nervous system. Cognitive events are closely\nlinked to cognitive workload as they activate mental processes and trigger\ncognitive responses. This study explores the potential of using machine\nlearning to automatically detect cognitive events experienced using\nindividuals. We framed the problem as a binary classification task, focusing on\ndetecting stimulus onset across four cognitive tasks using CNN models and\n1-second pupillary data. The results, measured by Matthew's correlation\ncoefficient, ranged from 0.47 to 0.80, depending on the cognitive task. This\npaper discusses the trade-offs between generalization and specialization, model\nbehavior when encountering unseen stimulus onset times, structural variances\namong cognitive tasks, factors influencing model predictions, and real-time\nsimulation. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning\ntechniques in detecting cognitive events based on pupil and eye movement\nresponses, contributing to advancements in personalized learning and optimizing\nneurocognitive workload management.",

We address this by repurposing the\ndiffusion framework for heavy-tail estimation using multivariate Student-t\ndistributions. We develop a tailored perturbation kernel and derive the\ndenoising posterior based on the conditional Student-t distribution for the\nbackward process. Inspired by $\\gamma$-divergence for heavy-tailed\ndistributions, we derive a training objective for heavy-tailed denoisers. The\nresulting framework introduces controllable tail generation using only a single\nscalar hyperparameter, making it easily tunable for diverse real-world\ndistributions. As specific instantiations of our framework, we introduce t-EDM\nand t-Flow, extensions of existing diffusion and flow models that employ a\nStudent-t prior. Remarkably, our approach is readily compatible with standard\nGaussian diffusion models and requires only minimal code changes.

However, a number of challenges remain in\nML-based smishing detection, with the scarcity of annotated datasets being one\nmajor hurdle. Specifically, given the sensitive nature of smishing-related\ndata, there is a lack of publicly accessible data that can be used for training\nand evaluating ML models. Additionally, the nuanced similarities between\nsmishing messages and other types of social engineering attacks such as spam\nmessages exacerbate the challenge of smishing classification with limited\nresources. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel data augmentation\nmethod utilizing a few-shot prompt learning approach.

However, merely decomposing 4D dynamic scenes into multiple 2D\nplane-based representations is insufficient for high-fidelity re-rendering of\nscenes with complex motions. In response, we present DaRePlane, a novel\ndirection-aware representation approach that captures scene dynamics from six\ndifferent directions. This learned representation undergoes an inverse\ndual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover plane-based\ninformation. Within NeRF pipelines, DaRePlane computes features for each\nspace-time point by fusing vectors from these recovered planes, then passed to\na tiny MLP for color regression. When applied to Gaussian splatting, DaRePlane\ncomputes the features of Gaussian points, followed by a tiny multi-head MLP for\nspatial-time deformation prediction. Notably, to address redundancy introduced\nby the six real and six imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we\nintroduce a trainable masking approach, mitigating storage issues without\nsignificant performance decline. To demonstrate the generality and efficiency\nof DaRePlane, we test it on both regular and surgical dynamic scenes, for both\nNeRF and GS systems.

Previous\naction quality assessment methods, which relied on labeled scores from motion\nvideos, exhibited slightly lower accuracy and discriminability.

To address this\nproblem, this paper presents an unlabeled Multi-Dimensional Exercise Distance\nAdaptive Constrained Dynamic Time Warping (MED-ACDTW) method for action quality\nassessment. Our approach uses an athletic version of DTW to compare features\nfrom template and test videos, eliminating the need for score labels during\ntraining. The result shows that utilizing both 2D and 3D spatial dimensions,\nalong with multiple human body features, improves the accuracy by 2-3% compared\nto using either 2D or 3D pose estimation alone. Additionally, employing MED for\nscore calculation enhances the precision of frame distance matching, which\nsignificantly boosts overall discriminability. The adaptive constraint scheme\nenhances the discriminability of action quality assessment by approximately\n30%.

Suspensions are simulated with a\ncoupled lattice Boltzmann method-discrete element method, which explicitly\nmodels all physics, including shear-thinning fluid rheology. Firstly, using a\nsimplified computational geometry, it is demonstrated that leak-off and\nmounding are both minimised when proppant invades and is retained in the cleat.\nThis occurs most effectively with wide proppant size distributions, such as\n100/635 mesh. However, when the proppant is larger than the cleat aperture,\nocclusions form at the cleat entrance, which can lead to significant mounding;\nthis is observed for 100 mesh and 40/70 mesh. These findings are commensurate\nwith an existing benchmark experiment. The present study additionally\ndemonstrates that mounding is significantly reduced for shear-thinning fluids\ncompared to Newtonian fluids. Simulations are then conducted with rough cleats\nin a realistic fracture channel. Leak-off is smallest for high cleat roughness\nand when cleats are narrower than a critical width, while proppant retention is\nlargest at the same critical width but only above a certain roughness. Mounding\nis primarily dependent on the width, as opposed to the roughness. These results\nare presented as high-fidelity maps which can be directly incorporated into\nhydraulic fracturing simulations for improved predictions of fluid leak-off and\npropped reservoir volumes, and which can be tailored for different treatment\nand reservoir conditions.",

Through\nboth theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that\nFiSAO effectively addresses the misalignment problem in VLLMs, marking the\nfirst instance of token-level rewards being applied to such models.",

    "abstract": "Public transit systems play a crucial role in providing efficient and\nsustainable transportation options in urban areas. However, these systems face\nvarious challenges in meeting commuters' needs. On the other hand, despite the\nrapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) worldwide, their integration\ninto transit systems remains relatively unexplored.\n  The objective of this paper is to explore the utilization of LLMs in the\npublic transit system, with a specific focus on improving the customers'\nexperience and transit staff performance. We present a general framework for\ndeveloping LLM applications in transit systems, wherein the LLM serves as the\nintermediary for information communication between natural language content and\nthe resources within the database. In this context, the LLM serves a\nmultifaceted role, including understanding users' requirements, retrieving data\nfrom the dataset in response to user queries, and tailoring the information to\nalign with the users' specific needs. Three transit LLM applications are\npresented: Tweet Writer, Trip Advisor, and Policy Navigator. Tweet Writer\nautomates updates to the transit system alerts on social media, Trip Advisor\noffers customized transit trip suggestions, and Policy Navigator provides clear\nand personalized answers to policy queries. Leveraging LLMs in these\napplications enhances seamless communication with their capabilities of\nunderstanding and generating human-like languages. With the help of these three\nLLM transit applications, transit system media personnel can provide system\nupdates more efficiently, and customers can access travel information and\npolicy answers in a more user-friendly manner.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study an inverse reinforcement learning problem that\ninvolves learning the reward function of a learning agent using trajectory data\ncollected while this agent is learning its optimal policy. To address this\nproblem, we propose an inverse reinforcement learning method that allows us to\nestimate the policy parameters of the learning agent which can then be used to\nestimate its reward function. Our method relies on a new variant of the\nbehavior cloning algorithm, which we call bundle behavior cloning, and uses a\nsmall number of trajectories generated by the learning agent's policy at\ndifferent points in time to learn a set of policies that match the distribution\nof actions observed in the sampled trajectories. We then use the cloned\npolicies to train a neural network model that estimates the reward function of\nthe learning agent. We provide a theoretical analysis to show a complexity\nresult on bound guarantees for our method that beats standard behavior cloning\nas well as numerical experiments for a reinforcement learning problem that\nvalidate the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as powerful tools for\nsolving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, training PINNs from\nscratch is often computationally intensive and time-consuming. To address this\nproblem, we propose a parameter-efficient approach that fine-tunes pre-trained\nDeepONet models within the PINN framework (FTO-PINN), enabling more efficient\nmeshless PDE solving. Specifically, we freeze the weights of the pre-trained\nDeepONet model and fine-tune the output of the branch net by incorporating a\nsmall number of new trainable parameters, which can be quickly determined using\nleast-squares techniques. Additionally, we introduce trunk net expansions and\nlow-rank adaptation strategies to further enhance the performance of FTO-PINN.\nThe effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated through a series of\nnumerical experiments across various types of PDEs. FTO-PINN significantly\nreduces the training time of vanilla PINNs while maintaining comparable\naccuracy, and outperforms DeepONet, which is pre-trained on general function\ndata, in both fidelity and generalization capabilities.",

We first\nsystematically investigate the average PDS and individual PDS for short GRBs\n(SGRBs), and obtain $\\alpha_{\\bar{P}}\\propto E^{-0.07}$ (8-1000 keV), where the\nvalues of $\\alpha_{\\bar{P}}$ vary from 1.86 to 1.34. The distribution of\npower-law index of individual PDS ($\\alpha$) of SGRB, is consistent with that\nof LGRB, and the $\\alpha$ value for the dominant timescale group (the bent\npower-law, BPL) is higher than that for the no-dominant timescale group (the\nsingle power-law, PL). Both LGRBs and SGRBs show similar $\\alpha$ and\n$\\alpha_{\\bar{P}}$, which indicates that they may be the result of similar\nstochastic processes. The typical value of dominant timescale $\\tau$ for LGRBs\nand SGRBs is 1.58 s and 0.02 s, respectively. It seems that the $\\tau$ in\nproportion to the duration of GRBs $T_{90}$, with a relation $\\tau \\propto\nT_{90}^{0.86}$. The GRB light curve may result from superposing a number of\npulses with different timescales. No periodic and quasi-periodical signal above\nthe 3$\\sigma$ significance threshold is found in our sample.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) traditionally employ a message-passing mechanism\nthat resembles diffusion over undirected graphs, which often leads to\nhomogenization of node features and reduced discriminative power in tasks such\nas node classification. Our key insight for addressing this limitation is to\nassign fuzzy edge directions -- that can vary continuously from node $i$\npointing to node $j$ to vice versa -- to the edges of a graph so that features\ncan preferentially flow in one direction between nodes to enable long-range\ninformation transmission across the graph. We also introduce a novel\ncomplex-valued Laplacian for directed graphs with fuzzy edges where the real\nand imaginary parts represent information flow in opposite directions. Using\nthis Laplacian, we propose a general framework, called Continuous Edge\nDirection (CoED) GNN, for learning on graphs with fuzzy edges and prove its\nexpressivity limits using a generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph\nisomorphism test for directed graphs with fuzzy edges. Our architecture\naggregates neighbor features scaled by the learned edge directions and\nprocesses the aggregated messages from in-neighbors and out-neighbors\nseparately alongside the self-features of the nodes. Since continuous edge\ndirections are differentiable, they can be learned jointly with the GNN weights\nvia gradient-based optimization. CoED GNN is particularly well-suited for graph\nensemble data where the graph structure remains fixed but multiple realizations\nof node features are available, such as in gene regulatory networks, web\nconnectivity graphs, and power grids.

Due to the lack of proper\nsupervision signals, the main task accuracy is negatively affected in defending\nagainst ID backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose DMGNN against OOD\nand ID graph backdoor attacks that can powerfully eliminate stealthiness to\nguarantee defense effectiveness and improve the model performance.\nSpecifically, DMGNN can easily identify the hidden ID and OOD triggers via\npredicting label transitions based on counterfactual explanation. To further\nfilter the diversity of generated explainable graphs and erase the influence of\nthe trigger features, we present a reverse sampling pruning method to screen\nand discard the triggers directly on the data level. Extensive experimental\nevaluations on open graph datasets demonstrate that DMGNN far outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) defense methods, reducing the attack success rate to 5%\nwith almost negligible degradation in model performance (within 3.5%).",

However, they still face significant challenges in accurately\ncapturing spatial details of radar images, particularly in regions of high\nprecipitation intensity. This limitation results in reduced spatial\nlocalization accuracy when predicting radar echo images across varying\nprecipitation intensities. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative\nprecipitation prediction approach termed the Multi-Task Latent Diffusion Model\n(MTLDM). The core idea of MTLDM lies in the recognition that precipitation\nradar images represent a combination of multiple components, each corresponding\nto different precipitation intensities. Thus, we adopt a divide-and-conquer\nstrategy, decomposing radar images into several sub-images based on their\nprecipitation intensities and individually modeling these components. During\nthe prediction stage, MTLDM integrates these sub-image representations by\nutilizing a trained latent-space rainfall diffusion model, followed by decoding\nthrough a multi-task decoder to produce the final precipitation prediction.\nExperimental evaluations conducted on the MRMS dataset demonstrate that the\nproposed MTLDM method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a\nCritical Success Index (CSI) improvement of 13-26%.",

The difficulty in finding\nmicrolensing black holes lies in having to choose a small subset of events\nbased on characteristics of their lightcurves to allocate expensive and scarce\nfollow-up resources to confirm the identity of the lens.

Our framework is simple and powerful: it\ncan leverage any off-the-shelf Sparse PCA algorithm and achieve significant\ncomputational speedups, with a minor additive error that is linear in the\napproximation error of the block-diagonal matrix. Suppose $g(k, d)$ is the\nruntime of an algorithm (approximately) solving Sparse PCA in dimension $d$ and\nwith sparsity constant $k$. Our framework, when integrated with this algorithm,\nreduces the runtime to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{d}{d^\\star} \\cdot g(k, d^\\star)\n+ d^2\\right)$, where $d^\\star \\leq d$ is the largest block size of the\nblock-diagonal matrix.

We perform\nlarge-scale evaluations on many real-world datasets: for exact Sparse PCA\nalgorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 100.50, while\nmaintaining an average approximation error of 0.61%; for approximate Sparse PCA\nalgorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 6.00 and an average\napproximation error of -0.91%, meaning that our method oftentimes finds better\nsolutions.",

For parametric governing equations, a potential challenge arises\nwhen there is a need to update the POD basis to adapt ROM that accurately\ncapture the variation of a system's behavior over its parameter space (in\ndesign, control, uncertainty quantification, digital twins applications, etc.).\nIn this paper, we propose a Projected Gaussian Process (pGP) and formulate the\nproblem of adapting the POD basis as a supervised statistical learning problem,\nfor which the goal is to learn a mapping from the parameter space to the\nGrassmann manifold that contains the optimal subspaces. A mapping is firstly\nestablished between the Euclidean space and the horizontal space of an\northogonal matrix that spans a reference subspace in the Grassmann manifold. A\nsecond mapping from the horizontal space to the Grassmann manifold is\nestablished through the Exponential/Logarithm maps between the manifold and its\ntangent space. Finally, given a new parameter, the conditional distribution of\na vector can be found in the Euclidean space using the Gaussian Process (GP)\nregression, and such a distribution is then projected to the Grassmann manifold\nthat enables us to predict the optimal subspace for the new parameter. As a\nstatistical learning approach, the proposed pGP allows us to optimally estimate\n(or tune) the model parameters from data and quantify the statistical\nuncertainty associated with the prediction. The advantages of the proposed pGP\nare demonstrated by numerical experiments.",
