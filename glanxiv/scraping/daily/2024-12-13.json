    "abstract": "Measurement in quantum mechanics is notoriously unpredictable. The\nuncertainty in quantum measurement can arise from the noncommutativity between\nthe state and the measurement basis which is intrinsically quantum, but it may\nalso be of classical origin due to the agent's ignorance. It is of fundamental\nas well as practical importance to cleanly separate the two contributions which\ncan be directly accessed using laboratory operations. Here, we propose two ways\nof decomposition of the total measurement uncertainty additively into quantum\nand classical parts. In the two decompositions, the total uncertainty of a\nmeasurement described by a POVM (positive-operator-valued measure) over a\nquantum state is quantified respectively by two generalized nonadditive\nentropies of the measurement outcomes; the quantum parts are identified,\nrespectively, by the nonreality and the nonclassicality | which captures\nsimultaneously both the nonreality and negativity | of the associated\ngeneralized Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability relative to the POVM of interest\nand a PVM (projection-valued measure) and maximized over all possible choices\nof the latter; and, the remaining uncertainties are identified as the classical\nparts. Both decompositions are shown to satisfy a few plausible requirements.\nThe minimum of the total measurement uncertainties in the two decompositions\nover all POVM measurements are given by the impurity of the quantum state\nquantified by certain generalized quantum entropies, and are entirely\nclassical. We argue that nonvanishing genuine quantum uncertainty in the two\ndecompositions are sufficient and necessary to prove quantum contextuality via\nweak measurement with postselection. Finally, we suggest that the genuine\nquantum uncertainty is a manifestation of a specific measurement disturbance.",

Though there have been various effective\nmethods to defend against jailbreak attacks, prefilling attacks remain an\nunsolved and popular threat against open-sourced LLMs. In-Context Learning\n(ICL) offers a computationally efficient defense against various jailbreak\nattacks, yet no effective ICL methods have been developed to counter prefilling\nattacks. In this paper, we: (1) show that ICL can effectively defend against\nprefilling jailbreak attacks by employing adversative sentence structures\nwithin demonstrations; (2) characterize the effectiveness of this defense\nthrough the lens of model size, number of demonstrations, over-defense,\nintegration with other jailbreak attacks, and the presence of safety alignment.\nGiven the experimental results and our analysis, we conclude that there is no\nfree lunch for defending against prefilling jailbreak attacks with ICL. On the\none hand, current safety alignment methods fail to mitigate prefilling\njailbreak attacks, but adversative structures within ICL demonstrations provide\nrobust defense across various model sizes and complex jailbreak attacks. On the\nother hand, LLMs exhibit similar over-defensiveness when utilizing ICL\ndemonstrations with adversative structures, and this behavior appears to be\nindependent of model size.",

This can hinder attack research, as modifying\none example for an attack can require hundreds of queries to a model,\nespecially for black-box attacks. Often these attacks remove one token at a\ntime to find the ideal one to change, requiring $n$ queries (the length of the\ntext) right away. We propose a more efficient selection method called\nBinarySelect which combines binary search and attack selection methods to\ngreatly reduce the number of queries needed to find a token. We find that\nBinarySelect only needs $\\text{log}_2(n) * 2$ queries to find the first token\ncompared to $n$ queries. We also test BinarySelect in an attack setting against\n5 classifiers across 3 datasets and find a viable tradeoff between number of\nqueries saved and attack effectiveness. For example, on the Yelp dataset, the\nnumber of queries is reduced by 32% (72 less) with a drop in attack\neffectiveness of only 5 points.

    "abstract": "Federated learning is a versatile framework for training models in\ndecentralized environments. However, the trust placed in clients makes\nfederated learning vulnerable to backdoor attacks launched by malicious\nparticipants. While many defenses have been proposed, they often fail short\nwhen facing heterogeneous data distributions among participating clients. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel defense mechanism for federated learning systems\ndesigned to mitigate backdoor attacks on the clients-side. Our approach\nleverages adversarial learning techniques and model patching to neutralize the\nimpact of backdoor attacks. Through extensive experiments on the MNIST and\nFashion-MNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our defense effectively reduces\nbackdoor accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art defenses, such as\nLFighter, FLAME, and RoseAgg, in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. scenarios, while\nmaintaining competitive or superior accuracy on clean data.",

    "abstract": "The time-varying geomagnetic field is a superposition of contributions from\nmultiple internal and external current systems. A major source of geomagnetic\nvariations at periods less than a few years are current systems external to the\nsolid Earth, namely the ionospheric and magnetospheric currents, as well as\nassociated induced currents. The separation of these three sources is\nmathematically underdetermined using either ground or satellite measurements\nalone, but becomes tractable when the two datasets are combined. Based on this\nconcept, we developed a new geomagnetic field modelling approach that allows us\nto simultaneously characterise the mid-latitude ionospheric, magnetospheric and\nthe internal induced magnetic fields using ground and satellite observations\nfor all local times and magnetic conditions, and without prescribing any\nharmonic behaviour on these current systems in time, as is typical in other\nmodels. By applying this new method to a 10-year dataset of ground observatory\nand multi-satellite measurements from 2014 to 2023, we obtained the time series\nof the spherical harmonic coefficients of the ionospheric, magnetospheric and\ninduced fields. These new time series allow the study of complex non-periodic\ndynamics of the external magnetic fields during global geomagnetic storms, as\nwell as periodicities in the magnetospheric coefficients linked to solar\nactivities and periodic ionospheric magnetic fields linked to lunar daily\nvariations, contributing to a more complete picture of the dynamics of the\nexternal currents and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, and facilitating\nmore accurate space weather nowcast and forecast.

Then the self-exciting REs (SEREs) can be\nconstructed in similar way as, e.g., semi-Markov REs, but instead of\nsemi-Markov process $x(t)$ we have SwishP. We give classifications and examples\nof self-exciting REs (SEREs). Then we consider two limit theorems for SEREs\nsuch as averaging (Theorem 1) and diffusion approximation (Theorem 2).\nApplications of SEREs are devoted to the so-called self-exciting\ntraffic/transport process and self-exciting summation on a Markov chain, which\nare examples of continuous and discrete SERE. From these processes we can\nconstruct many other self-exciting processes, e.g., such as impulse\ntraffic/transport process, self-exciting risk process, general compound Hawkes\nprocess for a stock price, etc. We present averaged and diffusion approximation\nof self-exciting processes. The novelty of the paper associated with new\nmodels, such as $x(t)$ and SERE, and also new features of SEREs and their many\napplications, namely, self-exciting and clustering effects.",

    "abstract": "Current methods of implementing wireless radio typically take one of two\nforms; either dedicated fixed-function hardware, or pure Software Defined Radio\n(SDR). Fixed function hardware is efficient, but being specific to each radio\nstandard it lacks flexibility, whereas Software Defined Radio is highly\nflexible but requires powerful processors to meet real-time performance\nconstraints. This paper presents a hybrid hardware/software approach that aims\nto combine the flexibility of SDR with the efficiency of dedicated hardware\nsolutions. We evaluate this approach by simulating five variants of the IEEE\n802.15.4 protocol, commonly known as Zigbee, and demonstrate the range of\nperformance and power consumption characteristics for different accelerator and\nsoftware configurations. Across the spectrum of configurations we see power\nconsumption varies from 8% to 38% of a dedicated hardware implementation, and\nshow how the hybrid approach allows a new modulation standard to be retrofitted\nto an existing design, with only a modest increase in power consumption.",

    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress in knowledge transfer across visual and textual\ndomains, extending these achievements to indoor localization, particularly for\nlearning transferable representations among Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprint datasets, remains a challenge. This is due to inherent\ndiscrepancies among these RSS datasets, largely including variations in\nbuilding structure, the input number and disposition of WiFi anchors.\nAccordingly, specialized networks, which were deprived of the ability to\ndiscern transferable representations, readily incorporate environment-sensitive\nclues into the learning process, hence limiting their potential when applied to\nspecific RSS datasets. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play (PnP) framework\nof knowledge transfer, facilitating the exploitation of transferable\nrepresentations for specialized networks directly on target RSS datasets\nthrough two main phases. Initially, we design an Expert Training phase, which\nfeatures multiple surrogate generative teachers, all serving as a global\nadapter that homogenizes the input disparities among independent source RSS\ndatasets while preserving their unique characteristics. In a subsequent Expert\nDistilling phase, we continue introducing a triplet of underlying constraints\nthat requires minimizing the differences in essential knowledge between the\nspecialized network and surrogate teachers through refining its representation\nlearning on the target dataset. This process implicitly fosters a\nrepresentational alignment in such a way that is less sensitive to specific\nenvironmental dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark WiFi\nRSS fingerprint datasets underscore the effectiveness of the framework that\nsignificantly exerts the full potential of specialized networks in\nlocalization.",

However, this\nfairness is evaluated on metrics that do not capture model uncertainty and on\ndatasets with only one, relatively large, minority group. As a remedy,\nmulticalibration has been introduced to measure fairness while accommodating\nuncertainty and accounting for multiple minority groups. However, existing\nmethods of improving multicalibration involve reducing initial training data to\ncreate a holdout set for post-processing, which is not ideal when minority\ntraining data is already sparse. This paper uses multicalibration to more\nrigorously examine data augmentation for classification fairness.

In the associated\nFeynman diagram, external photon lines are supplanted with lines representing\nthe c-number field. This modifies the cross section by factors proportional to\npowers of the Fourier amplitude of the classical field (and its complex\nconjugate). We demonstrate this explicitly by comparing different reaction\nchannels of low-energy photon-photon scattering in a classical background. We\nfind that background field cross sections typically undergo coherent\nenhancement and for some reaction channels display a more favourable scaling\nwith centre-of-mass energy compared to the vacuum process. Similar coherent\nenhancement may be found for leading-order pair annihilation to one photon, but\nthis competes with kinematic suppression.

In a\nRAG system, a retriever fetches passages from a collection in response to a\nquestion, which are then included in the prompt of a large language model (LLM)\nfor generating a natural language (NL) answer. However, several RAG systems\ntoday suffer from two shortcomings: (i) retrieved passages usually contain\ntheir raw text and lack appropriate document context, negatively impacting both\nretrieval and answering quality; and (ii) attribution strategies that explain\nanswer generation typically rely only on similarity between the answer and the\nretrieved passages, thereby only generating plausible but not causal\nexplanations. In this work, we demonstrate RAGONITE, a RAG system that remedies\nthe above concerns by: (i) contextualizing evidence with source metadata and\nsurrounding text; and (ii) computing counterfactual attribution, a causal\nexplanation approach where the contribution of an evidence to an answer is\ndetermined by the similarity of the original response to the answer obtained by\nremoving that evidence. To evaluate our proposals, we release a new benchmark\nConfQuestions: it has 300 hand-created conversational questions, each in\nEnglish and German, coupled with ground truth URLs, completed questions, and\nanswers from 215 public Confluence pages.

Our primary contribution is\nthe development of a metric that estimates potential epistemic uncertainty\nleveraging prediction interval-generation neural networks. This estimation\nrelies on the distance between the predicted upper and lower bounds and the\nobserved data at the tested positions and their neighboring points. Our second\ncontribution is the proposal of a batch sampling strategy based on Gaussian\nprocesses (GPs).

    "abstract": "Recent token reduction methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) incorporate\ntoken merging, which measures the similarities between token embeddings and\ncombines the most similar pairs. However, their merging policies are directly\ndependent on intermediate features in ViTs, which prevents exploiting features\ntailored for merging and requires end-to-end training to improve token merging.\nIn this paper, we propose Decoupled Token Embedding for Merging (DTEM) that\nenhances token merging through a decoupled embedding learned via a continuously\nrelaxed token merging process. Our method introduces a lightweight embedding\nmodule decoupled from the ViT forward pass to extract dedicated features for\ntoken merging, thereby addressing the restriction from using intermediate\nfeatures. The continuously relaxed token merging, applied during training,\nenables us to learn the decoupled embeddings in a differentiable manner. Thanks\nto the decoupled structure, our method can be seamlessly integrated into\nexisting ViT backbones and trained either modularly by learning only the\ndecoupled embeddings or end-to-end by fine-tuning. We demonstrate the\napplicability of DTEM on various tasks, including classification, captioning,\nand segmentation, with consistent improvement in token merging. Especially in\nthe ImageNet-1k classification, DTEM achieves a 37.2% reduction in FLOPs while\nmaintaining a top-1 accuracy of 79.85% with DeiT-small.

    "abstract": "Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in oncology often allow control group\nparticipants to crossover to experimental treatments, a practice that, while\noften ethically necessary, complicates the accurate estimation of long-term\ntreatment effects. When crossover rates are high or sample sizes are limited,\ncommonly used methods for crossover adjustment (such as the rank-preserving\nstructural failure time model, inverse probability of censoring weights, and\ntwo-stage estimation (TSE)) may produce imprecise estimates. Real-world data\n(RWD) can be used to develop an external control arm for the RCT, although this\napproach ignores evidence from trial subjects who did not crossover and ignores\nevidence from the data obtained prior to crossover for those subjects who did.\nThis paper introduces ''augmented two-stage estimation'' (ATSE), a method that\ncombines data from non-switching participants in a RCT with an external\ndataset, forming a ''hybrid non-switching arm''. With a simulation study, we\nevaluate the ATSE method's performance compared to TSE crossover adjustment and\nan external control arm approach. Results indicate that performance is\ndependent on scenario characteristics, but when unconfounded external data are\navailable, ATSE may result in less bias and improved precision compared to TSE\nand external control arm approaches. When external data are affected by\nunmeasured confounding, ATSE becomes prone to bias, but to a lesser extent\ncompared to an external control arm approach.",

Unlike traditional methods that adjust forecast parameters and\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) separately, this framework jointly optimizes\nboth the forecast model parameters and the decision conservativeness, which\ndetermines the size of the ambiguity set in the DR-OPF model. The framework\naligns UQ with actual uncertainty realizations by directly optimizing\ndownstream operational costs, a process referred to as cost-oriented\ncalibration. The calibration is achieved using a gradient descent approach. To\nenable efficient differentiation, the DR-OPF problem is reformulated into a\nconvex form, and the Envelope Theorem is leveraged to simplify gradient\nderivation in the two-stage setting. Additionally, the framework supports\ndistributed implementation, enhancing data privacy and reducing computational\noverhead.

Tracking Probe Requests over time offers insights\ninto movement patterns, traffic flows, and behavior trends, which are keys in\napplications such as urban planning, human mobility analysis, and retail\nanalytics. To protect user privacy, techniques such as MAC address\nrandomization are employed, periodically altering device MAC addresses to limit\ntracking.

By analyzing the Information Elements (IE) within the Probe\nRequest body, it is possible to fingerprint devices and track users over time.\nThis paper presents a machine learning-based approach for fingerprinting Wi-Fi\nProbe Requests in a compact fashion. We utilize Asymmetric Pairwise Boosting to\nlearn discriminating filters which are then used to process specific bit\nsequences in Probe Request frames, and quantize the results into a compact\nbinary format.

    "abstract": "Concept Drift has been extensively studied within the context of Stream\nLearning. However, it is often assumed that the deployed model's predictions\nplay no role in the concept drift the system experiences. Closer inspection\nreveals that this is not always the case. Automated trading might be prone to\nself-fulfilling feedback loops. Likewise, malicious entities might adapt to\nevade detectors in the adversarial setting resulting in a self-negating\nfeedback loop that requires the deployed models to constantly retrain. Such\nsettings where a model may induce concept drift are called performative. In\nthis work, we investigate this phenomenon. Our contributions are as follows:\nFirst, we define performative drift within a stream learning setting and\ndistinguish it from other causes of drift. We introduce a novel type of drift\ndetection task, aimed at identifying potential performative concept drift in\ndata streams. We propose a first such performative drift detection approach,\ncalled CheckerBoard Performative Drift Detection (CB-PDD). We apply CB-PDD to\nboth synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets that exhibit varying degrees of\nself-fulfilling feedback loops. Results are positive with CB-PDD showing high\nefficacy, low false detection rates, resilience to intrinsic drift,\ncomparability to other drift detection techniques, and an ability to\neffectively detect performative drift in semi-synthetic datasets. Secondly, we\nhighlight the role intrinsic (traditional) drift plays in obfuscating\nperformative drift and discuss the implications of these findings as well as\nthe limitations of CB-PDD.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel ISAC waveform design strategy, called the\nspatial-division ISAC (SD-ISAC) waveform, which simplifies the ISAC waveform\ndesign problem by decoupling it into separate communication and radar waveform\ndesign tasks. Specifically, the proposed strategy leverages the null-space of\nthe communication channel to superimpose sensing signals onto communication\nsignals without interference. This approach offers multiple benefits, including\nreduced complexity and the reuse of existing communication and radar waveforms.\nWe then address the problem of optimizing the spatial and temporal properties\nof the proposed waveform.

Despite its inherent privacy benefits, a\nmalicious data provider can simply deviate from the correct training protocol\nwithout being detected, potentially compromising the trained model. While\ncurrent solutions have explored the use of trusted execution environments\n(TEEs) to combat such attacks, they usually assume side-channel attacks against\nthe TEEs are out of scope. However, such side-channel attacks can undermine the\nsecurity properties of TEE-based FL frameworks, not by extracting the FL data,\nbut by leaking keys that allow the adversary to impersonate as the TEE whilst\ndeviating arbitrarily from the correct training protocol.\n  We describe ExclaveFL, an FL platform that provides end-to-end integrity and\ntransparency, even in the presence of side-channel attacks on TEEs. We propose\na new paradigm in which existing TEEs are used as exclaves --\nintegrity-protected execution environments that do not contain any secrets,\nmaking them immune to side-channel attacks. Whereas previous approaches attest\nthe TEE itself and bind this attestation to a key held by the TEE, ExclaveFL\nattests individual data transformations at runtime. These runtime attestations\nform an attested dataflow graph, which can be checked to ensure the FL training\njob satisfies claims, such as deviations from the correct computation. We\nimplement ExclaveFL by extending the popular NVFlare FL framework to use\nexclaves, and show experimentally that ExclaveFL introduces less than 10%\noverhead compared to the same FL framework without TEEs, whilst providing\nstronger security guarantees.",

This is explained through first-principles\nspin-diffusion coefficient calculations and finite-element polarization\nsimulations. The simulated zero-quantum (flip-flop) line width governing the\nspin diffusion is found to agree with the experimentally accessible\nsingle-quantum (single spin flip, e.g. radio-frequency pulse) line width.

By\napplying methods originally designed to improve one robustness type across both\ncontexts, we analyze their performance on adversarial and out-of-distribution\nbenchmark datasets. The input of the model consists of text samples, with the\noutput prediction evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1\nscores in various natural language inference tasks.\n  Our findings highlight nuanced interactions between adversarial robustness\nand OOD robustness, with results indicating limited transferability between the\ntwo robustness types. Through targeted ablations, we evaluate how these\ncorrelations evolve with different model sizes and architectures, uncovering\nmodel-specific trends: smaller models like LLaMA2-7b exhibit neutral\ncorrelations, larger models like LLaMA2-13b show negative correlations, and\nMixtral demonstrates positive correlations, potentially due to domain-specific\nalignment. These results underscore the importance of hybrid robustness\nframeworks that integrate adversarial and OOD strategies tailored to specific\nmodels and domains.

Quantum mechanics is generally constrained\nby the uncertainty principle and, therefore, cannot interpret definite\nobservations without uncertainty. Here, we resolve this enigma by demonstrating\nthat in phase space quantum mechanics, particularly through the Wigner Moyal\nequation, uncertainty can be arbitrarily adjusted by tuning the observation\nwindow. An observation window much smaller than the uncertainty limit causes\nsubstantial nonlocality, rendering the problem ill posed. This suggests that\nonly with sufficient uncertainty does nonlocality become bounded, resulting in\na well posed universe. Conversely, in the absence of uncertainty, spacetime is\nwarped beyond recognition, and the system exists as a superposition of numerous\npossible states. Measurement collapses this superposition into a unique\nsolution, exhibiting timeless nonlocal interactions.

    "abstract": "This work is inspired by the problem of characterizing a dependence measure\nbetween two cortical regions of the brain where each region contains multiple\nsignal recordings from several neurons or channels (e.g., inhibitory and\nexcitatory neurons). The goal is to identify differences in the structure of\nbrain functional connectivity between known brain states. An exploratory tool\nfor studying the dependence between two random vectors is via canonical\ncorrelation analysis. However, these are limited to only capturing linear\nassociations and are sensitive to outlier observations. Mitigating these\nlimitations is crucial because brain functional connectivity is likely to be\nmore complex than linear, and brain signals may exhibit heavy-tailed\nproperties. To overcome these limitations, we develop a robust method,\nKendall's tau-based canonical coherence (KenCoh), to learn connectivity\nstructure among neuronal signals filtered at given frequency bands. Our\nsimulation study demonstrates that KenCoh is competitive with the moment-based\nestimator and outperforms the latter when the underlying distributions are\nheavy-tailed. We apply our method to EEG recordings from a virtual-reality\ndriving experiment and to calcium imaging recordings in inhibitory and\nexcitatory neurons of the auditory cortex in mice subjected to sound stimuli.\nOur findings reveal distinct regional dependencies across frequency bands and\nbrain states.",

This is particularly advantageous in extended\nKalman filters, as it makes the propagation of the error covariance robust to\nlarge estimation errors. In this work, we construct invariant Kalman filters to\nthe trajectory of one system relative to another.

    "abstract": "Many algorithms have been developed to estimate probability distributions\nsubject to differential privacy (DP): such an algorithm takes as input\nindependent samples from a distribution and estimates the density function in a\nway that is insensitive to any one sample. A recent line of work, initiated by\nRaskhodnikova et al. (Neurips '21), explores a weaker objective: a\ndifferentially private algorithm that approximates a single sample from the\ndistribution. Raskhodnikova et al. studied the sample complexity of DP\n\\emph{single-sampling} i.e., the minimum number of samples needed to perform\nthis task. They showed that the sample complexity of DP single-sampling is less\nthan the sample complexity of DP learning for certain distribution classes. We\ndefine two variants of \\emph{multi-sampling}, where the goal is to privately\napproximate $m>1$ samples. This better models the realistic scenario where\nsynthetic data is needed for exploratory data analysis.\n  A baseline solution to \\emph{multi-sampling} is to invoke a single-sampling\nalgorithm $m$ times on independently drawn datasets of samples. When the data\ncomes from a finite domain, we improve over the baseline by a factor of $m$ in\nthe sample complexity. When the data comes from a Gaussian, Ghazi et al.\n(Neurips '23) show that \\emph{single-sampling} can be performed under\napproximate differential privacy; we show it is possible to \\emph{single- and\nmulti-sample Gaussians with known covariance subject to pure DP}.

This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the\nillusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between\ntwo variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been\nproposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,\nstereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this\nresearch, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) develop causal\nillusions, both in real-world and controlled laboratory contexts of causal\nlearning and inference. To this end, we built a dataset of over 2K samples\nincluding purely correlational cases, situations with null contingency, and\ncases where temporal information excludes the possibility of causality by\nplacing the potential effect before the cause. We then prompted the models to\nmake statements or answer causal questions to evaluate their tendencies to\ninfer causation erroneously in these structured settings. Our findings show a\nstrong presence of causal illusion bias in LLMs. Specifically, in open-ended\ngeneration tasks involving spurious correlations, the models displayed bias at\nlevels comparable to, or even lower than, those observed in similar studies on\nhuman subjects. However, when faced with null-contingency scenarios or temporal\ncues that negate causal relationships, where it was required to respond on a\n0-100 scale, the models exhibited significantly higher bias. These findings\nsuggest that the models have not uniformly, consistently, or reliably\ninternalized the normative principles essential for accurate causal learning.",

In the evolving quantum computing landscape, it is\nimperative to study these security challenges within the scope of realistic\nthreat model assumptions, wherein an adversarial user can mount practical\nattacks without relying on any heightened privileges afforded by physical\naccess to a quantum computer or rogue cloud services. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the potential of crosstalk as an attack vector for the first time\non a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machine, that an adversarial user\ncan exploit within a multi-tenant quantum computing model. The proposed\nside-channel attack is conducted with minimal and realistic adversarial\nprivileges, with the overarching aim of uncovering the quantum algorithm being\nexecuted by a victim. Crosstalk signatures are used to estimate the presence of\nCNOT gates in the victim circuit, and subsequently, this information is encoded\nand classified by a graph-based learning model to identify the victim quantum\nalgorithm. When evaluated on up to 336 benchmark circuits, our attack framework\nis found to be able to unveil the victim's quantum algorithm with up to 85.7\\%\naccuracy.",

When\nconsidering a Bell test involving three parties, we may even find a remarkable\nsituation where the nonlocality in two bipartite subsystems {\\em forces} the\nremaining bipartite subsystem to exhibit nonlocality. This intriguing effect,\ndubbed nonlocality transitivity, was first identified in the non-quantum\nnon-signaling world in 2011. However, whether such transitivity could manifest\nwithin quantum theory has remained unresolved -- until now. Here, we provide\nthe first affirmative answer to this open problem at the level of quantum\nstates, thereby showing that there exists a quantum-realizable notion of\nnonlocality transitivity. Specifically, by leveraging the possibility of\nBell-inequality violation by tensoring, we analytically construct a pair of\nnonlocal bipartite states such that simultaneously realizing them in a\ntripartite system induces nonlocality in the remaining bipartite subsystem. En\nroute to showing this, we also prove that multiple copies of the $W$-state\nmarginals uniquely determine the global compatible state, thus establishing\nanother instance when the parts determine the whole. Surprisingly, the\nnonlocality transitivity of quantum states also occurs among the reduced states\nof Haar-random three-qutrit pure states. We further show that the transitivity\nof quantum steering can already be demonstrated with the marginals of a\nthree-qubit $W$ state, showing again another noteworthy difference between the\ntwo forms of quantum correlations. Finally, we present a simple method to\nconstruct quantum states and correlations that are nonlocal in all their\nnon-unipartite marginals, which may be of independent interest.",

While the anomaly in pseudospin-1/2 (Weyl) systems is\nwell-established, its extension to higher-pseudospin fermions remains a\nfrontier with critical implications for transport phenomena in materials with\nmultifold fermions. We present a rigorous quasiclassical analysis of CA and\nlongitudinal magnetotransport in pseudospin-1 fermions, advancing beyond\nconventional models that assume constant relaxation times and neglect the\norbital magnetic moment and global charge conservation. Our study uncovers a\nmagnetic-field dependence of the longitudinal magnetoconductance: it is\npositive and quadratic-in-B for weak internode scattering and transitions to\nnegative values beyond a critical internode scattering strength. Notably, the\ncritical threshold is lower for pseudospin-1 fermions compared to their\npseudospin-1/2 counterparts. We show analytically that the zero-field\nconductivity is affected more strongly by internode scattering for pseudospin-1\nfermions than conventional Weyl fermions.

Previous studies of dynamical freezing have largely been\nrestricted to a high-frequency Floquet-Magnus expansion, and numerical exact\ndiagonalization, which are unable to capture the slow approach to\nthermalization (or lack thereof) in a systematic fashion. By employing Floquet\nflow-renormalization, where the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is\ngradually decoupled from the effective Hamiltonian using a sequence of unitary\ntransformations, we unveil the universal approach to dynamical freezing and\nbeyond, at asymptotically late times. We analyze the fixed-point behavior\nassociated with the flow-renormalization at and near freezing using both\nexact-diagonalization and tensor-network based methods, and contrast the\nresults with conventional prethermal phenomenon. For a generic non-integrable\nspin Hamiltonian with a periodic cosine wave drive, the flow approaches an\nunstable fixed point with an approximate emergent symmetry.

In this paper, we propose a\nworld-model-based framework to exploit the scene evolution for perception. We\nreformulate 3D occupancy prediction as a 4D occupancy forecasting problem\nconditioned on the current sensor input.

Current safety measures are typically limited to text-based filtering\nor concept removal strategies, able to remove just a few concepts from the\nmodel's generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce AlignGuard, a\nmethod for safety alignment of T2I models. We enable the application of Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) for safety purposes in T2I models by\nsynthetically generating a dataset of harmful and safe image-text pairs, which\nwe call CoProV2. Using a custom DPO strategy and this dataset, we train safety\nexperts, in the form of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices, able to guide the\ngeneration process away from specific safety-related concepts. Then, we merge\nthe experts into a single LoRA using a novel merging strategy for optimal\nscaling performance. This expert-based approach enables scalability, allowing\nus to remove 7x more harmful concepts from T2I models compared to baselines.\nAlignGuard consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art on many benchmarks and\nestablishes new practices for safety alignment in T2I networks.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained via contrastive learning have achieved\nnotable success in natural image tasks. However, their application in the\nmedical domain remains limited due to the scarcity of openly accessible,\nlarge-scale medical image-text datasets. Existing medical VLMs either train on\nclosed-source proprietary or relatively small open-source datasets that do not\ngeneralize well. Similarly, most models remain specific to a single or limited\nnumber of medical imaging domains, again restricting their applicability to\nother modalities. To address this gap, we introduce UniMed, a large-scale,\nopen-source multi-modal medical dataset comprising over 5.3 million image-text\npairs across six diverse imaging modalities: X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound,\nPathology, and Fundus. UniMed is developed using a data-collection framework\nthat leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform modality-specific\nclassification datasets into image-text formats while incorporating existing\nimage-text data from the medical domain, facilitating scalable VLM pretraining.\nUsing UniMed, we trained UniMed-CLIP, a unified VLM for six modalities that\nsignificantly outperforms existing generalist VLMs and matches\nmodality-specific medical VLMs, achieving notable gains in zero-shot\nevaluations. For instance, UniMed-CLIP improves over BiomedCLIP (trained on\nproprietary data) by an absolute gain of +12.61, averaged over 21 datasets,\nwhile using 3x less training data. To facilitate future research, we release\nUniMed dataset, training codes, and models at\nhttps://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/UniMed-CLIP.",

Most existing methods adopt dense representations\n(e.g., bird's eye view) or sparse representations (e.g., instance boxes) for\ndecision-making, which suffer from the trade-off between comprehensiveness and\nefficiency. This paper explores a Gaussian-centric end-to-end autonomous\ndriving (GaussianAD) framework and exploits 3D semantic Gaussians to\nextensively yet sparsely describe the scene. We initialize the scene with\nuniform 3D Gaussians and use surrounding-view images to progressively refine\nthem to obtain the 3D Gaussian scene representation. We then use sparse\nconvolutions to efficiently perform 3D perception (e.g., 3D detection, semantic\nmap construction). We predict 3D flows for the Gaussians with dynamic semantics\nand plan the ego trajectory accordingly with an objective of future scene\nforecasting. Our GaussianAD can be trained in an end-to-end manner with\noptional perception labels when available. Extensive experiments on the widely\nused nuScenes dataset verify the effectiveness of our end-to-end GaussianAD on\nvarious tasks including motion planning, 3D occupancy prediction, and 4D\noccupancy forecasting.

As a proof\nof concept, we apply this measure to the typology of word classes. Our measure\ncaptures the contentfulness asymmetry between functional (grammatical) and\nlexical (content) classes across languages, but contradicts the view that\nfunctional classes do not convey content. Moreover, we find universal trends in\nthe hierarchy of groundedness (e.g., nouns > adjectives > verbs), and show that\nour measure partly correlates with psycholinguistic concreteness norms in\nEnglish.

To address this task, we utilise geometric\nflows, in particular generalised Ricci flow, to probe the associated scalar\nfield spaces. Considering internal spaces supported by three-form fluxes, we\nfirst show that the distance defined in terms of the Perelman entropy\nfunctional needs to be refined in order to encompass fluxes.

This allows us to probe infinite-distance points within\nthese scalar field spaces in a purely geometric way. We subsequently construct\na geometric flow for internal manifolds supported by Ramond-Ramond fluxes and\ndiscuss its role in the Ricci Flow Conjecture. Our analysis suggests that in\nthe presence of fluxes the Distance Conjecture might be better characterised in\nterms of a cost function on the space of metrics, rather than a genuine\ndistance.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of releasing a sparse histogram under $(\\varepsilon,\n\\delta)$-differential privacy. The stability histogram independently adds noise\nfrom a Laplace or Gaussian distribution to the non-zero entries and removes\nthose noisy counts below a threshold.\n  Thereby, the introduction of new non-zero values between neighboring\nhistograms is only revealed with probability at most $\\delta$, and typically,\nthe value of the threshold dominates the error of the mechanism. We consider\nthe variant of the stability histogram with Gaussian noise.\n  Recent works ([Joseph and Yu, COLT '24] and [Lebeda, SOSA '25]) reduced the\nerror for private histograms using correlated Gaussian noise. However, these\ntechniques can not be directly applied in the very sparse setting. Instead, we\nadopt Lebeda's technique and show that adding correlated noise to the non-zero\ncounts only allows us to reduce the magnitude of noise when we have a sparsity\nbound. This, in turn, allows us to use a lower threshold by up to a factor of\n$1/2$ compared to the non-correlated noise mechanism. We then extend our\nmechanism to a setting without a known bound on sparsity. Additionally, we show\nthat correlated noise can give a similar improvement for the more practical\ndiscrete Gaussian mechanism.",

Many of the spectra were recorded during\ncampaigns in 1922 and 1937, and sample wavelengths between 0.39 and 0.50um.\nSpectra of poor quality are identified. Mean spectra near orbital phases 0.25\nand 0.75 match many characteristics of synthetic spectra, although Hgamma and\nHeI 4388 are exceptions. Evidence is presented that Hgamma was affected by\ntransient activity in 1937, but not in 1922. Emission lines of NIII and HeII\nmove with wavelength in a manner that is consistent with them tracking the\nmotion of the secondary, indicating that an 'f' spectral type designation\nshould be assigned to the secondary. The location of the peak that is\nassociated with the secondary in cross-correlation functions changes with time\nnear phase 0.75, although the mean amplitude of the radial velocity curve of\nthe secondary did not change between the two campaigns. There is also an offset\nin velocities of the primary measured from Hgamma and HeI 4472 near phase 0.25.\nThe velocity curves of the components suggest a mass ratio that is larger than\nprevious estimates, although uncertainties associated with the spectroscopic\nfeatures attributed to the secondary, coupled with the wavelength resolution of\nthe spectra, complicate efforts to determine robust masses. We conclude that\npeculiarities in the radial velocity curves of the components have thus been in\nplace for over a thousand orbital cycles.",

In many such application settings, nonholonomic robots, like\nunicycles with restricted motion, require precise planning and control of both\ntranslational and orientational motion to approach specific locations in a\ndesignated orientation, such as for approaching changing, parking, and loading\nareas. In this paper, we introduce a new dual-headway unicycle pose control\nmethod by leveraging an adaptively placed headway point in front of the\nunicycle pose and a tailway point behind the goal pose. In summary, the\nunicycle robot continuously follows its headway point, which chases the tailway\npoint of the goal pose and the asymptotic motion of the tailway point towards\nthe goal position guides the unicycle robot to approach the goal location with\nthe correct orientation. The simple and intuitive geometric construction of\ndual-headway unicycle pose control enables an explicit convex feedback motion\nprediction bound on the closed-loop unicycle motion trajectory for fast and\naccurate safety verification. We present an application of dual-headway\nunicycle control for optimal sampling-based motion planning around obstacles.\nIn numerical simulations, we show that optimal unicycle motion planning using\ndual-headway translation and orientation distances significantly outperforms\nEuclidean translation and cosine orientation distances in generating smooth\nmotion with minimal travel and turning effort.",

However, current vision-guided robot state\ngeneration methods often falter in this regard, as they lack the integration of\ntactile perception. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a novel state\ndiffusion framework termed SafeDiff. It generates a prospective state sequence\nfrom the current robot state and visual context observation while incorporating\nreal-time tactile feedback to refine the sequence. As far as we know, this is\nthe first study specifically focused on ensuring force safety in robotic\nmanipulation. It significantly enhances the rationality of state planning, and\nthe safe action trajectory is derived from inverse dynamics based on this\nrefined planning. In practice, unlike previous approaches that concatenate\nvisual and tactile data to generate future robot state sequences, our method\nemploys tactile data as a calibration signal to adjust the robot's state within\nthe state space implicitly. Additionally, we've developed a large-scale\nsimulation dataset called SafeDoorManip50k, offering extensive multimodal data\nto train and evaluate the proposed method.

    "abstract": "We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid\nin the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and\nquantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables\n$(\\rho, p, u^\\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is\ninherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent\nformulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite\ndimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\\omega = 0$ for\nthe transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum\ntheory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the\nincompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by\nquantum effects to become $\\omega \\propto \\mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental\nexcitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits\ninfinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV\nquantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite\nsymmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that\npreserves a deformed version of such symmetry.",

We fit a combination of a blackbody\nand a power-law function to the OIR data, in the blazar rest frame, to extract\nthe corresponding thermal (disc) and non-thermal (jet) components from the\ntotal flux. We carry out this analysis for the entire duration of the light\ncurves to obtain the variation of the disc and jet components over years.\nReliability of our fits have been affirmed by successfully retrieving accurate\nparameters by employing our method to simulated data and by comparing our\nresults with published disc luminosity obtained by other methods for a few\nwell-observed blazars. In blazars, the thermal (disc) emission is difficult to\nextract because the relativistically beamed radiation of the jet dominates at\nall wavelengths. By employing this method, the disc emission in blazars may be\nestimated directly from photometric data at OIR bands instead of indirect\nmethods, such as, inferring it from the emission line luminosities. We find\nthat the variability of the disc and jet emission obtained by the above method\nare strongly correlated in most cases.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation often suffers from significant performance degradation\nwhen the trained network is applied to a different domain. To address this\nissue, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been extensively studied.\nExisting methods introduce the domain bridging techniques to mitigate\nsubstantial domain gap, which construct intermediate domains to facilitate the\ngradual transfer of knowledge across different domains. However, these\nstrategies often require dataset-specific designs and may generate unnatural\nintermediate distributions that lead to semantic shift. In this paper, we\npropose DiDA, a universal degradation-based bridging technique formalized as a\ndiffusion forward process. DiDA consists of two key modules: (1)\nDegradation-based Intermediate Domain Construction, which creates continuous\nintermediate domains through simple image degradation operations to encourage\nlearning domain-invariant features as domain differences gradually diminish;\n(2) Semantic Shift Compensation, which leverages a diffusion encoder to encode\nand compensate for semantic shift information with degraded time-steps,\npreserving discriminative representations in the intermediate domains. As a\nplug-and-play solution, DiDA supports various degradation operations and\nseamlessly integrates with existing UDA methods. Extensive experiments on\nprevalent synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that\nDiDA consistently improves performance across different settings and achieves\nnew state-of-the-art results when combined with existing methods.",

A\nnovel numerical modeling approach is introduced where the liquid column is\ntreated as a spring-mass system. This approach can reproduce compressibility\neffects in the liquid column and is used to investigate the wave dynamics\nresponsible for the onset of tension and cavitation in the liquid column. The\nmodel is formulated as a coupled set of non-linear differential equations that\nreproduce the dynamics of an experiment while capturing the pressure wave\nactivity in the liquid column. A parametric study is conducted experimentally\nand numerically to investigate the behavior behind the onset of cavitation. The\nmechanism for the onset of cavitation is identified as a series of wave\nreflections at the boundaries of the liquid column, and this mechanism is found\nto be well reproduced by the model.

In financial\nnetworks, such reciprocity characterizes the importance of individual banks as\nboth liquidity absorber and provider, a feature typically attributed to large,\nintermediating dealer banks. In this paper we develop an exponential random\ngraph model that can account for reciprocal links of each node simultaneously\non the topological as well as on the weighted level. We provide an exact\nexpression for the normalizing constant and thus a closed-form solution for the\ngraph probability distribution. Applying this statistical null model to Italian\ninterbank data, we find that before the great financial crisis (i) banks\ndisplayed significantly more weighted reciprocity compared to what the\nlower-order network features (size and volume distributions) would predict (ii)\nwith a disappearance of this deviation once the early periods of the crisis set\nin, (iii) a trend which can be attributed in particular to smaller banks\n(dis)engaging in bilateral high-value trading relationships. Moreover, we show\nthat neglecting reciprocal links and weights can lead to spurious findings of\ntriadic relationships. As the hierarchical structure in the network is found to\nbe compatible with its transitive but not with its intransitive triadic\nsub-graphs, the interbank market seems to be well-characterized by a\nhierarchical core-periphery structure enhanced by non-hierarchical reciprocal\ntrading relationships.",

A deeper understanding of the\ndominant polarization transfer mechanisms between electrons and 1H and 13C\nspins at these unconventional benchtop conditions is therefore required if one\nwants to devise strategies to boost sensitivity further. In this study, we\nfound that DNP is generally dominated by solid effect for narrow electron\nparamagnetic resonance (EPR) line radicals (15 mM trityl OX063) and cross\neffect for broad EPR line radicals (50 mM TEMPOL). For both radicals, the\ndominant DNP mechanisms were investigated varying the microwave frequency and\nmeasuring the 1H and 13C DNP enhancement factors to obtain 1H and 13C DNP\nspectra. The impact of varying the microwave power on the 1H DNP buildup times\nand the 1H nuclear spin relaxation times were important as well to distinguish\nbetween solid effect and cross effect DNP. Finally, time-resolved electron\nsaturation simulations under continuous microwave irradiation could replicate\nthe experimental 1H and 13C DNP spectra at 1 T and 77 K for both radicals\nconsidering their electron relaxation properties. Only for trityl OX063, the\n13C DNP spectra showed additional DNP maxima compared to the simulations.

Each\nconfiguration is categorized according to the properties of the scalar field,\nwith an in-depth analysis of the horizon and throat structures, asymptotic\nbehaviour, and singularities. These findings underscore the versatility of HMPG\nin capturing complex gravitational phenomena and broadens the scope of the\ntheory, offering a robust framework for modelling gravitational phenomena\nacross a range of astrophysical contexts.

In recent years, an increasing number of\ndoubly-lensed events have been observed, where a secondary lens crosses the\nline of sight. This causes additional or distorted scintillation arcs over time\nscales ranging from days to months. In this work we report such a transient\nevent for pulsar B1737+13 and propose a possible lensing geometry including the\ndistance to both lenses, and the orientation of the main screen. Using phase\nretrieval techniques to separate the two lenses in the wavefield, we report a\ncurvature and rate of motion of features associated with the secondary lens as\nit passed through the line of sight. By fitting the annual variation of the\ncurvature, we report a possible distance and orientation for the main screen.\nThe distance of the secondary lens is found by mapping the secondary feature\nonto the sky and tracking its position over time for different distances. We\nvalidate this method using B0834+06, for which the screen solutions are known\nthrough VLBI, and successfully recover the correct solution for the secondary\nfeature.

    "abstract": "Quantum random access memory (QRAM) is required for numerous quantum\nalgorithms and network architectures. Previous work has shown that the\nubiquitous bucket-brigade QRAM is highly resilient to arbitrary local\nincoherent noise channels occurring during the operation of the QRAM [PRX\nQuantum 2, 020311 (2021)], with query infidelities growing only\npolylogarithmically with memory width when errors are assumed to only occur on\nindividual routers. We extend this result to a large class of generalized\nsettings that arise in realistic situations, including arbitrary initialization\nerrors, spatially correlated errors, as well as coherent errors, maintaining\nthe polylogarithmic scaling in all instances. Fully quantifying the extent to\nwhich QRAM's noise resilience holds may provide a guide for the design of QRAM\narchitectures - for instance, the resilience to initialization errors indicates\nthat a reset protocol between successive queries may not be necessary. In the\ncase of coherent errors, we find an up-to-quadratic increase in the infidelity\nbound, and therefore discuss generalizations to randomized compiling schemes,\nwhich usually are rendered inapplicable in the QRAM setting, to tailor these\nerrors into more favorable stochastic noise.",

Neutrino interactions (and the possible\nexistence of additional neutrinophilic mediators) are substantially less\nunderstood than those of other SM particles, yet this picture will change\ndramatically in the coming decades with new neutrino sources. One potential new\nsource arises with the construction of a high-energy muon collider (MuCol) --\ndue to muons' instability, a MuCol is a source of high-energy collimated\nneutrinos. Importantly, since the physics of muon decays (into neutrinos) is\nvery well-understood, this leads to a neutrino flux with systematic\nuncertainties far smaller than fluxes from conventional high-energy\n(proton-sourced) neutrino beams. In this work, we study the capabilities of a\npotential neutrino detector, \"MuCol$\\nu$,\" placed ~100 m downstream of the\nMuCol interaction point. The MuCol$\\nu$ detector would be especially capable of\nsearching for a neutrinophilic mediator $\\phi$ through the mono-neutrino\nscattering process $\\nu_\\mu N \\to \\mu^+ \\phi X$, exceeding searches from other\nterrestrial approaches for $m_\\phi$ in the ~few MeV -- ten GeV range.

For the language\ncomponent, we leverage DeepSeekMoE models with the Multi-head Latent Attention\nmechanism, which compresses Key-Value cache into latent vectors, to enable\nefficient inference and high throughput. Trained on an improved vision-language\ndataset, DeepSeek-VL2 demonstrates superior capabilities across various tasks,\nincluding but not limited to visual question answering, optical character\nrecognition, document/table/chart understanding, and visual grounding. Our\nmodel series is composed of three variants: DeepSeek-VL2-Tiny,\nDeepSeek-VL2-Small and DeepSeek-VL2, with 1.0B, 2.8B and 4.5B activated\nparameters respectively. DeepSeek-VL2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art\nperformance with similar or fewer activated parameters compared to existing\nopen-source dense and MoE-based models.

Such\nimaging systems have applications in diverse areas such as disaster response,\nremote surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

In this work, we demonstrate that the full TLTM on the relay\nsurface can be processed with efficient algorithms to computationally focus and\ndetect our illumination in different parts of the hidden scene, turning the\nrelay surface into a second-order active imaging system. These algorithms allow\nus to iterate on the measured, first-order TLTM, and extract a \\textbf{second\norder TLTM for surfaces in the hidden scene}.

    "abstract": "The pulsar timing technique, which compares the observed arrival times of\nelectromagnetic radiation from a pulsar with the predicted arrival times\nderived from a theoretical model of the pulsar system, is used in pulsar\nastronomy to infer a multitude of physical information and to constrain\npossible corrections to General Relativity (GR). The propagation delay is\nusually computed using formulas based on a post-Newtonian approach, for both\nthe light trajectory and the orbital motion. However, evidence has recently\nemerged that this approximation may no longer be sufficient when the companion\nobject is a supermassive black hole; deviations from a full GR computation of\nthe propagation delay can reach a few seconds. In this paper, we analyze the\ncase of binary pulsars with a stellar or intermediate black hole companion,\nwhose discovery and timing are key goals of SKA. With a numerical algorithm, we\nhave found that in this case, the full GR value depends only on the semi-major\naxis of the relative orbit and on the mass of the black hole companion. If the\nmass of the latter is sufficiently large ($100 M_{\\odot}$), the maximum\ndifference between the two approaches is significant ($\\sim10^{-7}$ s) even for\nlarge binaries ($\\sim10^{16}$ cm), and increases up to $\\sim 10^{-4}$ s when\nthe mass is $10^5 M_{\\odot}$. We also consider relativistic corrections to the\norbital motion, and discover that they can strongly affect the value of the\npropagation delay. We conclude that in the future, post-Newtonian formulas\nshould be replaced with a more accurate approach in these systems, especially\nin view of future discoveries made by new large telescopes such as SKA.",

To overcome this challenge, existing methods\noften use multi-modal models like CLIP, which combine image and text features\nin a shared embedding space to bridge the gap between limited and extensive\nvocabulary recognition, resulting in a two-stage approach: In the first stage,\na mask generator takes an input image to generate mask proposals, and the in\nthe second stage the target mask is picked based on the query. However, the\nexpected target mask may not exist in the generated mask proposals, which leads\nto an unexpected output mask. In our work, we propose a novel approach named\nPrompt-guided Mask Proposal (PMP) where the mask generator takes the input text\nprompts and generates masks guided by these prompts. Compared with mask\nproposals generated without input prompts, masks generated by PMP are better\naligned with the input prompts. To realize PMP, we designed a cross-attention\nmechanism between text tokens and query tokens which is capable of generating\nprompt-guided mask proposals after each decoding. We combined our PMP with\nseveral existing works employing a query-based segmentation backbone and the\nexperiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this\napproach, showcasing significant improvements over the current two-stage models\n(1% ~ 3% absolute performance gain in terms of mIOU).

    "abstract": "A myriad of measures to illustrate performance of predictive artificial\nintelligence (AI) models have been proposed in the literature. Selecting\nappropriate performance measures is essential for predictive AI models that are\ndeveloped to be used in medical practice, because poorly performing models may\nharm patients and lead to increased costs. We aim to assess the merits of\nclassic and contemporary performance measures when validating predictive AI\nmodels for use in medical practice. We focus on models with a binary outcome.\nWe discuss 32 performance measures covering five performance domains\n(discrimination, calibration, overall, classification, and clinical utility)\nalong with accompanying graphical assessments. The first four domains cover\nstatistical performance, the fifth domain covers decision-analytic performance.\nWe explain why two key characteristics are important when selecting which\nperformance measures to assess: (1) whether the measure's expected value is\noptimized when it is calculated using the correct probabilities (i.e., a\n\"proper\" measure), and (2) whether they reflect either purely statistical\nperformance or decision-analytic performance by properly considering\nmisclassification costs. Seventeen measures exhibit both characteristics,\nfourteen measures exhibited one characteristic, and one measure possessed\nneither characteristic (the F1 measure). All classification measures (such as\nclassification accuracy and F1) are improper for clinically relevant decision\nthresholds other than 0.5 or the prevalence. We recommend the following\nmeasures and plots as essential to report: AUROC, calibration plot, a clinical\nutility measure such as net benefit with decision curve analysis, and a plot\nwith probability distributions per outcome category.",

    "abstract": "Vertical land motion (VLM) observations obtained from Interferometric\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) have transformed our understanding of crustal\ndeformation processes over the past 3 decades. However, these observations are\noften related to a local reference frame, posing challenges for studies that\nrequire large-scale observations within a global reference frame, such as\nassessments of relative sea level rise and associated hazards. Here, we present\na novel approach that enables transforming InSAR-derived VLM at any location\nworldwide to a global (e.g., International Terrestrial Reference Frame)\nreference frame without a direct need for GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite\nSystem) measurements. To this end, we employ a coarse resolution model of\nglobal VLM obtained by interpolating rates of all available GNSS stations over\nthe global land areas. Our rationale is that the high-resolution InSAR-derived\nVLM data do not capture the long-wavelength signals present in the global VLM\nmodel. Therefore, we employ a set of 2D polynomial models to evaluate the\ndifference between InSAR-derived VLM and the global model and then add it back\nto the InSAR-derived VLM. We examined the validity of our rationale using\nnormalized power spectrum analysis and tested the effect of polynomial order on\nthe accuracy of transformed VLM and the overall success of our approach using\ntwo datasets from Los Angeles and New York City. This approach improves the\nusability of InSAR-derived VLM in geophysical applications, including\nmonitoring regional land subsidence.",

We explore the\nconsequences of hybridization via two model series: \\textit{Model Series A},\nconserving total moments of the same order across species, and \\textit{Model\nSeries B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we\nanalyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order\nmoments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions,\nand so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge\nsymmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading\nto true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with\nhybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce\nBose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the\nweak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global\nphase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical\nlattices via a third-order perturbation theory.

    "abstract": "Text-driven Image to Video Generation (TI2V) aims to generate controllable\nvideo given the first frame and corresponding textual description. The primary\nchallenges of this task lie in two parts: (i) how to identify the target\nobjects and ensure the consistency between the movement trajectory and the\ntextual description. (ii) how to improve the subjective quality of generated\nvideos. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a new diffusion-based TI2V\nframework, termed TIV-Diffusion, via object-centric textual-visual alignment,\nintending to achieve precise control and high-quality video generation based on\ntextual-described motion for different objects. Concretely, we enable our\nTIV-Diffuion model to perceive the textual-described objects and their motion\ntrajectory by incorporating the fused textual and visual knowledge through\nscale-offset modulation. Moreover, to mitigate the problems of object\ndisappearance and misaligned objects and motion, we introduce an object-centric\ntextual-visual alignment module, which reduces the risk of misaligned\nobjects/motion by decoupling the objects in the reference image and aligning\ntextual features with each object individually. Based on the above innovations,\nour TIV-Diffusion achieves state-of-the-art high-quality video generation\ncompared with existing TI2V methods.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) provide a compelling foundation for building\ngenerally-capable AI agents. These agents may soon be deployed at scale in the\nreal world, representing the interests of individual humans (e.g., AI\nassistants) or groups of humans (e.g., AI-accelerated corporations). At\npresent, relatively little is known about the dynamics of multiple LLM agents\ninteracting over many generations of iterative deployment. In this paper, we\nexamine whether a \"society\" of LLM agents can learn mutually beneficial social\nnorms in the face of incentives to defect, a distinctive feature of human\nsociality that is arguably crucial to the success of civilization. In\nparticular, we study the evolution of indirect reciprocity across generations\nof LLM agents playing a classic iterated Donor Game in which agents can observe\nthe recent behavior of their peers. We find that the evolution of cooperation\ndiffers markedly across base models, with societies of Claude 3.5 Sonnet agents\nachieving significantly higher average scores than Gemini 1.5 Flash, which, in\nturn, outperforms GPT-4o. Further, Claude 3.5 Sonnet can make use of an\nadditional mechanism for costly punishment to achieve yet higher scores, while\nGemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o fail to do so. For each model class, we also\nobserve variation in emergent behavior across random seeds, suggesting an\nunderstudied sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

In this work, we\nexplore modeling and solving this problem with the quantum-amenable quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism. Our work extends recent\nefforts by incorporating the objectives and constraints associated with peptide\ncyclization and peptide-protein docking in the two-particle model on a\ntetrahedral lattice. We propose a ``resource efficient'' QUBO encoding for this\nproblem, and baseline its performance with a novel constraint programming (CP)\napproach. We implement an end-to-end framework that enables the evaluation of\nour methods on instances from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our results show\nthat the QUBO approach, using a classical simulated annealing solver, is able\nto find feasible conformations for problems with up to 6 peptide residues and\n34 target protein residues, but has trouble scaling beyond this problem size.\nIn contrast, the CP approach can solve problems with up to 13 peptide residues\nand 34 target protein residues. We conclude that while QUBO can be used to\nsuccessfully tackle this problem, its scaling limitations and the strong\nperformance of the CP method suggest that it may not be the best choice.",

The challenge lies\nin the fact that copy-move targets can include background tissue, small\nforeground objects, or both, which may be out of the training domain and\nsubject to unseen attacks, rendering standard object-detection-based approaches\nless effective. To address this, we reformulate the problem of detecting\nbiomedical copy-move forgery regions as an intra-image co-saliency detection\ntask and propose CMSeg-Net, a copy-move forgery segmentation network capable of\nidentifying unseen duplicated areas.

Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt\ndirections, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model\nperformance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS)\nmethod of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the\nLLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a\nselected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then\nrefines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high\nprobability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and\ntransforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward\nweight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation\nspace, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are\nthen replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the\nconcept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method\nallows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the\nfamous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is\ndemonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced\nto 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the\nknowledge bi-directionally. Moreover, knowledge is shown to be removed across\nall languages despite only being targeted in English. Importantly, TARS has\nminimal impact on the general model capabilities, as after removing 5 diverse\nconcepts in a modular fashion, there is minimal KL divergence in the next token\nprobabilities of the LLM on large corpora of Wikipedia text (median of 0.0015).",

We reused the data from which it was developed (DIVAT cohort,\nn=2,169) to build another prediction algorithm using a survival super learner\ncombining (semi-)parametric and non-parametric methods. Performance in DIVAT\nwas estimated for the two prediction models using internal validation.

While the\ndiscrimination remained stable for the KTFS, it was not the case for the super\nlearner, with a drop to 0.80 (0.76-0.83). Regarding calibration, the survival\nSL overestimated graft survival at development, while the KTFS underestimated\ngraft survival ten years later.

However, finding a prior is difficult, as images often exhibit\nnon-stationary effects and multi-scale behaviour. Thus, usual Gaussian process\npriors are not suitable. Deep Gaussian processes, on the other hand, encode\nnon-stationary behaviour in a natural way through their hierarchical structure.\nTo apply Bayes' formula, one commonly employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethod. In the case of deep Gaussian processes, sampling is especially\nchallenging in high dimensions: the associated covariance matrices are large,\ndense, and changing from sample to sample. A popular strategy towards\ndecreasing computational complexity is to view Gaussian processes as the\nsolutions to a fractional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). In\nthis work, we investigate efficient computational strategies to solve the\nfractional SPDEs occurring in deep Gaussian process sampling, as well as MCMC\nalgorithms to sample from the posterior. Namely, we combine rational\napproximation and a determinant-free sampling approach to achieve sampling via\nthe fractional SPDE. We test our techniques in standard Bayesian image\nreconstruction problems: upsampling, edge detection, and computed tomography.\nIn these examples, we show that choosing a non-stationary prior such as the\ndeep GP over a stationary GP can improve the reconstruction. Moreover, our\napproach enables us to compare results for a range of fractional and\nnon-fractional regularity parameter values.",

This dependence on EOS models can\nintroduce substantial systematic uncertainties, which may exceed the\nmeasurement uncertainties when constraining $R_{1.4}$. In this study, we\nexplore a novel approach to constraining $R_{1.4}$ using data from NICER\nobservations of PSR J0030+0451 (J0030) and PSR J0437-4715 (J0437). However,\nthis work presents a more data-driven analysis framework, substantially\ndecreasing the need for EOS assumptions. By analyzing the Mass-Radius\nmeasurements of these two neutron stars, we infer $R_{1.4}$ using statistical\nmethods based mostly on observational data. We examine various hotspot\nconfigurations for J0030, along with new J0437 observations, and their effects\non the inferred radius.

Our study focuses on its impact on the QCD axion\nand an axion-like particle, identifying viable regions of axion mass and decay\nconstant that explain the observed dark matter. We demonstrate the equivalence\nof two different bases for describing the axion system in the existing\nliterature. Furthermore, we derive an improved expression for the adiabatic\ncondition that overcomes limitations in earlier formulations. This new\nformulation is basis-independent, and we numerically validate its\neffectiveness. Our analysis reveals specific relations between axion masses and\naxion-photon couplings within the viable region. These relations could\npotentially serve as a smoking gun signal for this scenario if confirmed\nexperimentally. We also find that, using the chiral perturbation model, the\nthermal friction on the QCD axion might be significantly larger than previously\nestimated. Additionally, we show that a simple model with axion mixing can\nnaturally realize either a heavier or lighter QCD axion.",

To address this\nproblem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors\nto fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting\nrenderings.

For\nGaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using\niteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating\nover-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent\nupsampling priors to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an\nimage.

In contrast to channeling radiation, CU radiation\n(CUR) occurs due to the average sinusoidal motion of positrons. Taking into\naccount the medium polarization, besides hard photons, soft photons are also\ngenerated. In the SASE XFEL process, microbunching occurs with a longitudinal\nsize on the order of the wavelength of the stimulated radiation due to the\ninteraction between positrons and generated photons at zero angle. These\nmicrobunches in CU will radiate coherently, and the radiation of the bunch will\nbe partially coherent. Charged particles organized into a microbunch with a\nwell-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or\ncollective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is\ncomparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. The CU\nparameters, the spatial period and the amplitude, are selected to preserve both\nthe channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CUR from positron\nmicrobunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation depends on the modulation depth\nof the microbunch, which is a critical parameter of the bunch and can also be\ndetermined through the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been\nconducted for a specific case involving CUR generated by a positron bunch\nmodulated during the SASE XFEL, at a corresponding wavelength of the process.",

To fill this gap, we present ToolCommander,\na novel framework designed to exploit vulnerabilities in LLM tool-calling\nsystems through adversarial tool injection.

    "abstract": "Batch effects are inevitable in large-scale metabolomics. Prior to formal\ndata analysis, batch effect correction (BEC) is applied to prevent from\nobscuring biological variations, and batch effect evaluation (BEE) is used for\ncorrection assessment. However, existing BEE algorithms neglect covariances\nbetween the variables, and existing BEC algorithms might fail to adequately\ncorrect the covariances. Therefore, we resort to recent advancements in\nhigh-dimensional statistics, and respectively propose \"quality control-based\nsimultaneous tests (QC-ST)\" and \"covariance correction (CoCo)\". Validated by\nthe simulation data, QC-ST can simultaneously detect the statistical\nsignificance of QC samples' mean vectors and covariance matrices across\ndifferent batches, and has a satisfactory statistical performance in empirical\nsizes, empirical powers, and computational speed. Then, we apply four QC-based\nBEC algorithms to two large cohort datasets, and find that extreme gradient\nboost (XGBoost) performs best in relative standard deviation (RSD) and\ndispersion-ratio (D-ratio). After prepositive BEC, if QC-ST still suggests that\nbatch effects between some two batches are significant, CoCo should be\nimplemented. And after CoCo (if necessary), the four metrics (i.e., RSD,\nD-ratio, classification performance, and QC-ST) might be further improved. In\nsummary, under the guidance of QC-ST, we can develop a matching strategy to\nintegrate multiple BEC algorithms more rationally and flexibly, and minimize\nbatch effects for reliable biological conclusions.",

The bumps can be used to minimize the effects of\nradiative depolarization while simultaneously maintaining other common benefits\nof vertical orbits, e.g. transverse coupling and vertical dispersion control.\nBecause simultaneously optimizing the large number of vertical correctors in a\nring is operationally infeasible, we use dimensionality reduction to define a\nminimal number of most effective groups of vertical correctors that can be\noptimized during operation, motivating the name ``Best Adjustment Groups for\nELectron Spin'' (BAGELS). The method is streamlined by using suitable ``basis\nbumps'' instead of all individual vertical correctors. We define three types of\nbasis bumps for different purposes: (1) generates no delocalized transverse\ncoupling nor delocalized vertical dispersion, (2) generates no delocalized\nvertical dispersion, and (3) generates no delocalized transverse coupling.\nBAGELS has been essential in the design of the Electron Storage Ring (ESR) of\nthe Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), and will be beneficial for any polarized\nelectron ring, including FCC-ee.

We use BAGELS to significantly increase polarization in the 18 GeV\nEIC-ESR, beyond achievable with conventional methods; in the 1-IP lattice, we\nnearly double the asymptotic polarization, and in the 2-IP lattice we more than\ntriple the asymptotic polarization.

These potentially habitable rocky planets are currently the most\naccessible for astronomical observations. A constraint on the volatile budget\nduring the magma ocean stage is a link to planet formation and also needed to\njudge their habitability. We perform simulations with 1-100 terrestrial oceans\n(TO) of H$_2$O with and without CO$_2$ and for albedos 0 and 0.75. The CO$_2$\nmass is scaled with initial H$_2$O by a constant factor between 0.1 and 1.\n  The magma ocean state of rocky planets begins with a CO$_2$-dominated\natmosphere but can evolve into a H$_2$O dominated state, depending on initial\nconditions. For less than 10 TO initial H$_2$O, the atmosphere tends to\ndesiccate and the evolution may end with a CO$_2$ dominated atmosphere.\nOtherwise, the final state is a thick (>1000 bar) H$_2$O-CO$_2$ atmosphere.\nComplete atmosphere desiccation with less than 10 TO initial H$_2$O can be\nsignificantly delayed for TRAPPIST-1e and f, when H$_2$O has to diffuse through\na CO$_2$ atmosphere to reach the upper atmosphere, where XUV photolysis occurs.\nAs a consequence of CO$_2$ diffusion-limited water loss, the time of mantle\nsolidification for TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g can be significantly extended\ncompared to a pure H$_2$O evolution by up to 40 Myrs for albedo 0.75 and by up\nto 200 Mrys for albedo 0. The addition of CO$_2$ further results in a higher\nwater content in the melt during the magma ocean stage. Our compositional model\nadjusted for the measured metallicity of TRAPPIST-1 yields for the dry inner\nplanets (b, c, d) an iron fraction of 27 wt-%. For TRAPPIST-1 e, this iron\nfraction would be compatible with a (partly) desiccated evolution scenario and\na CO$_2$ atmosphere with surface pressures of a few 100 bar. A comparative\nstudy between TRAPPIST-1 e and the inner planets may yield the most insights\nabout formation and evolution scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Data poisoning attacks pose one of the biggest threats to modern AI systems,\nnecessitating robust defenses. While extensive efforts have been made to\ndevelop empirical defenses, attackers continue to evolve, creating\nsophisticated methods to circumvent these measures. To address this, we must\nmove beyond empirical defenses and establish provable certification methods\nthat guarantee robustness. This paper introduces a novel certification\napproach, BiCert, using Bilinear Mixed Integer Programming (BMIP) to compute\nsound deterministic bounds that provide such provable robustness. Using BMIP,\nwe compute the reachable set of parameters that could result from training with\npotentially manipulated data. A key element to make this computation feasible\nis to relax the reachable parameter set to a convex set between training\niterations. At test time, this parameter set allows us to predict all possible\noutcomes, guaranteeing robustness. BiCert is more precise than previous\nmethods, which rely solely on interval and polyhedral bounds. Crucially, our\napproach overcomes the fundamental limitation of prior approaches where\nparameter bounds could only grow, often uncontrollably. We show that BiCert's\ntighter bounds eliminate a key source of divergence issues, resulting in more\nstable training and higher certified accuracy.",

To distinguish these massive labels\nutilizing machine learning, eXtreme Label Classification (XLC) has been\nestablished. However, as the number of categories increases, the number of\nparameters and nonlinear operations in the classifier also rises. This results\nin a Classifier Computational Overload Problem (CCOP). To address this, we\npropose a Multi-Head Encoding (MHE) mechanism, which replaces the vanilla\nclassifier with a multi-head classifier. During the training process, MHE\ndecomposes extreme labels into the product of multiple short local labels, with\neach head trained on these local labels. During testing, the predicted labels\ncan be directly calculated from the local predictions of each head. This\nreduces the computational load geometrically. Then, according to the\ncharacteristics of different XLC tasks, e.g., single-label, multi-label, and\nmodel pretraining tasks, three MHE-based implementations, i.e., Multi-Head\nProduct, Multi-Head Cascade, and Multi-Head Sampling, are proposed to more\neffectively cope with CCOP.

In comparison to\ntraditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRF enables the rapid,\nsimultaneous, non-invasive acquisition and reconstruction of multiple tissue\nparameters, paving the way for novel diagnostic techniques. In the original\nmatching approach, reconstruction is based on the search for the best matches\nbetween in vivo acquired signals and a dictionary of high-dimensional simulated\nsignals (fingerprints) with known tissue properties. A critical and limiting\nchallenge is that the size of the simulated dictionary increases exponentially\nwith the number of parameters, leading to an extremely costly subsequent\nmatching. In this work, we propose to address this scalability issue by\nconsidering probabilistic mixtures of high-dimensional elliptical\ndistributions, to learn more efficient dictionary representations. Mixture\ncomponents are modelled as flexible ellipitic shapes in low dimensional\nsubspaces. They are exploited to cluster similar signals and reduce their\ndimension locally cluster-wise to limit information loss. To estimate such a\nmixture model, we provide a new incremental algorithm capable of handling large\nnumbers of signals, allowing us to go far beyond the hardware limitations\nencountered by standard implementations. We demonstrate, on simulated and real\ndata, that our method effectively manages large volumes of MRF data with\nmaintained accuracy.

However, their\nultraviolet guidance is usually limited by discontinuities caused by the\npresence of high-loss resonance bands. In this paper, we report on\nresonance-free supercontinuum generation spanning from the deep ultraviolet to\nthe near infrared achieved through modulation instability in an argon-filled\nantiresonant hollow-core fibre.

Unfortunately,\nfor millisecond pulsars, it can be hard to measure observationally due to the\nextremely small second time derivative of the rotation frequency, $\\ddot{f}$.\nThis paper aims to examine whether it could be possible to extract the\ndistribution of $n$ for a whole population of pulsars rather than measuring the\nvalues individually. We use simulated data with an injected $n=5$ signal for 47\nmillisecond pulsars and extract the distribution using hierarchical Bayesian\ninference methods.

To address this\nnon-convexity, we modify a genetic algorithm, known in the literature as\ndifferential evolution, constraining the search space to unitary matrices by\nusing a QR factorization. We then refine results using a quasi-Newton method.\nWe benchmark our method on simple test problems and, as an application, compute\nentanglement between a system and its environment over time for pure dephasing\nevolutions.

We have reimplemented the MiCull model to model transmission\nof contagious mastitis pathogens through milking in a milking parlor. This\nadditional complexity requires a substantial increase in computations and a\nneed to structure the program code to make it more flexible for future use. The\naim of this paper was threefold: First, to implement the new model in a faster\nprogramming language; secondly, to describe the new model, in particular\ntransmission of a contagious mastitis pathogen through milking; and thirdly, to\ncompare three different milking order strategies in regards to prevalence and\nincidence of intramammary infections. For each scenario, 500 herds with 200\ncows each were simulated over 10 years. The model was calibrated using\navailable mastitis parameters from the literature. We hypothesized that milking\norder should have a considerable effect on disease transmission, especially if\nthe infected cows with clinical enter the milking parlor first and thereby have\na high risk of infecting the following cows. The milking order scenarios\nexamined were random milking order and milking clinical cases first, or last.\nUnexpectedly, there were no large differences between these scenarios for\nreasonably sized infection rates corresponding to a herd with a moderate level\nof clinical mastitis in the herd. Larger differences are expected to be found\nin herds with very high infection rates.

To\nmitigate these problems, we propose a novel vulnerability detection method,\nANGLE, whose novelty mainly embodies the hierarchical graph refinement and\ncontext-aware graph representation learning. The former hierarchically filters\nredundant information in the code graph, thereby reducing the size of the\ngraph, while the latter collaboratively employs the Graph Transformer and GNN\nto learn code graph representations from both the global and local\nperspectives, thus capturing long-distance dependencies. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate promising results on three widely used benchmark datasets: our\nmethod significantly outperforms several other baselines in terms of the\naccuracy and F1 score. Particularly, in large code graphs, ANGLE achieves an\nimprovement in accuracy of 34.27%-161.93% compared to the state-of-the-art\nmethod, AMPLE.

    "abstract": "Topological phases have been a central focus of condensed-matter physics for\nover 50 years. Along with many experimental applications, they have provided\nmuch intellectual interest due to their characterization via some form of\ntopological ordering, as opposed to the symmetry-breaking ordering of\nconventional continuous phase transitions. This distinction is most subtle in\nthe case of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition as its\nexperimental realizations appear to break U(1) symmetry at low temperature. It\nalso presents two further paradoxes: i) its prototypical short-range\ninteracting planar XY spin model behaves as an emergent long-range interacting\nelectrolyte; ii) its topological ordering is not accompanied by a topological\nnonergodicity within the BKT picture. This review paper addresses these three\ninterconnected questions. We review a series of papers that demonstrate that\nU(1) symmetry is indeed broken, but within a broader framework than that\ntraditionally used to characterize broken symmetry. We discuss recovery of this\nsymmetry by breaking velocity-symmetry in a deterministic Markov process. We\nthen expand on a modern field theory of the emergent electrolyte that maps\ndirectly from the spin field to an emergent lattice electric field governed by\nan augmented electrostatic Boltzmann distribution. This local model of\nelectrolyte physics resolves both the short-range-long-range paradox and the\nquestion of topological nonergodicity - as in contrast with the BKT picture, it\ndescribes global topological defects and their nonergodic freezing by the\ntopological ordering. It also connects the broken U(1) symmetry with the\ntopological ordering, providing a comprehensive framework for broken symmetry\nat the transition. We introduce long-time topological stability as a measure of\ntopological nonergodicity - within a general framework for weakly broken\nergodicity.",

    "abstract": "Scene text spotting has attracted the enthusiasm of relative researchers in\nrecent years. Most existing scene text spotters follow the\ndetection-then-recognition paradigm, where the vanilla detection module hardly\ndetermines the reading order and leads to failure recognition. After rethinking\nthe auto-regressive scene text recognition method, we find that a well-trained\nrecognizer can implicitly perceive the local semantics of all characters in a\ncomplete word or a sentence without a character-level detection module. Local\nsemantic knowledge not only includes text content but also spatial information\nin the right reading order. Motivated by the above analysis, we propose the\nLocal Semantics Guided scene text Spotter (LSGSpotter), which auto-regressively\ndecodes the position and content of characters guided by the local semantics.\nSpecifically, two effective modules are proposed in LSGSpotter. On the one\nhand, we design a Start Point Localization Module (SPLM) for locating text\nstart points to determine the right reading order. On the other hand, a\nMulti-scale Adaptive Attention Module (MAAM) is proposed to adaptively\naggregate text features in a local area. In conclusion, LSGSpotter achieves the\narbitrary reading order spotting task without the limitation of sophisticated\ndetection, while alleviating the cost of computational resources with the grid\nsampling strategy. Extensive experiment results show LSGSpotter achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the InverseText benchmark. Moreover, our\nspotter demonstrates superior performance on English benchmarks for\narbitrary-shaped text, achieving improvements of 0.7\\% and 2.5\\% on Total-Text\nand SCUT-CTW1500, respectively.

We manage to assess the\nmorphological stability of 105 nearby open clusters within tidal radii on the\nX-Y, X-Z, and Y-Z planes of the heliocentric Cartesian coordinate system,\nutilizing member catalogs from the literature. Meanwhile, we also delve into\nfactors potentially impacting the clusters' morphological stability on these\nprojection planes. Methods. We used the rose diagram method by constructing the\n3D projected morphology of sample clusters to quantify the morphological\nstability of their 3D projected morphology. Results. Our analysis indicates\nthere is a demonstrated linear positive correlation between the number of\nsample clusters' member stars within tidal radii and their morphological\nstability in different 3D projection planes. This may suggest that the more\nmember stars there are within the tidal radius of a cluster, the stronger its\nown gravitational binding capacity is, resulting in strong morphological\nstability. We find a direct link between the clusters' morphological\nstabilities in the X-Z plane within tidal radii and their velocity dispersion\nin the same plane, suggesting that the morphological stabilities in the X-Z\nplane may be dependent on internal dynamics. Moreover, the morphological\nstability of the clusters' 3D projection is influenced by their spatial\npositions along the Y axis, but not linearly, indicating that the environmental\nchanges at the clusters' location may affect their morphological stability.\nLikewise, specific external forces can have an effect on their morphological\nstability.

Existing preference optimization methods such as DPO and\nKTO, while improved based on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),\nare inherently derived from PPO, requiring a reference model that adds GPU\nmemory resources and relies heavily on abundant preference data. Meanwhile,\ncurrent preference optimization research mainly targets single-question\nscenarios with two replies, neglecting optimization with multiple replies,\nwhich leads to a waste of data in the application. This study introduces the\nMPPO algorithm, which leverages the average likelihood of model responses to\nfit the reward function and maximizes the utilization of preference data.\nThrough a comparison of Point-wise, Pair-wise, and List-wise implementations,\nwe found that the Pair-wise approach achieves the best performance,\nsignificantly enhancing the quality of model responses. Experimental results\ndemonstrate MPPO's outstanding performance across various benchmarks. On\nMT-Bench, MPPO outperforms DPO, ORPO, and SimPO. Notably, on Arena-Hard, MPPO\nsurpasses DPO and ORPO by substantial margins. These achievements underscore\nthe remarkable advantages of MPPO in preference optimization tasks.",

    "abstract": "Resonances are common in wave physics and their full and rigorous\ncharacterization is crucial to correctly tailor the response of a system in\nboth time and frequency domains. However, they have been conventionally\ndescribed by the quality factor, a real-valued number quantifying the sharpness\nof a single peak in the amplitude spectrum, and associated with a singularity\nin the complex frequency plane. But the amplitude of a physical signal does not\nhold all the information on the resonance and it has not been established that\neven the knowledge of the full distribution of singularities carries this\ninformation. Here we derive a dimensionless quality function that fully\ncharacterizes resonances from the knowledge of the phase spectrum of the\nsignal. This function is driven by the spectral derivative of the phase. It is\nequivalent to the imaginary part of the Wigner-Smith time delay but it has the\nadvantage of being valid for arbitrary response functions, including the\ncomponents of the S-matrix. The spectral derivative of the phase can be\ncalculated numerically from simulations or experimental acquisitions of the\nphase spectrum. Alternatively, it can be retrieved from the distribution of\npoles and zeros in the complex frequency plane through an analytic expression,\nwhich demonstrates that singularities do not suffice to fully characterize the\nresonances and that both singularities and zeros must be taken into account to\nretrieve the quality function. This approach permits to extract all the\ncharacteristics of resonances from arbitrary spectral response functions\nwithout a priori knowledge on the physical system.",

    "abstract": "Configuring a prosthetic leg is an integral part of the fitting process, but\nthe personalization of a multi-modal powered knee-ankle prosthesis is often too\ncomplex to realize in a clinical environment. This paper develops both the\ntechnical means to individualize a hybrid kinematic-impedance controller for\nvariable-incline walking and sit-stand transitions, and an intuitive Clinical\nTuning Interface (CTI) that allows prosthetists to directly modify the\ncontroller behavior. Utilizing an established method for predicting kinematic\ngait individuality alongside a new parallel approach for kinetic individuality,\nwe personalize continuous-phase/task models of joint impedance (during stance)\nand kinematics (during swing) using tuned characteristics exclusively from\nlevel-ground walking. To take advantage of this method, we developed a CTI that\ntranslates common clinical tuning parameters into model adjustments for the\nwalking and sit-stand controllers. We then conducted a case study where a\nprosthetist iteratively tuned the powered prosthesis to an above-knee amputee\nparticipant in a simulated clinical session involving sit-stand transitions and\nlevel walking, from which incline/decline walking features were automatically\ncalibrated. The prosthetist fully tuned the multi-activity prosthesis\ncontroller in under 20 min. Each iteration of tuning (i.e., observation,\nparameter adjustment, and model reprocessing) took 2 min on average for walking\nand 1 min on average for sit-stand. The tuned behavior changes were\nappropriately manifested in the commanded prosthesis torques, both at the\nmanually tuned tasks and automatically tuned tasks (inclines).

Among other things, our result shows that the IM\nsolution is efficient in the sense that, asymptotically, its credal set is the\nsmallest that contains the Gaussian distribution with variance equal to the\nCramer--Rao lower bound. Moreover, a corresponding version of this new\nBernstein--von Mises theorem is presented for problems that involve the\nelimination of nuisance parameters, which settles an open question concerning\nthe relative efficiency of profiling-based versus extension-based\nmarginalization strategies.",

Their statistical existence on the Sun has yet to be firmly\nestablished. The main goal of this paper is to identify a statistical signature\nof sympathetic flares, characterize their properties and determine a potential\nmechanism driving their interaction. We perform a statistical analysis of a\nlarge number of flares observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)\nonboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the Reuven Ramaty High Energy\nSolar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging\nX-rays (STIX) on Solar Orbiter during solar cycle 24 and 25. We examine the\nspatiotemporal distribution of consecutive flare pairs across solar cycle\nphases and hemispheres, along with the propagation velocity of potential causal\ninteractions and the relationship between flare magnitudes. We observe an\nexcess of hemispheric flares separated by about 30 degrees of longitude and\ntriggered in less than 1.5 hours from each other. This peak in angular\nseparation varies with the solar cycle phase and hemisphere. Moreover, we\nidentify a deficit of transequatorial events separated by 25-30 degrees in\nlatitude and less than 5 degrees in longitude, a phenomenon we term\nunsympathetic flares. We provide strong statistical evidence for the existence\nof sympathetic flares on the Sun, demonstrating that their occurrence rate\nreaches approximately 5% across the three instruments used in this study.\nAdditionally, we propose an interpretation of the observed angular scale of the\nsympathetic phenomenon, based on the separation between magnetic field line\nfootpoints derived from potential field source surface extrapolations.",

For focusing\nnonlinearity we prove the existence of a spatially exponentially localized and\ntime-periodic ground state and investigate the impact of an attractive\nrespectively repulsive delta potential on the existence of an excitation\nthreshold, i.e. supercritical $l^2$ norm, for the creation of such a ground\nstates.

Despite its importance, executing the test suite of a project can\nbe challenging in practice because different projects use different programming\nlanguages, software ecosystems, build systems, testing frameworks, and other\ntools. These challenges make it difficult to create a reliable, universal test\nexecution method that works across different projects. This paper presents\nExecutionAgent, an automated technique that prepares scripts for building an\narbitrary project from source code and running its test cases. Inspired by the\nway a human developer would address this task, our approach is a large language\nmodel (LLM)-based agent that autonomously executes commands and interacts with\nthe host system. The agent uses meta-prompting to gather guidelines on the\nlatest technologies related to the given project, and it iteratively refines\nits process based on feedback from the previous steps. Our evaluation applies\nExecutionAgent to 50 open-source projects that use 14 different programming\nlanguages and many different build and testing tools. The approach successfully\nexecutes the test suites of 33/50 projects, while matching the test results of\nground truth test suite executions with a deviation of only 7.5%.

We find\nlarge changes in two important properties: the compensation composition and the\nCo-rich in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy transition composition,\nboth of which move by 6 at.\\% towards higher Tb concentrations after hydrogen\nimplantation. This shift in composition does not increase with a larger dose.\nFrom the changes in magnetization we attribute the change in compensation\ncomposition to a significant reduction of the moment on the Tb sublattice.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian analysis has begun to be more widely adopted in X-ray spectroscopy,\nbut it has largely been constrained to relatively simple physical models due to\nlimitations in X-ray modelling software and computation time. As a result,\nBayesian analysis of numerical models with high physics complexity have\nremained out of reach. This is a challenge, for example when modelling the\nX-ray emission of accreting black hole X-ray binaries, where the slow model\ncomputations severely limit explorations of parameter space and may bias the\ninference of astrophysical parameters. Here, we present RTFAST-Spectra: a\nneural network emulator that acts as a drop in replacement for the spectral\nportion of the black hole X-ray reverberation model RTDIST. This is the first\nemulator for the reltrans model suite and the first emulator for a\nstate-of-the-art x-ray reflection model incorporating relativistic effects with\n17 physically meaningful model parameters. We use Principal Component Analysis\nto create a light-weight neural network that is able to preserve correlations\nbetween complex atomic lines and simple continuum, enabling consistent\nmodelling of key parameters of scientific interest. We achieve a\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ times speed up over the original model in the most\nconservative conditions with $\\mathcal{O}(1\\%)$ precision over all 17 free\nparameters in the original numerical model, taking full posterior fits from\nmonths to hours.

In particular, our theoretical\ndependence $M(T)$ demonstrates a scaling behavior $M(T)\\propto\n(T_{C}-T)^{\\beta_*}$ with the scaling index $\\beta_*\\approx 1/3$ in a wide\nrange of temperatures in agreement with the experimentally observed apparent\nscaling in EuO and EuS.

Current research increasingly relies on large synthetic\ndatasets, automatically generated to cover tens of thousands of distinct entity\ntypes, to train zero-shot NER models. However, in this paper, we find that\nthese synthetic datasets often contain entity types that are semantically\nhighly similar to (or even the same as) those in standard evaluation\nbenchmarks. Because of this overlap, we argue that reported F1 scores for\nzero-shot NER overestimate the true capabilities of these approaches. Further,\nwe argue that current evaluation setups provide an incomplete picture of\nzero-shot abilities since they do not quantify the label shift (i.e., the\nsimilarity of labels) between training and evaluation datasets. To address\nthese issues, we propose Familiarity, a novel metric that captures both the\nsemantic similarity between entity types in training and evaluation, as well as\ntheir frequency in the training data, to provide an estimate of label shift. It\nallows researchers to contextualize reported zero-shot NER scores when using\ncustom synthetic training datasets.

    "abstract": "Prediction models frequently face the challenge of concept drift, in which\nthe underlying data distribution changes over time, weakening performance.\nExamples can include models which predict loan default, or those used in\nhealthcare contexts. Typical management strategies involve regular model\nupdates or updates triggered by concept drift detection. However, these simple\npolicies do not necessarily balance the cost of model updating with improved\nclassifier performance. We present AMUSE (Adaptive Model Updating using a\nSimulated Environment), a novel method leveraging reinforcement learning\ntrained within a simulated data generating environment, to determine update\ntimings for classifiers. The optimal updating policy depends on the current\ndata generating process and ongoing drift process. Our key idea is that we can\ntrain an arbitrarily complex model updating policy by creating a training\nenvironment in which possible episodes of drift are simulated by a parametric\nmodel, which represents expectations of possible drift patterns. As a result,\nAMUSE proactively recommends updates based on estimated performance\nimprovements, learning a policy that balances maintaining model performance\nwith minimizing update costs. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness of\nAMUSE in simulated data.",

By employing\nprogressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language\nmodels (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody\nnaturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context\nlearning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large\nlanguage models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of\nspeech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore,\nin this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model,\nCosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations.\nSpecifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook\nutilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model\narchitecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In\naddition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support\nvarious synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming\nsynthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual\ndataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response\nlatency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode.

Although FPN integrates multi-scale features, it does not\ndirectly enhance or enrich the features of tiny objects. Furthermore, FPN lacks\nspatial perception ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel High\nFrequency and Spatial Perception Feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) with two\ninnovative modules. First, we designed a high frequency perception module (HFP)\nthat generates high frequency responses through high pass filters. These high\nfrequency responses are used as mask weights from both spatial and channel\nperspectives to enrich and highlight the features of tiny objects in the\noriginal feature maps. Second, we developed a spatial dependency perception\nmodule (SDP) to capture the spatial dependencies that FPN lacks.

We study for $\\mathcal{C}$ : (i) any two-character WZW CFT with\nvanishing Wronskian index, (ii) the Ising CFT, (iii) the infinite class of\n$D_{r,1}$ CFTs and the $A_{4,1}$ CFT. The characters being $S$-invariant\nhomogenous polynomials of the characters of $\\mathcal{C}$, when organised in\nterms of a $S$-invariant basis, take compact forms allowing for closed form\nanswers for high central charges. We find a $S$-invariant basis for each of the\nCFTs studied. As an example, one can find an explicit expression for the\ncharacter of the monster CFT as a degree-$48$ polynomial of the characters of\nthe Ising CFT. In some CFTs, some of the $S$-invariant polynomials of\ncharacters compute, after using the $q$-series of the characters, to a constant\nvalue. Hence, the characters of one-character extensions are more properly\nelements of the quotient ring of polynomials (of characters) with the ideal\nneeded for the quotient, generated by $S$-invariant polynomials that compute to\na constant.

They: 1) do not cover the educational\ndomain; 2) typically focus on low-complexity, generic knowledge or broad\ndomains, which do not adequately assess the models' knowledge in specific\nsubjects; and 3) often rely on templates that can bias model predictions. Here,\nwe introduce MALAMUTE, a multilingual, template-free, and highly granular\nprobing dataset comprising expert-written, peer-reviewed probes from 71\nuniversity-level textbooks across three languages (English, Spanish, and\nPolish). MALAMUTE is the first education-based cloze-style dataset. It covers\neight domains, each with up to 14 subdomains, further broken down into concepts\nand concept-based prompts, totaling 33,361 university curriculum concepts and\n116,887 prompts. MALAMUTE's fine granularity, educational focus, and inclusion\nof both sentence-level and paragraph-level prompts make it an ideal tool for\nevaluating LMs' course-related knowledge. Our evaluation of masked and causal\nLMs on MALAMUTE shows that despite overall proficiency, they have significant\ngaps in knowledge when examined closely on specific subjects, hindering their\nsafe use in classrooms and underscoring the need for further development.",

However, the lack of\nspecialized Tabular Question Answering datasets in this domain limits the\ndevelopment of automated question-answering systems. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce RETQA, the first large-scale open-domain Chinese Tabular Question\nAnswering dataset for Real Estate. RETQA comprises 4,932 tables and 20,762\nquestion-answer pairs across 16 sub-fields within three major domains: property\ninformation, real estate company finance information and land auction\ninformation. Compared with existing tabular question answering datasets, RETQA\nposes greater challenges due to three key factors: long-table structures,\nopen-domain retrieval, and multi-domain queries. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose the SLUTQA framework, which integrates large language models with\nspoken language understanding tasks to enhance retrieval and answering\naccuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLUTQA significantly improves\nthe performance of large language models on RETQA by in-context learning. RETQA\nand SLUTQA provide essential resources for advancing tabular question answering\nresearch in the real estate domain, addressing critical challenges in\nopen-domain and long-table question-answering.

    "abstract": "The update law in the indirect adaptive control scheme can be extended to\ninclude feedthrough of an error term. This reduces undesired oscillations of\nthe calculated weights. When the ${\\sigma}$-modification is used for achieving\nrobustness against unstructured uncertainties, the gain of the feedthrough in\nthe update law cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Compared to our previous result,\nwe show stability of the closed loop for a larger parameter-range for the gain\nof the feedthrough in the update law. This parameter-range includes a\nconfiguration for which the influence of the integration in the update law\ndiminishes over time, i.e. for which the adaptation for large times is governed\nsolely by the feedthrough in the update law. By initializing at zero, this\nallows for removing the integration from the update law, resulting in a static\nupdate law. For the purely linear case, the adaptation acts like a disturbance\nobserver. Frequency-domain analysis of the closed loop with a second order\nplant shows that removing the integration from the update law with\n${\\sigma}$-modification and feedthrough affects how precisely disturbances in\nthe low-frequency band are observed. If the damping injected into the\nadaptation process by the ${\\sigma}$-modification exceeds certain bounds, then\nthe precision is increased by using the static update law.",

The experimental reach varies strongly with the mass $M_N$ and\nthe mixing $\\theta$, and one observes specific correlations with the flavour of\nactive neutrinos. The SHiP experiment will mark a jump in sensitivity: (i) it\nwill probe a sterile dipole as small as $d\\sim 10^{-8}$ GeV$^{-1}$, thus\ntesting new physics well above the electroweak scale; (ii) it may detect the\nactive-sterile dipole to the level predicted by electroweak loops, if $\\theta$\nis close to the present bound.",

We find critical slowing\ndown of the learning approaching the transition from the overparametrized side:\nFor a given network depth, learning times to reach small training loss values\nappear to diverge proportional to $1/(w - w_c)$ as the width w approaches a\n(loss-dependent) critical value $w_c$. We identify the zero-loss limit of this\nvalue with the interpolation transition. We also study aging (the slowing down\nof fluctuations as the time since the beginning of learning increases). Taking\na system that has been learning for a time $\\tau_w$, we measure the subsequent\nmean-square fluctuations of the weight values at times $\\tau > \\tau_w$. In the\nunderparametrized phase, we find that they are well-described by a single\nfunction of $\\tau/\\tau_w$. While this scaling holds approximately at short\ntimes at the transition and in the overparametrized phase, it breaks down at\nlonger times when the training loss gets close to the lower limit imposed by\nthe stochastic gradient descent dynamics.

    "abstract": "Domain generalization addresses domain shift in real-world applications. Most\napproaches adopt a domain angle, seeking invariant representation across\ndomains by aligning their marginal distributions, irrespective of individual\nclasses, naturally leading to insufficient exploration of discriminative\ninformation. Switching to a class angle, we find that multiple domain-related\npeaks or clusters within the same individual classes must emerge due to\ndistribution shift. In other words, marginal alignment does not guarantee\nconditional alignment, leading to suboptimal generalization. Therefore, we\nargue that acquiring discriminative generalization between classes within\ndomains is crucial. In contrast to seeking distribution alignment, we endeavor\nto safeguard domain-related between-class discrimination. To this end, we\ndevise a novel Conjugate Consistent Enhanced Module, namely Con2EM, based on a\ndistribution over domains, i.e., a meta-distribution. Specifically, we employ a\nnovel distribution-level Universum strategy to generate supplementary diverse\ndomain-related class-conditional distributions, thereby enhancing\ngeneralization. This allows us to resample from these generated distributions\nto provide feedback to the primordial instance-level classifier, further\nimproving its adaptability to the target-agnostic. To ensure generation\naccuracy, we establish an additional distribution-level classifier to\nregularize these conditional distributions. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted to demonstrate its effectiveness and low computational cost compared\nto SOTAs.",

The proposed CBPA is an\nenhanced version of the consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) and comprises\ntwo primary core phases: the payload bundle construction and consensus phases.\nIn the payload bundle construction phase, CBPA introduces a payload assignment\nmatrix to track the payloads carried by the robots and the demands of\nmulti-robot tasks in real time.

These two phases are iterated to\ndynamically adjust the number of robots performing multi-robot tasks and the\nnumber of tasks each robot performs and obtain conflict-free results to ensure\nthat the robot coalition meets the demand and completes all tasks as quickly as\npossible.

This structural transition significantly improves domain homogeneity\nand reduces polarization imprint, leading to symmetric ferroelectric switching\ncharacteristics. The demonstrated ability to manipulate ferroelectric domains\npost-growth enables tailored functional properties without compromising the\ncoherently strained bottom interface. The method's compatibility with\nsemiconductor processing and ability to selectively modify specific regions\nmake it particularly promising for practical implementation in integrated\ndevices. This work establishes a versatile approach for strain-mediated domain\nengineering that could be extended to a wide range of ferroelectric systems,\nproviding new opportunities for memory, sensing, and photonic applications\nwhere precise control of polarization states is essential.",

However, as larger, more\nsensitive radio interferometers are conceived and built, the calibration\nproblem grows in both size and difficulty.\n  The increasing size can be attributed to the fact that the data volume scales\nquadratically with the number of antennas in an array. Additionally, new\ninstruments may have up to two orders of magnitude more channels than their\npredecessors. Simultaneously, increasing sensitivity is making calibration more\nchallenging: low-level RFI and calibration artefacts (in the resulting images)\nwhich would previously have been subsumed by the noise may now limit dynamic\nrange and, ultimately, the derived science.\n  It is against this backdrop that we introduce QuartiCal: a new Python package\nimplementing radio interferometric calibration routines. QuartiCal improves\nupon its predecessor, CubiCal, in terms of both flexibility and performance.\nWhilst the same mathematical framework - complex optimization using Wirtinger\nderivatives - is in use, the approach has been refined to support arbitrary\nlength chains of parameterized gain terms.\n  QuartiCal utilizes Dask, a library for parallel computing in Python, to\nexpress calibration as an embarrassingly parallel task graph. These task graphs\ncan (with some constraints) be mapped onto a number of different hardware\nconfigurations, allowing QuartiCal to scale from running locally on consumer\nhardware to a distributed, cloud-based cluster.\n  QuartiCal's qualitative behaviour is demonstrated using MeerKAT observations\nof PSR J2009-2026.

Non-stationary phenomena common to the\nentire range of $E \\times B$ devices, such as oscillations and instabilities,\nare likely to exist in the magnetic nozzle, according to the mounting\nexperimental evidence. These mechanisms could lead to anomalous cross-field\ntransport, either enhancing the plasma plume divergence or favoring electron\ndetachment. In this work we present a local linear analysis of fluid\ninstabilities relevant for said devices, expanding on previous works with the\naddition of plasma inhomogeneities in the direction parallel to the magnetic\nfield, with a rigorous inclusion of the effects of magnetic curvature, finite\nLarmor radius and $3$D wave propagation, allowing for a general formulation of\ndrift-driven instabilities in partially magnetized plasmas. Instability\nconditions are first studied analytically, and then applied to simulation data\nof a helicon plasma thruster. Finally, the effect of instabilities on\nwave-driven cross-field electron transport is assessed by means of quasi-linear\nanalysis. This study predicts the onset of essentially-azimuthal instabilities\nin the $1$ kHz--$1$ MHz range, in qualitative agreement with some of the\navailable experimental data, and highlights the importance of including\nparallel inhomogeneities in the formulation of the dispersion relation of an $E\n\\times B$ plasma, as these gradients may drive instabilities even in the\nabsence of axial propagation. Lastly, quasi-linear analysis suggests that the\ninduced cross-field transport acts to smooth out the zeroth-order drifts which\ncause the plasma to destabilize in the first place.",

    "abstract": "Ram pressure stripped galaxies are rare cases of environmental evolution in\naction. However, our ability to understand these galaxies is limited by the\nsmall number of identified galaxies experiencing ram pressure stripping (RPS).\nOur aim is to explore the efficacy of citizen science classifications in\nidentifying ram pressure stripped galaxies, and use this to aid in motivating\nnew samples of ram pressure stripped candidates. We compile a sample of over\n200 known ram pressure stripped galaxies from existing literature, with\nmorphological classifications obtained from Galaxy Zoo. We compare these\ngalaxies with magnitude and redshift-matched comparison cluster and field\ngalaxies. Additionally, we create a sample of SDSS cluster galaxies, with\nmorphological classifications similar to known ram pressure stripped galaxies,\nand compare the fraction of potential new RPS candidates against control\nsamples. We find that ram pressure stripped galaxies exhibit a higher\nproportion of odd and irregular morphological classifications compared to field\nand cluster comparison samples. This trend is particularly pronounced in\ngalaxies displaying strong optical ram pressure stripping features, but absent\nfrom galaxies with only radio tails. We find that SDSS galaxies with Galaxy Zoo\nclassifications consistent with the known RPS galaxies have a higher fraction\nof visible ram pressure stripping features ($19\\%$) compared with other cluster\ngalaxies ($12\\%$) when classified by experts. We identify 101 new ram pressure\nstripping candidate galaxies through these expert classifications. We\ndemonstrate that indirect morphological classifications from citizen science\nprojects can increase the efficiency in which new stripping candidates are\nfound. Projects such as Galaxy Zoo can aid in the identification of ram\npressure stripped galaxies that are key to understanding galaxy evolution in\nclusters.",

    "abstract": "Low bit-precisions and their bit-slice sparsity have recently been studied to\naccelerate general matrix-multiplications (GEMM) during large-scale deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) inferences. While the conventional symmetric quantization\nfacilitates low-resolution processing with bit-slice sparsity for both weight\nand activation, its accuracy loss caused by the activation's asymmetric\ndistributions cannot be acceptable, especially for large-scale DNNs. In efforts\nto mitigate this accuracy loss, recent studies have actively utilized\nasymmetric quantization for activations without requiring additional\noperations. However, the cutting-edge asymmetric quantization produces numerous\nnonzero slices that cannot be compressed and skipped by recent bit-slice GEMM\naccelerators, naturally consuming more processing energy to handle the\nquantized DNN models.\n  To simultaneously achieve high accuracy and hardware efficiency for\nlarge-scale DNN inferences, this paper proposes an Asymmetrically-Quantized\nbit-Slice GEMM (AQS-GEMM) for the first time. In contrast to the previous\nbit-slice computing, which only skips operations of zero slices, the AQS-GEMM\ncompresses frequent nonzero slices, generated by asymmetric quantization, and\nskips their operations. To increase the slice-level sparsity of activations, we\nalso introduce two algorithm-hardware co-optimization methods: a zero-point\nmanipulation and a distribution-based bit-slicing. To support the proposed\nAQS-GEMM and optimizations at the hardware-level, we newly introduce a DNN\naccelerator, Panacea, which efficiently handles sparse/dense workloads of the\ntiled AQS-GEMM to increase data reuse and utilization. Panacea supports a\nspecialized dataflow and run-length encoding to maximize data reuse and\nminimize external memory accesses, significantly improving its hardware\nefficiency. Our benchmark evaluations show Panacea outperforms existing DNN\naccelerators.",

However, there is growing concern that LLMs may ``game\"\nthese benchmarks due to data leakage, achieving high scores while struggling\nwith tasks simple for humans. To substantively address the problem, we create\nGAOKAO-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark based on China's National College\nEntrance Examination (Gaokao), and conduct ``closed-book\" evaluations for\nrepresentative models released prior to Gaokao. Contrary to prevailing\nconsensus, even after addressing data leakage and comprehensiveness,\nGAOKAO-Eval reveals that high scores still fail to truly reflect human-aligned\ncapabilities. To better understand this mismatch, We introduce the Rasch model\nfrom cognitive psychology to analyze LLM scoring patterns and identify two key\ndiscrepancies: 1) anomalous consistent performance across various question\ndifficulties, and 2) high variance in performance on questions of similar\ndifficulty. In addition, We identified inconsistent grading of LLM-generated\nanswers among teachers and recurring mistake patterns. we find that the\nphenomenons are well-grounded in the motivations behind OpenAI o1, and o1's\nreasoning-as-difficulties can mitigate the mismatch.

    "abstract": "Structure functions, which represent the moments of the increments of a\nstochastic process, are essential complementary statistics to power spectra for\nanalysing the self-similar behaviour of a time series. However, many real-world\nenvironmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the\nsolar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature\nof this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed,\noften overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field\nintervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the\nstructure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We\nquantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure\nfunction, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent\nunderestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we\ndemonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these\nestimates. This correction, \"learnt\" from the data from a single spacecraft, is\nshown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the\nheliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions >25%.\nGiven this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals\nfrom the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral\nindices similar to those from previous studies.

    "abstract": "The Fussell-Vesely Importance (FV) reflects the potential impact of a basic\nevent on system failure, and is crucial for ensuring system reliability.\nHowever, traditional methods for calculating FV importance are complex and\ntime-consuming, requiring the construction of fault trees and the calculation\nof minimal cut set. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid\nreal-time framework to evaluate the FV importance of basic events. Our\nframework combines expert knowledge with a data-driven model. First, we use\nInterpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to build a virtual fault tree that\ncaptures the relationships between basic events. Unlike traditional fault\ntrees, which include intermediate events, our virtual fault tree consists\nsolely of basic events, reducing its complexity and space requirements.\nAdditionally, our virtual fault tree considers the dependencies between basic\nevents rather than assuming their independence, as is typically done in\ntraditional fault trees. We then feed both the event relationships and relevant\ndata into a graph neural network (GNN). This approach enables a rapid,\ndata-driven calculation of FV importance, significantly reducing processing\ntime and quickly identifying critical events, thus providing robust decision\nsupport for risk control. Results demonstrate that our model performs well in\nterms of MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R2, reducing computational energy consumption and\noffering real-time, risk-informed decision support for complex systems.",

Watermarking has become a vital tool to address these\nchallenges, safeguarding both generated and real content. Effective\nwatermarking methods must withstand various distortions and attacks. Current\ndeep watermarking techniques often use an encoder-noise layer-decoder\narchitecture and include distortions to enhance robustness. However, they\nstruggle to balance robustness and fidelity and remain vulnerable to adaptive\nattacks, despite extensive training. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nSuperMark, a robust, training-free watermarking framework. Inspired by the\nparallels between watermark embedding/extraction in watermarking and the\ndenoising/noising processes in diffusion models, SuperMark embeds the watermark\ninto initial Gaussian noise using existing techniques. It then applies\npre-trained Super-Resolution (SR) models to denoise the watermarked noise,\nproducing the final watermarked image. For extraction, the process is reversed:\nthe watermarked image is inverted back to the initial watermarked noise via\nDDIM Inversion, from which the embedded watermark is extracted. This flexible\nframework supports various noise injection methods and diffusion-based SR\nmodels, enabling enhanced customization. The robustness of the DDIM Inversion\nprocess against perturbations allows SuperMark to achieve strong resilience to\ndistortions while maintaining high fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that\nSuperMark achieves fidelity comparable to existing methods while significantly\nimproving robustness. Under standard distortions, it achieves an average\nwatermark extraction accuracy of 99.46%, and 89.29% under adaptive attacks.\nMoreover, SuperMark shows strong transferability across datasets, SR models,\nembedding methods, and resolutions.",

    "abstract": "Nano-drones, with their small, lightweight design, are ideal for\nconfined-space rescue missions and inherently safe for human interaction.\nHowever, their limited payload restricts the critical sensing needed for\nego-velocity estimation and obstacle detection to single-bean laser-based\ntime-of-flight (ToF) and low-resolution optical sensors. Although those sensors\nhave demonstrated good performance, they fail in some complex real-world\nscenarios, especially when facing transparent or reflective surfaces (ToFs) or\nwhen lacking visual features (optical-flow sensors). Taking inspiration from\nbats, this paper proposes a novel two-way ranging-based method for ego-velocity\nestimation and obstacle avoidance based on down-and-forward facing\nultra-low-power ultrasonic sensors, which improve the performance when the\ndrone faces reflective materials or navigates in complete darkness. Our results\ndemonstrate that our new sensing system achieves a mean square error of 0.019\nm/s on ego-velocity estimation and allows exploration for a flight time of 8\nminutes while covering 136 m on average in a challenging environment with\ntransparent and reflective obstacles. We also compare ultrasonic and\nlaser-based ToF sensing techniques for obstacle avoidance, as well as optical\nflow and ultrasonic-based techniques for ego-velocity estimation, denoting how\nthese systems and methods can be complemented to enhance the robustness of\nnano-drone operations.",

    "abstract": "As AI continues to advance, there is a growing demand for systems that go\nbeyond language-based assistance and move toward intelligent agents capable of\nperforming real-world actions. This evolution requires the transition from\ntraditional Large Language Models (LLMs), which excel at generating textual\nresponses, to Large Action Models (LAMs), designed for action generation and\nexecution within dynamic environments. Enabled by agent systems, LAMs hold the\npotential to transform AI from passive language understanding to active task\ncompletion, marking a significant milestone in the progression toward\nartificial general intelligence.\n  In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for developing LAMs,\noffering a systematic approach to their creation, from inception to deployment.\nWe begin with an overview of LAMs, highlighting their unique characteristics\nand delineating their differences from LLMs. Using a Windows OS-based agent as\na case study, we provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on the key stages of\nLAM development, including data collection, model training, environment\nintegration, grounding, and evaluation. This generalizable workflow can serve\nas a blueprint for creating functional LAMs in various application domains.

Current\nreal-time object detectors are not optimized for UAV images, and complex\nmethods designed for small object detection often lack real-time capabilities.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel detector, RemDet (Reparameter\nefficient multiplication Detector). Our contributions are as follows: 1)\nRethinking the challenges of existing detectors for small and dense UAV images,\nand proposing information loss as a design guideline for efficient models. 2)\nWe introduce the ChannelC2f module to enhance small object detection\nperformance, demonstrating that high-dimensional representations can\neffectively mitigate information loss. 3) We design the GatedFFN module to\nprovide not only strong performance but also low latency, effectively\naddressing the challenges of real-time detection. Our research reveals that\nGatedFFN, through the use of multiplication, is more cost-effective than\nfeed-forward networks for high-dimensional representation. 4) We propose the\nCED module, which combines the advantages of ViT and CNN downsampling to\neffectively reduce information loss. It specifically enhances context\ninformation for small and dense objects. Extensive experiments on large UAV\ndatasets, Visdrone and UAVDT, validate the real-time efficiency and superior\nperformance of our methods.

For the task of graph skeleton estimation, we\nderive exact distributional results under random guessing for the expected\nbehavior of a range of typical causal discovery evaluation metrics, including\nprecision and recall. We show that these metrics can achieve very favorable\nvalues under random guessing in certain scenarios, and hence warn against using\nthem without also reporting negative control results, i.e., performance under\nrandom guessing.

Methods. The adopted\nstellar atmosphere is a combination of three components, the quiet photosphere,\nspots and faculae. The model takes into account the effects of star\ninclination, doppler shifts due to stellar rotation as well as for limb\ndarkening, independent for each component. Several synthetic products have been\npresented to show the capabilities of the model. Results. The model is able to\nretrieve the input surface inhomogeneities configuration through photometric or\nspectroscopic observations. The model has been validated against optical solar\ndata and compared to alternative stellar surface activity models; e.g. SOAP\ncode. The Sun is a unique laboratory to test stellar models because of the\npossibility to relate unambiguously flux variations to surface inhomogeneities\nconfiguration. This validation has been done by analyzing a photometric time\nseries from the VIRGO photometer on board of SOHO mission. Results have been\ncompared to real solar images from the HMI instrument on board of SDO to\nconfirm the goodness of the results in terms of surface inhomogeneities\nposition and dimensions.

    "abstract": "While unlabeled image data is often plentiful, the costs of high-quality\nlabels pose an important practical challenge: Which images should one select\nfor labeling to use the annotation budget for a particular target task most\neffectively? To address this problem, we focus on single-pass data selection,\nwhich refers to the process of selecting all data to be annotated at once\nbefore training a downstream model. Prior methods for single-pass data\nselection rely on image-level representations and fail to reliably outperform\nrandom selection for object detection and segmentation. We propose\nObject-Focused Data Selection (OFDS) which leverages object-level features from\nfoundation models and ensures semantic coverage of all target classes. In\nextensive experiments across tasks and target domains, OFDS consistently\noutperforms random selection and all baselines. The best results for\nconstrained annotation budgets are obtained by combining human labels from OFDS\nwith autolabels from foundation models. Moreover, using OFDS to select the\ninitial labeled set for active learning yields consistent improvements",

While supervised methods trained on synthetic noise\n(e.g., Gaussian/Poisson) suffer from out-of-distribution generalization issues,\nexisting self-supervised approaches degrade under real FMI noise due to\noversimplified noise assumptions and computationally intensive deep\narchitectures. In this paper, we propose Fluorescence Micrograph to Self\n(FM2S), a zero-shot denoiser that achieves efficient FMI denoising through\nthree key innovations: 1) A noise injection module that ensures training data\nsufficiency through adaptive Poisson-Gaussian synthesis while preserving\nspatial correlation and global statistics of FMI noise for robust model\ngeneralization; 2) A two-stage progressive learning strategy that first\nrecovers structural priors via pre-denoised targets then refines high-frequency\ndetails through noise distribution alignment; 3) An ultra-lightweight network\n(3.5k parameters) enabling rapid convergence with 270$\\times$ faster training\nand inference than SOTAs. Extensive experiments across FMI datasets demonstrate\nFM2S's superiority: It outperforms CVF-SID by 1.4dB PSNR on average while\nrequiring 0.1% parameters of AP-BSN.

Motivated by the remarkable success of this model, in a\nrecent work we have looked for a general relativistic extension, proposing a\ntheory, dubbed Relativistic Scalar Fractional Gravity or RSFG, in which the\ntrace of the DM stress-energy tensor couples to the scalar curvature via a\nnon-local operator constructed with a fractional power of the d'Alembertian. In\nthis work we construct an extension of that model in which also a non-local\ncoupling between the Ricci tensor and the DM stress energy tensor is present.\nIn the action we encode the normalization between these scalar and tensorial\nterm into two operators $F_0(\\Box)$ and $F_2(\\Box)$, and we derive the general\nfield equations. We then take the weak field limit of the latter, showing that\nthey reduce to general relativity sourced by an effective stress energy tensor,\nfeaturing a non local isotropic pressure and anisotropic stress, even if one\nstarts with the assumption of a pressureless DM fluid. Finally, after having\nworked out the lensing theory in our setup, we test particularly interesting\nrealizations of our framework against the measured convergence profiles of the\nindividual and stacked clusters of the CLASH sample, finding remarkable\nconsistency with the data.",

Our empirical\nresults demonstrate that any independent component in the decoder can\neffectively learn both targets simultaneously, even when other components are\nshared.

For\nthe second auxiliary route, we introduce a route-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nto facilitate knowledge sharing while mitigating potential conflicts between\nroutes.

Electron dynamics has two critical effects. First, it\nleads to a structure formation characterized by strong zonal flows shearing\nrate, reduction of turbulence and profile corrugation. Second, it leads to\nzonal current sheets that result in a broadening of the minimum-q region,\nqualitatively consistent with the flux-tube simulations of Vol\\v{c}okas et al.\n[1]. Flux-driven simulations performed with $q_{\\text{min}}=2$ reveal the\ndevelopment of the transport barrier in the ion channel, forming at inner and\nouter radial positions with respect to the $q_{\\text{min}}$ position. The ITB\nformation in flux-driven setup is not recovered if $q_{\\text{min}} = 2.03$.\nAdditionally, a simulation at higher $\\rho^*$ indicates that the extent of the\nflattened region of the q-profile due to turbulent self-interaction does not\nchange proportionally to $\\rho^*$ or to $\\rho_i$, but somewhere in between. On\nthe other hand, the input power required to achieve similar on-axis\ntemperatures appears to exhibit almost GyroBohm scaling (for the two considered\n$\\rho^*$ values). Furthermore, considering an initial q-profile with\n$q_{\\text{min}} = 2.01$, flux-driven simulations show that partial\nself-interaction can evolve to complete self-interaction. This occurs due to\nturbulent-driven zonal currents that lower and flatten the q-profile down to\n$q_{\\text{min}} = 2.0$, in line with what is reported in Vol\\v{c}okas et\nal.[1].",

Results indicate that IC does not affect garden-path\nrecovery in Chinese, suggesting reliance on semantic context may reduce the\nneed for IC. In contrast, findings for English L2 learners reveal a complex\nrelationship between language proficiency and IC: Participants with low L2\nproficiency but high IC showed lingering misinterpretations, while those with\nhigh proficiency exhibited none. These results support and extend the Model of\nCognitive Control (Ness et al., 2023). Moreover, our comparison of three Stroop\ntask versions identifies L1 colour-word Stroop task as the preferred measure of\nIC in bilingual research.",

    "abstract": "Noisy matrix completion has attracted significant attention due to its\napplications in recommendation systems, signal processing and image\nrestoration. Most existing works rely on (weighted) least squares methods under\nvarious low-rank constraints. However, minimizing the sum of squared residuals\nis not always efficient, as it may ignore the potential structural information\nin the residuals. In this study, we propose a novel residual spectral matching\ncriterion that incorporates not only the numerical but also locational\ninformation of residuals. This criterion is the first in noisy matrix\ncompletion to adopt the perspective of low-rank perturbation of random matrices\nand exploit the spectral properties of sparse random matrices. We derive\noptimal statistical properties by analyzing the spectral properties of sparse\nrandom matrices and bounding the effects of low-rank perturbations and partial\nobservations. Additionally, we propose algorithms that efficiently approximate\nsolutions by constructing easily computable pseudo-gradients. The iterative\nprocess of the proposed algorithms ensures convergence at a rate consistent\nwith the optimal statistical error bound. Our method and algorithms demonstrate\nimproved numerical performance in both simulated and real data examples,\nparticularly in environments with high noise levels.",

    "abstract": "Texture synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer graphics that would\nbenefit various applications. Existing methods are effective in handling 2D\nimage textures. In contrast, many real-world textures contain meso-structure in\nthe 3D geometry space, such as grass, leaves, and fabrics, which cannot be\neffectively modeled using only 2D image textures. We propose a novel texture\nsynthesis method with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to capture and synthesize\ntextures from given multi-view images. In the proposed NeRF texture\nrepresentation, a scene with fine geometric details is disentangled into the\nmeso-structure textures and the underlying base shape. This allows textures\nwith meso-structure to be effectively learned as latent features situated on\nthe base shape, which are fed into a NeRF decoder trained simultaneously to\nrepresent the rich view-dependent appearance. Using this implicit\nrepresentation, we can synthesize NeRF-based textures through patch matching of\nlatent features. However, inconsistencies between the metrics of the\nreconstructed content space and the latent feature space may compromise the\nsynthesis quality. To enhance matching performance, we further regularize the\ndistribution of latent features by incorporating a clustering constraint. In\naddition to generating NeRF textures over a planar domain, our method can also\nsynthesize NeRF textures over curved surfaces, which are practically useful.\nExperimental results and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach.",

    "abstract": "Accelerated MRI reconstruction plays a vital role in reducing scan time while\npreserving image quality. While most existing methods rely on complex-valued\nimage-space or k-space data, these formats are often inaccessible in clinical\npractice due to proprietary reconstruction pipelines, leaving only magnitude\nimages stored in DICOM files. To address this gap, we focus on the\nunderexplored task of magnitude-image-based MRI reconstruction. Recent\nadvancements in diffusion models, particularly denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling\nimage priors. However, their task-agnostic denoising nature limits performance\nin source-to-target image translation tasks, such as MRI reconstruction. In\nthis work, we propose a novel Self-Consistent Nested Diffusion Bridge (SC-NDB)\nframework that models accelerated MRI reconstruction as a bi-directional image\ntranslation process between under-sampled and fully-sampled magnitude MRI\nimages. SC-NDB introduces a nested diffusion architecture with a\nself-consistency constraint and reverse bridge diffusion pathways to improve\nintermediate prediction fidelity and better capture the explicit priors of\nsource images. Furthermore, we incorporate a Contour Decomposition Embedding\nModule (CDEM) to inject structural and textural knowledge by leveraging\nLaplacian pyramids and directional filter banks. Extensive experiments on the\nfastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance compared to both magnitude-based and non-magnitude-based diffusion\nmodels, confirming the effectiveness and clinical relevance of SC-NDB.",

PETs aim to alleviate power asymmetries, but can actually entrench the\ninfrastructural power of companies implementing them vis-\\`a-vis other public\nand private organisations. We investigate whether and how this contradiction\nmanifests with an empirical study of Amazon's cloud connectivity service called\nSidewalk. In 2021, Amazon remotely updated Echo and Ring devices in consumers'\nhomes, to transform them into Sidewalk \"gateways\". Compatible Internet of\nThings (IoT) devices, called \"endpoints\", can connect to an associated\n\"Application Server\" in Amazon Web Services (AWS) through these gateways. We\nfind that Sidewalk is not just a connectivity service, but an extension of\nAmazon's cloud infrastructure as a software production environment for IoT\nmanufacturers. PETs play a prominent role in this pursuit: we observe a\ntwo-faceted PET paradox. First, suppressing some information flows allows\nAmazon to promise narrow privacy guarantees to owners of Echo and Ring devices\nwhen \"flipping\" them into gateways. Once flipped, these gateways constitute a\ncrowdsourced connectivity infrastructure that covers 90% of the US population\nand expands their AWS offerings. We show how novel information flows, enabled\nby Sidewalk connectivity, raise greater surveillance and competition concerns.\nSecond, Amazon governs the implementation of these PETs, requiring\nmanufacturers to adjust their device hardware, operating system and software;\ncloud use; factory lines; and organisational processes. Together, these changes\nturn manufacturers' endpoints into accessories of Amazon's computational\ninfrastructure; further entrenching Amazon's infrastructural power.

    "abstract": "Since decades, the modelling of metadata has been core to the functioning of\nany academic library. Its importance has only enhanced with the increasing\npervasiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven information\nactivities and services which constitute a library's outreach. However, with\nthe rising importance of metadata, there arose several outstanding problems\nwith the process of designing a library metadata model impacting its\nreusability, crosswalk and interoperability with other metadata models. This\npaper posits that the above problems stem from an underlying thesis that there\nshould only be a few core metadata models which would be necessary and\nsufficient for any information service using them, irrespective of the\nheterogeneity of intra-domain or inter-domain settings. To that end, this paper\nadvances a contrary view of the above thesis and substantiates its argument in\nthree key steps. First, it introduces a novel way of thinking about a library\nmetadata model as an ontology-driven composition of five functionally\ninterlinked representation levels from perception to its intensional definition\nvia properties. Second, it introduces the representational manifoldness\nimplicit in each of the five levels which cumulatively contributes to a\nconceptually entangled library metadata model. Finally, and most importantly,\nit proposes a Generative AI-driven Human-Large Language Model (LLM)\ncollaboration based metadata modelling approach to disentangle the entanglement\ninherent in each representation level leading to the generation of a\nconceptually disentangled metadata model.

    "abstract": "Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is an attractive and significant research area\nin computer vision, which aims to recognize and track specific targets in video\nsequences where the target objects are arbitrary and class-agnostic. The VOT\ntechnology could be applied in various scenarios, processing data of diverse\nmodalities such as RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud. Besides, since no one\nsensor could handle all the dynamic and varying environments, multi-modal VOT\nis also investigated. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent\nprogress of both single-modal and multi-modal VOT, especially the deep learning\nmethods. Specifically, we first review three types of mainstream single-modal\nVOT, including RGB, thermal infrared and point cloud tracking. In particular,\nwe conclude four widely-used single-modal frameworks, abstracting their schemas\nand categorizing the existing inheritors. Then we summarize four kinds of\nmulti-modal VOT, including RGB-Depth, RGB-Thermal, RGB-LiDAR and RGB-Language.\nMoreover, the comparison results in plenty of VOT benchmarks of the discussed\nmodalities are presented. Finally, we provide recommendations and insightful\nobservations, inspiring the future development of this fast-growing literature.",

    "abstract": "As learning-based methods for legged robots rapidly grow in popularity, it is\nimportant that we can provide safety assurances efficiently across different\ncontrollers and environments. Existing works either rely on a priori knowledge\nof the environment and safety constraints to ensure system safety or provide\nassurances for a specific locomotion policy. To address these limitations, we\npropose an observation-conditioned reachability-based (OCR) safety-filter\nframework. Our key idea is to use an OCR value network (OCR-VN) that predicts\nthe optimal control-theoretic safety value function for new failure regions and\ndynamic uncertainty during deployment time. Specifically, the OCR-VN\nfacilitates rapid safety adaptation through two key components: a LiDAR-based\ninput that allows the dynamic construction of safe regions in light of new\nobstacles and a disturbance estimation module that accounts for dynamics\nuncertainty in the wild. The predicted safety value function is used to\nconstruct an adaptive safety filter that overrides the nominal quadruped\ncontroller when necessary to maintain safety. Through simulation studies and\nhardware experiments on a Unitree Go1 quadruped, we demonstrate that the\nproposed framework can automatically safeguard a wide range of hierarchical\nquadruped controllers, adapts to novel environments, and is robust to unmodeled\ndynamics without a priori access to the controllers or environments - hence,\n\"One Filter to Deploy Them All\".

    "abstract": "Quantum reservoirs have great potential as they utilize the complex real-time\ndissipative dynamics of quantum systems for information processing and target\ntime-series generation without precise control or fine-tuning of the\nHamiltonian parameters. Nonetheless, their realization is challenging as\nquantum hardware with appropriate dynamics, robustness to noise, and ability to\nproduce target steady states is required. To that end, we propose the\ndisordered quantum homogenizer as an alternative platform, and prove it\nsatisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions - stability and contractivity\n- of the reservoir dynamics, necessary for solving machine learning tasks with\ntime-series input data streams. The results indicate that the quantum\nhomogenization protocol, physically implementable as either nuclear magnetic\nresonance ensemble or a photonic system, can potentially function as a\nreservoir computer.",

In this\nstudy, we develop a dynamic charging scheduling method (named CongestionAware)\nthat anticipates vehicles' energy needs and coordinates their charging\noperations with real-time energy prices to avoid long waiting time at charging\nstations and increase the total profit of the system. A sequential mixed\ninteger linear programming model is proposed to devise vehicles' day-ahead\ncharging plans based on their experienced charging waiting times and energy\nconsumption. The obtained charging plans are adapted within the day in response\nto vehicles' energy needs and charging station congestion. The developed\ncharging policy is tested using NYC yellow taxi data in a Manhattan-like study\narea with a fleet size of 100 vehicles given the scenarios of 3000 and 4000\ncustomers per day. The computational results show that our CongestionAware\npolicy outperforms different benchmark policies with up to +15.06% profit and\n+19.16% service rate for 4000 customers per day.

This provides a decomposition of the LOCO as the sum of a two-body\ncomponent and higher-order components (redundant and synergistic), also\nhighlighting the features that contribute to building these high-order effects\nalongside the driving feature. We report the application to proton/pion\ndiscrimination from simulated detector measures by GEANT.",

    "abstract": "A sheared cube is made out of a cube by giving a shear to the body in one\ndirection keeping one of the faces fixed. We investigate here the thermodynamic\nphase behavior of a family of such regular hard sheared cubes, each of the\nmembers of the family having a distinct angle made by the faces with the\nperpendicular on the fixed face. Hard particle Monte Carlo (HPMC) has been\nperformed with these anisotropic building blocks resulting entropy-driven self\nassembly. Thereby computational evidence of discrete plastic crystal phase has\nbeen found in crystal. The discrete plastic crystal phase is known to form\nthrough the spontaneous self-assembly of certain polyhedra. Throughout the\nentire solid regime particle orientations exhibit strong specific correlations\nbefore melting into a liquid, without any evidence of freely rotating plastic\ncrystal at lower density solid. It has been thoroughly observed that\ngeometrical attributes of the shapes don't determine any of the properties that\ndesignate this orientational disorder phase reported here. We also find that\nparticle's rotational symmetric axes and one of the rotational symmetric axes\nof the unit cell of the crystal have a strong relationship in their alignment\nin space. These results, achieved with shapes having crystallographic point\ngroup symmetry, are investigated as being consistent with the phenomenology of\ndiscrete plastic crystal phase established in earlier works with hard particles\nhaving non-crystallographic point group symmetry.",

Surgical interventions such as\ntrochleoplasty require precise planning to correct the trochlear groove.\nHowever, no standardized preoperative plan exists to guide surgeons in\nreshaping the femur. This study aims to generate patient-specific,\npseudo-healthy MR images of the trochlear region that should theoretically\nalign with the respective patient's patella, potentially supporting the\npre-operative planning of trochleoplasty.\n  Methods: We employ a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to generate personalized\npseudo-healthy, anatomically plausible MR scans of the trochlear region. We\ntrain our model using knee MR scans of healthy subjects. During inference, we\nmask out pathological regions around the patella in scans of patients affected\nby TD, and replace them with their pseudo-healthy counterpart.

    "abstract": "When does a digital image resemble reality? The relevance of this question\nincreases as the generation of synthetic images -- so called deep fakes --\nbecomes increasingly popular. Deep fakes have gained much attention for a\nnumber of reasons -- among others, due to their potential to disrupt the\npolitical climate. In order to mitigate these threats, the EU AI Act implements\nspecific transparency regulations for generating synthetic content or\nmanipulating existing content. However, the distinction between real and\nsynthetic images is -- even from a computer vision perspective -- far from\ntrivial. We argue that the current definition of deep fakes in the AI act and\nthe corresponding obligations are not sufficiently specified to tackle the\nchallenges posed by deep fakes. By analyzing the life cycle of a digital photo\nfrom the camera sensor to the digital editing features, we find that: (1.) Deep\nfakes are ill-defined in the EU AI Act. The definition leaves too much scope\nfor what a deep fake is. (2.) It is unclear how editing functions like Google's\n``best take'' feature can be considered as an exception to transparency\nobligations. (3.) The exception for substantially edited images raises\nquestions about what constitutes substantial editing of content and whether or\nnot this editing must be perceptible by a natural person. Our results\ndemonstrate that complying with the current AI Act transparency obligations is\ndifficult for providers and deployers. As a consequence of the unclear\nprovisions, there is a risk that exceptions may be either too broad or too\nlimited. We intend our analysis to foster the discussion on what constitutes a\ndeep fake and to raise awareness about the pitfalls in the current AI Act\ntransparency obligations.",

The new temperature threshold is 13.4 keV for the\nisochoric ignition and 25.1 keV for the isobaric ignition, both of which are\nmore accessible experimentally. When a shock wave is present, alpha-particle\ndeposition occurs at the high-density shock front instead of the cold fuel,\naccelerating the burning wave by approximately 20%. To further validate these\nfindings, we conducted a series of 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations using\nfinite isochoric hot spots with different fast electron energy. The results\nreveal a rise in burn-up fraction caused by the detonation wave with a\ndeposited fast electron energy about 8.5 kJ. This work can provide a reference\nfor the realization of fusion energy via fast ignition schemes, such as the\ndouble-cone ignition scheme.

    "abstract": "DNN-based watermarking methods have rapidly advanced, with the\n``Encoder-Noise Layer-Decoder'' (END) framework being the most widely used. To\nensure end-to-end training, the noise layer in the framework must be\ndifferentiable. However, real-world distortions are often non-differentiable,\nleading to challenges in end-to-end training. Existing solutions only treat the\ndistortion perturbation as additive noise, which does not fully integrate the\neffect of distortion in training. To better incorporate non-differentiable\ndistortions into training, we propose a novel dual-decoder architecture\n(END$^2$). Unlike conventional END architecture, our method employs two\nstructurally identical decoders: the Teacher Decoder, processing pure\nwatermarked images, and the Student Decoder, handling distortion-perturbed\nimages. The gradient is backpropagated only through the Teacher Decoder branch\nto optimize the encoder thus bypassing the problem of non-differentiability. To\nensure resistance to arbitrary distortions, we enforce alignment of the two\ndecoders' feature representations by maximizing the cosine similarity between\ntheir intermediate vectors on a hypersphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms under various\nnon-differentiable distortions. Moreover, even without the differentiability\nconstraint, our method surpasses baselines with a differentiable noise layer.\nOur approach is effective and easily implementable across all END\narchitectures, enhancing practicality and generalizability.",

Recent approaches employ\npre-trained diffusion models to generate informative images directly, avoiding\npixel-level optimization and achieving notable results.

With the loss differences, we identify distinctive regions\nof the original images. Additionally, we perform intra-class clustering and\nranking on selected patches to maintain diversity constraints.

    "abstract": "User interactions in recommender systems are inherently complex, often\ninvolving behaviors that go beyond simple acceptance or rejection. One\nparticularly common behavior is hesitation, where users deliberate over\nrecommended items, signaling uncertainty. Our large-scale surveys, with 6,644\nand 3,864 responses respectively, confirm that hesitation is not only\nwidespread but also has a profound impact on user experiences. When users spend\nadditional time engaging with content they are ultimately uninterested in, this\ncan lead to negative emotions, a phenomenon we term as tolerance. The surveys\nreveal that such tolerance behaviors often arise after hesitation and can erode\ntrust, satisfaction, and long-term loyalty to the platform. For instance, a\nclick might reflect a need for more information rather than genuine interest,\nand prolonged exposure to unsuitable content amplifies frustration. This\nmisalignment between user intent and system interpretation introduces noise\ninto recommendation training, resulting in suggestions that increase\nuncertainty and disengagement. To address these issues, we identified signals\nindicative of tolerance behavior and analyzed datasets from both e-commerce and\nshort-video platforms. The analysis shows a strong correlation between\nincreased tolerance behavior and decreased user activity. We integrated these\ninsights into the training process of a recommender system for a major\nshort-video platform. Results from four independent online A/B experiments\ndemonstrated significant improvements in user retention, achieved with minimal\nadditional computational costs. These findings underscore the importance of\nrecognizing hesitation as a ubiquitous user behavior and addressing tolerance\nto enhance satisfaction, build trust, and sustain long-term engagement in\nrecommender systems.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end\nframework called Stable Matching EV Charging Assignment (SMEVCA) that\nefficiently assigns charge-seeking EVs to CPs with assistance from roadside\nunits (RSUs). The proposed framework operates within a subscription-based\nmodel, ensuring that the subscribed EVs complete their charging within a\npredefined time limit enforced by a service level agreement (SLA). The\nframework SMEVCA employs a stable, fast, and efficient EV-CP assignment\nformulated as a one-to-many matching game with preferences. The matching\nprocess identifies the preferred coalition (a subset of EVs assigned to the\nCPs) using two strategies: (1) Preferred Coalition Greedy (PCG) that offers an\nefficient, locally optimal heuristic solution and (2) Preferred Coalition\nDynamic (PCD) that is more computation-intensive but delivers a globally\noptimal coalition. Extensive simulations reveal that PCG and PCD achieve a gain\nof 14.6% and 20.8% over random elimination for in-network charge transferred\nwith only 3% and 0.1% EVs unserved within the RSUs vicinity.",

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown\ngreat success in this field, leading to growing interest in developing fair\nGNNs for critical applications. However, most existing fair GNNs focus on\nstatistical fairness notions, which may be insufficient when dealing with\nstatistical anomalies. Hence, motivated by causal theory, there has been\ngrowing attention to mitigating root causes of unfairness utilizing graph\ncounterfactuals. Unfortunately, existing methods for generating graph\ncounterfactuals invariably require the sensitive attribute. Nevertheless, in\nmany real-world applications, it is usually infeasible to obtain sensitive\nattributes due to privacy or legal issues, which challenge existing methods. In\nthis paper, we propose a framework named Fairwos (improving Fairness without\nsensitive attributes). In particular, we first propose a mechanism to generate\npseudo-sensitive attributes to remedy the problem of missing sensitive\nattributes, and then design a strategy for finding graph counterfactuals from\nthe real dataset. To train fair GNNs, we propose a method to ensure that the\nembeddings from the original data are consistent with those from the graph\ncounterfactuals, and dynamically adjust the weight of each pseudo-sensitive\nattribute to balance its contribution to fairness and utility. Furthermore, we\ntheoretically demonstrate that minimizing the relation between these\npseudo-sensitive attributes and the prediction can enable the fairness of GNNs.\nExperimental results on six real-world datasets show that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in balancing utility and fairness.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a real-time closed-loop control strategy\nenhanced by nonlinear non-intrusive Deep Learning-based Reduced Order Models\n(DL-ROMs). Specifically, in the offline phase, (i) full-order state-control\npairs are generated for different scenarios through the adjoint method, (ii)\nthe essential features relevant for control design are extracted from the\nsnapshots through a combination of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and\ndeep autoencoders, and (iii) the low-dimensional policy bridging latent control\nand state spaces is approximated with a feedforward neural network.

By\ntransforming graphs into vectors, it simplifies the analysis and processing of\nlarge-scale datasets. Several approaches, such as GraphSAGE, Node2Vec, and\nFastRP, offer efficient methods for generating graph embeddings. By storing\nembeddings as node properties, it is possible to compare different embedding\ntechniques and evaluate their effectiveness for specific tasks. This\nflexibilityallows for dynamic updates to embeddings and facilitates\nexperimentation with different approaches.

    "abstract": "The complexity of performance-based building design stems from the evaluation\nof numerous candidate design options, driven by the plethora of variables,\nobjectives, and constraints inherent in multi-disciplinary projects. This\nnecessitates optimization approaches to support the identification of well\nperforming designs while reducing the computational time of performance\nevaluation. In response, this paper proposes and evaluates a sequential\napproach for multi-objective design optimization of building geometry, fabric,\nHVAC system and controls for building performance. This approach involves\nsequential optimizations with optimal solutions from previous stages passed to\nthe next. The performance of the sequential approach is benchmarked against a\nfull factorial search, assessing its effectiveness in finding global optima,\nsolution quality, reliability to scale and variations of problem formulations,\nand computational efficiency compared to the NSGA-II algorithm. 24\nconfigurations of the sequential approach are tested on a multi-scale case\nstudy, simulating 874 to 4,147,200 design options for an office building,\naiming to minimize energy demand while maintaining thermal comfort. A two-stage\nsequential process-(building geometry + fabric) and (HVAC system + controls)\nidentified the same Pareto-optimal solutions as the full factorial search\nacross all four scales and variations of problem formulations, demonstrating\n100% effectiveness and reliability. This approach required 100,700 function\nevaluations, representing a 91.2% reduction in computational effort compared to\nthe full factorial search. In contrast, NSGA-II achieved only 73.5% of the\nglobal optima with the same number of function evaluations. This research\nindicates that a sequential optimization approach is a highly efficient and\nrobust alternative to the standard NSGA-II algorithm.",

To fit the rotation curves, we employed the\nstandard halo model and the dark matter disc (DMD) model, which assumes that\ndark matter is primarily confined to the galactic discs and can be traced by\nthe distribution of \\HI{}. Interestingly, our analysis revealed that the fits\nfrom the DMD model are statistically comparable to those obtained using the\nstandard halo model, but the inferred masses of the galaxies in the DMD model\nare approximately 10 to 100 times smaller than the masses inferred in the\nstandard halo model. In the DMD model, the inner slope of the rotation curve is\ndirectly related to a linear combination of the surface density profiles of the\nstellar and gas components, which generally exhibit a flat core. Consequently,\nthe observation of a linear relationship between the rotation curve and the\nradius in the disc central regions is consistent with the framework of the DMD\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "Vertical shear instability (VSI), driven by a vertical gradient of rotational\nangular velocity, is a promising source of turbulence in protoplanetary disks.\nWe examine the semi-global stability of thermally stratified disks and find\nthat the VSI consists of surface and body modes: surface modes are confined to\nregions of strong shear, while body modes extend perturbations across the disk,\nconsistent with the previous findings. In thermally stratified disks, surface\nmodes bifurcate into two branches. The branch associated with the strongest\nshear at mid-height exhibits a higher growth rate compared to the branch near\nthe surfaces. Surface modes generally grow rapidly and require a high radial\nwave number $k_R$, whereas body mode growth rates increase as $k_R$ decreases.\nThermal stratification enhances the growth rates of both surface and body modes\nand boosts VSI-driven radial kinetic energy relative to vertical energy. Our\nresults suggest that simulations will initially favor surface modes with large\n$k_R$, followed by an increase in body modes with smaller $k_R$, with faster\nprogression in more thermal stratified disks.",

However, these methods still have some limitations in practical\napplications: (1) They typically focus only on the matching similarity between\nsentences. However, there exists implicit high-value information both within\nsentences of the same class and across different classes, which is very crucial\nfor classification tasks. (2) Existing methods such as pre-trained language\nmodels and graph-based approaches often consume substantial memory for training\nand text-graph construction.

Our approach begins by constructing a\ncompressor list for each class to fully mine the regularity information within\nintra-class data. We then remove redundant information irrelevant to the target\nclassification to reduce processing time. Finally, we compute the similarity\ndistance between text pairs for classification. We evaluate LFTC on 9 publicly\navailable benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in performance and processing time, especially under limited\ncomputational and data resources, highlighting its superior advantages.",

Existing proactive defenses also have limitations,\nas they are effective only for deepfake models based on specific Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), making them less applicable in light of recent\nadvancements in diffusion-based models.

    "abstract": "Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision\nencoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of\nVLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling\nVLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However,\nunderstanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as\nthe number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in\nthe risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy\ncomputation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs\neither: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2)\nreducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the\nformer solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later\noverlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present\nBalanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively\nleverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of\nvisual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method,\nwe devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames\nrelevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then\nde-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens\nof the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module\nand an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over\nthe token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in\nbalancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding,\nyielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

In contrast, diffusion-based attacks require pre-trained\nmodels, demanding substantial data when these models are unavailable, limiting\npractical use in data-scarce scenarios. In medical imaging, however, this is\noften unfeasible due to the limited availability of datasets. Building on\nrecent advancements in learnable prompts, we propose Prompt2Perturb (P2P), a\nnovel language-guided attack method capable of generating meaningful attack\nexamples driven by text instructions. During the prompt learning phase, our\napproach leverages learnable prompts within the text encoder to create subtle,\nyet impactful, perturbations that remain imperceptible while guiding the model\ntowards targeted outcomes. In contrast to current prompt learning-based\napproaches, our P2P stands out by directly updating text embeddings, avoiding\nthe need for retraining diffusion models. Further, we leverage the finding that\noptimizing only the early reverse diffusion steps boosts efficiency while\nensuring that the generated adversarial examples incorporate subtle noise, thus\npreserving ultrasound image quality without introducing noticeable artifacts.\nWe show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art attack techniques across\nthree breast ultrasound datasets in FID and LPIPS. Moreover, the generated\nimages are both more natural in appearance and more effective compared to\nexisting adversarial attacks.

Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy\neigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product\nstates for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their\nexpectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained\nthermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of\ntypical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble\nstates. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical\nensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE)\nwith all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called\npartial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the\nthermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and\nother conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs\nextends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the\nsubsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the\nrelative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the\ntypical states/eigenstates.

Despite the remarkable progress made\nthrough recent efforts, traditional PTQ methods typically encounter failure in\ndynamic and ever-changing real-world scenarios, involving unpredictable data\nstreams and continual domain shifts, which poses greater challenges. In this\npaper, we propose a novel and stable quantization process for test-time\nadaptation (TTA), dubbed TTAQ, to address the performance degradation of\ntraditional PTQ in dynamically evolving test domains. To tackle domain shifts\nin quantizer, TTAQ proposes the Perturbation Error Mitigation (PEM) and\nPerturbation Consistency Reconstruction (PCR). Specifically, PEM analyzes the\nerror propagation and devises a weight regularization scheme to mitigate the\nimpact of input perturbations. On the other hand, PCR introduces consistency\nlearning to ensure that quantized models provide stable predictions for same\nsample. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Balanced Loss (ABL) to adjust the\nlogits by taking advantage of the frequency and complexity of the class, which\ncan effectively address the class imbalance caused by unpredictable data\nstreams during optimization. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple\ndatasets with generic TTA methods, proving that TTAQ can outperform existing\nbaselines and encouragingly improve the accuracy of low bit PTQ models in\ncontinually changing test domains.

    "abstract": "Stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) are H-poor transients produced at the end\nof the life of massive stars that previously lost their H-rich envelope. Their\nprogenitors are thought to be donor stars in mass-transferring binary systems,\nwhich were stripped of their H-rich envelopes some $10^6$yr before core\ncollapse. A subset of the stripped-envelope SNe exhibit spectral and\nphotometric features indicative of interaction between their ejecta and nearby\ncircumstellar material (CSM). We examine whether mass transfer during, or\nshortly before, core collapse in massive binary systems can produce the CSM\ninferred from the observations of interacting H-poor SNe. We select 44 models\nfrom a comprehensive grid of detailed binary evolution models in which the mass\ndonors are H-free and explode while transferring mass to a main-sequence\ncompanion. We find that in these models, mass transfer starts less than\n$\\sim20$kyr before, and often continues until the core collapse of the donor\nstar. Up to $0.8M_\\odot$ of H-free material are removed from the donor star\nduring this phase, which may produce a He-rich circumbinary material. We\nexplore plausible assumptions for its spatial distribution at the time of\nexplosion. When assuming that the CSM accumulates in a circumbinary disk, we\nfind qualitative agreement with the supernova and CSM properties inferred from\nobserved Type Ibn SNe, and to a lesser extent with constraints from Type Icn\nSNe. We find that our mass transferring stripped envelope SN progenitor models\nmay produce up to $\\sim$10% of all stripped envelope supernovae. The binary\nchannel proposed in this work can qualitatively account for the observed key\nproperties and rate of interacting H-poor SNe. Models for the evolution of the\ncircumbinary material and the spectral evolution of exploding progenitors from\nthis channel are needed to further test its significance.",

Subsequently,\nsentence-level semantic lyric embeddings independently extracted from a\nsentence-wise Transformer encoder are combined with word-level part-of-speech\nembeddings and syllable-level tone embeddings as fine-grained controls to\nenhance the controllability of lyrics over melody generation. Then we introduce\nhuman-labeled musical tags, sentence-level statistical musical attributes, and\nlearned musical features extracted from a pre-trained VQ-VAE as coarse-grained,\nfine-grained and high-fidelity controls, respectively, to the generation\nprocess, thereby enabling user control over melody generation.

Extracting geometry from NeRF typically relies on the Marching Cubes\nalgorithm, which uses a hand-crafted threshold to define the level set.\nHowever, this threshold-based approach requires laborious and scenario-specific\ntuning, limiting its practicality for real-world applications. In this work, we\nseek to enhance the efficiency of this method during the training time. To this\nend, we introduce a spiking neuron mechanism that dynamically adjusts the\nthreshold, eliminating the need for manual selection. Despite its promise,\ndirectly training with the spiking neuron often results in model collapse and\nnoisy outputs. To overcome these challenges, we propose a round-robin strategy\nthat stabilizes the training process and enables the geometry network to\nachieve a sharper and more precise density distribution with minimal\ncomputational overhead. We validate our approach through extensive experiments\non both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Existing methods often assume that the student model is inherently\ninferior to the teacher model. However, we identify that the fundamental issue\naffecting student performance is the bias transferred by the teacher. Current\nKD frameworks transmit both right and wrong knowledge, introducing bias that\nmisleads the student model. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy\nto rectify bias and greatly improve the student model's performance. Our\nstrategy involves three steps: First, we differentiate knowledge and design a\nbias elimination method to filter out biases, retaining only the right\nknowledge for the student model to learn. Next, we propose a bias rectification\nmethod to rectify the teacher model's wrong predictions, fundamentally\naddressing bias interference. The student model learns from both the right\nknowledge and the rectified biases, greatly improving its prediction accuracy.\nAdditionally, we introduce a dynamic learning approach with a loss function\nthat updates weights dynamically, allowing the student model to quickly learn\nright knowledge-based easy tasks initially and tackle hard tasks corresponding\nto biases later, greatly enhancing the student model's learning efficiency. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first strategy enabling the student\nmodel to surpass the teacher model.

    "abstract": "Searching for ambient-pressure conventional superconductors with critical\ntemperatures ($T_C$) higher than 40 K and implementable synthesis routes is a\nkey challenge in the field of high-temperature superconductivity, mainly due to\nlack of efficient and effective models to estimate $T_C$ of potential systems.\nIn this work, we propose a simplified model to estimate the dimensionless\nelectron-phonon coupling (EPC) strength \\lambbda and thus $T_C$ by separately\ntreating the EPC matrix elements which evaluate the pairing strength and the\nphonon-assisted nesting function P(w) which evaluates the matching of electron\nbands and phonon spectra for forming potential electron pairs via phonons. By\napplying the model to screen over the Computational 2D Materials Database\n(C2DB), we successfully identify several systems with TC exceeding 20 K as\nconfirmed by accurate first-principles calculations. Especially,\nTi$_3$N$_2$H$_2$ has a record high $T_C$ value among known MXenes, which is 52\nK (78 K) according to isotropic (anisotropic) Migdal-Eliashberg equations under\nambient pressure. More importantly, we propose a feasible synthesis route for\nTi$_3$N$_2$H$_2$ starting from the experimentally synthesized MXene\nTi$_4$N$_3$. Beyond demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency in identifying\nhigh-$T_C$ superconductors, our model illuminates the critical roles of the\nmatching between electron band and phonon spectra as a necessary condition in\ndetermining $T_C$ and points out the directions for prediction and design of\nhigh-$T_C$ superconductors, which is exemplified by showing a novel designed\nsystem Ti$_3$N$_2$H$_2$ with a possible $T_C$ of 80 K under ambient pressure.\nOur model opens new avenues for exploring high-$T_C$ systems.",

An integral\npart of traffic management is understanding the turning movement counts (TMCs)\nat intersections, Accurate TMCs at intersections are crucial for traffic signal\ncontrol, congestion mitigation, and road safety. In general, TMCs are obtained\nusing physical sensors installed at intersections, but this approach can be\ncost-prohibitive and technically challenging, especially for cities with\nextensive road networks. Recent advancements in machine learning and\ndata-driven approaches have offered promising alternatives for estimating TMCs.\nTraffic patterns can vary significantly across different intersections due to\nfactors such as road geometry, traffic signal settings, and local driver\nbehaviors. This domain discrepancy limits the generalizability and accuracy of\nmachine learning models when applied to new or unseen intersections. In\nresponse to these limitations, this research proposes a novel framework\nleveraging transfer learning (TL) to estimate TMCs at intersections by using\ntraffic controller event-based data, road infrastructure data, and\npoint-of-interest (POI) data.

    "abstract": "Molecular gas, as the fuel for star formation, and its relationship with\natomic gas are crucial for understanding how galaxies regulate their star\nforming (SF) activities. We conducted IRAM 30m observations of 23 nearby spiral\ngalaxies from the CHANG-ES project to investigatet the distribution of\nmolecular gas and the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Combining these results with\natomic gas masses from previous studies, we aim to investigate the scaling\nrelations that connect the molecular and atomic gas masses with stellar masses\nand the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. Based on spatially resolved\nobservations of the three CO lines, we calculated the total molecular gas\nmasses, the ratios between different CO lines, and derived physical parameters\nsuch as temperature and optical depth. The median line ratios for nuclear/disk\nregions are 8.6/6.1 (^{12}\\mathrm{CO}/^{13}\\mathrm{CO}\\ J=1{-}0) and 0.53/0.39\n(^{12}\\mathrm{CO}\\ J=2{-}1/J=1{-}0). Molecular gas mass derived from\n^{13}\\mathrm{CO} is correlated but systematically lower than that from\n^{12}\\mathrm{CO}. Most galaxies follow the spatially resolved SF scaling\nrelation with a median gas depletion timescale of approximately 1 Gyr, while a\nfew exhibit shorter timescales of approximately 0.1 Gyr. The\nmolecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio correlates strongly with stellar mass,\nconsistent with previous studies. Galaxies with lower stellar masses show an\nexcess of atomic gas, indicating less efficient conversion to molecular gas.\nMost galaxies tightly follow the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, but NGC 2992\nand NGC 4594 deviate from the relation due to different physical factors. We\nfind that the ratio of the cold gas (comprising molecular and atomic gas) to\nthe total baryon mass decreases with the gravitational potential of the galaxy,\nas traced by rotation velocity, which could be due to gas consumption in SF or\nbeing heated to the hot phase.",

This paper first\nexposes a serious privacy problem in EEG-based BCIs, i.e., the user identity in\nEEG data can be easily learned so that different sessions of EEG data from the\nsame user can be associated together to more reliably mine private information.\nTo address this issue, we further propose two approaches to convert the\noriginal EEG data into identity-unlearnable EEG data, i.e., removing the user\nidentity information while maintaining the good performance on the primary BCI\ntask. Experiments on seven EEG datasets from five different BCI paradigms\nshowed that on average the generated identity-unlearnable EEG data can reduce\nthe user identification accuracy from 70.01\\% to at most 21.36\\%, greatly\nfacilitating user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.",

As SR is severely ill-conditioned, effective image\npriors are necessary to regularize the solution space and generate the\ncorresponding high-resolution (HR) image. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngradient-guided multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR) framework for remote\nsensing imagery reconstruction. The framework integrates a learned gradient\nprior as the regularization term into a model-based optimization method.\nSpecifically, the local gradient regularization (LGR) prior is derived from the\ndeep residual attention network (DRAN) through gradient profile transformation.\nThe non-local total variation (NLTV) prior is characterized using the spatial\nstructure similarity of the gradient patches with the maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) model. The modeled prior performs well in preserving edge smoothness and\nsuppressing visual artifacts, while the learned prior is effective in enhancing\nsharp edges and recovering fine structures. By incorporating the two\ncomplementary priors into an adaptive norm based reconstruction framework, the\nmixed L1 and L2 regularization minimization problem is optimized to achieve the\nrequired HR remote sensing image.

    "abstract": "This study explored the transformative potential of artificial intelligence\n(AI) in addressing the challenges posed by terahertz ultra-massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems. It begins by outlining the\ncharacteristics of terahertz UM-MIMO systems and identifies three primary\nchallenges for transceiver design: computational complexity, modeling\ndifficulty, and measurement limitations. The study posits that AI provides a\npromising solution to these challenges. Three systematic research roadmaps are\nproposed for developing AI algorithms tailored to terahertz UM-MIMO systems.\nThe first roadmap, model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes the importance\nof leveraging available domain knowledge and advocates the adoption of AI only\nto enhance bottleneck modules within an established signal processing or\noptimization framework. Four essential steps are discussed: algorithmic\nframeworks, basis algorithms, loss-function design, and neural architecture\ndesign. The second roadmap presents channel state information (CSI) foundation\nmodels, aimed at unifying the design of different transceiver modules by\nfocusing on their shared foundation, that is, the wireless channel. The\ntraining of a single compact foundation model is proposed to estimate the score\nfunction of wireless channels, which serve as a versatile prior for designing a\nwide variety of transceiver modules. Four essential steps are outlined: general\nframeworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, joint design of CSI\nfoundation models, and model-driven DL. The third roadmap aims to explore\npotential directions for applying pretrained large language models (LLMs) to\nterahertz UM-MIMO systems. Several application scenarios are envisioned,\nincluding LLM-based estimation, optimization, search, network management, and\nprotocol understanding. Finally, the study highlights open problems and future\nresearch directions.",

For multiple reasons, these youth\noften don't receive adequate social support from those around them. Despite\ntechnology's potential, very little work has explored how these tools can\nprovide more support to foster-involved youth. To begin to fill this gap, we\nworked with current and former foster-involved youth to develop the first\ndigital tool that aims to increase social support for this population, creating\na novel system in which users complete reflective check-ins in an online\ncommunity setting. We then conducted a pilot study with 15 current and former\nfoster-involved youth, comparing the effect of using the app for two weeks to\ntwo weeks of no intervention. We collected qualitative and quantitative data,\nwhich demonstrated that this type of interface can provide youth with types of\nsocial support that are often not provided by foster care services and other\ndigital interventions. The paper details the motivation behind the app, the\ntrauma-informed design process, and insights gained from this initial\nevaluation study.

If individuals perceive an environment as unsafe for cycling, it is\nlikely that they will prefer other means of transportation.

In\nthis study, we tackle this problem. We base our approach on using pairwise\ncomparisons of real-world images, repeatedly presenting respondents with pairs\nof road environments and asking them to select the one they perceive as safer\nfor cycling, if any. Using the collected data, we train a siamese-convolutional\nneural network using a multi-loss framework that learns from individuals'\nresponses, learns preferences directly from images, and includes ties (often\ndiscarded in the literature). Effectively, this model learns to predict\nhuman-style perceptions, evaluating which cycling environments are perceived as\nsafer. Our model achieves good results, showcasing this approach has a\nreal-life impact, such as improving interventions' effectiveness. Furthermore,\nit facilitates the continuous assessment of changing cycling environments,\npermitting short-term evaluations of measures to enhance perceived cycling\nsafety.

One such approach\ninvolves using a two-photon quantum state, where only one photon interacts with\nthe object being imaged while its entangled partner carries spatial or temporal\ninformation. To implement this technique, it is necessary to generate specific\nquantum states of light and detect photons at the single-photon level. While\nthis method has been successfully demonstrated in the visible electromagnetic\nspectrum, extending it to X-rays has faced significant challenges due to the\ndifficulties in producing a sufficient rate of X-ray photon pairs and detecting\nthem with adequate resolution. Here, we demonstrate record high rates of\ncorrelated X-ray photon pairs produced via a spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion process and we employ these photons to perform quantum\ncorrelation imaging of several objects, including a biological sample (E.\ncardamomum seedpod). Notably, we report an unprecedented detection rate of\nabout 6,300 pairs per hour and the observation of energy anti-correlation for\nthe X-ray photon pairs. We also present a detailed analysis of the properties\nof the down-converted X-ray photons, as well as a comprehensive study of the\ncorrelation imaging formation, including a study of distortions and\ncorrections.

Obtaining kinetic constants in rate laws for nucleation\nand growth of advanced biotherapeutics such as capsids, an assembly of\nmacromolecules, is challenging and essential to the design of the\ncrystallization processes. In this work, coupled population balance and species\nbalance equations are developed to extract nucleation and growth kinetics for\ncrystallization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids. A\ncomparison of model results with that of experimental data for capsid\ncrystallization in hanging-drop vapor diffusion system shows that slow rate of\nvapor diffusion from the droplet controls the initial nucleation and growth\nprocesses, and the capsid nucleation occurs via heterogeneous nucleation in the\nmicrodroplet.

Capids also show a prolonged nucleation period as for proteins\nand other macromolecules, but has a slow growth rate with a growth rate\npre-factor seven orders of magnitude smaller than that of lysozyme. The capsid\ncrystal growth rate is weakly sensitive to the supersaturation compared to\nlysozyme and is limited by the transport of capsids due to slow Brownian motion\nresulting from the very high molecular weight.",

In this\nsense, efforts to approximate the initial quasispecies theory to more realistic\nscenarios have been made in recent decades. Despite this, how time lags in RNA\nsynthesis and periodic fluctuations impact quasispecies dynamics remains poorly\nstudied. In this article, we combine the theory of delayed ordinary\ndifferential equations and topological Leray-Schauder degree to investigate the\nclassical quasispecies model in the single-peak fitness landscape considering\ntime lags and periodic fluctuations in replication. First, we prove that the\ndynamics with time lags under the constant population constraint remains in the\nsimplex in both forward and backward times. With backward mutation and periodic\nfluctuations, we prove the existence of periodic orbits regardless of time\nlags. Nevertheless, without backward mutation, neither periodic fluctuation nor\nthe introduction of time lags leads to periodic orbits. However, in the case of\nperiodic fluctuations, solutions converge exponentially to a periodic\noscillation around the equilibria associated with a constant replication rate.\nWe check the validity of the error catastrophe hypothesis assuming no backward\nmutation; we determine that the error threshold remains sound for the case of\ntime of periodic fitness and time lags with constant fitness.

    "abstract": "Conscious experience permeates our daily lives, yet general consensus on a\ntheory of consciousness remains elusive. In the face of such difficulty, an\nalternative strategy is to address a more general (meta-level) version of the\nproblem for insights into the original problem at hand. Category theory was\ndeveloped for this purpose, i.e. as an axiomatic (meta-)mathematical theory for\ncomparison of mathematical structures, and so affords a (formally) formal\napproach towards a theory of consciousness. In this way, category theory is\nused for comparison with Information Integration Theory (IIT) as a supposed\naxiomatic theory of consciousness, which says that every conscious state\ninvolves six axiomatic properties: the IIT axioms for consciousness. All six\naxioms are shown to follow from the categorical notion of a universal mapping\nproperty: a unique-existence condition for all instances in the domain of\ninterest. Accordingly, this categorical approach affords a formal basis for\nfurther development of a (meta-)mathematical theory of consciousness, whence\nthe slogan, ``Consciousness is a universal property.''",

Needle insertion involves physical and geometrical\nnonlinearities and a complex failure mechanism. To overcome the complexity of\nthe problem, we describe needle insertion as a sharp transition between two\nneedle-specimen configurations, namely \"indentation\" and \"penetration\". The\nsharp configurational change emerges from a mechanical instability and follows\nthe principle of energy minimum. We describe the needle-specimen system in\nterms of the force applied to the back of the needle and the axial displacement\nof the needle tip toward the material. At small needle displacements, the\nenergetically favoured configuration is indentation. Conversely, when the\nneedle displaces beyond a critical threshold, it penetrates the specimen by\nrupturing its surface. This creates a new energetically favoured configuration:\npenetration. Our analysis considers a cylindrical needle with a spherical tip,\nneglects friction and adhesion between the needle and the material, and assumes\nquasi-static conditions. Despite the mathematical simplicity of our analysis,\nour theoretical predictions on the needle insertion force have been validated\nagainst experiments with surprising accuracy.

    "abstract": "Recent research on universal object detection aims to introduce language in a\nSoTA closed-set detector and then generalize the open-set concepts by\nconstructing large-scale (text-region) datasets for training. However, these\nmethods face two main challenges: (i) how to efficiently use the prior\ninformation in the prompts to genericise objects and (ii) how to reduce\nalignment bias in the downstream tasks, both leading to sub-optimal performance\nin some scenarios beyond pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose\na strong universal detection foundation model called CP-DETR, which is\ncompetitive in almost all scenarios, with only one pre-training weight.\nSpecifically, we design an efficient prompt visual hybrid encoder that enhances\nthe information interaction between prompt and visual through scale-by-scale\nand multi-scale fusion modules. Then, the hybrid encoder is facilitated to\nfully utilize the prompted information by prompt multi-label loss and auxiliary\ndetection head. In addition to text prompts, we have designed two practical\nconcept prompt generation methods, visual prompt and optimized prompt, to\nextract abstract concepts through concrete visual examples and stably reduce\nalignment bias in downstream tasks. With these effective designs, CP-DETR\ndemonstrates superior universal detection performance in a broad spectrum of\nscenarios. For example, our Swin-T backbone model achieves 47.6 zero-shot AP on\nLVIS, and the Swin-L backbone model achieves 32.2 zero-shot AP on ODinW35.\nFurthermore, our visual prompt generation method achieves 68.4 AP on COCO val\nby interactive detection, and the optimized prompt achieves 73.1 fully-shot AP\non ODinW13.",

    "abstract": "The production of 225Ac using either a proton or electron accelerator\nrequires a target of 226Ra. Radium metal is difficult to work with and so a\nradium salt, such as radium carbonate, is preferred as a target material.\nNormally available as a powder, the average density of the powder is low and\nthe thermal conductivity is poor, thus limiting the beam power that can be\ndissipated in the target. This work proposes the creation of a solid mixture of\na radium salt powder with a metal matrix. Although aluminum powder has been\nused in similar applications, we suggest that indium powder is good choice for\nthe metal matrix in the case of radioactive radium salts. The target can be\nformed with low die pressure without any need for heating, thus simplifying the\nhot-cell equipment needed for target preparation. We describe how the solid\nmixture can be formed, measure its thermal conductivity and compare the value\nto model estimates. We calculate the yield of 225Ac under different scenarios.\nCalculations show that the radioactive isotopes of indium produced during the\nirradiation should not produce significant handling challenges\npost-irradiation. For the proposed target geometry and beam parameters, thermal\nmodelling indicates that the target temperature will be below the melting point\nof indium and the heat flux from the surfaces will be manageable. Thermal\nresistance at the target interfaces is shown to have a large effect on the\ntarget temperature. Using indium powder to form the mixture, occupying about 40\n% of the target volume, we find that the yield of 225Ac is 80 GBq (2 Ci) for a\n10-day irradiation with a 24 MeV, 3 kW proton beam and approximately the same\nfor three milkings of 225Ra after a 10-day irradiation with a 25 MeV, 20 kW\nelectron beam.",

Owing to these tremendous\npotentials, many big tech companies have released several lightweight Small\nLanguage Models (SLMs) to bridge this gap. However, we still have huge\nmotivations to deploy more powerful (LLMs) AI models on edge devices and\nenhance their smartness level. Unlike the conventional approaches for AI model\ncompression, we investigate activation sparsity. The activation sparsity method\nis orthogonal and combinable with existing techniques to maximize the\ncompression rate while maintaining great accuracy. LLMs' Feed-Forward Network\n(FFN) components, which typically comprise a large proportion of parameters\n(around 2/3), ensure that our FFN optimizations would have a better chance of\nachieving effective compression. Moreover, our findings are beneficial to\ngeneral LLMs and are not restricted to ReLU-based models. This work\nsystematically investigates the tradeoff between enforcing activation sparsity\nand perplexity (accuracy) on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our empirical analysis\ndemonstrates that we can obtain around 50% of main memory and computing\nreductions for critical FFN components with negligible accuracy degradation.\nThis extra 50% sparsity does not naturally exist in the current LLMs, which\nrequire tuning LLMs' activation outputs by injecting zero-enforcing thresholds.\nTo obtain the benefits of activation sparsity, we provide a guideline for the\nsystem architect for LLM prediction and prefetching.

    "abstract": "In randomized trials and observational studies, it is often necessary to\nevaluate the extent to which an intervention affects a time-to-event outcome,\nwhich is only partially observed due to right censoring. For instance, in\ninfectious disease studies, it is frequently of interest to characterize the\nrelationship between risk of acquisition of infection with a pathogen and a\nbiomarker previously measuring for an immune response against that pathogen\ninduced by prior infection and/or vaccination. It is common to conduct\ninference within a causal framework, wherein we desire to make inferences about\nthe counterfactual probability of survival through a given time point, at any\ngiven exposure level. To determine whether a causal effect is present, one can\nassess if this quantity differs by exposure level. Recent work shows that,\nunder typical causal assumptions, summaries of the counterfactual survival\ndistribution are identifiable. Moreover, when the treatment is multi-level,\nthese summaries are also pathwise differentiable in a nonparametric probability\nmodel, making it possible to construct estimators thereof that are unbiased and\napproximately normal. In cases where the treatment is continuous, the target\nestimand is no longer pathwise differentiable, rendering it difficult to\nconstruct well-behaved estimators without strong parametric assumptions. In\nthis work, we extend beyond the traditional setting with multilevel\ninterventions to develop approaches to nonparametric inference with a\ncontinuous exposure. We introduce methods for testing whether the\ncounterfactual probability of survival time by a given time-point remains\nconstant across the range of the continuous exposure levels. The performance of\nour proposed methods is evaluated via numerical studies, and we apply our\nmethod to data from a recent pair of efficacy trials of an HIV monoclonal\nantibody.",

In this regard, graphene emerges as an\nideal candidate for long-distance spin transport owing to its minimal\nspin-orbit coupling, which, however, limits its capacity for effective spin\nmanipulation. This problem can be overcome by putting spin-orbit coupling\nmaterials in close contact to graphene leading to spin-orbit proximity and,\nconsequently, efficient spin-to-charge conversion through mechanisms such as\nthe spin Hall effect. Here, we report and quantify the gate-dependent spin Hall\neffect in trilayer graphene proximitized with tin sulfide (SnS), a group-IV\nmonochalcogenide which has recently been predicted to be a viable alternative\nto transition-metal dichalcogenides for inducing strong spin-orbit coupling in\ngraphene. The spin Hall angle exhibits a maximum around the charge neutrality\npoint of graphene up to room temperature. Our findings expand the library of\nmaterials that induce spin-orbit coupling in graphene to a new class, group-IV\nmonochalcogenides, thereby highlighting the potential of two-dimensional\nmaterials to pave the way for the development of innovative spin-based devices\nand future technological applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have revealed that the rate of convergence of the expected\ntest error in deep supervised learning decays as a function of the intrinsic\ndimension and not the dimension $d$ of the input space. Existing literature\ndefines this intrinsic dimension as the Minkowski dimension or the manifold\ndimension of the support of the underlying probability measures, which often\nresults in sub-optimal rates and unrealistic assumptions. In this paper, we\nconsider supervised deep learning when the response given the explanatory\nvariable is distributed according to an exponential family with a\n$\\beta$-H\\\"older smooth mean function. We consider an entropic notion of the\nintrinsic data-dimension and demonstrate that with $n$ independent and\nidentically distributed samples, the test error scales as\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{2\\beta +\n\\bar{d}_{2\\beta}(\\lambda)}}\\right)$, where $\\bar{d}_{2\\beta}(\\lambda)$ is the\n$2\\beta$-entropic dimension of $\\lambda$, the distribution of the explanatory\nvariables. This improves on the best-known rates. Furthermore, under the\nassumption of an upper-bounded density of the explanatory variables, we\ncharacterize the rate of convergence as $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\nd^{\\frac{2\\lfloor\\beta\\rfloor(\\beta + d)}{2\\beta + d}}n^{-\\frac{2\\beta}{2\\beta\n+ d}}\\right)$, establishing that the dependence on $d$ is not exponential but\nat most polynomial.

However,\ndue to high computational costs, it is challenging to model both aberration and\ndiffraction in light transport for end-to-end optimization of compound optics.\nTherefore, most existing methods compromise physical accuracy by neglecting\nwave optics effects or off-axis aberrations, which raises concerns about the\nrobustness of the resulting designs.

Here we emphasize the growing use of Montage in radio\nastronomy (37 peer-reviewed papers since 2020), and will focus on three\nhigh-profile applications: (1) Analysis of observations made with SKA precursor\nexperiments, such as MeerKAT and the Murchison Wide-field Array, (2) Faraday\ntomography of LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey data (LoTSS-DR2), which explores the\nstructure of the local interstellar medium, and (3) Identification of fast\nradio bursts.",

    "abstract": "We study learning-augmented streaming algorithms for estimating the value of\nMAX-CUT in a graph. In the classical streaming model, while a\n$1/2$-approximation for estimating the value of MAX-CUT can be trivially\nachieved with $O(1)$ words of space, Kapralov and Krachun [STOC'19] showed that\nthis is essentially the best possible: for any $\\epsilon > 0$, any (randomized)\nsingle-pass streaming algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of at\nleast $1/2 + \\epsilon$ requires $\\Omega(n / 2^{\\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon)})$\nspace. We show that it is possible to surpass the $1/2$-approximation barrier\nusing just $O(1)$ words of space by leveraging a (machine learned) oracle.\nSpecifically, we consider streaming algorithms that are equipped with an\n$\\epsilon$-accurate oracle that for each vertex in the graph, returns its\ncorrect label in $\\{-1, +1\\}$, corresponding to an optimal MAX-CUT solution in\nthe graph, with some probability $1/2 + \\epsilon$, and the incorrect label\notherwise. Within this framework, we present a single-pass algorithm that\napproximates the value of MAX-CUT to within a factor of $1/2 +\n\\Omega(\\epsilon^2)$ with probability at least $2/3$ for insertion-only streams,\nusing only $\\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$ words of space. We also extend our\nalgorithm to fully dynamic streams while maintaining a space complexity of\n$\\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon,\\log n)$ words.",

    "abstract": "Accurately measuring the geometry and spatially-varying reflectance of\nreal-world objects is a complex task due to their intricate shapes formed by\nconcave features, hollow engravings and diverse surfaces, resulting in\ninter-reflection and occlusion when photographed. Moreover, issues like lens\nflare and overexposure can arise from interference from secondary reflections\nand limitations of hardware even in professional studios. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach using polarized reflectance field capture and a\ncomprehensive statistical analysis algorithm to obtain highly accurate surface\nnormals (within 0.1mm/px) and spatially-varying reflectance data, including\nalbedo, specular separation, roughness, and anisotropy parameters for realistic\nrendering and analysis. Our algorithm removes image artifacts via analytical\nmodeling and further employs both an initial step and an optimization step\ncomputed on the whole image collection to further enhance the precision of\nper-pixel surface reflectance and normal measurement. We showcase the captured\nshapes and reflectance of diverse objects with a wide material range, spanning\nfrom highly diffuse to highly glossy - a challenge unaddressed by prior\ntechniques. Our approach enhances downstream applications by offering precise\nmeasurements for realistic rendering and provides a valuable training dataset\nfor emerging research in inverse rendering. We will release the polarized\nreflectance fields of several captured objects with this work.",

    "abstract": "Self-organized criticality is a dynamical system property where, without\nexternal tuning, a system naturally evolves towards its critical state,\ncharacterized by scale-invariant patterns and power-law distributions. In this\npaper, we explored a self-organized critical dynamic on the Sierpinski carpet\nlattice, a scale-invariant structure whose dimension is defined as a power-law\nwith a non-integer exponent, i.e. a fractal. To achieve this, we proposed an\nIsing-BCP (bond-correlated percolation) model as the foundation for\ninvestigating critical dynamics. Within this framework, we outlined a feedback\nmechanism for critical self-organization and followed an algorithm for its\nnumerical implementation. The results obtained from the algorithm demonstrated\nenhanced efficiency when driving the Sierpinski carpet towards critical\nself-organization compared to a two-dimensional lattice. This efficiency was\nattributed to the iterative construction of the lattice and the distribution of\nspins within it. The key outcome of our findings is a novel dependence of\nself-organized criticality on topology for this particular model, which may\nhave several applications in fields regarding information transmission.",

We test it in a low-resource visual\nprocessing scenario, in which the agent must learn to recognize distinct types\nof toy truck. The agent starts the learning process with no ontology about what\ntypes of trucks exist nor which parts they have, and a deficient model for\nrecognizing those parts from visual input. The teacher's feedback to the\nagent's explanations addresses its lack of relevant knowledge in the ontology\nvia a generic rule (e.g., \"dump trucks have dumpers\"), whereas an inaccurate\npart recognition is corrected by a deictic statement (e.g., \"this is not a\ndumper\"). The learner utilizes this feedback not only to improve its estimate\nof the hypothesis space of possible domain ontologies and probability\ndistributions over them, but also to use those estimates to update its visual\ninterpretation of the scene.
