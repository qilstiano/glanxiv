    "abstract": "While most ML models expect independent and identically distributed data,\nthis assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios due to distribution\nshifts, resulting in the degradation of machine learning model performance.\nUntil now, no tabular method has consistently outperformed classical supervised\nlearning, which ignores these shifts. To address temporal distribution shifts,\nwe present Drift-Resilient TabPFN, a fresh approach based on In-Context\nLearning with a Prior-Data Fitted Network that learns the learning algorithm\nitself: it accepts the entire training dataset as input and makes predictions\non the test set in a single forward pass. Specifically, it learns to\napproximate Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets drawn from a prior that\nspecifies the model's inductive bias. This prior is based on structural causal\nmodels (SCM), which gradually shift over time. To model shifts of these causal\nmodels, we use a secondary SCM, that specifies changes in the primary model\nparameters. The resulting Drift-Resilient TabPFN can be applied to unseen data,\nruns in seconds on small to moderately sized datasets and needs no\nhyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across 18 synthetic and\nreal-world datasets demonstrate large performance improvements over a wide\nrange of baselines, such as XGB, CatBoost, TabPFN, and applicable methods\nfeatured in the Wild-Time benchmark. Compared to the strongest baselines, it\nimproves accuracy from 0.688 to 0.744 and ROC AUC from 0.786 to 0.832 while\nmaintaining stronger calibration. This approach could serve as significant\ngroundwork for further research on out-of-distribution prediction.",

Consequently, the system is modeled as a massive\nDirac-like field coupled to a two-component vector field $\\mathcal{A}_i$,\nrepresenting the phonon modes.

    "abstract": "Proteins play crucial roles in biological processes, with therapeutic\npeptides emerging as promising pharmaceutical agents. They allow new\npossibilities to leverage target binding sites that were previously\nundruggable. While deep learning (DL) has advanced peptide discovery,\ngenerating D-proteins composed of D-amino acids remains challenging due to the\nscarcity of natural examples. This paper proposes D-Flow, a full-atom\nflow-based framework for {de novo} D-peptide design. D-Flow is conditioned on\nreceptor binding and utilizes a comprehensive representation of peptide\nstructure, incorporating backbone frames, side-chain angles, and discrete amino\nacid types. A mirror-image algorithm is implemented to address the lack of\ntraining data for D-proteins, which converts L-receptors' chirality.\nFurthermore, we enhance D-Flow's capacity by integrating large protein language\nmodels (PLMs) with structural awareness through a lightweight structural\nadapter. A two-stage training pipeline and a controlling toolkit also enable\nD-Flow to transition from general protein design to targeted binder design\nwhile preserving pretraining knowledge.\n  Extensive experimental results on the PepMerge benchmark demonstrate D-Flow's\neffectiveness, particularly in developing peptides with entire D-residues. This\napproach represents a significant advancement in computational D-peptide\ndesign, offering unique opportunities for bioorthogonal and stable molecular\ntools and diagnostics.

    "abstract": "We propose a new method for data visualization based on attraction-repulsion\nswarming (ARS) dynamics, which we call ARS visualization. ARS is a generalized\nframework that is based on viewing the t-distributed stochastic neighbor\nembedding (t-SNE) visualization technique as a swarm of interacting agents\ndriven by attraction and repulsion. Motivated by recent developments in\nswarming, we modify the t-SNE dynamics to include a normalization by the\n\\emph{total influence}, which results in better posed dynamics in which we can\nuse a data size independent time step (of $h=1$) and a simple iteration,\nwithout the need for the array of optimization tricks employed in t-SNE. ARS\nalso includes the ability to separately tune the attraction and repulsion\nkernels, which gives the user control over the tightness within clusters and\nthe spacing between them in the visualization.\n  In contrast with t-SNE, our proposed ARS data visualization method is not\ngradient descent on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be viewed solely\nas an interacting particle system driven by attraction and repulsion forces. We\nprovide theoretical results illustrating how the choice of interaction kernel\naffects the dynamics, and experimental results to validate our method and\ncompare to t-SNE on the MNIST and Cifar-10 data sets.",

Dense 3D mapping involves\nsegmenting and embedding sequential RGBD frames which are then fused into 3D.\nThis leads to redundant computation as the differences between frames are small\nbut all are individually segmented and embedded. This makes dense 3D mapping\nimpractical for research involving embodied agents in which the environment,\nand thus the mapping, must be modified with regularity. VAFS drastically\nreduces this computation by using the segmented point cloud computed by a\nsimulator's physics engine and synthesizing views of each region. This reduces\nthe number of features to embed from the number of captured RGBD frames to the\nnumber of objects in the scene, effectively allowing a \"ground truth\" semantic\nmap to be computed an order of magnitude faster than traditional methods. We\ntest the resulting representation by assessing the IoU scores of semantic\nqueries for different objects in the simulated scene, and find that VAFS\nexceeds the accuracy and speed of prior dense 3D mapping techniques.",

Since DP-SGD processes training data in batches, it\nemploys Poisson sub-sampling to select each batch at every step. However, it\nhas become common practice to replace sub-sampling with shuffling owing to\nbetter compatibility and computational overhead. At the same time, we do not\nknow how to compute tight theoretical guarantees for shuffling; thus, DP\nguarantees of models privately trained with shuffling are often reported as\nthough Poisson sub-sampling was used.\n  This prompts the need to verify whether gaps exist between the theoretical DP\nguarantees reported by state-of-the-art models and their actual leakage. To do\nso, we introduce a novel DP auditing procedure to analyze DP-SGD with shuffling\nand show that DP models trained with this approach have considerably\noverestimated privacy guarantees (up to 4 times).

For the first time, an\nexpanded vessel wall was considered that would give space for implementation of\na physical divertor target structure. The analysis was done for four different\nmagnetic configurations with very different chaotic plasma edges. A resilient\nplasma wall interaction pattern was identified across all configurations. This\nmanifests as qualitatively very similar footprint behavior across the different\nplasma equilibria. Overall, the resilient field lines of interest with high\nconnection length $L_C$ lie within a helical band along the wall for all\nconfigurations. This resiliency can be used to identify the best location of a\ndivertor. The details of the magnetic footprint's resilient helical band is\nsubject to specific field line structures which are linked to the penetration\ndepth of field lines into the plasma and directly influence the heat and\nparticle flux patterns. The differences arising from these details are\ncharacterized by introducing a new metric, the minimum radial connection\n$\\text{min}(\\delta_N)$ of a field line from the last closed flux surface. The\nrelationship, namely the deviation from a scaling law, between\n$\\text{min}(\\delta_N)$ and $L_C$ of the field lines in the plasma edge field\nline behavior suggests that the field lines are associated with structures such\nas resonant islands, cantori, and turnstiles.

Our study\nnot only expands the repertoire of colloid-polymer mixtures to depletion\ninteractions in brushes, but also suggests the brush-induced depletion\ninteraction as a previously unappreciated mechanism for glycocalyx-induced\nprotein cluster formation on cell surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the transformative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)\nacross various natural language tasks, there has been a growing demand to\ndeploy these models effectively across diverse real-world applications and\nplatforms. However, the challenge of efficiently deploying LLMs has become\nincreasingly pronounced due to the varying application-specific performance\nrequirements and the rapid evolution of computational platforms, which feature\ndiverse resource constraints and deployment flows. These varying requirements\nnecessitate LLMs that can adapt their structures (depth and width) for optimal\nefficiency across different platforms and application specifications. To\naddress this critical gap, we propose AmoebaLLM, a novel framework designed to\nenable the instant derivation of LLM subnets of arbitrary shapes, which achieve\nthe accuracy-efficiency frontier and can be extracted immediately after a\none-time fine-tuning. In this way, AmoebaLLM significantly facilitates rapid\ndeployment tailored to various platforms and applications. Specifically,\nAmoebaLLM integrates three innovative components: (1) a knowledge-preserving\nsubnet selection strategy that features a dynamic-programming approach for\ndepth shrinking and an importance-driven method for width shrinking; (2) a\nshape-aware mixture of LoRAs to mitigate gradient conflicts among subnets\nduring fine-tuning; and (3) an in-place distillation scheme with loss-magnitude\nbalancing as the fine-tuning objective. Extensive experiments validate that\nAmoebaLLM not only sets new standards in LLM adaptability but also successfully\ndelivers subnets that achieve state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy and\nefficiency.",

Large Language\nModels (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to mitigate RL sample inefficiency\nand potentially replace human trainers. However, applying LLMs as RL trainers\nis challenging due to their overconfidence and less reliable solutions in\nsequential tasks. We address this limitation by introducing a calibrated\nguidance system that uses Monte Carlo Dropout to enhance LLM advice reliability\nby assessing prediction variances from multiple forward passes. Additionally,\nwe develop a novel RL policy shaping method based on dynamic model average\nentropy to adjust the LLM's influence on RL policies according to guidance\nuncertainty. This approach ensures robust RL training by relying on reliable\nLLM guidance. To validate our contributions, we conduct extensive experiments\nin a Minigrid environment with three goals in varying environment sizes.

Our method relies on the\nestimation of second moments on the image, and the evaluation of how second\nmoments respond to a shear applied to the coordinate system, without altering\nthe image itself, at variance with the Metacalibration method. We also evaluate\nanalytically the noise bias due to the non-linearity of the estimator, and\nconfront it with the bias derived from noisy image simulations, which allows a\nfast and precise noise bias correction.",

The holy grail in the topic\nof monocular global human mesh and motion reconstruction (GHMR) is to achieve\naccuracy on par with traditional multi-view capture on any monocular videos\ncaptured with a dynamic camera, in-the-wild.

The core of our method is to\noptimize the initial motion reconstruction using the MDM prior. This step can\nlead to more globally coherent human motion.

Analyses on learning dynamics\nshow that the shortcut learning generally occurs in the later stage of model\ntraining, and multilingual pretraining accelerates and aggravates the shortcut\nlearning.

We investigate the\nmagnetization dynamics of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ following circularly-polarized\nphotoexcitation with below-gap mid-infrared (mid-IR -- 9 $\\mu m$) and above-gap\nnear-infrared (near-IR -- 1.3 $\\mu m$) pulses. In both cases, we observe\nexcitation of a zone-center coherent magnon mode featuring a 0.5 THz\noscillation in the pump-induced Kerr-rotation signal. However, only below-gap\nexcitation exhibits a helicity dependent response and linear (quadratic)\nscaling of the coherent magnon amplitude with excitation fluence (electric\nfield). Moreover, below-gap excitation has a magnon generation efficiency that\nis at least two orders of magnitude greater in comparison to above-gap\nexcitation. Our analysis indicates that the helicity dependence and enhanced\ngeneration efficiency arises from a unique one-photon two-magnon coupling\nmechanism for magnon generation. Thus, preferential spin-photon coupling\nwithout photoexcitation of electrons permits extremely efficient magnon\ngeneration. Our results reveal new possibilities for ultrafast control of\nantiferromagnets.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced the integration of\nvisual and linguistic modalities, establishing themselves as the dominant\nparadigm for visual-language tasks. Current approaches like chain of thought\n(CoT) reasoning have augmented the cognitive capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs), yet their adaptation to MLLMs is hindered by heightened risks of\nhallucination in cross-modality comprehension. In this paper, we find that the\nthinking while looking paradigm in current multimodal CoT approaches--where\nreasoning chains are generated alongside visual input--fails to mitigate\nhallucinations caused by misleading images. To address these limitations, we\npropose the Visual Inference Chain (VIC) framework, a novel approach that\nconstructs reasoning chains using textual context alone before introducing\nvisual input, effectively reducing cross-modal biases and enhancing multimodal\nreasoning accuracy. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that VIC\nsignificantly improves zero-shot performance across various vision-related\ntasks, mitigating hallucinations while refining the reasoning capabilities of\nMLLMs. Our code repository can be found at\nhttps://github.com/Terry-Xu-666/visual_inference_chain.",

Conceptually, tenure\nsystems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers;\na dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low\noutput after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured\nindividuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven\ndifferent sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at\nan unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15\ndisciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically\nincrease sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure.\nPost-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such\nas biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure,\nwhereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research\noutput typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative\nsearch, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing\ntenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline\nin impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers.\nComparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or\ncomparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research\nsettings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied\nto the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new\nempirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research\ntrajectories, and the shape of scientific output.",

Here, we fit the MIRI spectrum of Gliese 229 Bab with a two-component\nbinary model using the Sonora Elf Owl grid and additionally account for the\nobserved $K$ band flux ratio of the binary brown dwarf. Assuming the two brown\ndwarfs share the same abundances, we obtain $\\rm C/O=0.65\\pm0.05$ and $\\rm\n[M/H]=0.00^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ as their abundances ($2\\sigma$ statistical errors),\nwhich are fully consistent with the host star abundances. We also recover the\nsame abundances if we fit the MIRI spectrum with a single brown dwarf model,\nindicating that binarity does not strongly affect inferred abundances from\nmid-infrared data when the $T_\\rm{eff}$ are similar between components of the\nbinary.

    "abstract": "Patient-centered research is increasingly important in narrowing the gap\nbetween research and patient care, yet incorporating patient perspectives into\nhealth research has been inconsistent. We propose an automated framework\nleveraging innovative natural language processing (NLP) and artificial\nintelligence (AI) with patient portal messages to generate research ideas that\nprioritize important patient issues. We further quantified the quality of\nAI-generated research topics. To define patient clinical concerns, we analyzed\n614,464 patient messages from 25,549 individuals with breast or skin cancer\nobtained from a large academic hospital (2013 to 2024), constructing a 2-staged\nunsupervised NLP topic model. Then, we generated research topics to resolve the\ndefined issues using a widely used AI (ChatGPT-4o, OpenAI Inc, April 2024\nversion) with prompt-engineering strategies. We guided AI to perform\nmulti-level tasks: 1) knowledge interpretation and summarization (e.g.,\ninterpreting and summarizing the NLP-defined topics), 2) knowledge generation\n(e.g., generating research ideas corresponding to patients issues), 3)\nself-reflection and correction (e.g., ensuring and revising the research ideas\nafter searching for scientific articles), and 4) self-reassurance (e.g.,\nconfirming and finalizing the research ideas). Six highly experienced breast\noncologists and dermatologists assessed the significance and novelty of\nAI-generated research topics using a 5-point Likert scale (1-exceptional,\n5-poor). One-third of the AI-suggested research topics were highly significant\nand novel when both scores were lower than the average. Two-thirds of the\nAI-suggested topics were novel in both cancers. Our findings demonstrate that\nAI-generated research topics reflecting patient perspectives via a large volume\nof patient messages can meaningfully guide future directions in\npatient-centered health research.",

    "abstract": "In computer vision tasks, the ability to focus on relevant regions within an\nimage is crucial for improving model performance, particularly when key\nfeatures are small, subtle, or spatially dispersed. Convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) typically treat all regions of an image equally, which can lead\nto inefficient feature extraction. To address this challenge, I have introduced\nVision Eagle Attention, a novel attention mechanism that enhances visual\nfeature extraction using convolutional spatial attention. The model applies\nconvolution to capture local spatial features and generates an attention map\nthat selectively emphasizes the most informative regions of the image. This\nattention mechanism enables the model to focus on discriminative features while\nsuppressing irrelevant background information. I have integrated Vision Eagle\nAttention into a lightweight ResNet-18 architecture, demonstrating that this\ncombination results in an efficient and powerful model. I have evaluated the\nperformance of the proposed model on three widely used benchmark datasets:\nFashionMNIST, Intel Image Classification, and OracleMNIST, with a primary focus\non image classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach\nimproves classification accuracy. Additionally, this method has the potential\nto be extended to other vision tasks, such as object detection, segmentation,\nand visual tracking, offering a computationally efficient solution for a wide\nrange of vision-based applications.

The post-rupture dynamics, from initial hole formation\nto the complete collapse of the film, are crucial because they govern droplet\nformation, which plays a significant role in many applications such as disease\ntransmission, aerosol formation, spray drying nanodrugs, oil spill remediation,\ninkjet printing, and spray coating. While single-hole rupture has been\nextensively studied, the dynamics of multiple-hole ruptures, especially the\ninteractions between neighboring holes, are less well understood. Here, this\nstudy reveals that when two holes 'meet' on a curved film, the film evolves\ninto a spinning twisted ribbon before breaking into droplets, distinctly\ndifferent from what occurs on flat films. We explain the formation and\nevolution of the spinning twisted ribbon, including its geometry, corrugations,\nligaments, and orbits, and compare the experimental observations with models.\nWe compare and contrast this phenomena with its counterpart on planar films.\nWhile our experiments are based on the multiple-hole ruptures in corona splash,\nthe underlying principles are likely applicable to other systems.

Much of this\ncomplexity comes from the existence of multiple tiers and the need to maintain\ncorrespondence between these separate definitions of the language's semantics;\nalso, from the indirect nature of the semantics implicitly encoded in a\ncompiler backend. One way to address this complexity is to automatically\nderive, as much as possible, the compiled code from a single source-of-truth;\nfor example, the interpreter tier. In this work, we introduce a partial\nevaluator that can derive compiled code ``for free'' by specializing an\ninterpreter with its bytecode. This transform operates on the interpreter body\nat a basic-block IR level and is applicable to almost unmodified existing\ninterpreters in systems languages such as C or C++. We show the effectiveness\nof this new tool by applying it to the interpreter tier of an existing\nindustrial JavaScript engine, SpiderMonkey, yielding $2.17\\times$ speedups, and\nthe PUC-Rio Lua interpreter, yielding $1.84\\times$ speedups with only three\nhours' effort.

    "abstract": "Gravitational Wave (GW) signals from Binary Neutron Star (BNS) mergers\nprovide critical insights into the properties of matter under extreme\nconditions. Due to the scarcity of observational data, Numerical Relativity\n(NR) simulations are indispensable for exploring these phenomena. However,\nsimulating BNS mergers is a formidable challenge, and ensuring the consistency,\nreliability or convergence, especially in the post-merger, remains a work in\nprogress. In this paper we assess the performance of current BNS merger\nsimulations by analyzing open-source GW waveforms from five leading NR codes -\nSACRA, BAM, THC, Whisky amd SpEC. We focus on the accuracy of these simulations\nand on the effect of the equation of state (EOS) on waveform predictions. We\nfirst check if different codes give similar results for similar initial data,\nthen apply two methods to calculate convergence and quantify discretization\nerrors. Lastly, we perform a thorough investigation into the effect of tidal\ninteractions on key frequencies in the GW spectrum. We introduce a novel\nquasi-universal relation for the transient post-merger time, enhancing our\nunderstanding of remnant dynamics in this region. This detailed analysis\nclarifies agreements and discrepancies between these leading NR codes, and\nhighlights necessary improvements for the advanced accuracy requirements of\nfuture GW detectors.",

The natural environment is replete with\nphenotypic plasticity, which is the source of inducible defences against\npredators, including concealment, cave-dwelling, mimicry, evasion, and revenge.\nIn this work, a predator-prey model is proposed where the prey species shows\ninducible defence against their predators. The dynamics produce a wide range of\nnon-trivial and impactful results, including the stabilizing effect of the\ndefence mechanism. The model is also analyzed in the presence of\nspatio-temporal diffusion in a bounded domain. It is found in the numerical\nsimulation that the Turing domain shrinks with the increase of defence level.\nThe work is extended further by introducing a nonlocal term in the\nintra-specific competition of the prey species. The Turing instability\ncondition has been studied for the local model around the coexisting steady\nstate, followed by the Turing and non-Turing patterns in the presence of the\nnonlocal interaction term. The work reveals how an increase in inducible\ndefence reduces the Turing domain in the local interaction model but expands it\nwhen the range of nonlocal interactions is extended, suggesting a higher\nlikelihood of species colonization.",

This\npaper consequently proposes that frontier AI companies build on existing safety\nframeworks by outlining transparent procedures for making decisions about model\naccess, which we term Responsible Access Policies (RAPs). We recommend that, at\na minimum, RAPs should include the following: i) processes for empirically\nevaluating model capabilities given different styles of access, ii) processes\nfor assessing the risk profiles of different categories of user, and iii) clear\nand robust pre-commitments regarding when to grant or revoke specific types of\naccess for particular groups under specified conditions.",

    "abstract": "We show that axion dark matter in the range meV $\\lesssim m_a\\lesssim$ 100\nmeV can incoherently excite phonons in crystal targets with unpolarised nuclear\nspins. This can occur through its coupling to nuclear spins and/or through its\ninduced time-dependent electric dipole moment in nuclei. Due to the random\norientation of the nuclear spins, translation symmetry is broken in the phonon\neffective theory, allowing axion absorption to create phonons with unrestricted\nmomentum. The absorption rate is therefore proportional to the phonon density\nof states, which generically has support across a wide range of energies,\nallowing for a broadband detection scheme.

Although previous research has explored aspects like\nrephrasing prompt contexts, using various prompting techniques (like in-context\nlearning and chain-of-thought), and ordering few-shot examples, our\nunderstanding of LLM sensitivity to prompt templates remains limited.\nTherefore, this paper examines the impact of different prompt templates on LLM\nperformance. We formatted the same contexts into various human-readable\ntemplates, including plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML, and evaluated their\nimpact across tasks like natural language reasoning, code generation, and\ntranslation using OpenAI's GPT models. Experiments show that GPT-3.5-turbo's\nperformance varies by up to 40\\% in a code translation task depending on the\nprompt template, while larger models like GPT-4 are more robust to these\nvariations. Our analysis highlights the need to reconsider the use of fixed\nprompt templates, as different formats can significantly affect model\nperformance.",

These developments\nin turn ushered a wave of research on symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nMore recently, a new wave of non-symbolic AI has emerged with neural Language\nModels (LMs) that exhibit impressive linguistic performance, leading many to\nquestion the older approach and wonder about the the compatibility of\ngenerative AI and generative linguistics. In this paper, we argue that\ngenerative AI is compatible with generative linguistics and reinforces its\nbasic tenets in at least three ways. First, we argue that LMs are formal\ngenerative models as intended originally in Chomsky's work on formal language\ntheory. Second, LMs can help develop a program for discovery procedures as\ndefined by Chomsky's \"Syntactic Structures\". Third, LMs can be a major asset\nfor Chomsky's minimalist approach to Universal Grammar and language\nacquisition.

For decades following the creation of MD,\nsimulations have improved with computing power along the three principal\ndimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal\nscale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have however failed to provide\nstrong scaling for MD as scale-out CPU and GPU platforms that provide\nsubstantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in\ntemporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible\nto direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated\nalgorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency\nchallenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to\nlonger timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader\ncommunity has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and\npotentials.

    "abstract": "The precise characterization and mitigation of systematic effects is one of\nthe biggest roadblocks impeding the detection of the fluctuations of\ncosmological 21cm signals. Missing data in radio cosmological experiments,\noften due to radio frequency interference (RFI), poses a particular challenge\nto power spectrum analysis as it could lead to the ringing of bright foreground\nmodes in Fourier space, heavily contaminating the cosmological signals. Here we\nshow that the problem of missing data becomes even more arduous in the presence\nof systematic effects. Using a realistic numerical simulation, we demonstrate\nthat partially flagged data combined with systematic effects can introduce\nsignificant foreground ringing. We show that such an effect can be mitigated\nthrough inpainting the missing data. We present a rigorous statistical\nframework that incorporates the process of inpainting missing data into a\nquadratic estimator of the 21cm power spectrum. Under this framework, the\nuncertainties associated with our inpainting method and its impact on power\nspectrum statistics can be understood. These results are applied to the latest\nPhase II observations taken by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array,\nforming a crucial component in power spectrum analyses as we move toward\ndetecting 21cm signals in the ever more noisy RFI environment.",

    "abstract": "Optimal Transmission Switching (OTS) problems minimize operational costs\nwhile treating both the transmission line energization statuses and generator\nsetpoints as decision variables. The combination of nonlinearities from an AC\npower flow model and discrete variables associated with line statuses makes\nAC-OTS a computationally challenging Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP).\nTo address these challenges, the DC power flow approximation is often used to\nobtain a DC-OTS formulation expressed as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP).\nHowever, this approximation often leads to suboptimal or infeasible switching\ndecisions when evaluated with an AC power flow model. This paper proposes an\nenhanced DC-OTS formulation that leverages techniques for training machine\nlearning models to optimize the DC power flow model's parameters. By optimally\nselecting parameter values that align flows in the DC power flow model with\napparent power flows -- incorporating both real and reactive components -- from\nAC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solutions, our method more accurately captures line\ncongestion behavior. Integrating these optimized parameters into the DC-OTS\nformulation significantly improves the accuracy of switching decisions and\nreduces discrepancies between DC-OTS and AC-OTS solutions. We compare our\noptimized DC-OTS model against traditional OTS approaches, including DC-OTS,\nLinear Programming AC (LPAC)-OTS, and Quadratic Convex (QC)-OTS. Numerical\nresults show that switching decisions from our model yield better performance\nwhen evaluated using an AC power flow model, with up to $44\\%$ cost reductions\nin some cases.",

In\nsome cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal\nsurface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a\npython's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be\nmodelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge\nnarrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts\nthat reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is\ncomputationally difficult. In this work, we use cryptographic tools related to\na primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop\nconsequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked\ndirectly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual\ninformation between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an\narea difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the\nmutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a\ncheckable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model.

Given that many 6G\nuse cases require both high data rates and strong reliability, robust\ntransmission schemes that achieve high throughput under these challenging\nconditions are essential for the effective use of high-frequency bands.

Thus, connecting the measured PTA GWB spectrum and the\nunderlying physics governing the demographics and dynamics of SMBH-binaries is\nextremely important. Previously, Gaussian processes (GPs) and dense neural\nnetworks have been used to make such a connection by being built as conditional\nemulators; their input is some selected evolution or environmental SMBH-binary\nparameters and their output is the emulated mean and standard deviation of the\nGWB strain ensemble distribution over many Universes. In this paper, we use a\nnormalizing flow (NF) emulator that is trained on the entirety of the GWB\nstrain ensemble distribution, rather than only mean and standard deviation. As\na result, we can predict strain distributions that mirror underlying\nsimulations very closely while also capturing frequency covariances in the\nstrain distributions as well as statistical complexities such as tails,\nnon-Gaussianities, and multimodalities that are otherwise not learnable by\nexisting techniques. In particular, we feature various comparisons between the\nNF-based emulator and the GP approach used extensively in past efforts. Our\nanalyses conclude that the NF-based emulator not only outperforms GPs in the\nease and computational cost of training but also outperforms in the fidelity of\nthe emulated GWB strain ensemble distributions.",

Scaling relations are commonly used to relate global\nasteroseismic properties, the frequency of maximum power $\\nu_{max}$ and the\nlarge frequency separation $\\Delta \\nu$, to stellar properties. Mass, radius,\nand age can then be inferred with the addition of stellar spectroscopy. There\nis excellent agreement between seismic radii and fundamental data on the lower\nred giant branch and red clump. However, the scaling relations appear to\nbreakdown in luminous red giant stars. We attempt to constrain the\ncontributions of the asteroseismic parameters to the observed breakdown. We\ntest the $\\nu_{max}$ and $\\Delta \\nu$ scaling relations separately, by using\nstars of known mass and radius in star clusters and the Milky Way's\nhigh-$\\alpha$ sequence. We find evidence that the $\\Delta \\nu$-scaling relation\ncontributes to the observed breakdown in luminous giants more than the\n$\\nu_{max}$ relation. We test different methods of mapping the observed $\\Delta\n\\nu$ to the mean density via a correction factor, $F_{\\Delta \\nu}$ and find a\n$\\approx 1 - 3\\%$ difference in the radii in the luminous giant regime\ndepending on the technique used to measure $F_{\\Delta \\nu}$. The differences\nbetween the radii inferred by these two techniques are too small on the\nluminous giant branch to account for the inflated seismic radii observed in\nevolved giant stars. Finally, we find that the $F_{\\Delta \\nu}$ correction is\ninsensitive to the adopted mixing length, chosen by calibrating the models to\nobservations of $T_{eff}$.",

However, as we discuss here, current data allow for dark\nmatter models where this is not necessarily true. In particular, if dark matter\nis heavier and more strongly interacting than weakly interacting massive\nparticle dark matter, it could act as ionizing radiation and deposit a\nsignificant amount of radiation energy in all or part of the human population,\nsimilar to or even exceeding the known radiation exposure from other background\nsources. Conversely, the non-observation of such an exposure can be used to\nconstrain this type of heavier and more strongly interacting dark matter. We\nfirst consider the case where dark matter scatters elastically and identify the\nrelevant parameter space in a model-independent way. We also discuss how\nprevious bounds from cosmological probes, as well as atmospheric and\nspace-based detectors, might be avoided, and how a re-analysis of existing\nradiation data, along with a simple experiment monitoring ionizing radiation in\nspace with a lower detection threshold, could help constrain part of this\nparameter space.

Our analysis uncovers distinct dynamical\nphenomena under linearly and circularly polarized pumps. Linearly polarized\npumps induce directional preferences in the rCDWs, accompanied by an\nenhancement in the flat band. Unexpectedly, charge nematicity also emerges and\nreceives maximal enhancement at a resonant pump frequency, which we understand\nwith a Rabi-oscillation-like model. On the other hand, circularly polarized\npumps suppress the rCDWs uniformly and triggers imaginary CDWs (iCDWs) with\ncharge loop currents.

Moreover, our largest model M-VAR-d32\nimpressively registers 1.78 FID on ImageNet 256$\\times$256 and outperforms the\nprior-art autoregressive models LlamaGen/VAR by 0.4/0.19 and popular diffusion\nmodels LDM/DiT by 1.82/0.49, respectively.

Compared to\nthe Katz-Schwartz model, we obtain a significantly more realistic description\nof axial-vector mesons with regard to $f_1$-$f_1'$ mixing and equivalent photon\nrates. Moreover, predictions of the $f_1\\to e^+e^-$ branching ratios are found\nto be in line with a recent phenomenological study. However, pseudoscalar\ntransition form factors compare less well with experiment; in particular the\n$\\pi^0$ transition form factor turns out to be overestimated at moderate\nnon-zero virtuality. For the combined HLBL contribution to the muon $g-2$ from\nthe towers of axial vector mesons and excited pseudoscalars we obtain, however,\na result very close to that of the Katz-Schwartz model.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven modeling for dynamic systems has gained widespread attention in\nrecent years. Its inverse formulation, parameter estimation, aims to infer the\ninherent model parameters from observations. However, parameter degeneracy,\nwhere different combinations of parameters yield the same observable output,\nposes a critical barrier to accurately and uniquely identifying model\nparameters. In the context of WECC composite load model (CLM) in power systems,\nutility practitioners have observed that CLM parameters carefully selected for\none fault event may not perform satisfactorily in another fault. Here, we\ninnovate a joint conditional diffusion model-based inverse problem solver\n(JCDI), that incorporates a joint conditioning architecture with simultaneous\ninputs of multi-event observations to improve parameter generalizability.\nSimulation studies on the WECC CLM show that the proposed JCDI effectively\nreduces uncertainties of degenerate parameters, thus the parameter estimation\nerror is decreased by 42.1% compared to a single-event learning scheme. This\nenables the model to achieve high accuracy in predicting power trajectories\nunder different fault events, including electronic load tripping and motor\nstalling, outperforming standard deep reinforcement learning and supervised\nlearning approaches. We anticipate this work will contribute to mitigating\nparameter degeneracy in system dynamics, providing a general parameter\nestimation framework across various scientific domains.",

The large vacuum window\nis the only optical element in the system at ambient temperature, and therefore\nminimizing loss in the window is crucial for maximizing detector sensitivity.\nThis motivates the use of low-loss polymer materials and a window as thin as\npracticable.

We report on\nthe development of extremely thin composite polyethylene window technology that\nmeets these goals. Two windows have been deployed for two full observing\nseasons on the BICEP3 and BA150 CMB telescopes at the South Pole.

SN~2023adsy, a Type Ia supernova discovered by JWST at z=2.9,\nwas found to be a peculiar event, being extremely red and faint, but showing\nvery similar rest-frame light curve decline rate to the majority of\nlow-redshift SNe Ia. We examine whether the red color and faint peak magnitude\ncould also be explained by significant reddening/extinction due to dust within\nthe host galaxy. We use the light curve fitter SALT3-NIR with templates\nextended to the near-infrared, to re-fit the published NIRCam photometry,\nassuming a \"normal\" SN Ia and Milky-Way dust extinction law. NIRCam photometry\nof the host galaxy taken before the SN discovery is also examined by comparing\nits Spectral Energy Distribution with galaxy templates. The NIRCam photometry\ncan be fit reasonably well with a slowly declining, but otherwise \"normal\" SN\nIa template suffering significant reddening ($E(B-V)_{host} \\gtrsim 0.5$ mag).\nPhotometry of the host galaxy suggests a blue, star-forming galaxy, where the\npresence of significant amount of dust cannot be ruled out. Comparison of the\ninferred luminosity distance with the prediction of the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology\non the Hubble-diagram suggests no significant evolution of the SN Ia peak\nluminosity at z>2 redshifts.

    "abstract": "Quantifying similarities between time series in a meaningful way remains a\nchallenge in time series analysis, despite many advances in the field. Most\nreal-world solutions still rely on a few popular measures, such as Euclidean\nDistance (EuD), Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS), and Dynamic Time Warping\n(DTW). The strengths and weaknesses of these measures have been studied\nextensively, and incremental improvements have been proposed. In this study,\nhowever, we present a different similarity measure that fuses the notion of\nDubuc's variation from fractal analysis with the Intersection-over-Union (IoU)\nmeasure which is widely used in object recognition (also known as the Jaccard\nIndex). In this proof-of-concept paper, we introduce the Multiscale Dubuc\nDistance (MDD) measure and prove that it is a metric, possessing desirable\nproperties such as the triangle inequality. We use 95 datasets from the UCR\nTime Series Classification Archive to compare MDD's performance with EuD, LCSS,\nand DTW. Our experiments show that MDD's overall success, without any\ncase-specific customization, is comparable to DTW with optimized window sizes\nper dataset. We also highlight several datasets where MDD's performance\nimproves significantly when its single parameter is customized. This\ncustomization serves as a powerful tool for gauging MDD's sensitivity to noise.\nLastly, we show that MDD's running time is linear in the length of the time\nseries, which is crucial for real-world applications involving very large\ndatasets.",

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised and\ntraining-free approach based solely on the self-attention of Stable Diffusion.\nWe interpret the self-attention tensor as a Markov transition operator, which\nenables us to iteratively construct a Markov chain. Pixel-wise counting of the\nrequired number of iterations along the Markov chain to reach a relative\nprobability threshold yields a Markov-iteration-map, which we simply call a\nMarkov-map. Compared to the raw attention maps, we show that our proposed\nMarkov-map has less noise, sharper semantic boundaries and more uniform values\nwithin semantically similar regions. We integrate the Markov-map in a simple\nyet effective truncated nearest neighbor framework to obtain interactive point\nprompt based segmentation.

We analyze the nature of\natmospheric oxidation of both niobium and a-tantalum surfaces at time scales\nrelevant to fabrication, from sub-minute to two-week atmospheric exposure,\nemploying a combination of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission\nelectron microscopy to monitor the growth of the surface oxides.

Today,\nsmall-scale demonstrations have become possible for quantum algorithmic\nprimitives on hundreds of physical qubits and proof-of-principle\nerror-correction on a single logical qubit. Nevertheless, despite significant\nprogress and excitement, the path toward a full-stack scalable technology is\nlargely unknown.

These opportunities for research\nand development could unlock certain promising applications, in particular,\nefficient quantum simulation/learning of quantum data generated by natural or\nengineered quantum systems. To estimate the true cost of such promises, we\nprovide a detailed resource and sensitivity analysis for classically hard\nquantum chemistry calculations on surface-code error-corrected quantum\ncomputers given current, target, and desired hardware specifications based on\nsuperconducting qubits, accounting for a realistic distribution of errors.\nFurthermore, we argue that, to tackle industry-scale classical optimization and\nmachine learning problems in a cost-effective manner, heterogeneous\nquantum-probabilistic computing with custom-designed accelerators should be\nconsidered as a complementary path toward scalability.",

ML-based\nreconstructions can deliver clinically acceptable image quality under\nsubstantially accelerated scans. ML-based reconstruction, however, also\nrequires substantial data and computational time to train the neural network,\nwhich is often optimized for a fixed acceleration rate or image contrast. In\npractice, imaging parameters are often tuned to best suit the diagnosis, which\nmay differ from the training data.

In\nthis study, we propose a foundation model that uses adaptive unrolling,\nchannel-shifting, and Pattern and Contrast-Prompt-UNet (PCP-UNet) to tackle the\nproblem. In particular, the undersampled data goes through a different number\nof unrolled iterations according to its acceleration rate. Channel-shifting\nimproves reconstructed data quality. The PCP-UNet is equipped with an image\ncontrast and sampling pattern prompt.

This is the first\nobliquity constraint of a brown dwarf orbiting an M dwarf and the seventh\nobliquity constraint of a brown dwarf overall. We measure a projected obliquity\nof $5^{+11}_{-10}$ degrees and a true obliquity of $14^{+8}_{-7}$ degrees for\nthe system, meaning that the system is well-aligned and that the star is\nrotating very nearly edge-on, with an inclination of $90^o\\,\\pm\\,11^o$. The\nsystem thus follows along with the trends observed in transiting brown dwarfs\naround hotter stars, which typically have low obliquities. The tendency for\nbrown dwarfs to be aligned may point to some enhanced obliquity damping in\nbrown dwarf systems, but there is also a possibility that the LP 261-75 system\nwas simply formed aligned. In addition, we note that the brown dwarf's radius\n($R_C\\,=\\,0.9$ R$_J$) is not consistent with the youth of the system or radius\ntrends observed in other brown dwarfs, indicating that LP 261-75C may have an\nunusual formation history.",

They argue that general\nmanagers systematically overvalue top draft picks, which generate less surplus\nvalue on average than later first-round picks, a phenomenon known as the\nloser's curse. Their conclusion hinges on the assumption that general managers\nshould use expected surplus value as their utility function for evaluating\ndraft picks.

In this paper, we challenge their framework by\nconsidering alternative utility functions, particularly those that emphasize\nthe acquisition of transformational players--those capable of dramatically\nincreasing a team's chances of winning the Super Bowl. Under a decision rule\nthat prioritizes the probability of acquiring elite players, which we construct\nfrom a novel Bayesian hierarchical Beta regression model, general managers'\ndraft trade behavior appears rational rather than systematically flawed.

The distinguishing feature\nof AMMs is that trade prices are determined algorithmically, unlike classical\nlimit order books. Concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMMs) are a major\nclass of AMMs that offer liquidity providers flexibility to decide not only\n\\emph{how much} liquidity to provide, but \\emph{in what ranges of prices} they\nwant the liquidity to be used. This flexibility can complicate strategic\nplanning, since fee rewards are shared among LPs. We formulate and analyze a\ngame theoretic model to study the incentives of LPs in CLMMs. Our main results\nshow that while our original formulation admits multiple Nash equilibria and\nhas complexity quadratic in the number of price ticks in the contract, it can\nbe reduced to a game with a unique Nash equilibrium whose complexity is only\nlinear. We further show that the Nash equilibrium of this simplified game\nfollows a waterfilling strategy, in which low-budget LPs use up their full\nbudget, but rich LPs do not. Finally, by fitting our game model to real-world\nCLMMs, we observe that in liquidity pools with risky assets, LPs adopt\ninvestment strategies far from the Nash equilibrium. Under price uncertainty,\nthey generally invest in fewer and wider price ranges than our analysis\nsuggests, with lower-frequency liquidity updates.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of bounding the posterior distribution of discrete\nprobabilistic programs with unbounded support, loops, and conditioning. Loops\npose the main difficulty in this setting: even if exact Bayesian inference is\npossible, the state of the art requires user-provided loop invariant templates.\nBy contrast, we aim to find guaranteed bounds, which sandwich the true\ndistribution. They are fully automated, applicable to more programs and provide\nmore provable guarantees than approximate sampling-based inference. Since lower\nbounds can be obtained by unrolling loops, the main challenge is upper bounds,\nand we attack it in two ways. The first is called residual mass semantics,\nwhich is a flat bound based on the residual probability mass of a loop. The\napproach is simple, efficient, and has provable guarantees.\n  The main novelty of our work is the second approach, called geometric bound\nsemantics. It operates on a novel family of distributions, called eventually\ngeometric distributions (EGDs), and can bound the distribution of loops with a\nnew form of loop invariants called contraction invariants. The invariant\nsynthesis problem reduces to a system of polynomial inequality constraints,\nwhich is a decidable problem with automated solvers. If a solution exists, it\nyields an exponentially decreasing bound on the whole distribution, and can\ntherefore bound moments and tail asymptotics as well, not just probabilities as\nin the first approach.\n  Both semantics enjoy desirable theoretical properties. In particular, we\nprove soundness and convergence, i.e. the bounds converge to the exact\nposterior as loops are unrolled further. On the practical side, we describe\nDiabolo, a fully-automated implementation of both semantics, and evaluate them\non a variety of benchmarks from the literature, demonstrating their general\napplicability and the utility of the resulting bounds.",

We show that trapping and heating occur simultaneously, at least\nat the stage of a mature bar, that is, some orbits quickly pass through\nvertical resonance while at the same time, a substantial number of orbits\nremains trapped into this stage for a long time. Half of all bar orbits spend\nmore than 2.5 Gyr in vertical resonance over an interval of 4 Gyr.

At the receiver, a\ndecoder performs a machine learning task, specifically for classifying the\nreceived signals. The deep neural networks corresponding to the encoder-decoder\npair are jointly trained, taking both channel and data characteristics into\naccount. Our objective is to achieve high accuracy in completing the underlying\ntask while minimizing the number of channel uses determined by the encoder's\noutput size. To this end, we propose a multi-round, multi-task learning (MRMTL)\napproach for the dynamic update of channel uses in multi-round transmissions.\nThe transmitter incrementally sends an increasing number of encoded samples\nover the channel based on the feedback from the receiver, and the receiver\nutilizes the signals from a previous round to enhance the task performance,\nrather than only considering the latest transmission. This approach employs\nmulti-task learning to jointly optimize accuracy across varying number of\nchannel uses, treating each configuration as a distinct task. By evaluating the\nconfidence of the receiver in task decisions, MRMTL decides on whether to\nallocate additional channel uses in multiple rounds. We characterize both the\naccuracy and the delay (total number of channel uses) of MRMTL, demonstrating\nthat it achieves the accuracy close to that of conventional methods requiring\nlarge numbers of channel uses, but with reduced delay by incorporating signals\nfrom a prior round. We consider the CIFAR-10 dataset, convolutional neural\nnetwork architectures, and AWGN and Rayleigh channel models for performance\nevaluation.

There is a very large literature on\nspatial statistics that attempts to address unmeasured spatial confounding\nbias; most of this literature is not framed in the context of causal inference\nand relies on strict assumptions. In this paper, we introduce a foundational\ninstrumental variables (IV) framework that unites many of the existing\napproaches designed to account for unmeasured spatial confounding bias. Using\nthe newly introduced framework, we show that many existing approaches are in\nfact IV methods, where small-scale variation in exposure is the instrument. By\nmapping each approach to our framework, we explicitly derive its underlying\nassumptions and estimation strategy. We further provide theoretical arguments\nthat enable the IV framework to identify a general class of causal effects,\nincluding the exposure response curve, without assuming a linear outcome model.\nWe apply our methodology to a national data set of 33,255 zip codes to estimate\nthe effect of enforcing air pollution exposure levels below 6-12 $\\mu g/m^3$ on\nall-cause mortality while adjusting for unmeasured spatial confounding.",

    "abstract": "We discuss a prediction of the solar activity on a short time-scale applying\nthe method based on a combination of a nonlinear mean-field dynamo model and\nthe artificial neural network. The artificial neural network which serves as a\ncorrection scheme for the forecast, uses the currently available observational\ndata (e.g., the 13 month running average of the observed solar sunspot numbers)\nand the dynamo model output. The nonlinear mean-field $\\alpha\\,\\Omega$ dynamo\nproduces the large-scale magnetic flux which is redistributed by negative\neffective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) producing sunspots and active\nregions. The nonlinear mean-field dynamo model includes algebraic nonlinearity\n(caused by the feedback of the growing magnetic field on the plasma motion) and\ndynamic nonlinearities (related to the dynamics of the magnetic helicity of\nsmall-scale magnetic field). We compare the forecast errors with a horizon of\n1, 6, 12 and 18 months, for different forecast methods, with the same\ncorrections on the current monthly observations. Our forecast is in good\nagreement with the observed solar activity, the forecast error is almost stably\nsmall over short-medium ranges of forecasting windows. Despite a strong level\nof chaotic component in the solar magnetic activity we present quantitative\nevidence that the solar activity on a short range can be stably well predicted,\nby the joint use of the physically based model with the neural network. This\nresult may have an immediate practical implementation for predictions of\nvarious phenomena of solar activity and other astrophysical processes, so may\nbe of interest to a broad community.",

The\nvariability of gait impairment in MS necessitates the development of a\nnon-invasive, sensitive, and cost-effective tool for quantitative gait\nevaluation. The eGait movement sensor, designed to characterize human gait\nthrough unit quaternion time series (QTS) representing hip rotations, is a\npromising approach. However, the small sample sizes typical of clinical studies\npose challenges for the stability of gait data analysis tools. To address these\nchallenges, this article presents two key scientific contributions. First, a\ncomprehensive framework is proposed for transforming QTS data into a form that\npreserves the essential geometric properties of gait while enabling the use of\nany tabular synthetic data generation method. Second, a synthetic data\ngeneration method is introduced, based on nearest neighbors weighting, which\nproduces high-fidelity synthetic QTS data suitable for small datasets and\nprivate data environments. The effectiveness of the proposed method, is\ndemonstrated through its application to MS gait data, showing very good\nfidelity and respect of the initial geometry of the data.

However,\nachieving such precision is challenging and uncommon, as specific applications\nimpose constraints on the type and geometry of magnetic field sources, limiting\ntheir capabilities.\n  Here, we introduce an approach that leverages machine learning algorithms to\nachieve precise 3D magnetic field control using a hexapole electromagnet that\nis composed of three independent, non-collinear dipole electromagnets.

    "abstract": "Learning from label proportions (LLP), i.e., a challenging weakly-supervised\nlearning task, aims to train a classifier by using bags of instances and the\nproportions of classes within bags, rather than annotated labels for each\ninstance. Beyond the traditional bag-level loss, the mainstream methodology of\nLLP is to incorporate an auxiliary instance-level loss with pseudo-labels\nformed by predictions. Unfortunately, we empirically observed that the\npseudo-labels are are often inaccurate due to over-smoothing, especially for\nthe scenarios with large bag sizes, hurting the classifier induction. To\nalleviate this problem, we suggest a novel LLP method, namely Learning from\nLabel Proportions with Auxiliary High-confident Instance-level Loss\n(L^2P-AHIL). Specifically, we propose a dual entropy-based weight (DEW) method\nto adaptively measure the confidences of pseudo-labels. It simultaneously\nemphasizes accurate predictions at the bag level and avoids overly smoothed\npredictions. We then form high-confident instance-level loss with DEW, and\njointly optimize it with the bag-level loss in a self-training manner. The\nexperimental results on benchmark datasets show that L^2P-AHIL can surpass the\nexisting baseline methods, and the performance gain can be more significant as\nthe bag size increases. The implementation of our method is available at\nhttps://github.com/TianhaoMa5/LLP-AHIL.",

    "abstract": "We examine the role of LIGO-India in facilitating multi-messenger astronomy\nin the era of next generation observatories. A network with two L-shaped Cosmic\nExplorer (CE) detectors and one triangular Einstein Telescope (ET) would\nprecisely localize nearly the entire annual binary neutron star merger\npopulation up to a redshift of 0.5--over 10,000 events would be localized\nwithin $10\\ \\mathrm{deg}^2$, including approximately 150 events within $0.1\\\n\\mathrm{deg}^2$. Luminosity distance would be measured to within 10% for over\n9,000 events and within 1% for $\\sim 100$ events. Surprisingly, replacing the\n20 km CE detector with LIGO-India operating at A$^\\sharp$ sensitivity\n(I$^\\sharp$) yields nearly identical performance. The factor-of-five shorter\narms are offset by a fourfold increase in baseline relative to a second CE in\nthe U.S., preserving localization accuracy, with over 9,000 events within $10\\\n\\mathrm{deg}^2$ and $\\sim 90$ events within $0.1\\ \\mathrm{deg}^2$. This\nconfiguration detects $\\sim 6,000$ events with luminosity distance\nuncertainties under 10%, including $\\sim 50$ events with under 1%. Both\nnetworks provide $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ early-warning detections up to 10 minutes\nbefore merger, with localization areas $\\leq 10\\ \\mathrm{deg}^2$. While\nI$^\\sharp$ enables excellent localization and early warnings, its shorter arms\nand narrower sensitivity band would limit its reach for other science goals,\nsuch as detecting population III binary black hole mergers at $z \\gtrsim 10$,\nneutron star mergers at $z \\sim 2$, or constraining cosmological parameters.",

BiDense incorporates two key techniques: the Distribution-adaptive\nBinarizer (DAB) and the Channel-adaptive Full-precision Bypass (CFB). The DAB\nadaptively calculates thresholds and scaling factors for binarization,\neffectively retaining more information within BNNs. Meanwhile, the CFB\nfacilitates full-precision bypassing for binary convolutional layers undergoing\nvarious channel size transformations, which enhances the propagation of\nreal-valued signals and minimizes information loss. By leveraging these\ntechniques, BiDense preserves more real-valued information, enabling more\naccurate and detailed dense predictions in BNNs.

    "abstract": "We use one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations combined with synthetic\nstellar population models of the Magellanic Clouds to study the onset of\nself-excited pulsation in luminous red giants. By comparing the results with\nOGLE observations in the period-luminosity diagram we are able to link the\ntransition from small-amplitude red giants to semi-regular variables with a\nshift from stochastic driving to self-excited pulsations. This is consistent\nwith previous studies relating this transition with an increase in mass-loss\nrate, dust formation, and the appearance of long secondary periods. The\nluminosity and effective temperature at the onset of pulsation are found to\ndepend on metallicity, hydrogen content, and the adopted mixing length\nparameter. This confirms the role of partial hydrogen ionization in driving the\npulsation, supporting the idea of a heat mechanism similar to that of classical\npulsators. We examine the impact of turbulent viscosity, and find clear\nevidence that it must be adjusted according to the stellar chemical and\nphysical parameters to fully match observations. In order to improve the\npredictive power of pulsation models, the turbulent viscosity and the\ntemperature scale of pulsating red giants must be jointly calibrated. This is\ncritical for model-based studies of the period-luminosity relations of evolved\nstars and to exploit their potential as distance and age indicators, in\nparticular given the sensitivity of the onset of pulsation to the envelope\ncomposition.

Particularly interesting for magnetic-memory applications are thin\nlayers of SCO complexes, where practical magnetic probing techniques are\nrequired. While conventional magnetometry on SCO complexes employs cryogenic\ntemperatures, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are quantum magnetometers that can\noperate at room temperature with high spatial resolution and magnetic-field\nsensitivity. In this work, we apply thin layers of Fe-triazole SCO complexes\ndirectly onto a single-crystal diamond with shallow NV centers working as\nmagnetic sensors and probe the fluctuating magnetic field. Using\ntemperature-dependent NV-center $T_1$ measurements and a widefield technique,\nwe find that the complexes are paramagnetic in the investigated temperature\nrange from 20 {\\deg}C to 80 {\\deg}C. We quantitatively describe the $T_1$ time\nby a model considering the fluctuating magnetic field of the Fe$^{\\mathrm{II}}$\nions. We see signatures of a local change of spin state in the $T_1$\nrelaxometry data, but structural changes in the SCO material dominate the local\nmagnetic environment of the NV centers. Moreover, we conduct a Hahn echo to\nmeasure the $T_2$ time, which contrasts the findings of the $T_1$ times for the\nSCO complexes. We attribute this to different NV detection sensitivities\ntowards Fe$^{\\mathrm{II}}$ and Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$ of the protocols. Our\nresults on the magnetic properties of SCO materials highlight the capabilities\nof the NV center as a susceptible sensor for fluctuating magnetic fields.

    "abstract": "In machine learning (ML), the inference phase is the process of applying\npre-trained models to new, unseen data with the objective of making\npredictions. During the inference phase, end-users interact with ML services to\ngain insights, recommendations, or actions based on the input data. For this\nreason, serving strategies are nowadays crucial for deploying and managing\nmodels in production environments effectively. These strategies ensure that\nmodels are available, scalable, reliable, and performant for real-world\napplications, such as time series forecasting, image classification, natural\nlanguage processing, and so on. In this paper, we evaluate the performances of\nfive widely-used model serving frameworks (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe,\nMLServer, MLflow, and BentoML) under four different scenarios (malware\ndetection, cryptocoin prices forecasting, image classification, and sentiment\nanalysis). We demonstrate that TensorFlow Serving is able to outperform all the\nother frameworks in serving deep learning (DL) models. Moreover, we show that\nDL-specific frameworks (TensorFlow Serving and TorchServe) display\nsignificantly lower latencies than the three general-purpose ML frameworks\n(BentoML, MLFlow, and MLServer).",

    "abstract": "This work introduces B-spline Movement Primitives (BMPs), a new Movement\nPrimitive (MP) variant that leverages B-splines for motion representation.\nB-splines are a well-known concept in motion planning due to their ability to\ngenerate complex, smooth trajectories with only a few control points while\nsatisfying boundary conditions, i.e., passing through a specified desired\nposition with desired velocity. However, current usages of B-splines tend to\nignore the higher-order statistics in trajectory distributions, which limits\ntheir usage in imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where\nmodeling trajectory distribution is essential. In contrast, MPs are commonly\nused in IL and RL for their capacity to capture trajectory likelihoods and\ncorrelations. However, MPs are constrained by their abilities to satisfy\nboundary conditions and usually need extra terms in learning objectives to\nsatisfy velocity constraints. By reformulating B-splines as MPs, represented\nthrough basis functions and weight parameters, BMPs combine the strengths of\nboth approaches, allowing B-splines to capture higher-order statistics while\nretaining their ability to satisfy boundary conditions. Empirical results in IL\nand RL demonstrate that BMPs broaden the applicability of B-splines in robot\nlearning and offer greater expressiveness compared to existing MP variants.",

In particular, this includes\nmodels constructed on general point sets other than the standard Poisson point\nprocess or the Bernoulli-percolated lattice. Moreover, in our setting the\nexistence of an edge may depend not only on the two end vertices but also on a\nsurrounding vertex set and models are included that are not monotone in some of\ntheir parameters. We study the critical annulus-crossing intensity\n$\\widehat{\\lambda}_{c}$, which is smaller or equal to the classical critical\npercolation intensity $\\lambda_{c}$ and derive a condition for\n$\\widehat{\\lambda}_{c}>0$ by relating the crossing of annuli to the occurrence\nof long edges. This condition is sharp for models that have a modicum of\nindependence. In a nutshell, our result states that annuli are either not\ncrossed for small intensities or crossed by a single edge. Our proof rests on a\nmultiscale argument that further allows us to directly describe the decay of\nthe annulus-crossing probability with the decay of long edges probabilities.\n  We apply our result to a number of examples from the literature. Most\nimportantly, we extensively discuss the weight-dependent random connection\nmodel in a generalised version, for which we derive sufficient conditions for\nthe presence or absence of long edges that are typically easy to check.

Existing safe generation methods typically focus on suppressing\ninappropriate content by erasing undesired concepts from visual\nrepresentations, while neglecting to sanitize the textual representation.\nAlthough these methods help mitigate the risk of misuse to some extent, their\nrobustness remains insufficient when dealing with adversarial attacks.\n  Given that semantic consistency between input text and output image is a core\nrequirement of T2I models, we identify that textual representations are likely\nthe primary source of unsafe generation.

Two different excitation geometries\nwere studied: in one case the electric field vector of the linearly polarized\nlaser radiation was parallel to the static magnetic field, whereas in the other\ncase these vectors were perpendicular.

We propose the Probabilistic\nPrior Turbulence Removal Network (PPTRN), which combines probabilistic\ndiffusion-based prior modeling with Transformer-driven feature extraction to\naddress this issue. PPTRN employs a two-stage approach: first, a latent encoder\nand Transformer are jointly trained on clear images to establish robust feature\nrepresentations. Then, a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) models\nprior distributions over latent vectors, guiding the Transformer in capturing\ndiverse feature variations essential for restoration. A key innovation in PPTRN\nis the Probabilistic Prior Driven Cross Attention mechanism, which integrates\nthe DDPM-generated prior with feature embeddings to reduce artifacts and\nenhance spatial coherence.

And, the influence of spin parameter ($a$), charge\n($Q$), and MOG parameter ($\\alpha$) on the observed features of BHs are\ncarefully addressed. Interestingly, as $\\alpha$ increases, the flat edge of the\nBH's shadow gradually becomes more rounded, the size of shadow enlarges, and\nthe deviation rate ($\\delta s$) correspondingly decreases. By tracing the\nphoton around BH, we observe that the trajectory of photon exhibits distortion\nbehavior, i.e., the formation of two \"tails\" near the Einstein ring, which\nelongate as $a$ increases. For the accretion disk, it shows that the inner\nshadow expands with $\\alpha$, while decreases with $Q$. The increase of\n$\\alpha$ exhibits an increasing effect on redshift. At the same parameter\nlevel, $\\alpha$ has a more obvious effect on inner shadow and image of BH by\ncomparing with that of $Q$. Our study implies that both $\\alpha$ and $Q$ have\nrelatively significant effects on the image of the KN-MOG BH with the thin disk\naccretion, but the influence of $\\alpha$ is much greater.

Consistent with prior work, we find that spokes typically appear as\ndark features when the lit side of the rings are viewed at low phase angles,\nand as bright features when the rings are viewed at high phase angles or the\ndark side of the rings are observed. However, we also find examples of spokes\non the dark side of the rings that transition between being brighter and darker\nthan the background ring as they move around the planet. Most interestingly, we\nalso identify spokes that appear to be darker than the background ring near\ntheir center and brighter than the background ring near their edges. These\n\"mixed spokes\" indicate that the particle size distribution can vary spatially\nwithin a spoke. In addition, we document seasonal variations in the overall\nspoke activity over the course of the Cassini mission using statistics derived\nfrom lit-side imaging sequences. These statistics demonstrate that while spokes\ncan be detected over a wide range of solar elevation angles, spoke activity\nincreases dramatically when the Sun is within 10 degrees of the ring plane.",

    "abstract": "The Cavendish torsion balance is the instrument of choice for measuring weak\nforces, such as gravity. Although torsion balances have extremely high\nsensitivity for measuring forces over ranges of a few cm and more, their\ndynamics make it difficult to extend this range to much less than fractions of\nmm. In particular forces such as the Casimir force are usually studied using\natomic force microscopes. We present results of our studies of a simple torsion\nbalance with a 3-wire suspension. This device should be able to maintain\nparallelism between flat plates of areas of a few $\\sim\\mathrm{cm^2}$ at\nseparations of much less of 10's of $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$. In this paper we describe\nour experimental investigation into the coupling of ground tilt to the\ntorsional rotation of the novel device. We show that, like the Cavendish\ntorsion balance, the 3-wire torsion balance is highly insensitive to tilts. We\nalso demonstrate that this tilt sensitivity is itself insensitive to shifts in\nthe centre of mass position of the suspended mass. We discuss simple models of\nthe 3-wire torsion balance that show that it is only the static wire lengths\nthat determine the coupling of tilts and horizontal accelerations. We also\ndiscuss designs of torsion balances where sensitivity and noise rejection to\ntilts are optimised.",

    "abstract": "Understanding of cloud microphysics and the evolution of cloud structures in\nsub-stellar atmospheres remains a key challenge in the JWST era. The abundance\nof new JWST data necessitates models that are suitable for coupling with\nlarge-scale simulations, such as general circulation models (GCMs), in order to\nfully understand and assess the complex feedback effects of clouds on the\natmosphere, and their influence on observed spectral and variability\ncharacteristics. We aim to develop a 2-moment, time-dependent bulk\nmicrophysical cloud model that is suitable for GCMs of sub-stellar atmospheres.\nWe derive a set of moment equations for the particle mass distribution and\ndevelop a microphysical cloud model employing a 2-moment approach. We include\nhomogeneous nucleation, condensation, and collisional microphysical processes\nthat evolve the moments of a particle size distribution in time. We couple our\nnew 2-moment scheme with the Exo-FMS GCM to simulate the evolution of KCl\nclouds for a WISE 0359-54 Y-dwarf parameter regime, and examine the effect of\ncloud opacity on the atmospheric characteristics. Our results show a global KCl\ncloud structure, with a patchy coverage at higher latitudes, as well as an\nequatorial belt region that shows increased particle sizes and variations in\nlongitude. Patchy regions are long lived, being present over many rotations of\nthe brown dwarf. Our synthetic spectra conform well with JWST observations of\nWISE 0359-54, but more cloud opacity is required to dampen the spectral\nfeatures at wavelengths below ~7um. Our GCM shows periodic and sub-rotational\nvariability on the order of 0.5-1% in the Spitzer [3.6] and [4.5] micron bands,\nlower than that observed on other Y-dwarf objects.",

This document presents the\nscientifically relevant sections of our submission, which builds on our prior\nresearch on applying quantum computation to this challenging design problem.\nFor the competition, we expanded our previous work in several significant ways.\nFirst, we incorporated a full set of manufacturing constraints into our\nalgorithmic framework, including those previously established theoretically but\nnot yet demonstrated, thereby aligning our approach more closely with\nreal-world manufacturing demands. We implemented the F-VQE algorithm, which\nenhances the probability shaping of optimal solutions, improving on simpler\nvariational quantum algorithms. Our approach also demonstrates flexibility by\naccommodating diverse objectives as well as finer ply-angle increments\nalongside the previously demonstrated conventional ply angles. Scalability was\ntested using the DMRG algorithm, which, despite limitations in entanglement\nrepresentation, enabled simulations with up to 200 plies. Results were directly\ncompared to conventional stacking sequence retrieval algorithms with DMRG\nshowing high competitiveness. Given DMRG's limited entanglement capabilities,\nit serves as a conservative baseline, suggesting potential for even greater\nperformance on fully realized quantum systems.

Humans generally cooperate\nmore than expected in laboratory settings, showing less cooperation in\nwell-mixed populations but more in fixed networks. In contrast, LLMs tend to\nexhibit greater cooperation in well-mixed settings. This raises a key question:\nAre LLMs about to emulate human behavior in cooperative dilemmas on networks?\nIn this study, we examine networked interactions where agents repeatedly engage\nin the Prisoner's Dilemma within both well-mixed and structured network\nconfigurations, aiming to identify parallels in cooperative behavior between\nLLMs and humans. Our findings indicate critical distinctions: while humans tend\nto cooperate more within structured networks, LLMs display increased\ncooperation mainly in well-mixed environments, with limited adjustment to\nnetworked contexts. Notably, LLM cooperation also varies across model types,\nillustrating the complexities of replicating human-like social adaptability in\nartificial agents.

    "abstract": "With their potential to significantly reduce traffic accidents, enhance road\nsafety, optimize traffic flow, and decrease congestion, autonomous driving\nsystems are a major focus of research and development in recent years. Beyond\nthese immediate benefits, they offer long-term advantages in promoting\nsustainable transportation by reducing emissions and fuel consumption.\nAchieving a high level of autonomy across diverse conditions requires a\ncomprehensive understanding of the environment. This is accomplished by\nprocessing data from sensors such as cameras, radars, and LiDARs through a\nsoftware stack that relies heavily on machine learning algorithms. These ML\nmodels demand significant computational resources and involve large-scale data\nmovement, presenting challenges for hardware to execute them efficiently and at\nhigh speed. In this survey, we first outline and highlight the key components\nof self-driving systems, covering input sensors, commonly used datasets,\nsimulation platforms, and the software architecture. We then explore the\nunderlying hardware platforms that support the execution of these software\nsystems. By presenting a comprehensive view of autonomous driving systems and\ntheir increasing demands, particularly for higher levels of autonomy, we\nanalyze the performance and efficiency of scaled-up off-the-shelf GPU/CPU-based\nsystems, emphasizing the challenges within the computational components.\nThrough examples showcasing the diverse computational and memory requirements\nin the software stack, we demonstrate how more specialized hardware and\nprocessing closer to memory can enable more efficient execution with lower\nlatency. Finally, based on current trends and future demands, we conclude by\nspeculating what a future hardware platform for autonomous driving might look\nlike.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of clock synchronization in a networked system with\narbitrary starts for all nodes. We consider a synchronous network of $n$ nodes,\nwhere each node has a local clock that is an integer counter. Eventually,\nclocks must be all equal and increase by one in each round modulo some period\n$P$. The purpose of this paper is to study whether clock synchronization can be\nachieved with bounded memory, that is every node maintains a number of states\nthat does not depend on the network size. In particular, we are interested in\nclock synchronization algorithms which work in dynamic networks, i.e., tolerate\nthat communication links continuously fail and come-up.\n  We first focus on self-stabilizing solutions for clock synchronization, and\nprove that there is no such algorithm that is bounded memory, even in the case\nof static networks. More precisely, we show a lower bound of $n+1$ states at\neach node required to achieve clock synchronization in static strongly\nconnected networks with at most $n$ nodes, and derive a lower bound of $n-2$\nrounds on synchronization time, in the worst case. We then prove that, when the\nself-stabilizing requirement is removed, the impossibility of clock\nsynchronization with bounded memory still holds in the dynamic setting: every\nsolution for the clock synchronization problem in dynamic networks with at most\n$n$ nodes requires each node to have $\\Omega(\\log n)$ states.",

Neural Network (NN) based cryptography is being\ninvestigated due to its ability to learn and implement random cryptographic\nschemes that may be harder to decipher than human-designed algorithms. NN based\ncryptography may create a new cryptographic scheme that is NN specific and that\nchanges every time the NN is (re)trained. This is attractive since it would\nrequire an adversary to restart its process(es) to learn or break the\ncryptographic scheme every time the NN is (re)trained. Current challenges\nfacing NN-based encryption include additional communication overhead due to\nencoding to correct bit errors, quantizing the continuous-valued output of the\nNN, and enabling One-Time-Pad encryption. With this in mind, the Random\nAdversarial Data Obfuscation Model (RANDOM) Adversarial Neural Cryptography\n(ANC) network is introduced. RANDOM is comprised of three new NN layers: the\n(i) projection layer, (ii) inverse projection layer, and (iii) dot-product\nlayer.

By analyzing a suite of AREPO simulations, this paper\ninvestigates how observables can relate to underlying physical properties to\nderive a more comprehensive picture of the magnetic field's inclination angle\nand strength, specifically in regions where both dust polarization and Zeeman\ndata are available.

The strength of the magnetic field relative\nto turbulence can be estimated by comparing polarization observations to Zeeman\nobservations.

    "abstract": "We consider the Hospitals/Residents (HR) problem in the presence of ties in\npreference lists. Among the three notions of stability, viz. weak, strong, and\nsuper stability, we focus on the notion of strong stability. Strong stability\nhas many desirable properties, both theoretically and practically; however, its\nexistence is not guaranteed. In this paper, our objective is to optimally\nincrease the quotas of hospitals to ensure that a strongly stable matching\nexists in the modified instance. First, we show that if ties are allowed in\nresidents' preference lists, it may not be possible to augment the hospital\nquotas to obtain an instance that admits a strongly stable matching. When\nresidents' preference lists are strict, we explore two natural optimization\ncriteria: (i) minimizing the total capacity increase across all hospitals\n(MINSUM) and (ii) minimizing the maximum capacity increase for any hospital\n(MINMAX). We show that the MINSUM problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm,\nwhereas the MINMAX problem is NP-hard. We prove an analogue of the Rural\nHospitals theorem for the MINSUM problem. When each hospital incurs a cost for\na unit increase in its quota, the MINSUM problem becomes NP-hard, even for 0/1\ncosts. In fact, we show that the problem cannot be approximated to any\nmultiplicative factor. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal\nMINSUM augmentation when a specified subset of edges is required to be included\nin the matching. We show that the MINMAX problem is NP-hard in general. When\nhospital preference lists have ties of length at most $\\ell+1$, we give a\npolynomial-time algorithm that increases each hospital's quota by at most\n$\\ell$. Amongst all instances obtained by at most $\\ell$ augmentations per\nhospital, our algorithm produces a strongly stable matching that is best for\nresidents.",

    "abstract": "Scene graphs have proven to be highly effective for various scene\nunderstanding tasks due to their compact and explicit representation of\nrelational information. However, current methods often overlook the critical\nimportance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point\nclouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when\ndealing with noisy, multi-view data. Furthermore, a major limitation of prior\napproaches is the lack of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent\nrelationships among dynamically evolving entities in a scene. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network\n(TESGNN), consisting of two key components: (1) an Equivariant Scene Graph\nNeural Network (ESGNN), which extracts information from 3D point clouds to\ngenerate scene graph while preserving crucial symmetry properties, and (2) a\nTemporal Graph Matching Network, which fuses scene graphs generated by ESGNN\nacross multiple time sequences into a unified global representation using an\napproximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture TESGNN\noutperforms current state-of-the-art methods in scene graph generation,\nachieving higher accuracy and faster training convergence. Moreover, we show\nthat leveraging the symmetry-preserving property produces a more stable and\naccurate global scene representation compared to existing approaches.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses how to assign a monetary value to scientific\npublications, particularly in the case of multi-author papers arising from\nlarge-scale research collaborations. Contemporary science increasingly relies\non extensive and varied collaborations to tackle global challenges in fields\nsuch as life sciences, climate science, energy, high-energy physics, astronomy,\nand many others. We argue that existing literature fails to address the\ncollaborative nature of research by overlooking the relationship between\ncoauthorship and scientists productivity. Using the Marginal Cost of Production\n(MCP) approach, we first highlight the methodological limitations of ignoring\nthis relationship, then propose a generalised MCP model to value co-authorship.\nAs a case study, we examine High-Energy Physics (HEP) collaborations at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, analysing approximately half a million\nscientific outputs by over 50,000 authors from 1990 to 2021. Our findings\nindicate that collaborative adjustments yield monetary valuations for subsets\nof highly collaborative papers up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than previous\nestimates, with elevated values correlating with high research quality. This\nstudy contributes to the literature on research output evaluation, addressing\ndebates in science policy around assessing research performance and impact. Our\nmethodology is applicable to authorship valuation both within academia and in\nlarge-scale scientific collaborations, fitting diverse research impact\nassessment frameworks or as self-standing procedure. Additionally, we discuss\nthe conditions under which this method may complement survey-based approaches.",

Previous studies indicated that the phase diagram of this system\nincluded extended and disorder-induced localized phases. However, by studying\nthe properties of wave functions, we find that this phase diagram can be\nfurther refined, revealing the existence of a bound phase for the large\npotential amplitude $W$ and noise control parameter $\\alpha$. In the bound\nphase, the wave function cannot extend throughout the entire chain, tails decay\nfaster than exponentially and its distribution expands as the system size\nincreases. By adjusting the potential amplitude to induce a transition from the\nextended phase to the bound phase, we find that bound states coexist with\nextended states in the spectrum. In contrast, when the system transitions from\nthe Anderson localized phase to the bound phase, we do not observe the obvious\ncoexistence of Anderson localized and bound states. Finally, by performing the\ntime evolution, we find that the dynamic transition point of the bound phase is\ninconsistent with the static one for large $\\alpha$.",

    "abstract": "Blind face restoration (BFR) is fundamentally challenged by the extensive\nrange of degradation types and degrees that impact model generalization. Recent\nadvancements in diffusion models have made considerable progress in this field.\nNevertheless, a critical limitation is their lack of awareness of specific\ndegradation, leading to potential issues such as unnatural details and\ninaccurate textures. In this paper, we equip diffusion models with the\ncapability to decouple various degradation as a degradation prompt from\nlow-quality (LQ) face images via unsupervised contrastive learning with\nreconstruction loss, and demonstrate that this capability significantly\nimproves performance, particularly in terms of the naturalness of the restored\nimages. Our novel restoration scheme, named DR-BFR, guides the denoising of\nLatent Diffusion Models (LDM) by incorporating Degradation Representation (DR)\nand content features from LQ images. DR-BFR comprises two modules: 1)\nDegradation Representation Module (DRM): This module extracts degradation\nrepresentation with content-irrelevant features from LQ faces and estimates a\nreasonable distribution in the degradation space through contrastive learning\nand a specially designed LQ reconstruction. 2) Latent Diffusion Restoration\nModule (LDRM): This module perceives both degradation features and content\nfeatures in the latent space, enabling the restoration of high-quality images\nfrom LQ inputs. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DR-BFR\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and\nqualitatively across various datasets. The DR effectively distinguishes between\nvarious degradations in blind face inverse problems and provides a reasonably\npowerful prompt to LDM.",

    "abstract": "Many magnetic white dwarfs exhibit a polarised spectrum that periodically\nvaries as the star rotates because the magnetic field is not symmetric about\nthe rotation axis. In this work, we report the discovery that while weakly\nmagnetic white dwarfs of all ages with M < 1Mo show polarimetric variability\nwith a period between hours and several days, the large majority of magnetic\nwhite dwarfs in the same mass range with cooling ages older than 2 Gyr and\nfield strengths > 10 MG show little or no polarimetric variability. This could\nbe interpreted as extremely slow rotation, but a lack of known white dwarfs\nwith measured periods longer than two weeks means that we do not see white\ndwarfs slowing their rotation. We therefore suggest a different interpretation:\nold strongly magnetic white dwarfs do not vary because their fields are roughly\nsymmetric about the rotation axes. Symmetry may either be a consequence of\nfield evolution or a physical characteristic intrinsic to the way strong fields\nare generated in older stars. Specifically, a strong magnetic field could\ndistort the shape of a star, forcing the principal axis of maximum inertia away\nfrom the spin axis. Eventually, as a result of energy dissipation, the magnetic\naxis will align with the angular momentum axis. We also find that the\nhigher-mass strongly magnetised white dwarfs, which are likely the products of\nthe merging of two white dwarfs, may appear as either polarimetrically variable\nor constant. This may be the symptom of two different formation channels or the\nconsequence of the fact that a dynamo operating during a merger may produce\ndiverse magnetic configurations. Alternatively, the massive white dwarfs with\nconstant polarisation may be rotating with periods much shorter than the\ntypical exposure times of the observations.",

A controlled laboratory study, using a within-subjects design,\nwas conducted to investigate the effects of a customizable augmented table\nsetup and lighting on user experience (UX), perceived waiting time,\npsychological ownership, and social acceptability.

Results\nfrom a paired samples t-test showed a statistically significant effect of table\nsetup and lighting on the pragmatic quality of UX, hedonic quality of UX,\noverall UX, valence, dominance, psychological ownership, and affect.\nFurthermore, table setup had a significant effect on arousal and perceived\nwaiting time. Moreover, table setup significantly affected AR interaction,\nisolation, and safety acceptability, while lighting only affected AR\ninteraction acceptability.

For a number of common rewriting rules\n(which are known to preserve logical equivalence), including rules that allow\nfor the movement of quantifiers, we present an algorithm that, given a positive\nfirst-order sentence $\\phi$, outputs the minimum-width sentence obtainable from\n$\\phi$ via application of these rules.

Although various methods have\nbeen proposed to solve the technical issues of interoperability, such as data\nsharing and data consistency; organizational issues, including data ownership\nand data privacy, remain unresolved to date. These organizational issues\nprevent different stakeholders from sharing their data due to concerns\nregarding losing control of the data. This study proposes a multi-server\ninformation-sharing approach on a private cloud after analyzing the\nrequirements for cross-party collaboration to address the aforementioned issues\nand prepare for massive data handling in the near future. This approach adopts\na global controller to track the location, ownership and privacy of the data,\nwhich are stored in different servers that are controlled by different parties.\nFurthermore, data consistency conventions, parallel sub-model extraction, and\nsub-model integration with model verification are investigated in depth to\nsupport information sharing in a distributed environment and to maintain data\nconsistency. Thus, with this approach, the ownership and privacy of the data\ncan be controlled by its owner while still enabling certain required data to be\nshared with other parties. Application of the multi-server approach for\ninformation interoperability and cross-party collaboration is illustrated using\na real construction project of an airport terminal. Validation shows that the\nproposed approach is feasible for maintaining the ownership and privacy of the\ndata while supporting cross-party data sharing and collaboration at the same\ntime, thus avoiding possible legal problems regarding data copyrights or other\nlegal issues.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized computing in many real-world applications,\narguably due to its remarkable performance and extreme convenience as an\nend-to-end solution. However, deep learning models can be costly to train and\nto use, especially for those large-scale models, making it necessary to\noptimize the original overly complicated models into smaller ones in scenarios\nwith limited resources such as mobile applications or simply for resource\nsaving. The key question in such model optimization is, how can we effectively\nidentify and measure the redundancy in a deep learning model structure. While\nseveral common metrics exist in the popular model optimization techniques to\nmeasure the performance of models after optimization, they are not able to\nquantitatively inform the degree of remaining redundancy. To address the\nproblem, we present a novel testing approach, i.e., RedTest, which proposes a\nnovel testing metric called Model Structural Redundancy Score (MSRS) to\nquantitatively measure the degree of redundancy in a deep learning model\nstructure. We first show that MSRS is effective in both revealing and assessing\nthe redundancy issues in many state-of-the-art models, which urgently calls for\nmodel optimization. Then, we utilize MSRS to assist deep learning model\ndevelopers in two practical application scenarios: 1) in Neural Architecture\nSearch, we design a novel redundancy-aware algorithm to guide the search for\nthe optimal model structure and demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it\nto existing standard NAS practice; 2) in the pruning of large-scale pre-trained\nmodels, we prune the redundant layers of pre-trained models with the guidance\nof layer similarity to derive less redundant ones of much smaller size.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that removing such redundancy has a\nnegligible effect on the model utility.",

While\nthis field has been thoroughly investigated, a clear study on trajectory\neffects is lacking, particularly in the context of inelastic processes at low\nenergies. In this work, we address this gap by solving the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for the electron in a numerical lattice with a coupled\nelectron-nuclear dynamics approach as well as a straight-line trajectory\napproximation for the nuclei to asses trajectory effects on charge exchange and\nenergy loss. The collision dynamics are studied using bare ion projectiles with\ncharge $Z=$1-4 incident on atomic hydrogen in an energy range of 0.1 to 900\nkeV/u. We find that the charge exchange process is trajectory-independent\nwithin the energy range considered, showing excellent agreement with available\nexperimental and theoretical data. However, projectile energy loss exhibits\nstrong trajectory dependence, with the straight-line approximation\noverestimating energy loss at low collision energies due to the forced linear\npath. Our results for electronic stopping cross sections with electron-nuclear\ncoupled trajectories are consistent with the available experimental data at\nhigh collision energies. At low energies, nuclear energy loss becomes\nprominent, driven by polarization effects induced by the ion charge on the\nhydrogen target.

The analysis\nis performed in the very low dielectron invariant mass-squared region between\n$0.0009$ and $0.2615\\,{\\rm GeV}^2\\!/c^4$. The longitudinal polarisation\nfraction of the $\\phi$ meson is measured to be less than $11.5\\%$ at $90\\%$\nconfidence level. The $A_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathcal{R}e C\\!P}$ observable, which is\nrelated to the lepton forward-backward asymmetry, is measured to be $0.116 \\pm\n0.155 \\pm 0.006$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second\nsystematic. The transverse asymmetries, $A_{\\mathrm{T}}^{(2)}$ and\n$A_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\mathcal{I}m C\\!P}$, which are sensitive to the virtual photon\npolarisation, are found to be $-0.045 \\pm 0.235 \\pm 0.014$ and $0.002 \\pm 0.247\n\\pm 0.016$, respectively.

    "abstract": "Tucker tensor decomposition offers a more effective representation for\nmultiway data compared to the widely used PARAFAC model. However, its\nflexibility brings the challenge of selecting the appropriate latent\nmulti-rank. To overcome the issue of pre-selecting the latent multi-rank, we\nintroduce a Bayesian adaptive Tucker decomposition model that infers the\nmulti-rank automatically via an infinite increasing shrinkage prior. The model\nintroduces local sparsity in the core tensor, inducing rich and at the same\ntime parsimonious dependency structures. Posterior inference proceeds via an\nefficient adaptive Gibbs sampler, supporting both continuous and binary data\nand allowing for straightforward missing data imputation when dealing with\nincomplete multiway data. We discuss fundamental properties of the proposed\nmodeling framework, providing theoretical justification. Simulation studies and\napplications to chemometrics and complex ecological data offer compelling\nevidence of its advantages over existing tensor factorization methods.",

    "abstract": "Fixed target experiments where beam electrons are focused upon a thin target\nhave shown great potential for probing new physics, including the sub-GeV dark\nmatter (DM) paradigm. However, a signal in future experiments such as the light\ndark matter experiment (LDMX) would require an independent validation to assert\nits DM origin. To this end, we propose to combine LDMX and next generation DM\ndirect detection (DD) data in a four-step analysis strategy, which we here\nillustrate with Monte Carlo simulations. In the first step, the hypothetical\nLDMX signal (i.e. an excess in the final state electron energy and transverse\nmomentum distributions) is $\\textit{recorded}$. In the second step, a DM DD\nexperiment operates with increasing exposure to test the DM origin of the LDMX\nsignal. Here, LDMX and DD data are simulated. In the third step, a posterior\nprobability density function (pdf) for the DM model parameters is extracted\nfrom the DD data, and used to $\\textit{predict}$ the electron recoil energy and\ntransverse momentum distributions at LDMX. In the last step,\n$\\textit{predicted}$ and $\\textit{recorded}$ electron recoil energy and\ntransverse momentum distributions are compared in a chi-square test. We present\nthe results of this comparison in terms of a threshold exposure that a DD\nexperiment has to operate with to assert whether $\\textit{predicted}$ and\n$\\textit{recorded}$ distributions $\\textit{can}$ be statistically dependent. We\nfind that this threshold exposure grows with the DM particle mass, $m_\\chi$. It\nvaries from 0.012 kg-year for a DM mass of $m_\\chi=4$ MeV to 1 kg-year for\n$m_\\chi=25$ MeV, which is or will soon be within reach.",

The limit cycles of precipitation\nand evaporation that result from TNE have been simulated in 1D models of\ncoronal loops, as well as 2D and 3D models of the solar chromosphere and lower\ncorona. However, a careful study of TNE in the solar wind has not been\nperformed until now. Here we demonstrate that for suitable combinations of\nlocal and global heating rates it is possible for the plasma to exhibit a TNE\ncondition, even in the context of a transonic solar wind with appreciable mass\nand energy fluxes. This implies limits on the amount of foot-point heating that\ncan be withstood under steady-state conditions in the solar wind, and may help\nto explain the variability of solar wind streams that emanate from regions of\nhighly concentrated magnetic flux on the solar surface. The implications of\nthis finding pertain to various sources of high-density solar wind, including\nplumes that form above regions of mixed magnetic polarity in polar coronal\nholes and the slow solar wind (SSW) that emanates from coronal hole boundaries.",

Conventional tomographic\nreconstruction techniques are based on recording a sequence of 3D images that\nrepresent the sample state at different moments in time. This frame-based\napproach limits the temporal resolution compared to dynamic radiography\nexperiments due to the time needed to make CT scans. Moreover, it leads to an\ninflation of the amount of data and thus to costly post-processing computations\nto quantify the dynamic behaviour from the sequence of time frames, hereby\noften ignoring the temporal correlations of the sample structure. Our proposed\n4D $\\mu$CT reconstruction technique, named DYRECT, estimates individual\nattenuation evolution profiles for each position in the sample. This leads to a\nnovel memory-efficient event-based representation of the sample, using as\nlittle as three image volumes: its initial attenuation, its final attenuation\nand the transition times. This third volume represents local events on a\ncontinuous timescale instead of the discrete global time frames. We propose a\nmethod to iteratively reconstruct the transition times and the attenuation\nvolumes. The dynamic reconstruction technique was validated on synthetic ground\ntruth data and experimental data, and was found to effectively pinpoint the\ntransition times in the synthetic dataset with a time resolution corresponding\nto less than a tenth of the amount of projections required to reconstruct\ntraditional $\\mu$CT time frames.",

Globally, hepatitis B is recognized as one of the\nprevailing infectious diseases with a significant impact on human health. In\nspite of being non-infectious in nature, sub-viral particles (SVPs) , composed\nwith mainly viral surface proteins, play critical roles in the persistence and\nprogression of the infection. Although the understanding on the functions of\nthese non-infectious SVPs remains limited and incomplete. In this study, a\nmathematical model is proposed for the first time by incorporating the roles of\nSVPs and including the effects of capsids recycling. The impacts of spatial\nmobility of capsids, viruses, SVPs and antibodies are also taken into account\nin this model. Overall, this model carry unique characteristics in the context\nof this viral infection. This study investigates the changes in the dynamics of\ninfection considering both single-point as well as multi-point infection\ninitial condition. As a result, it is observed that SVPs can significantly\nenhance intracellular viral replication and gene expression by reducing the\nneutralization of virus particles by antibodies. The recycling of capsids\nsubstantially increase the concentration of SVPs. The experiments which are\ncarried out on single-point as well as multi-point infection initial conditions\nshow that if the liver is infected at more than one point, infection propagates\nrapidly.

Theoretically, the\nparticle acceleration mechanisms responsible for blazar emissions and the\nprecise location within the jet where this occurs remain undetermined. This\npaper explores MM emission driven by magnetic reconnection in a blazar jet.\nPrevious studies have shown that reconnection in the magnetically dominated\nregions of these relativistic jets can efficiently accelerate particles to very\nhigh energies (VHE). Assuming that turbulent-driven magnetic reconnection\naccelerates cosmic-ray protons and electrons by a Fermi process, we developed a\nlepto-hadronic radiation model without the influence of external soft-photons\nto explain the 2017 MM flare from TXS 0506+056. In the proposed scenario, the\nemission blob moves downstream in the jet from $\\sim$2 to 4 pc from the central\nengine, which is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $3 \\times 10^{8}$\nM$_\\odot$ launching a jet with $150L_\\mathrm{Edd}$ power. As the blob moves, we\nobserve a sequence of spectral energy distribution (SED) profiles that match\nthe observed arrival of the high energy neutrino and electromagnetic emission\nfrom TXS 0506+056. This arrival coincides with the high state of intermediate\nenergy $\\gamma$-rays ($E \\sim 1 $ GeV) detection, followed by the subsequent\nappearance of the VHE $\\gamma$-ray signal and then no further significant\nneutrino detection.

Previous spike-based 3D reconstruction approaches often employ a\ncasecased pipeline: starting with high-quality image reconstruction from spike\nstreams based on established spike-to-image reconstruction algorithms, then\nprogressing to camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, this\ncascaded approach suffers from substantial cumulative errors, where quality\nlimitations of initial image reconstructions negatively impact pose estimation,\nultimately degrading the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction. To address these\nissues, we propose a synergistic optimization framework, \\textbf{USP-Gaussian},\nthat unifies spike-based image reconstruction, pose correction, and Gaussian\nsplatting into an end-to-end framework.

We\ncompare these to the characteristics of other sources of Earth's magnetic\nfield, and discuss whether it is feasible for the ocean-induced magnetic field\nto be retrieved and routinely monitored from space. We focus on large length\nscales (spherical harmonic degrees up to 30) and periods from one month up to\nfive years. To characterize the expected ocean signal we make use of advanced\nnumerical simulations taking high resolution oceanographic inputs and solve the\nmagnetic induction equation in 3D including galvanic coupling and self\ninduction effects. We find the time-varying ocean-induced signal dominates over\nthe primary source of the internal field, the core dynamo, at high spherical\nharmonic degree with the cross-over taking place at degree 15 to 20 depending\non the considered period. The ionospheric and magnetospheric fields (including\ntheir Earth induced counterparts) have most power on periods shorter than one\nmonth and are expected to be mostly zonal in magnetic coordinates at satellite\naltitude.

    "abstract": "Wasserstein distances form a family of metrics on spaces of probability\nmeasures that have recently seen many applications. However, statistical\nanalysis in these spaces is complex due to the nonlinearity of Wasserstein\nspaces. One potential solution to this problem is Linear Optimal Transport\n(LOT). This method allows one to find a Euclidean embedding, called LOT\nembedding, of measures in some Wasserstein spaces, but some information is lost\nin this embedding. So, to understand whether statistical analysis relying on\nLOT embeddings can make valid inferences about original data, it is helpful to\nquantify how well these embeddings describe that data. To answer this question,\nwe present a decomposition of the Fr\\'echet variance of a set of measures in\nthe 2-Wasserstein space, which allows one to compute the percentage of variance\nexplained by LOT embeddings of those measures. We then extend this\ndecomposition to the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein setting. We also present several\nexperiments that explore the relationship between the dimension of the LOT\nembedding, the percentage of variance explained by the embedding, and the\nclassification accuracy of machine learning classifiers built on the embedded\ndata. We use the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, IMDB-50000 dataset, and\nDiffusion Tensor MRI images for these experiments.

In this\nwork, we present a novel framework that learns manipulation skills from as few\nas 10 demonstrations, yet still generalizes to spatial variants such as\ndifferent initial object positions and camera viewpoints. Our framework\nconsists of two key modules: Semantic Guided Perception (SGP), which constructs\ntask-focused, spatially aware 3D point cloud representations from RGB-D inputs;\nand Spatial Generalized Decision (SGD), an efficient diffusion-based\ndecision-making module that generates actions via denoising. To effectively\nlearn generalization ability from limited data, we introduce a critical\nspatially equivariant training strategy that captures the spatial knowledge\nembedded in expert demonstrations. We validate our framework through extensive\nexperiments on both simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic systems.

In the frequentist approach, we\nhave shown that only reducing the distance between the classical and the\nquantum Fisher information does not necessarily mean that the estimators as\nfunctions of the data deliver an estimate with desirable accuracy, as the\nclassical Fisher information takes small values. We have proposed and\ninvestigated a cost function to account for the maximization of the classical\nFisher information and the minimization of the aforementioned distance.

Traditional methods, which use recurrent\nneural networks to capture temporal patterns, have proven their effectiveness\nbut come with high system complexity and computational demand. Convolutions\ncould offer a more efficient alternative but are limited by their\ncharacteristic of treating all previous frames equally, resulting in poor\ntemporal characterization, and by their local receptive field, limiting the\ncapacity to capture distant correlations among frames. In this paper, we\npropose STLight, a novel method for spatio-temporal learning that relies solely\non channel-wise and depth-wise convolutions as learnable layers. STLight\novercomes the limitations of traditional convolutional approaches by\nrearranging spatial and temporal dimensions together, using a single\nconvolution to mix both types of features into a comprehensive spatio-temporal\npatch representation. This representation is then processed in a purely\nconvolutional framework, capable of focusing simultaneously on the interaction\namong near and distant patches, and subsequently allowing for efficient\nreconstruction of the predicted frames.

Viewing the set\nof premisses as a set of assumptions, however, it is possible to deduce useful\nconclusions from an inconsistent set of premisses. In this paper a logic for\nreasoning with inconsistent knowledge is described. This logic is a\ngeneralization of the work of N. Rescher [15]. In the logic a reliability\nrelation is used to choose between incompatible assumptions. These choices are\nonly made when a contradiction is derived. As long as no contradiction is\nderived, the knowledge is assumed to be consistent. This makes it possible to\ndefine an argumentation-based deduction process for the logic. For the logic a\nsemantics based on the ideas of Y. Shoham [22, 23], is defined. It turns out\nthat the semantics for the logic is a preferential semantics according to the\ndefinition S. Kraus, D.

While significant\nprogress has been made in detecting deepfakes, the simultaneous manipulation of\naudio and visual modalities, sometimes at small parts or in subtle ways,\npresents highly challenging detection scenarios. To address these challenges,\nwe present DiMoDif, an audio-visual deepfake detection framework that leverages\nthe inter-modality differences in machine perception of speech, based on the\nassumption that in real samples -- in contrast to deepfakes -- visual and audio\nsignals coincide in terms of information. DiMoDif leverages features from deep\nnetworks that specialize in visual and audio speech recognition to spot\nframe-level cross-modal incongruities, and in that way to temporally localize\nthe deepfake forgery. To this end, we devise a hierarchical cross-modal fusion\nnetwork, integrating adaptive temporal alignment modules and a learned\ndiscrepancy mapping layer to explicitly model the subtle differences between\nvisual and audio representations. Then, the detection model is optimized\nthrough a composite loss function accounting for frame-level detections and\nfake intervals localization.

    "abstract": "Seamless forecasting that produces warning information at continuum\ntimescales based on only one system is a long-standing pursuit for\nweather-climate service. While the rapid advancement of deep learning has\ninduced revolutionary changes in classical forecasting field, current efforts\nare still focused on building separate AI models for weather and climate\nforecasts. To explore the seamless forecasting ability based on one AI model,\nwe propose FengWu-Weather to Subseasonal (FengWu-W2S), which builds on the\nFengWu global weather forecast model and incorporates an ocean-atmosphere-land\ncoupling structure along with a diverse perturbation strategy. FengWu-W2S can\ngenerate 6-hourly atmosphere forecasts extending up to 42 days through an\nautoregressive and seamless manner. Our hindcast results demonstrate that\nFengWu-W2S reliably predicts atmospheric conditions out to 3-6 weeks ahead,\nenhancing predictive capabilities for global surface air temperature,\nprecipitation, geopotential height and intraseasonal signals such as the\nMadden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Moreover,\nour ablation experiments on forecast error growth from daily to seasonal\ntimescales reveal potential pathways for developing AI-based integrated system\nfor seamless weather-climate forecasting in the future.",

In addition,\nconductors are glossy, which may cause strong specular reflection and is hard\nto reconstruct. To solve the above issues, we propose NeISF++, an inverse\nrendering pipeline that supports conductors and dielectrics.

A key challenge of try-on is to\ngenerate realistic images of the model wearing the garments while preserving\nthe details of the garments. Previous methods focus on masking certain parts of\nthe original model's standing image, and then inpainting on masked areas to\ngenerate realistic images of the model wearing corresponding reference\ngarments, which treat the try-on task as an inpainting task. However, such\nimplements require the user to provide a complete, high-quality standing image,\nwhich is user-unfriendly in practical applications. In this paper, we propose\nTry-On-Adapter (TOA), an outpainting paradigm that differs from the existing\ninpainting paradigm. Our TOA can preserve the given face and garment, naturally\nimagine the rest parts of the image, and provide flexible control ability with\nvarious conditions, e.g., garment properties and human pose. In the\nexperiments, TOA shows excellent performance on the virtual try-on task even\ngiven relatively low-quality face and garment images in qualitative\ncomparisons.

Traditional SCM relies on human consensus in decision-making to\navoid emergent problems like the bullwhip effect. Some routine consensus\nprocesses, especially those that are time-intensive and costly, can be\nautomated. Existing solutions for automated coordination have faced challenges\ndue to high entry barriers locking out SMEs, limited capabilities, and limited\nadaptability in complex scenarios. However, recent advances in Generative AI,\nparticularly LLMs, show promise in overcoming these barriers. LLMs, trained on\nvast datasets can negotiate, reason, and plan, facilitating near-human-level\nconsensus at scale with minimal entry barriers. In this work, we identify key\nlimitations in existing approaches and propose autonomous LLM agents to address\nthese gaps.

Firstly, according to the input text,\nchatGPT is utilized to produce questions for the generated images.

Our results, perhaps surprisingly, reveal that for MBRL\ncurrent PVRs are not more sample efficient than learning representations from\nscratch, and that they do not generalize better to out-of-distribution (OOD)\nsettings. To explain this, we analyze the quality of the trained dynamics\nmodel.

However despite their high value and public\naccessibility, the protection of the intellectual property of DNNs is still an\nissue and an emerging research field. Recent works have successfully extracted\nfully-connected DNNs using cryptanalytic methods in hard-label settings,\nproving that it was possible to copy a DNN with high fidelity, i.e., high\nsimilitude in the output predictions. However, the current cryptanalytic\nattacks cannot target complex, i.e., not fully connected, DNNs and are limited\nto special cases of neurons present in deep networks.\n  In this work, we introduce a new end-to-end attack framework designed for\nmodel extraction of embedded DNNs with high fidelity. We describe a new\nblack-box side-channel attack which splits the DNN in several linear parts for\nwhich we can perform cryptanalytic extraction and retrieve the weights in\nhard-label settings. With this method, we are able to adapt cryptanalytic\nextraction, for the first time, to non-fully connected DNNs, while maintaining\na high fidelity. We validate our contributions by targeting several\narchitectures implemented on a microcontroller unit, including a Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) of 1.7 million parameters and a shortened MobileNetv1. Our\nframework successfully extracts all of these DNNs with high fidelity (88.4% for\nthe MobileNetv1 and 93.2% for the MLP).

Such defects allow\na specific account or user to disrupt the normal operations of smart contracts,\npotentially causing malfunctions or even complete project shutdowns. Despite\nthe significance of this issue, most current smart contract analyses overlook\ncentralization defects, focusing primarily on other types of defects. To\naddress this gap, our paper introduces six types of centralization defects in\nsmart contracts by manually analyzing 597 Stack Exchange posts and 117 audit\nreports. For each defect, we provide a detailed description and code examples\nto illustrate its characteristics and potential impacts. Additionally, we\nintroduce a tool named CDRipper (Centralization Defects Ripper) designed to\nidentify the defined centralization defects. Specifically, CDRipper constructs\na permission dependency graph (PDG) and extracts the permission dependencies of\nfunctions from the source code of smart contracts. It then detects the\nsensitive operations in functions and identifies centralization defects based\non predefined patterns. We conduct a large-scale experiment using CDRipper on\n244,424 real-world smart contracts and evaluate the results based on a manually\nlabeled dataset. Our findings reveal that 82,446 contracts contain at least one\nof the six centralization defects, with our tool achieving an overall precision\nof 93.7%.",

    "abstract": "Existing Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods achieve remarkable success in\nanalyzing quality for overall image, but few works explore quality analysis for\nRegions of Interest (ROIs). The quality analysis of ROIs can provide\nfine-grained guidance for image quality improvement and is crucial for\nscenarios focusing on region-level quality. This paper proposes a novel\nnetwork, SEAGULL, which can SEe and Assess ROIs quality with GUidance from a\nLarge vision-Language model. SEAGULL incorporates a vision-language model\n(VLM), masks generated by Segment Anything Model (SAM) to specify ROIs, and a\nmeticulously designed Mask-based Feature Extractor (MFE) to extract global and\nlocal tokens for specified ROIs, enabling accurate fine-grained IQA for ROIs.\nMoreover, this paper constructs two ROI-based IQA datasets, SEAGULL-100w and\nSEAGULL-3k, for training and evaluating ROI-based IQA. SEAGULL-100w comprises\nabout 100w synthetic distortion images with 33 million ROIs for pre-training to\nimprove the model's ability of regional quality perception, and SEAGULL-3k\ncontains about 3k authentic distortion ROIs to enhance the model's ability to\nperceive real world distortions. After pre-training on SEAGULL-100w and\nfine-tuning on SEAGULL-3k, SEAGULL shows remarkable performance on fine-grained\nROI quality assessment.

    "abstract": "Near-beta titanium alloys have shown low Young's modulus and good strength,\nmaking them excellent implant candidates. However, their processing using\nthermomechanical routes in single phase beta region results in heterogeneous\nmicrostructures due to high content alloying elements and consequent slow\ndiffusion-controlled processes such as dynamic recovery. This study\ninvestigates the deformation behaviour of a Ti-15Mo alloy through hot\ncompression experiments using a Gleeble 3800 device in the single beta domain\nat strain rates from 0.01 s-1 to 10 s-1, reaching final strains of 0.50 and\n0.85 followed by immediate water quench. The findings show that the material\npresents a low strain rate sensitivity. The flow curves show significant strain\nhardening before reaching a steady-state regime, particularly at high strain\nrates. The strain hardening exponent calculations support the effect of\nmolybdenum on retarding softening mechanisms such as dynamic recovery. Electron\nbackscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements of deformed samples revealed that\ndynamic recovery is the primary restoration mechanism, with continuous and\ngeometric dynamic recrystallisation evidence. Due to the slow restoration\nprocess, we observe the subgrain formation for different deformation\nparameters. Therefore, we introduced an EBSD-based method to quantify dynamic\nrecovery and subgrain size. We concluded that dynamic recovery and dynamic\nrecrystallisation decrease as the strain rate increases with minimal variation\nat higher strain rates.",

BONE provides a common structure to tackle a variety of\nproblems, including online continual learning, prequential forecasting, and\ncontextual bandits. The framework requires specifying three modelling choices:\n(i) a model for measurements (e.g., a neural network), (ii) an auxiliary\nprocess to model non-stationarity (e.g., the time since the last changepoint),\nand (iii) a conditional prior over model parameters (e.g., a multivariate\nGaussian). The framework also requires two algorithmic choices, which we use to\ncarry out approximate inference under this framework: (i) an algorithm to\nestimate beliefs (posterior distribution) about the model parameters given the\nauxiliary variable, and (ii) an algorithm to estimate beliefs about the\nauxiliary variable. We show how the modularity of our framework allows for many\nexisting methods to be reinterpreted as instances of BONE, and it allows us to\npropose new methods.

    "abstract": "The heat exchange fluctuation theorem (XFT) by Jarzynski and W\\'ojcik [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 92, 230602 (2004)] addresses the setting where two systems with\ndifferent temperatures are brought in thermal contact at time $t=0$ and then\ndisconnected at later time $\\tau$. The theorem asserts that the probability of\nan anomalous heat flux (from cold to hot), while nonzero, is exponentially\nsmaller than the probability of the corresponding normal flux (from hot to\ncold). As a result, the average heat flux is always normal. In that way, the\ntheorem demonstrates how irreversible heat transfer, observed on the\nmacroscopic scale, emerges from the underlying reversible dynamics. The XFT was\nproved under the assumption that the coupling work required to connect and then\ndisconnect the systems is small compared to the change of the internal energies\nof the systems. That condition is often valid for macroscopic systems, but may\nbe violated for microscopic ones. We examine the validity of the XFT's\nassumption for a specific model of the Caldeira-Leggett type, where one system\nis a classical harmonic oscillator and the other is a thermal bath comprised of\na large number of oscillators. The coupling between the system and the bath,\nwhich is bilinear, is instantaneously turned on at $t=0$ and off at $t=\\tau$.\nFor that model, we found that the assumption of the XFT can be satisfied only\nfor a rather restricted range of parameters. In general, the work involved in\nthe process is not negligible and the energy exchange may be anomalous in the\nsense that the internal energy of the system, which is initially hotter than\nthe bath, may further increase.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\nhandling long texts and have almost perfect performance in traditional\nretrieval tasks. However, their performance significantly degrades when it\ncomes to numerical calculations in the long-context. Numeric-involved\nlong-context tasks typically cannot be addressed by current LLMs in normal\nsettings due to their inherent limitations in simultaneously handling complex\nand massive information. Some CoT like prompting methods can improve accuracy\nbut demands massive output tokens, which is costly and slow. To address this\nissue, we propose a workflow, which decompose a numeric-involved long-context\ntask into 4 low-level subtasks: judging, extracting and processing with code\nand conclusion. The former 2 subtasks is relatively simple, which allows us to\nuse smaller models for efficiently processing long context. When numerical\ncalculations are required, we use code generated by LLMs to avoid the\ndisadvantage of LLM not being good at calculations. The results in 2\nnumeric-involved long-context benchmarks demonstrate our workflow can not only\nimprove accuracy, but also significantly reduce the cost of API calls.",

However, these methods are insufficient for\nhigh-spatial-resolution short-term nowcasting within 6 hours, which is crucial\nfor warning short-duration, mesoscale and small-scale weather events.\nGeostationary satellite remote sensing provides detailed, high spatio-temporal\nand all-day observations, which can address the above limitations of existing\nmethods. Therefore, this paper proposed an advanced data-driven thermal\ninfrared cloud images forecasting model, \"DaYu.\" Unlike existing data-driven\nweather forecasting models, DaYu is specifically designed for geostationary\nsatellite observations, with a temporal resolution of 0.5 hours and a spatial\nresolution of ${0.05}^\\circ$ $\\times$ ${0.05}^\\circ$. DaYu is based on a\nlarge-scale transformer architecture, which enables it to capture fine-grained\ncloud structures and learn fast-changing spatio-temporal evolution features\neffectively. Moreover, its attention mechanism design achieves a balance in\ncomputational complexity, making it practical for applications. DaYu not only\nachieves accurate forecasts up to 3 hours with a correlation coefficient higher\nthan 0.9, 6 hours higher than 0.8, and 12 hours higher than 0.7, but also\ndetects short-duration, mesoscale, and small-scale weather events with enhanced\ndetail, effectively addressing the shortcomings of existing methods in\nproviding detailed short-term nowcasting within 6 hours.

However, optimally triggering observations of blazar high states can\nbe challenging. Notable examples include identifying a flaring episode in real\ntime and predicting VHE flaring activity based on lower-energy observables. For\nthis purpose, we have developed a novel deep learning analysis framework, based\non data-driven anomaly detection techniques.

Based on unsupervised\nanomaly detection and clustering methods, we differentiate source variability\nfrom noisy background activity, without the need for a labeled training data\nset of flaring states. The framework incorporates measurement uncertainties and\nis robust given data quality challenges, such as varying cadences and\nobservational gaps. We evaluate our approach using both historical data and\nsimulations of blazar light curves in two energy bands, corresponding to\nsources observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and the upcoming\nCherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.

In that case it is known that risk sharing may have a negative effect,\nwhich is sometimes called the nondiversification trap. This phenomenon is well\nknown for infinite mean stable distributions. In a series of recent papers\nsimilar results for infinite mean Pareto and Fr\\'echet distributions have been\nobtained. We further investigate this property by showing that many of these\nresults can be obtained as special cases of a simple result demonstrating that\nthis holds for any distribution that is more skewed than a Cauchy distribution.\nWe also relate this to the situation of deadly catastrophic risks, where we\nassume a positive probability for an infinite value. That case gives a very\nsimple intuition why this phenomenon can occur for such catastrophic risks. We\nalso mention several open problems and conjectures in this context.",

Domain Generalization\n(DG) methods aim to train models on source domains that can generalize to\nunseen target domains. Recently, the segment anything model (SAM) has\ndemonstrated strong generalization capabilities due to its prompt-based design,\nand has gained significant attention in image segmentation tasks. Existing\nSAM-based approaches attempt to address the need for manual prompts by\nintroducing prompt generators that automatically generate these prompts.\nHowever, we argue that auto-generated prompts may not be sufficiently accurate\nunder distribution shifts, potentially leading to incorrect predictions that\nstill require manual verification and correction by clinicians. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a method for 2D medical image segmentation called\nSelf-Correcting SAM (CoSAM). Our approach begins by generating coarse masks\nusing SAM in a prompt-free manner, providing prior prompts for the subsequent\nstages, and eliminating the need for prompt generators. To automatically refine\nthese coarse masks, we introduce a generalized error decoder that simulates the\ncorrection process typically performed by clinicians. Furthermore, we generate\ndiverse prompts as feedback based on the corrected masks, which are used to\niteratively refine the predictions within a self-correcting loop, enhancing the\ngeneralization performance of our model.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyse a misere tree searching game, where players take\nturns to guess vertices in a tree with a secret `poisoned' vertex. After each\nturn, the guessed vertex is removed from the tree and the game continues on the\ncomponent containing the poisoned vertex, and as soon as a player guesses the\npoisoned vertex, they lose. We describe and prove the solution when the game is\nplayed on a path graph, both between two optimal players and between a player\nwho makes their decisions uniformly at random and an opponent who plays to\nexploit this. We show that, with two perfect players, the solution involves\ndifferent guessing strategies depending on the value of n modulo 4. We then\nshow that, with a random and an exploitative player, the probability that the\nexploitative player wins approaches a constant (approximately 0.599) as n\nincreases, and that the vertices one away from the leaves of the path are\nalways optimal guesses for them. We also solve the game played on a star graph,\nand briefly discuss the possibility for extending the analysis to more general\ntrees.",

    "abstract": "Important advances have recently been made in the search for materials with\ncomplex multi-phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective\nstates with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired\nphases are accessed by exploiting light-matter interactions via the imaginary\npart of the dielectric function through above-bandgap or resonant mode\nexcitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes has been\nexperimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the\nresulting atomic excursion has been limited to perturbative levels. Here, this\nchallenge is overcome by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low\nphoton energies well below the bandgap. Using mid-infrared pulses,\nferroelectric reversal is induced in lithium niobate, and the large-amplitude\nmode displacements are characterized through femtosecond stimulated Raman\nscattering and second harmonic generation. This approach, validated by\nfirst-principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden\nphases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy\nlandscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast speeds.",

    "abstract": "The stylization of 3D scenes is an increasingly attractive topic in 3D\nvision. Although image style transfer has been extensively researched with\npromising results, directly applying 2D style transfer methods to 3D scenes\noften fails to preserve the structural and multi-view properties of 3D\nenvironments, resulting in unpleasant distortions in images from different\nviewpoints. To address these issues, we leverage the remarkable generative\nprior of diffusion-based models and propose a novel style transfer method,\nOSDiffST, based on a pre-trained one-step diffusion model (i.e., SD-Turbo) for\nrendering diverse styles in multi-view images of 3D scenes. To efficiently\nadapt the pre-trained model for multi-view style transfer on small datasets, we\nintroduce a vision condition module to extract style information from the\nreference style image to serve as conditional input for the diffusion model and\nemploy LoRA in diffusion model for adaptation. Additionally, we consider color\ndistribution alignment and structural similarity between the stylized and\ncontent images using two specific loss functions. As a result, our method\neffectively preserves the structural information and multi-view consistency in\nstylized images without any 3D information. Experiments show that our method\nsurpasses other promising style transfer methods in synthesizing various styles\nfor multi-view images of 3D scenes. Stylized images from different viewpoints\ngenerated by our method achieve superior visual quality, with better structural\nintegrity and less distortion.

    "abstract": "Generating accurate code review comments remains a significant challenge due\nto the inherently diverse and non-unique nature of the task output. Large\nlanguage models pretrained on both programming and natural language data tend\nto perform well in code-oriented tasks. However, large-scale pretraining is not\nalways feasible due to its environmental impact and project-specific\ngeneralizability issues. In this work, first we fine-tune open-source Large\nlanguage models (LLM) in parameter-efficient, quantized low-rank (QLoRA)\nfashion on consumer-grade hardware to improve review comment generation. Recent\nstudies demonstrate the efficacy of augmenting semantic metadata information\ninto prompts to boost performance in other code-related tasks. To explore this\nin code review activities, we also prompt proprietary, closed-source LLMs\naugmenting the input code patch with function call graphs and code summaries.\nBoth of our strategies improve the review comment generation performance, with\nfunction call graph augmented few-shot prompting on the GPT-3.5 model\nsurpassing the pretrained baseline by around 90% BLEU-4 score on the\nCodeReviewer dataset. Moreover, few-shot prompted Gemini-1.0 Pro, QLoRA\nfine-tuned Code Llama and Llama 3.1 models achieve competitive results (ranging\nfrom 25% to 83% performance improvement) on this task. An additional human\nevaluation study further validates our experimental findings, reflecting\nreal-world developers' perceptions of LLM-generated code review comments based\non relevant qualitative metrics.",

In\nthis work, we apply this method to study the hadronic decay $\\psi(3770)\\to\n\\bar{D}D$ on two CLS $N_\\text{f}=2$ ensembles.

One of the\nchallenges in development of MLPs is the need for a large and diverse training\nset calculated by ab initio methods. This data set should ideally cover the\nentire phase space, while not searching this space using ab initio methods, as\nthis would be counterproductive and generally intractable with respect to\ncomputational time.In this paper, we present the self-learning PI hybrid Monte\nCarlo Method using a mixed ab initio and ML potential (SL-PIHMC-MIX), where the\nmixed potential allows for the study of larger systems and the extension of the\noriginal SL-HMC method [Nagai et al., Phys. Rev. B 102, 041124 (2020)] to PI\nmethods and larger systems. While the MLPs generated by this method can be\ndirectly applied to run long-time ML-PIMD simulations, we demonstrate that\nusing PIHMC-MIX with the trained MLPs allows for an exact reproduction of the\nstructure obtained from ab initio PIMD. Specifically, we find that the\nPIHMC-MIX simulations require only 5,000 evaluations of the 32-bead structure,\ncompared to the 100,000 evaluations needed for the ab initio PIMD result.",

However, when the overall hypothesis is rejected, identifying\nspecific vector components or determining the groups among which differences\nexist requires additional investigations. Conversely, employing multiple\ncontrast tests (MCT) allows conclusions about which components or groups\ncontribute to these differences. However, they come with a trade-off, as MCT\nlose some benefits inherent to quadratic forms. In this paper, we combine both\napproaches to get a quadratic form based multiple contrast test that leverages\nthe advantages of both. To understand its theoretical properties, we\ninvestigate its asymptotic distribution in a semiparametric model. We thereby\nfocus on two common quadratic forms - the Wald-type statistic and the\nAnova-type statistic - although our findings are applicable to any quadratic\nform.\n  Furthermore, we employ Monte-Carlo and resampling techniques to enhance the\ntest's performance in small sample scenarios.

Our method relies on an adiabatic\nevolution in which the initial motional squeezing is adiabatically transferred\ninto collective spin squeezing. In the weak squeezing regime, we show that the\nadiabatic evolution creates a spin-squeezed state, which reduces the quantum\nprojective noise to a sub-shot noise limit. For strong bosonic squeezing we\nfind that the quantum Fisher information follows a super-Heisenberg scaling law\n$\\propto N^{5/2}$ in terms of the number of ions $N$.

    "abstract": "Longitudinal analyses are increasingly used in clinical studies as they allow\nthe study of subtle changes over time within the same subjects. In most of\nthese studies, it is necessary to align all the images studied to a common\nreference by registering them to a template. In the study of white matter using\nthe recently developed fixel-based analysis (FBA) method, this registration is\nimportant, in particular because the fiber bundle cross-section metric is a\ndirect measure of this registration. In the vast majority of longitudinal FBA\nstudies described in the literature, sessions acquired for a same subject are\ndirectly independently registered to the template. However, it has been shown\nin T1-based morphometry that a 2-step registration through an intra-subject\naverage can be advantageous in longitudinal analyses. In this work, we propose\nan implementation of this 2-step registration method in a typical longitudinal\nFBA aimed at investigating the evolution of white matter changes in Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD). We compared at the fixel level the mean absolute effect and\nstandard deviation yielded by this registration method and by a direct\nregistration, as well as the results obtained with each registration method for\nthe study of AD in both fixelwise and tract-based analyses. We found that the\n2-step method reduced the variability of the measurements and thus enhanced\nstatistical power in both types of analyses.",

Traditionally, test cases are ordered based on some\nheuristic and rerun against the version under test with the goal of yielding a\nhigh failure throughput. Almost four decades of TCP research has seen extensive\ncontributions in the light of individual prioritization strategies. However,\ntest case prioritization via preference aggregation has largely been\nunexplored. We envision this methodology as an opportunity to obtain robust\nprioritizations by consolidating multiple standalone ranked lists, i.e.,\nperforming a consensus. In this work, we propose Ensemble Test Prioritization\n(EnTP) as a three stage pipeline involving: (i) ensemble selection, (ii) rank\naggregation, and (iii) test case execution. We evaluate EnTP on 20 open-source\nC projects from the Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository and GitHub\n(totaling: 694,512 SLOC, 280 versions, and 69,305 system level test-cases). We\nemploy an ensemble of 16 standalone prioritization plans, four of which are\nimposed due to respective state-of-the-art approaches. We build EnTP on the\nfoundations of Hansie, an existing framework on consensus prioritization and\nshow that EnTP's diversity based ensemble selection budget of top-75% followed\nby rank aggregation can outperform Hansie, and the employed standalone\nprioritization approaches.",

These methods often struggle with\nissues such as texture-aware maintenance and size-aware fitting, which hinder\ntheir overall effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\ngarment perception enhancement technique, termed FitDiT, designed for\nhigh-fidelity virtual try-on using Diffusion Transformers (DiT) allocating more\nparameters and attention to high-resolution features. First, to further improve\ntexture-aware maintenance, we introduce a garment texture extractor that\nincorporates garment priors evolution to fine-tune garment feature,\nfacilitating to better capture rich details such as stripes, patterns, and\ntext. Additionally, we introduce frequency-domain learning by customizing a\nfrequency distance loss to enhance high-frequency garment details. To tackle\nthe size-aware fitting issue, we employ a dilated-relaxed mask strategy that\nadapts to the correct length of garments, preventing the generation of garments\nthat fill the entire mask area during cross-category try-on. Equipped with the\nabove design, FitDiT surpasses all baselines in both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations. It excels in producing well-fitting garments with\nphotorealistic and intricate details, while also achieving competitive\ninference times of 4.57 seconds for a single 1024x768 image after DiT structure\nslimming, outperforming existing methods.",

In this letter, charm-baryon correlations are measured\nfor the first time by studying the azimuthal-angle difference between charged\nparticles and prompt $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryons produced in pp collisions at\na centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, with the ALICE detector.\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryons are reconstructed at midrapidity ($|y| < 0.5$) in\nthe transverse-momentum interval $3 < p_{\\rm T} < 16$ GeV/$c$, and correlated\nwith charged particles with $p_{\\rm T} > 0.3$ GeV/$c$ and pseudorapidity\n$|\\eta| < 0.8$. For $3< p_{\\rm T}^{\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+},{\\rm D}} <5$ GeV/$c$,\nthe comparison with published measurements of D-meson and charged-particle\ncorrelations in the same collision system hints at a larger number of\nlow-momentum particles associated with $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$-baryon triggers\nthan with D-meson triggers, both in the collinear and opposite directions with\nrespect to the trigger particle. These differences can be quantified by the\ncomparison of the properties of the near- and away-side correlation peaks, and\nare not reproduced by predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators,\ngenerally underpredicting the associated particle yields at $p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm\nassoc}<1$ GeV/$c$. This tension between $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$-baryon and\nD-meson associated peak yields could suggest a modified fragmentation of the\ncharm quark, or a different hadronisation process, when a charm baryon is\nproduced in the final state.",

[Phys. Rev. D 110, L081501\n(2024)]. Within the newly identified class and these two novel subclasses, the\ninnermost small black hole states exhibit a distinct sequence of unstable,\nstable, and stable behaviours, while the outermost large black hole states\ndisplay a uniform pattern of stable behaviours. These classifications indicate\nthermodynamic properties in both the low and high Hawking temperature regimes\nthat are strikingly different from the previously known four topological\nclasses. In particular, we demonstrate that static charged AdS black holes in\ngauged supergravity exhibit an intricate thermodynamic evolution that is\nnotably distinct from that of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS)\nblack hole. From a topological perspective, we emphasize the advantages and\npotential of investigating thermodynamic phase transitions in these black hole\nspacetimes, an area that has been rarely explored in previous research.

Within the interval, multistable states are connected\nthrough multiple hysteresis, called homoclinic snaking. In particular, we\nexplore its mechanism and consider two limiting cases of coupling strength:\nweak (anti-continuum) and strong (continuum) limits. We employ an asymptotic\nand a variational method for the weak and strong coupling limits, respectively,\nto capture the pinning region's width. The width exhibits an algebraic and an\nexponentially small dependence on the coupling constant for the weak and strong\ncoupling, respectively. This finding is supported by both analytical and\nnumerical results, which show excellent agreement. We also consider the\nmodulational instability of spatially uniform solutions.

    "abstract": "The control of large-scale cyber-physical systems requires optimal\ndistributed policies relying solely on limited communication with neighboring\nagents. However, computing stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems while\noptimizing complex costs remains a significant challenge. Neural Networks\n(NNs), known for their expressivity, can be leveraged to parametrize control\npolicies that yield good performance. However, NNs' sensitivity to small input\nchanges poses a risk of destabilizing the closed-loop system. Many existing\napproaches enforce constraints on the controllers' parameter space to guarantee\nclosed-loop stability, leading to computationally expensive optimization\nprocedures. To address these problems, we leverage the framework of\nport-Hamiltonian systems to design continuous-time distributed control policies\nfor nonlinear systems that guarantee closed-loop stability and finite\n$\\mathcal{L}_2$ or incremental $\\mathcal{L}_2$ gains, independent of the\noptimzation parameters of the controllers. This eliminates the need to\nconstrain parameters during optimization, allowing the use of standard\ntechniques such as gradient-based methods. Additionally, we discuss\ndiscretization schemes that preserve the dissipation properties of these\ncontrollers for implementation on embedded systems. The effectiveness of the\nproposed distributed controllers is demonstrated through consensus control of\nnon-holonomic mobile robots subject to collision avoidance and averaged voltage\nregulation with weighted power sharing in DC microgrids.",

However, commercially available energy storage\ndevices are based mainly on critical elements such as Li, Co, Mn, P, Ni, and\ngraphite opening sustainability concerns for the industry and society. Yet,\nthese elements are crucial for both, battery cells as well as for electrode and\nelectrolyte material properties. New research directions point toward the\ndevelopment of materials free of such critical elements, but unfortunately\noften at the price of lower performance. In the present work, we study the\ninterlink between sustainability and properties at both, material and battery\ncell levels of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and Na-ion batteries (SIBs).\nSustainability factors, such as supply and environmental risks, are assessed\nbased on the critical element content in the cells and the individual risks\nassociated with these materials. Although LIB cells exhibit superior energy\ndensity compared to their Na-ion counterparts, their sustainability is\ncompromised by the consumption of Li and graphite. SIBs do not work with\ngraphite-like LIBs due to the difficulty of intercalating Na within the\nstructure of graphite. They work with other carbonaceous materials that can be\nproduced in a sustainable way from biomass. Moreover, the composition of\ncathode materials significantly influences the sustainability of SIBs cells,\nwith cells containing P and V presenting notable supply and environmental\nconcerns. SIBs, with cathodes such as a layered typed Na-metal oxide which\ncontains Ni and Mn as redox centers and anodes such as hard carbon, demonstrate\nexceptional sustainability scores. Their potential energy densities are\nprojected to match that of a LiFePO4 (LFP)-based LIB, making them increasingly\nattractive for commercial applications.",

Due to the NP-hardness of\nSAT, adding constraints to either specify a more precise NP-complete problem or\nto obtain a tractable one helps better understand the complexity class of\nseveral problems. In 1984, Tovey proved that bounded-degree SAT is also\nNP-complete, thereby providing a tool for performing NP-hardness reductions\neven with bounded parameters, when the size of the reduction gadget is a\nfunction of the variable degree. In this work, we initiate a similar study for\nQBF, the quantified version of SAT. We prove that, like SAT, the truth value of\na maximum degree two quantified formula is polynomial-time computable. However,\nsurprisingly, while the truth value of a 3-regular 3-SAT formula can be decided\nin polynomial time, it is PSPACE-complete for a 3-regular QBF formula. A direct\nconsequence of these results is that Avoider-Enforcer and Client-Waiter\npositional games are PSPACE-complete when restricted to bounded-degree\nhypergraphs. To complete the study, we also show that Maker-Breaker and\nMaker-Maker positional games are PSPACE-complete for bounded-degree\nhypergraphs.",

In this work, searches\nfor dark matter annihilations in the Galactic Centre and the Sun with data\nsamples taken with the first configurations of both detectors are presented. No\nsignificant excess over the expected background was found in either of the two\nanalyses.

Dipolar interactions between these\nelectronic states are then translated into effective interactions among ground\nstate atoms. Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate two dressing\nprotocols, in which Rydberg atoms are resonantly excited in a stroboscopic\nfashion. The first one is non-adiabatic, meaning Rydberg states are excited by\nfast pulses. In this case, mechanical forces among Rydberg atoms result in\nelectron-motion coupling, which generates effective multi-body interactions. In\nthe second, adiabatic protocol, Rydberg states are excited by smoothly varying\nlaser pulses. We show that also in this protocol substantial multi-body\ninteractions emerge.",

Through simulations,\npenalized regressions (Lasso, Elasticnet) and algorithm-based methods (neural\nnetwork, support vector machine, super learner) were compared.

In contrast,\nalgorithm-based methods, while effective for larger and more complex data\nstructures, underestimated the standard deviation, especially with small sample\nsizes.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a data-driven learning approach that\nutilizes the innate structure of the data to guide the learning process. In\ncontrast to supervised learning, which depends on external labels, SSL utilizes\nthe inherent characteristics of the data to produce its own supervisory signal.\nHowever, one frequent issue with SSL methods is representation collapse, where\nthe model outputs a constant input-invariant feature representation. This issue\nhinders the potential application of SSL methods to new data modalities, as\ntrying to avoid representation collapse wastes researchers' time and effort.\nThis paper introduces a novel SSL algorithm for time-series data called\nPrediction of Functionals from Masked Latents (PFML). Instead of predicting\nmasked input signals or their latent representations directly, PFML operates by\npredicting statistical functionals of the input signal corresponding to masked\nembeddings, given a sequence of unmasked embeddings. The algorithm is designed\nto avoid representation collapse, rendering it straightforwardly applicable to\ndifferent time-series data domains, such as novel sensor modalities in clinical\ndata. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFML through complex, real-life\nclassification tasks across three different data modalities: infant posture and\nmovement classification from multi-sensor inertial measurement unit data,\nemotion recognition from speech data, and sleep stage classification from EEG\ndata. The results show that PFML is superior to a conceptually similar SSL\nmethod and a contrastive learning-based SSL method. Additionally, PFML is on\npar with the current state-of-the-art SSL method, while also being conceptually\nsimpler and without suffering from representation collapse.",

This study reveals that\ninter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation\nperformance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and\nvalue of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment\nAnything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing\ninter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may\ncontain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates\nself-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the\nweight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional\nbranches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic\nrepresentation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks\nto improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch\ncorrelations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves\nsuperior performance across eight benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Jointly optimizing power allocation and device association is crucial in\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) networks to ensure devices achieve their data\nthroughput requirements. Device association, which assigns IoT devices to\nspecific access points (APs), critically impacts resource allocation. Many\nexisting works often assume all data throughput requirements are satisfied,\nwhich is impractical given resource limitations and diverse demands. When\nrequirements cannot be met, the system becomes infeasible, causing congestion\nand degraded performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework\nto enhance IoT system robustness by solving two problems, comprising maximizing\nthe number of satisfied IoT devices and jointly maximizing both the number of\nsatisfied devices and total network throughput. These objectives often conflict\nunder infeasible circumstances, necessitating a careful balance. We thus\npropose a modified branch-and-bound (BB)-based method to solve the first\nproblem. An iterative algorithm is proposed for the second problem that\ngradually increases the number of satisfied IoT devices and improves the total\nnetwork throughput. We employ a logarithmic approximation for a lower bound on\ndata throughput and design a fixed-point algorithm for power allocation,\nfollowed by a coalition game-based method for device association. Numerical\nresults demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, serving fewer\ndevices than the BB-based method but with faster running time and higher total\nthroughput.",

    "abstract": "Depth cameras are an interesting modality for capturing vital signs such as\nrespiratory rate. Plenty approaches exist to extract vital signs in a\ncontrolled setting, but in order to apply them more flexibly for example in\nmulti-camera settings, a simulated environment is needed to generate enough\ndata for training and testing of new algorithms. We show first results of a\n3D-rendering simulation pipeline that focuses on different noise models in\norder to generate realistic, depth-camera based respiratory signals using both\nsynthetic and real respiratory signals as a baseline. While most noise can be\naccurately modelled as Gaussian in this context, we can show that as soon as\nthe available image resolution is too low, the differences between different\nnoise models surface.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a novel approach to Bermudan swaption hedging by\napplying the deep hedging framework to address limitations of traditional\narbitrage-free methods. Conventional methods assume ideal conditions, such as\nzero transaction costs, perfect liquidity, and continuous-time hedging, which\noften differ from real market environments. This discrepancy can lead to\nresidual profit and loss (P&L), resulting in two primary issues. First,\nresidual P&L may prevent achieving the initial model price, especially with\nimproper parameter settings, potentially causing a negative P&L trend and\nsignificant financial impacts. Second, controlling the distribution of residual\nP&L to mitigate downside risk is challenging, as hedged positions may become\ncurve gamma-short, making them vulnerable to large interest rate movements. The\ndeep hedging approach enables flexible selection of convex risk measures and\nhedge strategies, allowing for improved residual P&L management. This study\nalso addresses challenges in applying the deep hedging approach to Bermudan\nswaptions, such as efficient arbitrage-free market scenario generation and\nmanaging early exercise conditions. Additionally, we introduce a unique \"Option\nSpread Hedge\" strategy, which allows for robust hedging and provides intuitive\ninterpretability. Numerical analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach.",

However, in most cases, the accuracy of\nthese approaches is too low for reliable utilization of the automatic labeling,\ntypically in the range of 80-85% accuracy. In this paper, we present and\nvalidate an approach that can greatly improve this accuracy, essentially by\nexamining the confidence that the network has in the generated label as well as\nutilizing a user-defined threshold to reject labels that fall below a chosen\nlevel. We demonstrate that a naive model that produced 86% initial accuracy can\nachieve improved performance - over 95% accuracy (rejecting about 40% of the\nlabels) or over 99% accuracy (rejecting about 65%) by selecting higher\nconfidence thresholds. This gives flexibility to adapt existing models to the\nstatistical requirements of various types of research and has the potential to\nmove these automatic labeling approaches from being unusably inaccurate to\nbeing an invaluable new tool. After validating the approach in a number of\nways, we annotate the reproductive state of a large dataset of over 600,000\nherbarium specimens.

We set out to model it on a\nlonger dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy. Methods:\nThree models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small\nplanet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are\nimplemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of\nposterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic\ncriteria. Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is\nruled out. Achromatic red noise or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best\nfits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the\npresence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions\nwhich allows us to constrain its mass to $\\sim 0.5 M_{\\rm Moon}$ as well as its\ninclination.

Existing adversarial patch methods primarily focus on improving attack\nperformance, but they often produce patches that are easily detectable by\nhumans and struggle to achieve environmental consistency, i.e., blending\npatches into the environment. This paper introduces a novel approach for\ngenerating adversarial patches, which addresses both the visual naturalness and\nenvironmental consistency of the patches. We propose Prompt-Guided\nEnvironmentally Consistent Adversarial Patch (PG-ECAP), a method that aligns\nthe patch with the environment to ensure seamless integration into the\nenvironment. The approach leverages diffusion models to generate patches that\nare both environmental consistency and effective in evading detection. To\nfurther enhance the naturalness and consistency, we introduce two alignment\nlosses: Prompt Alignment Loss and Latent Space Alignment Loss, ensuring that\nthe generated patch maintains its adversarial properties while fitting\nnaturally within its environment. Extensive experiments in both digital and\nphysical domains demonstrate that PG-ECAP outperforms existing methods in\nattack success rate and environmental consistency.",

Our approach is evaluated on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets, with comparisons to conventional data-driven\nmodels such as ResNet. For the synthetic data, 2D domains were generated using\nthree distinct governing equations: the diffusion equation, the\nadvection-diffusion equation, and the Poisson equation.

A common strategy in existing FedDG studies\ninvolves sharing domain-specific knowledge among clients, such as spectrum\ninformation, class prototypes, and data styles. However, this knowledge is\nextracted directly from local client samples, and sharing such sensitive\ninformation poses a potential risk of data leakage, which might not fully meet\nthe requirements of FedDG. In this paper, we introduce prompt learning to adapt\npre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) in the FedDG scenario, and leverage\nlocally learned prompts as a more secure bridge to facilitate knowledge\ntransfer among clients. Specifically, we propose a novel FedDG framework\nthrough Prompt Learning and AggregatioN (PLAN), which comprises two training\nstages to collaboratively generate local prompts and global prompts at each\nfederated round. First, each client performs both text and visual prompt\nlearning using their own data, with local prompts indirectly synchronized by\nregarding the global prompts as a common reference. Second, all domain-specific\nlocal prompts are exchanged among clients and selectively aggregated into the\nglobal prompts using lightweight attention-based aggregators. The global\nprompts are finally applied to adapt VLMs to unseen target domains. As our PLAN\nframework requires training only a limited number of prompts and lightweight\naggregators, it offers notable advantages in computational and communication\nefficiency for FedDG.

Previous methods usually treat multimodal information as equal\nquality and employ symmetric architectures to conduct multimodal fusion.\nHowever, in reality, the quality of different modalities usually varies\nconsiderably, and utilizing a symmetric architecture is difficult to accurately\nrecognize conversational emotions when dealing with uneven modal information.\nFurthermore, fusing multi-modality information in a single granularity may fail\nto adequately integrate modal information, exacerbating the inaccuracy in\nemotion recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Modality Augmented\nTransformer with Hierarchical Variational Distillation, called CMATH, which\nconsists of two major components, i.e., Multimodal Interaction Fusion and\nHierarchical Variational Distillation. The former is comprised of two\nsubmodules, including Modality Reconstruction and Cross-Modality Augmented\nTransformer (CMA-Transformer), where Modality Reconstruction focuses on\nobtaining high-quality compressed representation of each modality, and\nCMA-Transformer adopts an asymmetric fusion strategy which treats one modality\nas the central modality and takes others as auxiliary modalities. The latter\nfirst designs a variational fusion network to fuse the fine-grained\nrepresentations learned by CMA- Transformer into a coarse-grained\nrepresentations. Then, it introduces a hierarchical distillation framework to\nmaintain the consistency between modality representations with different\ngranularities.

For example, it did not pre-train the RL method\n(removing its ability to learn from prior experience), used substantially fewer\ncompute resources (20x fewer RL experience collectors and half as many GPUs),\ndid not train to convergence (standard practice in machine learning), and\nevaluated on test cases that are not representative of modern chips. Recently,\nIgor Markov published a meta-analysis of three papers: our peer-reviewed Nature\npaper, the non-peer-reviewed ISPD paper, and Markov's own unpublished paper\n(though he does not disclose that he co-authored it).

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing - information processing based on untrained recurrent\nneural networks with random connections - is expected to depend on the\nnonlinear properties of the neurons and the resulting oscillatory, chaotic, or\nfixpoint dynamics of the network. However, the required degree of nonlinearity\nand the range of suitable dynamical regimes for a given task are not fully\nunderstood. To clarify these questions, we study the accuracy of a reservoir\ncomputer in artificial classification tasks of varying complexity, while tuning\nthe neuron's degree of nonlinearity and the reservoir's dynamical regime. We\nfind that, even for activation functions with extremely reduced nonlinearity,\nweak recurrent interactions and small input signals, the reservoir is able to\ncompute useful representations, detectable only in higher order principal\ncomponents, that render complex classificiation tasks linearly separable for\nthe readout layer. When increasing the recurrent coupling, the reservoir\ndevelops spontaneous dynamical behavior. Nevertheless, the input-related\ncomputations can 'ride on top' of oscillatory or fixpoint attractors without\nmuch loss of accuracy, whereas chaotic dynamics reduces task performance more\ndrastically. By tuning the system through the full range of dynamical phases,\nwe find that the accuracy peaks both at the oscillatory/chaotic and at the\nchaotic/fixpoint phase boundaries, thus supporting the 'edge of chaos'\nhypothesis. Our results, in particular the robust weakly nonlinear operating\nregime, may offer new perspectives both for technical and biological neural\nnetworks with random connectivity.",

Interestingly, all galaxies found in the group\nare aligned along a straight line in the plane of the sky. The observed spatial\nextent of the member galaxies is 154 kpc, and their relative line-of-sight\nvelocity span is within 75 km s$^{-1}$.

    "abstract": "Determining the creep compliances of orthotropic composite materials requires\nexperiments in at least three different uniaxial and biaxial loading\ndirections. Up to date, data respecting multiple climates and all anatomical\ndirections are sparse for hygro-responsive materials like Norway spruce.\nConsequently, simulation models of wood frequently over-simplify creep, e.g.,\nby proportionally scaling missing components or neglecting climatic influences.\nTo overcome such simplifications, an automated computer-controlled climatized\ncreep rack was developed, that experimentally assesses moisture-dependent\nviscoelasticity and mechanosorption in all anatomical directions. The device\nsimultaneously measures the creep strains of three dogbone tension samples,\nthree flat compression samples, and six Arcan shear samples via Digital Image\nCorrelation. This allows for ascertaining the complete orthotropic compliance\ntensors while accounting for loading direction asymmetries. This paper explains\nthe creep rack's structure and demonstrates its use by determining all nine\nindependent creep compliance components of Norway spruce at 65% relative\nhumidity. The data shows that loading asymmetry effects amount up to 16%.\nFurthermore, the found creep compliance tensor is not proportional to the\nelastic compliance tensor. By clustering the compliance components, we identify\nfour necessary components to represent the full orthotropy of the compliance\ntensor, obtainable from not less than two experiments.",

    "abstract": "Effective usage of approximate circuits for various performance trade-offs\nrequires accurate computation of error. Several average and worst case error\nmetrics have been proposed in the literature. We propose a framework for exact\ncomputation of these error metrics, including the error rate (ER), mean\nabsolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE) and the worst-case error (WCE).\nWe use a combination of SAT and message-passing algorithms. Our algorithm takes\nas input the CNF formula for the exact and approximate circuits followed by a\nsubtractor that finds the difference of the two outputs. This is converted into\na tree, with each vertex of the tree associated with a sub-formulas and all\nsatisfying solutions to it. Once this is done, any probability can be computed\nby setting appropriate error bits and using a message passing algorithm on the\ntree. Since message-passing is fast, besides ER and MAE, computation of metrics\nlike MSE is also very efficient. In fact, it is possible to get the entire\nprobability distribution of the error. Besides standard benchmarks, we could\ncompute the error metrics exactly for approximate Gaussian and Sobel filters,\nwhich has not been done previously.",

This paper presents EveGuard, a\nsoftware-driven defense framework that creates adversarial audio, protecting\nvoice privacy from side channels without compromising human perception. We\nleverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional\nmicrophones, where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record\nchanges in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses.

Second, to\nenable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task\ncalled Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We\nfurther apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for\nEve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a\nprotection rate of more than 97 percent from audio classifiers and\nsignificantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction.

Among existing methods, Multi-Agent Reinforcement\nLearning (MARL) appears to be a promising control strategy because it can\nmanage complex scenarios in real time. However, current research on MARL-based\nmixed-autonomy platoon control suffers from several limitations. First,\nexisting MARL approaches address safety by penalizing safety violations in the\nreward function, thus lacking theoretical safety guarantees due to the\nblack-box nature of RL. Second, few studies have explored the cooperative\nsafety of multi-CAV platoons, where CAVs can be coordinated to further enhance\nthe system-level safety involving the safety of both CAVs and HDVs. Third,\nexisting work tends to make an unrealistic assumption that the behavior of HDVs\nand CAVs is publicly known and rationale. To bridge the research gaps, we\npropose a safe MARL framework for mixed-autonomy platoons. Specifically, this\nframework (i) characterizes cooperative safety by designing a cooperative\nControl Barrier Function (CBF), enabling CAVs to collaboratively improve the\nsafety of the entire platoon, (ii) provides a safety guarantee to the\nMARL-based controller by integrating the CBF-based safety constraints into MARL\nthrough a differentiable quadratic programming (QP) layer, and (iii)\nincorporates a conformal prediction module that enables each CAV to estimate\nthe unknown behaviors of the surrounding vehicles with uncertainty\nqualification. Simulation results show that our proposed control strategy can\neffectively enhance the system-level safety through CAV cooperation of a\nmixed-autonomy platoon with a minimal impact on control performance.",

However, there are\nincreasing concerns about privacy leakage, as these networks rely on processing\nprivate data. Recently, a new type of privacy attack, the model inversion\nattacks (MIAs), aims to extract sensitive features of private data for training\nby abusing access to a well-trained model. The effectiveness of MIAs has been\ndemonstrated in various domains, including images, texts, and graphs. These\nattacks highlight the vulnerability of neural networks and raise awareness\nabout the risk of privacy leakage within the research community. Despite the\nsignificance, there is a lack of systematic studies that provide a\ncomprehensive overview and deeper insights into MIAs across different domains.\nThis survey aims to summarize up-to-date MIA methods in both attacks and\ndefenses, highlighting their contributions and limitations, underlying modeling\nprinciples, optimization challenges, and future directions. We hope this survey\nbridges the gap in the literature and facilitates future research in this\ncritical area.

While large language models (LLMs) excel on\ngenerative tasks, their performance on extractive tasks remains debated.\nMethods: We investigated Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction\n(RE) using 1,588 clinical notes from four sources (UT Physicians, MTSamples,\nMIMIC-III, and i2b2). We developed an annotated corpus covering 4 clinical\nentities and 16 modifiers, and compared instruction-tuned LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3\nagainst BERT in terms of performance, generalizability, computational\nresources, and throughput to BERT. Results: LLaMA models outperformed BERT\nacross datasets. With sufficient training data, LLaMA showed modest\nimprovements (1% on NER, 1.5-3.7% on RE); improvements were larger with limited\ntraining data. On unseen i2b2 data, LLaMA-3-70B outperformed BERT by 7% (F1) on\nNER and 4% on RE. However, LLaMA models required more computing resources and\nran up to 28 times slower. We implemented \"Kiwi,\" a clinical IE package\nfeaturing both models, available at https://kiwi.clinicalnlp.org/.

Continuous structuring is allowed for. A 1D\ninitial value problem (IVP) is formulated in conjunction with an eigenvalue\nproblem (EVP) for laterally open systems, with no strict boundary conditions\n(BCs) at infinity. The IVP is solved by eigenfunction expansion, allowing a\nclear distinction between the contributions from proper eigenmodes and improper\ncontinuum eigenmodes. Example solutions are offered for parameters typical of\nactive region loops. Our solutions show that the system evolves towards long\nperiodicities due to proper eigenmodes (of order the axial Alfven time),\nwhereas the interference of the improper continuum may lead to short\nperiodicities initially (of order the lateral Alfven time). Specializing to the\nslab axis, we demonstrate that the proper contribution strengthens with the\ndensity contrast, but may occasionally be stronger for less steep density\nprofiles. Short periodicities are not guaranteed in the improper contribution,\nthe details of the initial exciter being key. When identifiable, these\nperiodicities tend to agree with the oscillation frequencies expected for DLMs,\ndespite the differences in the BCs between our EVP and classic analyses. The\neigenfunction expansion approach enables all qualitative features to be\ninterpreted as the interplay between the initial exciter and some response\nfunction, the latter solely determined by the equilibria.

While this expansion holds\nthe potential to improve forecast accuracy, it raises a critical question:\nwhich prediction is the most plausible? If the NWP models have comparable\naccuracy, it is impossible to determine in advance which one is the best.\nTraditional approaches, such as ensemble or weighted averaging, combine\nmultiple NWP outputs to produce a single forecast with improved accuracy.\nHowever, they often result in meteorologically unrealistic and uninterpretable\noutputs, such as the splitting of tropical cyclone centers or frontal\nboundaries into multiple distinct systems.\n  To address this issue, we propose DeepMedcast, a deep learning method that\ngenerates intermediate forecasts between two or more NWP outputs. Unlike\naveraging, DeepMedcast provides predictions in which meteorologically\nsignificant features -- such as the locations of tropical cyclones,\nextratropical cyclones, fronts, and shear lines -- approximately align with the\narithmetic mean of the corresponding features predicted by the input NWP\nmodels, without distorting meteorological structures. We demonstrate the\ncapability of DeepMedcast through case studies and verification results,\nshowing that it produces realistic and interpretable forecasts with higher\naccuracy than the input NWP models.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the computational complexity of computing empirical\nplug-in estimates for causal effect queries. Given a causal graph and\nobservational data, any identifiable causal query can be estimated from an\nexpression over the observed variables, called the estimand. The estimand can\nthen be evaluated by plugging in probabilities computed empirically from data.\nIn contrast to conventional wisdom, which assumes that high dimensional\nprobabilistic functions will lead to exponential evaluation time of the\nestimand. We show that computation can be done efficiently, potentially in time\nlinear in the data size, depending on the estimand's hypergraph.\n  In particular, we show that both the treewidth and hypertree width of the\nestimand's structure bound the evaluation complexity of the plug-in estimands,\nanalogous to their role in the complexity of probabilistic inference in\ngraphical models. Often, the hypertree width provides a more effective bound,\nsince the empirical distributions are sparse.",

Using Gaia\nData Release 3, we examine [Ca/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] fluctuations in a ~4 kpc region\naround the Sun, focusing on bright giant stars. We implemented a kernel density\nestimator technique to enhance the chemical inhomogeneities. We observe radial\ngradients and azimuthal fluctuations in [alpha/Fe] for young (<150 Myr) and old\n(>2 Gyr) stars, with amplitudes varying according to the studied element. In\nyoung stars, those within spiral arms (e.g., Sagittarius-Carina and Local arms)\nare generally more metal and calcium-rich (~0-0.19 dex) but show lower [Ca/Fe]\n(~0.06 dex) and [Mg/Fe] (~0.05 dex) compared to inter-arm regions, suggesting\nenhanced iron production in spiral arms. These [alpha/Fe] depletions are\nanalysed in light of theoretical scenarios and compared to a 2D chemical\nevolution model with multiple spiral patterns. For the old sample, [Ca/Fe] maps\nreveal deficiencies along a segment of the Local arm identified by young stars.\nWe caution that, for this old sample, the quality of the obtained maps might be\nlimited along a specific line-of-sight, due to the Gaia scanning law. This\nstudy transitions our understanding of disc chemical evolution from a 1D radial\nview to a more detailed 2D framework incorporating radial, azimuthal, and\nsmall-scale variations.

Recently, the Mixture of Expert (MoE) has drawn significant\nattention as it can scale models to extra-large sizes with a stable computation\nbudget. However, inefficient distributed training of large-scale MoE models\nhinders their broader application. Specifically, a considerable dynamic load\nimbalance occurs among devices during training, significantly reducing\nthroughput. Several load-balancing works have been proposed to address the\nchallenge. System-level solutions draw more attention for their hardware\naffinity and non-disruption of model convergence compared to algorithm-level\nones. However, they are troubled by high communication costs and poor\ncommunication-computation overlapping. To address these challenges, we propose\na systematic load-balancing method, Pro-Prophet, which consists of a planner\nand a scheduler for efficient parallel training of large-scale MoE models. To\nadapt to the dynamic load imbalance, we profile training statistics and use\nthem to design Pro-Prophet. For lower communication volume, Pro-Prophet planner\ndetermines a series of lightweight load-balancing strategies and efficiently\nsearches for a communication-efficient one for training based on the\nstatistics. For sufficient overlapping of communication and computation,\nPro-Prophet scheduler schedules the data-dependent operations based on the\nstatistics and operation features, further improving the training throughput.\nExperimental results indicate that Pro-Prophet achieves up to 2.66x speedup\ncompared to Deepspeed-MoE and FasterMoE.

In quantitative investment, for\nexample, the process typically involves several sequential stages such as\nfactor mining, alpha prediction, portfolio optimization, and sometimes order\nexecution. While state-of-the-art end-to-end modeling aims to unify these\nstages into a single global framework, it faces significant challenges: (1)\ntraining such a unified neural network consisting of multiple stages between\ninitial inputs and final outputs often leads to suboptimal solutions, or even\ncollapse, and (2) many decision-making scenarios are not easily reducible to\nstandard prediction problems. To overcome these challenges, we propose Guided\nLearning, a novel methodological framework designed to enhance end-to-end\nlearning in multi-stage decision-making. We introduce the concept of a\n``guide'', a function that induces the training of intermediate neural network\nlayers towards some phased goals, directing gradients away from suboptimal\ncollapse. For decision scenarios lacking explicit supervisory labels, we\nincorporate a utility function that quantifies the ``reward'' of the throughout\ndecision. Additionally, we explore the connections between Guided Learning and\nclassic machine learning paradigms such as supervised, unsupervised,\nsemi-supervised, multi-task, and reinforcement learning. Experiments on\nquantitative investment strategy building demonstrate that guided learning\nsignificantly outperforms both traditional stage-wise approaches and existing\nend-to-end methods.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Journal Impact Factors and other citation-based indicators are\nwidely used and abused to help select journals to publish in or to estimate the\nvalue of a published article. Nevertheless, citation rates primarily reflect\nscholarly impact rather than other quality dimensions, including societal\nimpact, originality, and rigour. In contrast, Journal Quality Factors (JQFs)\nare average quality score estimates given to a journal's articles by ChatGPT.\nDesign: JQFs were compared with Polish, Norwegian and Finnish journal ranks and\nwith journal citation rates for 1,300 journals with 130,000 articles from 2021\nin large monodisciplinary journals in the 25 out of 27 Scopus broad fields of\nresearch for which it was possible. Outliers were also examined. Findings: JQFs\ncorrelated positively and mostly strongly (median correlation: 0.641) with\njournal ranks in 24 out of the 25 broad fields examined, indicating a nearly\nscience-wide ability for ChatGPT to estimate journal quality. Journal citation\nrates had similarly high correlations with national journal ranks, however, so\nJQFs are not a universally better indicator. An examination of journals with\nJQFs not matching their journal ranks suggested that abstract styles may affect\nthe result, such as whether the societal contexts of research are mentioned.\nLimitations: Different journal rankings may have given different findings\nbecause there is no agreed meaning for journal quality. Implications: The\nresults suggest that JQFs are plausible as journal quality indicators in all\nfields and may be useful for the (few) research and evaluation contexts where\njournal quality is an acceptable proxy for article quality, and especially for\nfields like mathematics for which citations are not strong indicators of\nquality.

This approach offers novel and diverse perspectives for studying\nhistorical texts like \"Yantie Lun\" and provides new auxiliary tools for history\neducation. The framework aims to equip historians and learners with\nLLM-assisted tools to facilitate in-depth, multi-layered analysis of historical\ntexts and foster innovation in historical education.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a new dimensionality-independent and\ngradient-free sampler, called Geometric Optics Approximation Sampling, which is\nbased on the reflector antenna system. The core idea is to construct a\nreflecting surface that redirects rays from a source with a predetermined\nsimpler measure towards a output domain while achieving a desired distribution\ndefined by the projection of a complex target measure of interest. Given a such\nreflecting surface, one can generate arbitrarily many independent and\nuncorrelated samples from the target measure simply by dual re-simulating or\nrays tracing the reflector antenna system and then projecting the traced rays\nonto target domain. In order to obtain a desired reflecting surface, we use the\nmethod of supporting paraboloid to solve the reflector antenna problem that\ndoes not require a gradient information regarding the density of the target\nmeasure. Furthermore, within the supporting paraboloid method, we utilize a\nlow-discrepancy sequence or a random sequence to discretize the target measure,\nwhich in turn yields a dimensionality-independent approach for constructing the\nreflecting surface. Meanwhile, we present a dual re-simulation or ray tracing\nmethod based on its dual reflecting surface, which enables drawing samples from\nthe target measure using the reflector antenna system obtained through the\ndimensionality-independent method. Several examples and numerical experiments\ncomparing with measure transport samplers as well as traditional Markov chain\nMonte Carlo simulations are provided in this paper to demonstrate the\nefficiency and applicability of our geometric optics approximation sampling,\nespecially in the context of Bayesian inverse problems.

    ],
    "abstract": "Planetesimal formation via the streaming and gravitational instabilities of\ndust in protoplanetary disks requires a local enhancement of the dust-to-gas\nmass ratio. Radial drift of large grains toward pressure bumps in gas disks is\na plausible mechanism for achieving the required dust concentration. However,\nrecent millimeter disk observations suggest that the maximum sizes of dust\ngrains in these disks are considerably smaller than predicted by dust evolution\nmodels that assume sticky grains. This indicates that the grains may be more\nstrongly coupled to the gas and hence drift more slowly than previously\nanticipated. In this study, we propose a new dust retention mechanism that\nenables an enhancement of the dust-to-gas mass ratio in disks with slowly\ndrifting grains. This mechanism assumes that a surface accretion flow driven by\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) winds removes disk gas while retaining the slowly\ndrifting grains below the flow. This process is expected to occur when the\ntimescale of gas removal is shorter than the timescale of dust radial\nadvection. To test this, we develop a radially one-dimensional framework for\nthe transport of gas and dust in a disk with a vertically nonuniform accretion\nstructure. Using this framework, we simulate the growth, fragmentation, and\nradial transport of dust grains in surface-accreting disks. Our simulations\nconfirm a significant enhancement of the midplane dust-to-gas mass ratio when\nthe predicted conditions for dust retention are met. Dust retention by\nMHD-driven surface accretion flows may thus pave the way for planetesimal\nformation from poorly sticky grains.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), foundational\nmodels (FMs) have seen significant advancements. Healthcare is one of the most\ncrucial application areas for these FMs, given the significant time and effort\nrequired for physicians to analyze large volumes of patient data. Recent\nefforts have focused on adapting multimodal FMs to the medical domain through\ntechniques like instruction-tuning, leading to the development of medical\nfoundation models (MFMs). However, these approaches typically require large\namounts of training data to effectively adapt models to the medical field.\nMoreover, most existing models are trained on English datasets, limiting their\npracticality in non-English-speaking regions where healthcare professionals and\npatients are not always fluent in English. The need for translation introduces\nadditional costs and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we propose a\n\\textbf{J}apanese \\textbf{Radi}ology report generation model enhanced by\n\\textbf{Evo}lutionary optimization of model merging (JRadiEvo). This is the\nfirst attempt to extend a non-medical vision-language foundation model to the\nmedical domain through evolutionary optimization of model merging. We\nsuccessfully created a model that generates accurate Japanese reports from\nX-ray images using only 50 translated samples from publicly available data.\nThis model, developed with highly efficient use of limited data, outperformed\nleading models from recent research trained on much larger datasets.\nAdditionally, with only 8 billion parameters, this relatively compact\nfoundation model can be deployed locally within hospitals, making it a\npractical solution for environments where APIs and other external services\ncannot be used due to strict privacy and security requirements.",

Compared to\ntraditional three-tier cascaded spoken dialogue models that comprise speech\nrecognition (ASR), large language models (LLMs), and text-to-speech (TTS),\nmodern spoken dialogue models exhibit greater intelligence. These advanced\nspoken dialogue models not only comprehend audio, music, and other\nspeech-related features, but also capture stylistic and timbral characteristics\nin speech. Moreover, they generate high-quality, multi-turn speech responses\nwith low latency, enabling real-time interaction through simultaneous listening\nand speaking capability. Despite the progress in spoken dialogue systems, there\nis a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically organize and analyze\nthese systems and the underlying technologies. To address this, we have first\ncompiled existing spoken dialogue systems in the chronological order and\ncategorized them into the cascaded and end-to-end paradigms. We then provide an\nin-depth overview of the core technologies in spoken dialogue models, covering\naspects such as speech representation, training paradigm, streaming, duplex,\nand interaction capabilities.

Obtaining reliable data for fluid-solid IFE remains\nchallenging with experimental and semi-empirical methods, and the applicability\nof first-principle theoretical methods is constrained by a lack of accessible\ncomputational tools. In recent years, a variety of molecular simulation methods\nhave been developed for determining the fluid-solid IFE. This review provides a\ncomprehensive summary and critical evaluation of these techniques. The\ndevelopments, fundamental principles, and implementations of various simulation\nmethods are presented from mechanical routes, such as the contact angle\napproach, the technique using Bakker's equation, and the Wilhelmy simulation\nmethod, as well as thermodynamic routes, including the cleaving wall method,\nthe Frenkel-Ladd technique, and the test-volume/area methods. These approaches\ncan be applied to compute various fluid-solid interfacial properties, including\nIFE, relative IFE, surface stress, and superficial tension, although these\nproperties are often used without differentiation in the literature.\nAdditionally, selected applications of these methods are reviewed to provide\ninsight into the behavior of fluid-solid interfacial energies in diverse\nsystems. We also illustrate two interpretations of the fluid-solid IFE based on\nthe theory of Navascues and Berry and Bakker's equation. It is shown that the\nsimulation methods developed from these two interpretations are identical. This\nreview advocates for the broader adoption of molecular simulation methods in\nestimating fluid-solid IFE, which is essential for advancing our understanding\nof wetting behaviors in various chemical systems.",

The analytical results show that the complex amplitudes of\nthe primary system responses contain only the slow frequency, while that of the\nNES responses can contain both the slow frequency and the fast frequency when\nit triggers the high-order frequency term. In addition, each type of set on the\ninvariant manifold represents the corresponding steady-state oscillations of\nthe system, that is, the fixed point corresponds to the stationary oscillation,\nthe interval corresponds to the nonlinear beat, and the hysteresis loop\ncorresponds to the relaxation oscillation. Accordingly, we rewrite the forms of\nthe complexification system to match the corresponding types of steady-state\noscillations.

However, in foggy scenarios, image\ndegradation leads to loss of target details, which seriously affects the\naccuracy and effectiveness of these vision tasks. Polarized light, due to the\nfact that its electromagnetic waves vibrate in a specific direction, is able to\nresist scattering and refraction effects in complex media more effectively\ncompared to unpolarized light. As a result, polarized light has a greater\nability to maintain its polarization characteristics in complex transmission\nmedia and under long-distance imaging conditions. This property makes polarized\nimaging especially suitable for complex scenes such as outdoor and underwater,\nespecially in foggy environments, where higher quality images can be obtained.\nBased on this advantage, we propose an innovative semi-physical polarization\ndehazing method that does not rely on an external light source. The method\nsimulates the diffusion process of fog and designs a diffusion kernel that\ncorresponds to the image blurriness caused by this diffusion. By employing\nspatiotemporal Fourier transforms and deconvolution operations, the method\nrecovers the state of fog droplets prior to diffusion and the light inversion\ndistribution of objects.

To facilitate the development of the\nnew task, we collect a large-scale dataset called GROUNDMORE, which comprises\n1,715 video clips, 249K object masks that are deliberately designed with 4\nquestion types (Causal, Sequential, Counterfactual, and Descriptive) for\nbenchmarking deep and comprehensive motion reasoning abilities. GROUNDMORE\nuniquely requires models to generate visual answers, providing a more concrete\nand visually interpretable response than plain texts. It evaluates models on\nboth spatiotemporal grounding and reasoning, fostering to address complex\nchallenges in motion-related video reasoning, temporal perception, and\npixel-level understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a novel baseline model\nnamed Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning Assistant (MORA). MORA incorporates the\nmultimodal reasoning ability from the Multimodal LLM, the pixel-level\nperception capability from the grounding model (SAM), and the temporal\nperception ability from a lightweight localization head. MORA achieves\nrespectable performance on GROUNDMORE outperforming the best existing visual\ngrounding baseline model by an average of 21.5% relatively. We hope this novel\nand challenging task will pave the way for future advancements in robust and\ngeneral motion understanding via video reasoning segmentation",

We go beyond the traditional notions\nof contextuality and antidistinguishability and treat both properties as\nresources, demonstrating that the degree of contextuality within a set of\nstates has a direct connection to its level of antidistinguishability.

The rate of the $^{34}$Ar($\\alpha,p$)$^{37}$K\nreaction may influence features of the light curve that results from the\nunderlying thermonuclear runaway, as shown in recent XRB stellar modelling\nstudies.\n  Purpose: In order to reduce the uncertainty of the rate of this reaction,\nproperties of resonances in the compound nucleus $^{38}$Ca, such as resonance\nenergies, spins, and particle widths, must be well constrained.\n  Method: This work discusses a study of resonances in the $^{38}$Ca compound\nnucleus produced in the $^{34}$Ar($\\alpha,p$) reaction. The experiment was\nperformed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, with the ReA3\nfacility by measuring proton scattering using an unstable $^{37}$K beam. The\nkinematics were designed specifically to identify and characterize resonances\nin the Gamow energy window for the temperature regime relevant to XRBs.\n  Results: The spins and proton widths of newly identified and previously known\nstates in $^{38}$Ca in the energy region of interest for the\n$^{34}$Ar($\\alpha,p$)$^{37}$K reaction have been constrained through an\nR-Matrix analysis of the scattering data.\n  Conclusions: Using these constraints, a newly estimated rate is applied to an\nXRB model built using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA),\nto examine its impact on observables, including the light curve. It is found\nthat the newly determined reaction rate does not substantially affect the\nfeatures of the light curve.",

In this study, we first\ndeveloped a 21700 battery pack indirect liquid cooling system with cold plates\non the top and bottom with thermal paste surrounding the battery cells.

Due\nto the high coolant flow rate, the cold plates can be considered as constant\ntemperature boundaries, while battery cells are the heat sources.

    "abstract": "To ensure secure and reliable communication in wireless systems,\nauthenticating the identities of numerous nodes is imperative. Traditional\ncryptography-based authentication methods suffer from issues such as low\ncompatibility, reliability, and high complexity. Physical-Layer Authentication\n(PLA) is emerging as a promising complement due to its exploitation of unique\nproperties in wireless environments. Recently, Machine Learning (ML)-based PLA\nhas gained attention for its intelligence, adaptability, universality, and\nscalability compared to non-ML approaches. However, a comprehensive overview of\nstate-of-the-art ML-based PLA and its foundational aspects is lacking. This\npaper presents a comprehensive survey of characteristics and technologies that\ncan be used in the ML-based PLA. We categorize existing ML-based PLA schemes\ninto two main types: multi-device identification and attack detection schemes.\nIn deep learning-based multi-device identification schemes, Deep Neural\nNetworks are employed to train models, avoiding complex processing and expert\nfeature transformation. Deep learning-based multi-device identification schemes\nare further subdivided, with schemes based on Convolutional Neural Networks\nbeing extensively researched. In ML-based attack detection schemes, receivers\nutilize intelligent ML techniques to set detection thresholds automatically,\neliminating the need for manual calculation or knowledge of channel models.\nML-based attack detection schemes are categorized into three sub-types:\nSupervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.\nAdditionally, we summarize open-source datasets used for PLA, encompassing\nRadio Frequency fingerprints and channel fingerprints. Finally, this paper\noutlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.",

Here, we use thousands of\nmain-sequence binaries from the Gaia DR3 catalog to reveal that, binaries\ninwards of a few AU exhibit a simple Rayleigh distribution with a mode sigma_e\n~ 0.3. We find the same distribution for binaries from M to A spectral types,\nand from tens of days to a thousand days (possibly extending to tens of AU).\nThis observed distribution is most likely primordial and its invariance\nsuggests a single universal process. One possibility is eccentricity excitation\nby circumbinary disks. Another, as is suggested by the Rayleigh form, is weak\nscattering and ejection of brown-dwarf objects. We explore this latter scenario\nand find that the binary eccentricities reach an equi-partition value of\nsigma_e ~ sqrt{M_bd M_*}. So to explain the observed mode, the brown dwarfs\nwill have to be of order one tenth the stellar masses, and be at least as\nabundant in the Galaxy as the close binaries. The veracity of both proposals\nremains to be tested.",

We adopted the same methods to estimate the distances, calculate\nthe sample completeness, and determine the HIMF for all three surveys. The\nbest-fit Schechter function for the total HIMF shows a low-mass slope parameter\nof alpha = -1.30 and a knee mass log(Ms) = 9.86, along with a normalisation of\nphi_s = 0.00658.

Previous analyses modeled this emission\nwith a power law (PL), inferring various values for the photon index ($\\Gamma$)\nand absorbing column density ($N_{\\rm H}$). Based on these, S1 was suggested to\nbe the SNR shell, a background pulsar wind nebula (PWN), or an interaction\nregion between the SNR and a molecular cloud. Our analysis of a larger dataset\nfavors a steepening (broken or curved PL) spectrum over a straight PL, with the\nbest-fit broken power-law (BPL) parameters of $\\Gamma=1.23\\pm0.23$ and\n$2.24\\pm0.16$ below and above a break at $5.57\\pm0.52$ keV, respectively.\nHowever, a simple PL or srcut model cannot be definitively ruled out. For the\nBPL model, the inferred $N_{\\rm H}=(4.08\\pm0.72)\\times 10^{22}\\rm \\ cm^{-2}$\ntowards S1 is consistent with that of the SNR, suggesting a physical\nassociation. The BPL-inferred spectral break $\\Delta \\Gamma \\approx 1$ and hard\n$\\Gamma$ can be naturally explained by a non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB)\nmodel. We present an evolutionary NTB model that reproduces the observed\nspectrum, which indicates the presence of sub-relativistic electrons within S1.\nHowever, alternate explanations for S1, an unrelated PWN or the SNR shock with\nunusually efficient acceleration, cannot be ruled out.

While X-ray observations have provided radial profiles for\nboth the intensity and photon index of the nebula, previous theoretical studies\nhave not reached an agreement on their physical interpretation, which also lead\nto different anticipation of the UHE emission from the nebula. In this work, we\nmodel its X-ray emission with a dynamical evolution model of PWN, considering\nboth convective and diffusive transport of electrons. On the premise of fitting\nthe X-ray intensity and photon index profiles, we find that the magnetic field\nwithin the Boomerang nebula is weak ($\\sim 10\\mu$G in the core region and\ndiminishing to $1\\mu\\,G$ at the periphery), which therefore implies a\nsignificant contribution to the UHE gamma-ray emission by the inverse Compton\n(IC) radiation of injected electron/positron pairs. Depending on the particle\ntransport mechanism, the UHE gamma-ray flux contributed by the Boomerang nebula\nvia the IC radiation may constitute about $10-50\\%$ of the flux of\nLHAASO~J2226+6057 at 100\\,TeV, and up to 30\\% at 500\\,TeV. Finally, we compare\nour results with previous studies and discuss potential hadronic UHE emission\nfrom the PWN.

    "abstract": "Integrating robotically driven contact-based material characterization\ntechniques into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality,\nreliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust\nautonomy, current methods lack reliable pixel-precision positioning and require\nextensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach\nfor building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that\nteach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at\nhigh-throughputs. Firstly, we design a vision-based, self-supervised\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses differentiable image\npriors to optimize domain-specific objectives, refining the pixel precision of\npredicted robot contact poses by 20.0% relative to existing approaches.\nSecondly, we design a reliable graph-based planner for generating\ndistance-minimizing paths to accelerate the robot measurement throughput and\ndecrease planning variance by 6x. We demonstrate the performance of this\napproach by autonomously driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic probe for 24\nhours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3,025 uniquely\npredicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions,\nachieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping\nphotoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and\nregions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing process\ndefects. With this self-supervised CNN-driven robotic system, we enable\nhigh-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization\ntechniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously\ninaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving\nlaboratories.",

Previous work tackles this challenge by training on the source\ndomain with modified rewards derived by matching distributions between the\nsource and the target optimal trajectories. However, pure modified rewards only\nensure the behavior of the learned policy in the source domain resembles\ntrajectories produced by the target optimal policies, which does not guarantee\noptimal performance when the learned policy is actually deployed to the target\ndomain. In this work, we propose to utilize imitation learning to transfer the\npolicy learned from the reward modification to the target domain so that the\nnew policy can generate the same trajectories in the target domain. Our\napproach, Domain Adaptation and Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (DARAIL),\nutilizes the reward modification for domain adaptation and follows the general\nframework of generative adversarial imitation learning from observation (GAIfO)\nby applying a reward augmented estimator for the policy optimization step.\nTheoretically, we present an error bound for our method under a mild assumption\nregarding the dynamics shift to justify the motivation of our method.\nEmpirically, our method outperforms the pure modified reward method without\nimitation learning and also outperforms other baselines in benchmark\noff-dynamics environments.",

    "abstract": "Most population projection models require age-specific information on net\nmigration totals as a key demographic component of population change. Existing\nmethods for predicting future patterns of net migration by age have proven\ninadequate. The main reason is that methods applied to model net migration are\nunable to distinguish factors influencing the inflows from those influencing\nthe outflows. In this paper, we develop two flow-difference methods to produce\nage-specific forecasts of net migration for counties in the Washington State.\nOne uses a deterministic approach; the other uses a Bayesian approach and\nincludes measures of uncertainty. Both methods model the age-specific flows of\nin-migration and out-migration to derive age-specific net migration. By\nincluding models for in-migration and out-migration, even in the absence of\ndata on such flows, the resulting net migration predictions are greatly\nimproved over existing methods that only model the net migration totals. The\nestimation intervals from the Bayesian flow-difference method are found to be\nwell calibrated, while the other approaches do not yield such intervals. The\nimplications for future county-level population projections in Washington State\nare shown.",

This approach exploits the concept of the\ntime-invariant reference spreading framework, in which partly-overlapping ante-\nand post-impact reference vector fields are used. These vector fields are\ncoupled via an impact model in proximity of the expected impact area,\nminimizing the otherwise large impact-induced velocity errors and control\nefforts. We show how a nonsmooth physics engine can be used to construct this\nimpact model for complex scenarios, which warrants applicability to a large\nrange of possible impact states without requiring contact stiffness and damping\nparameters. In addition, a novel interim-impact control mode provides\nrobustness in the execution against the inevitable lack of exact impact\nsimultaneity and the corresponding unreliable velocity error during the time\nwhen contact is only partially established. This interim mode uses a position\nfeedback signal that is derived from the ante-impact velocity reference to\npromote contact completion, and smoothly transitions into the post-impact mode.\nAn experimental validation of time-invariant reference spreading control is\npresented for the first time through a set of 600 robotic hit-and-push and\ndual-arm grabbing experiments.",

Prior routing game studies focus on myopic users in\noversimplified one-shot scenarios to regulate selfish routing via information\nhiding or pricing mechanisms. For practical human-in-the-loop learning (HILL)\nin repeated routing games, we face non-myopic users of differential past\nobservations and need new mechanisms (preferably non-monetary) to persuade\nusers to adhere to the optimal path recommendations. We model the repeated\nrouting game in a typical parallel transportation network, which generally\ncontains one deterministic path and $N$ stochastic paths. We first prove that\nno matter under the information sharing mechanism in use or the latest routing\nliterature's hiding mechanism, the resultant price of anarchy (PoA) for\nmeasuring the efficiency loss from social optimum can approach infinity,\ntelling arbitrarily poor exploration-exploitation tradeoff over time. Then we\npropose a novel user-differential probabilistic recommendation (UPR) mechanism\nto differentiate and randomize path recommendations for users with differential\nlearning histories. We prove that our UPR mechanism ensures interim individual\nrationality for all users and significantly reduces $\\text{PoA}=\\infty$ to\nclose-to-optimal $\\text{PoA}=1+\\frac{1}{4N+3}$, which cannot be further reduced\nby any other non-monetary mechanism.

    "abstract": "Computing ground-state properties of molecules is a promising application for\nquantum computers operating in concert with classical high-performance\ncomputing resources. Quantum embedding methods are a family of algorithms\nparticularly suited to these computational platforms: they combine high-level\ncalculations on active regions of a molecule with low-level calculations on the\nsurrounding environment, thereby avoiding expensive high-level full-molecule\ncalculations and allowing to distribute computational cost across multiple and\nheterogeneous computing units. Here, we present the first density matrix\nembedding theory (DMET) simulations performed in combination with the\nsample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method. We employ the DMET-SQD\nformalism to compute the ground-state energy of a ring of 18 hydrogen atoms,\nand the relative energies of the chair, half-chair, twist-boat, and boat\nconformers of cyclohexane. The full-molecule 41- and 89-qubit simulations are\ndecomposed into 27- and 32-qubit active-region simulations, that we carry out\non the ibm_cleveland device, obtaining results in agreement with reference\nclassical methods. Our DMET-SQD calculations mark a tangible progress in the\nsize of active regions that can be accurately tackled by near-term quantum\ncomputers, and are an early demonstration of the potential for quantum-centric\nsimulations to accurately treat the electronic structure of large molecules,\nwith the ultimate goal of tackling systems such as peptides and proteins.",

This\nwork examines the factorization of a skew-symmetric matrix $X$ into its\n$LTL^\\mathrm{T}$ decomposition, where $L$ is unit lower triangular and $T$ is\ntridiagonal. This is also known as a triangular tridiagonalization. This\noperation is a means for computing the determinant of $X$ as the square of the\n(cheaply-computed) Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric tridiagonal matrix $T$ as\nwell as for solving systems of equations, across fields such as quantum\nelectronic structure and machine learning.

Our OCL approach is simple: we randomly mask patches to\ngenerate different views within an image and contrast them among a mini-batch\nof images. The core idea behind OCL consists of two designs. First, masked\ntokens have the potential to significantly diminish the conceptual redundancy\ninherent in images, and create distinct views with substantial fine-grained\ndifferences on the semantic concept level instead of the instance level.\nSecond, contrastive learning is adept at extracting high-level semantic\nconceptual features during the pre-training, circumventing the high-frequency\ninterference and additional costs associated with image reconstruction.\nImportantly, OCL learns highly semantic conceptual representations efficiently\nwithout relying on hand-crafted data augmentations or additional auxiliary\nmodules. Empirically, OCL demonstrates high scalability with Vision\nTransformers, as the ViT-L/16 can complete pre-training in 133 hours using only\n4 A100 GPUs, achieving 85.8\\% accuracy in downstream fine-tuning tasks.

Companies allocate capital across\nmitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing\nclimate outcomes and investor preferences. We are releasing open-source\nversions of InvestESG in both PyTorch and JAX, which enable scalable and\nhardware-accelerated simulations for investigating competing incentives in\nmitigate climate change. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious\ninvestors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited\nunder the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors\nprioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate\nrisks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more\ninformation about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in\nmitigation, even without investor involvement.

The main challenge\narises when the appropriate functional forms cannot be derived from first\nprinciples, especially when there is no underlying true closed-form function\nfor the distribution.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful foundation model for visual\ngenerations. With an appropriate sampling process, it can effectively serve as\na generative prior for solving general inverse problems. Current posterior\nsampling-based methods take the measurement (i.e., degraded image sample) into\nthe posterior sampling to infer the distribution of the target data (i.e.,\nclean image sample). However, in this manner, we show that high-frequency\ninformation can be prematurely introduced during the early stages, which could\ninduce larger posterior estimate errors during restoration sampling. To address\nthis observation, we first reveal that forming the log-posterior gradient with\nthe noisy measurement ( i.e., noisy measurement from a diffusion forward\nprocess) instead of the clean one can benefit the early posterior sampling.\nConsequently, we propose a novel diffusion posterior sampling method DPS-CM,\nwhich incorporates a Crafted Measurement (i.e., noisy measurement crafted by a\nreverse denoising process, rather than constructed from the diffusion forward\nprocess) to form the posterior estimate. This integration aims to mitigate the\nmisalignment with the diffusion prior caused by cumulative posterior estimate\nerrors. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly\nimproves the overall capacity to solve general and noisy inverse problems, such\nas Gaussian deblurring, super-resolution, inpainting, nonlinear deblurring, and\ntasks with Poisson noise, relative to existing approaches.
