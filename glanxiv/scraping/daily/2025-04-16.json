    "abstract": "This systematic literature review seeks to explain the mechanisms and\nimplications of information disorder for public policy and the democratic\nprocess, by proposing a five-stage framework capturing its full life cycle. To\nour knowledge, no prior reviews in the field of public administration have\noffered a comprehensive, integrated model of information disorder; most\nexisting studies are situated within communication, information science, or\ndata science, and tend to focus on isolated aspects of the phenomenon. By\nconnecting concepts and stages with enabling factors, agents, tactics and\nimpacts, we reframe information disorder not as a question of \"truthiness\",\nindividual cognition, digital literacy, or merely of technology, but as a\nsocio-material phenomenon, deeply embedded in and shaped by the material\nconditions of contemporary digital society. This approach calls for a shift\naway from fragmented interventions toward more holistic, system-level policy\nresponses.",

While\nthese tools often support instructional needs, they raise significant privacy,\nsecurity, and regulatory compliance concerns. Despite its importance,\nunderstanding the adoptions and risks from the perspective of educators, who\nserve as de facto decision makers behind unsanctioned technology use, is\nlargely understudied in existing literature.To address this gap, we conducted\ntwo surveys: one with 375 educators who listed 1,373 unsanctioned apps, and\nanother with 21 administrators who either often help educators to set up\neducational technologies (EdTechs) or observe their security or privacy\nincidents. Our study identified 494 unique applications used by educators,\nprimarily for pedagogical utility (n=213) and functional convenience (n=155),\nand the associated risks were often ignored. In fact, despite security and\nprivacy concerns, many educators continued using the same apps (n = 62), citing\na lack of alternatives or heavy dependence as barriers to discontinuation. We\nalso found that fewer than a third of educators were aware of any institutional\npolicy on unsanctioned technology use (K12: 30.3%, HEI: 24.8%), and 22\nknowingly violated such policies. While 107 received formal warnings, only 33\nadjusted their behavior. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of\nour findings and future recommendations to minimize the risks.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiography) is widely used to diagnose\ncardiac diseases. However, obtaining an echocardiogram requires an expert\nsonographer and a high-quality ultrasound imaging device, which are generally\nonly available in hospitals. Recently, AI-based navigation models and\nalgorithms have been used to aid novice sonographers in acquiring the\nstandardized cardiac views necessary to visualize potential disease\npathologies. These navigation systems typically rely on directional guidance to\npredict the necessary rotation of the ultrasound probe. This paper demonstrates\na novel AI navigation system that builds on a decision model for identifying\nthe inferior vena cava (IVC) of the heart. The decision model is trained\noffline using cardiac ultrasound videos and employs binary classification to\ndetermine whether the IVC is present in a given ultrasound video. The\nunderlying model integrates a novel localization algorithm that leverages the\nlearned feature representations to annotate the spatial location of the IVC in\nreal-time. Our model demonstrates strong localization performance on\ntraditional high-quality hospital ultrasound videos, as well as impressive\nzero-shot performance on lower-quality ultrasound videos from a more affordable\nButterfly iQ handheld ultrasound machine. This capability facilitates the\nexpansion of ultrasound diagnostics beyond hospital settings. Currently, the\nguidance system is undergoing clinical trials and is available on the Butterfly\niQ app.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely deployed as local\nmagnetic sensors, using coherent, single qubit control to measure both\ntime-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution. Moving beyond\nsingle qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as\nmeasuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators, or using entangled states to\nimprove measurement sensitivity. Here, we describe protocols to use optically\nunresolved NV center pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for\nmeasuring correlated noise, enabling covariance magnetometry at nanometer\nlength scales. For NV centers that are optically unresolved but have spectrally\nresolved spin transitions, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that\ndisambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations by alternating\nthe relative spin orientations of the two NV centers. For NV centers that are\nboth optically and spectrally unresolved, we leverage the presence of a third\nqubit, a 13C nucleus that is strongly coupled to one of the NV centers, to\neffect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable a similar phase-cycling\nprotocol. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell\nstates through dipole-dipole coupling between two NV centers, and use these\nentangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather\nthan reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centers.\nImportantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from\nquadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV center\nspin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum\nprojection limit), this results in a dramatic sensitivity improvement. Finally,\nwe demonstrate methods for the detection of high spatial- and\ntemporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centers.",

    "abstract": "How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and\nis somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score\nmatching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score\nfunction of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn\nthe score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy.\nWe claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its\ntarget is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only\nequal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent\ndiffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory\nthat partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our\ntheoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to\ncompute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and\noverparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion\nmodels effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions,\nbut with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the\ncovariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also\ncharacterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive\nbiases.",

    "abstract": "Tipping behaviour can occur when an equilibrium loses stability in response\nto a slowly varying parameter crossing a bifurcation threshold, or where noise\ndrives a system from one attractor to another, or some combination of these\neffects. Similar behaviour can be expected when a multistable system is forced\nby a chaotic deterministic system rather than by noise. In this context, the\nchaotic tipping window was recently introduced and investigated for\ndiscrete-time dynamics. In this paper, we find tipping windows for\ncontinuous-time nonlinear systems forced by chaos. We characterise the tipping\nwindow in terms of forcing by unstable periodic orbits of the chaos, and we\nshow how the location and structure of this window depend on the relative\ntimescales between the forcing and the responding system. We illustrate this by\nfinding tipping windows for two examples of coupled bistable ODEs forced with\nchaos. Additionally, we describe the dynamic tipping window in the setting of a\nchanging system parameter.",

We consider three types of noise to\nmodel the random fluctuations: the Gaussian white and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nnoises, and the logarithmic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (logOU). The advantages of logOU\nnoise are its positivity and its ability to model the presence of\nsuperspreaders.

LogOU noise\nresults in distributions that stay close to the endemic deterministic\nequilibrium even for high noise intensities.

    "abstract": "Despite continuous advancements in cancer treatment, brain metastatic disease\nremains a significant complication of primary cancer and is associated with an\nunfavorable prognosis. One approach for improving diagnosis, management, and\noutcomes is to implement algorithms based on artificial intelligence for the\nautomated segmentation of both pre- and post-treatment MRI brain images. Such\nalgorithms rely on volumetric criteria for lesion identification and treatment\nresponse assessment, which are still not available in clinical practice.\nTherefore, it is critical to establish tools for rapid volumetric segmentations\nmethods that can be translated to clinical practice and that are trained on\nhigh quality annotated data. The BraTS-METS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge aims to\naddress this critical need by establishing inter-rater and intra-rater\nvariability in dataset annotation by generating high quality annotated datasets\nfrom four individual instances of segmentation by neuroradiologists while being\nrecorded on video (two instances doing \"from scratch\" and two instances after\nAI pre-segmentation). This high-quality annotated dataset will be used for\ntesting phase in 2025 Lighthouse challenge and will be publicly released at the\ncompletion of the challenge. The 2025 Lighthouse challenge will also release\nthe 2023 and 2024 segmented datasets that were annotated using an established\npipeline of pre-segmentation, student annotation, two neuroradiologists\nchecking, and one neuroradiologist finalizing the process. It builds upon its\nprevious edition by including post-treatment cases in the dataset. Using these\nhigh-quality annotated datasets, the 2025 Lighthouse challenge plans to test\nbenchmark algorithms for automated segmentation of pre-and post-treatment brain\nmetastases (BM), trained on diverse and multi-institutional datasets of MRI\nimages obtained from patients with brain metastases.",

Experiments on various Llama, Qwen, and\nMistral models demonstrate that MOM reduces peak memory usage by over 50\\% on\naverage. On Meta-Llama-3.2-8B, MOM extends the maximum context length from 155k\nto 455k tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU, while keeping outputs identical and\nnot compromising accuracy. MOM also maintains highly competitive throughput due\nto minimal computational overhead and efficient last-layer processing. Compared\nto traditional chunked prefill methods, MOM achieves a 35\\% greater context\nlength extension. More importantly, our method drastically reduces prefill\nmemory consumption, eliminating it as the longstanding dominant memory\nbottleneck during inference. This breakthrough fundamentally changes research\npriorities, redirecting future efforts from prefill-stage optimizations to\nimproving decode-stage residual KV cache efficiency.",

In this paper, we introduce Knowledge Update Playground (KUP), an\nautomatic pipeline for simulating realistic knowledge updates reflected in an\nevidence corpora. KUP's evaluation framework includes direct and indirect\nprobes to both test memorization of updated facts and reasoning over them, for\nany update learning methods. Next, we present a lightweight method called\nmemory conditioned training (MCT), which conditions tokens in the update corpus\non self-generated \"memory\" tokens during training. Our strategy encourages LLMs\nto surface and reason over newly memorized knowledge at inference. Our results\non two strong LLMs show that (1) KUP benchmark is highly challenging, with the\nbest CPT models achieving $<2\\%$ in indirect probing setting (reasoning) and\n(2) MCT training significantly outperforms prior continued pre-training (CPT)\nbaselines, improving direct probing (memorization) results by up to $25.4\\%$.",

Using\nopen-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive\nresults: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via\nRL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater\neffective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing\ndiversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality\noutputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity\nwhile preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity\nin form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook. Our\nanalysis further shows that smaller models are consistently more\nparameter-efficient at generating unique content within a fixed sampling\nbudget, offering insights into the relationship between model scaling and\ndiversity.

It is well-known that on such problems\ndeterministic GD has loss convergence rates $L_t=O(t^{-\\zeta})$, which can be\nimproved to $L_t=O(t^{-2\\zeta})$ by using Heavy Ball with a non-stationary\nJacobi-based schedule (and the latter rate is optimal among fixed schedules).\nHowever, in the mini-batch Stochastic GD setting, the sampling noise causes the\nJacobi HB to diverge; accordingly no $O(t^{-2\\zeta})$ algorithm is known. In\nthis paper we show that rates up to $O(t^{-2\\zeta})$ can be achieved by a\ngeneralized stationary SGD with infinite memory. We start by identifying\ngeneralized (S)GD algorithms with contours in the complex plane. We then show\nthat contours that have a corner with external angle $\\theta\\pi$ accelerate the\nplain GD rate $O(t^{-\\zeta})$ to $O(t^{-\\theta\\zeta})$. For deterministic GD,\nincreasing $\\theta$ allows to achieve rates arbitrarily close to\n$O(t^{-2\\zeta})$. However, in Stochastic GD, increasing $\\theta$ also amplifies\nthe sampling noise, so in general $\\theta$ needs to be optimized by balancing\nthe acceleration and noise effects. We prove that the optimal rate is given by\n$\\theta_{\\max}=\\min(2,\\nu,\\tfrac{2}{\\zeta+1/\\nu})$, where $\\nu,\\zeta$ are the\nexponents appearing in the capacity and source spectral conditions.\nFurthermore, using fast rational approximations of the power functions, we show\nthat ideal corner algorithms can be efficiently approximated by finite-memory\nalgorithms, and demonstrate their practical efficiency on a synthetic problem\nand MNIST.",

    "abstract": "Event cameras promise a paradigm shift in vision sensing with their low\nlatency, high dynamic range, and asynchronous nature of events. Unfortunately,\nthe scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets hinders their widespread adoption\nin deep learning-driven computer vision. To mitigate this, several simulators\nhave been proposed to generate synthetic event data for training models for\ndetection and estimation tasks. However, the fundamentally different sensor\ndesign of event cameras compared to traditional frame-based cameras poses a\nchallenge for accurate simulation. As a result, most simulated data fail to\nmimic data captured by real event cameras. Inspired by existing work on using\ndeep features for image comparison, we introduce event quality score (EQS), a\nquality metric that utilizes activations of the RVT architecture. Through\nsim-to-real experiments on the DSEC driving dataset, it is shown that a higher\nEQS implies improved generalization to real-world data after training on\nsimulated events. Thus, optimizing for EQS can lead to developing more\nrealistic event camera simulators, effectively reducing the simulation gap. EQS\nis available at https://github.com/eventbasedvision/EQS.",

    "abstract": "Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more\nsimplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental\nperspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper,\nwe propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and\ngeneralizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat\nspacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by\nconsidering BMS-like symmetries for \"asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons\",\nor A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector\nfield satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The\nconstruction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of\nthe Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with\ndifferent dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the\nresults by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing\nhorizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a\nlarger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of \"superdilations\". We\nspeculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work,\nincluding the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general\nrelativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in\nterms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter\nspacetime and Killing horizons.",

In this\npaper, we introduce AdaVid, a flexible architectural framework designed to\nlearn efficient video encoders that can dynamically adapt their computational\nfootprint based on available resources. At the heart of AdaVid is an adaptive\ntransformer block, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, which allows\nthe model to adjust its hidden embedding dimension at inference time. We show\nthat AdaVid-EgoVLP, trained on video-narration pairs from the large-scale Ego4D\ndataset, matches the performance of the standard EgoVLP on short video-language\nbenchmarks using only half the compute, and even outperforms EgoVLP when given\nequal computational resources. We further explore the trade-off between frame\ncount and compute on the challenging Diving48 classification benchmark, showing\nthat AdaVid enables the use of more frames without exceeding computational\nlimits. To handle longer videos, we also propose a lightweight hierarchical\nnetwork that aggregates short clip features, achieving a strong balance between\ncompute efficiency and accuracy across several long video benchmarks.",

However, traditional power planning\nhas yet to integrate local economic impact directly into capacity expansion to\nguide optimal siting decisions. Moreover, existing economic assessments tend to\nemphasize local benefits while overlooking the opportunity costs of converting\nproductive farmland for solar development. This study addresses these gaps by\nendogenously incorporating local economic metrics into a power system planning\nmodel to evaluate how economic impacts influence solar siting, accounting for\nthe cost of lost agricultural output. We analyze all counties within the Great\nLakes region, constructing localized supply and marginal benefit curves that\nare embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at\nminimizing system costs and maximizing community economic benefits. Our\nfindings show that counties with larger economies and lower farmland\nproductivity deliver the highest local economic benefit per megawatt (MW) of\ninstalled solar capacity. In Ohio, for example, large counties generate up to\n$34,500 per MW, driven in part by high property tax revenues, while smaller\ncounties yield 31% less. Accounting for the opportunity cost of displaced\nagricultural output reduces local benefits by up to 16%, depending on farmland\nquality. A scenario prioritizing solar investment in counties with higher\neconomic returns increases total economic benefits by $1 billion (or 11%) by\n2040, with solar investment shifting away from Michigan and Wisconsin (down by\n39%) toward Ohio and Indiana (up by 75%), with only a marginal increase of 0.5%\nin system-wide costs.

We finally discuss the prospects of deeper spectroscopic\nobservations of a statistically significant number of bright galaxies to\nquantify the true impact of bursting star formation on the evolution of the\nbright end of the ultraviolet luminosity function at these early epochs.",

    "abstract": "Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve\ncomputationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering\ndata evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new\nknowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models\nfrom scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by\nenabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic\nforgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work\nintroduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on\nrepresentative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering\ndatasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their\nability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results\nshow that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over\nnaive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance\ncomparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by\nnearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.\nThe code and datasets used in this work will be available at:\nhttps://github.com/kmsamuel/cl-for-engineering-release.",

We treat participants as points in a\nspace, which are organised into \"actionable coalitions\". An actionable\ncoalition is any set of participants who collectively have the resources to\ncollaborate (if they choose) to progress according to the system's rules,\nwithout involving any other participants in the system.\n  It turns out that much useful information about the system can be obtained\n\\emph{just} by viewing it as a semitopology and studying its actionable\ncoalitions.

To address this gap, we\nconducted a systematic review of 109 HCI papers using the PRISMA approach. From\nthis literature, we identify four overarching design strategies for AI writing\nsupport: structured guidance, guided exploration, active co-writing, and\ncritical feedback - mapped across the four key cognitive processes in writing:\nplanning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. We complement this analysis\nwith interviews of 15 writers across diverse domains. Our findings reveal that\nwriters' desired levels of AI intervention vary across the writing process:\ncontent-focused writers (e.g., academics) prioritize ownership during planning,\nwhile form-focused writers (e.g., creatives) value control over translating and\nreviewing. Writers' preferences are also shaped by contextual goals, values,\nand notions of originality and authorship. By examining when ownership matters,\nwhat writers want to own, and how AI interactions shape agency, we surface both\nalignment and gaps between research and user needs. Our findings offer\nactionable design guidance for developing human-centered writing tools for\nco-writing with AI, on human terms.",

    "abstract": "Language is not neutral; it frames understanding, structures power, and\nshapes governance. This paper argues that misnomers like cybersecurity and\nartificial intelligence (AI) are more than semantic quirks; they carry\nsignificant governance risks by obscuring human agency, inflating expectations,\nand distorting accountability. Drawing on lessons from cybersecurity's\nlinguistic pitfalls, such as the 'weakest link' narrative, this paper\nhighlights how AI discourse is falling into similar traps with metaphors like\n'alignment,' 'black box,' and 'hallucination.' These terms embed adversarial,\nmystifying, or overly technical assumptions into governance structures. In\nresponse, the paper advocates for a language-first approach to AI governance:\none that interrogates dominant metaphors, foregrounds human roles, and\nco-develops a lexicon that is precise, inclusive, and reflexive. This paper\ncontends that linguistic reform is not peripheral to governance but central to\nthe construction of transparent, equitable, and anticipatory regulatory\nframeworks.",

We present evidence\nfrom two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of\nAI-enabled systems in Germany (n = 1800) and the United States (n = 1756). We\nexamine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and\nreliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational\nimaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and\nconsistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader\ntechnological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both\ncountries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more\nnormatively charged goals -- like fairness and aspirational imaginaries --\nreceive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how\nindividual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political\nideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and\nfree speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S.\nresponses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure\nto AI may consolidate public expectations.

However, these parameters are strongly correlated when\nperforming parameter estimation, which may hamper the enormous potential of GW\nastronomy. We comprehensively explore this problem by performing Bayesian\ninference on synthetic data for a network of current and planned\nsecond-generation GW detectors, and for the third-generation interferometer\nEinstein Telescope~(ET). We quantify the role of the network alignment factor,\ndetector sensitivity, and waveform higher-order modes in breaking this\ndegeneracy. We discuss the crucial role of the binary mass ratio: in\nparticular, we find that ET can efficiently remove the error in the distance as\nlong as the compact binary is asymmetric in mass.",

    "abstract": "Describing general quantum many-body dynamics is a challenging task due to\nthe exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size. The\ntime-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle\nthis task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system\nwithin a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a\ncrucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the\nlong-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally\ndifficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over\nmatrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we\ndevelop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic\norbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising\nmodel, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the\nKolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and\ntrack the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian\nparameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling\nconstant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance\nto quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system\nleaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits\nprovide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body\nevolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical\nchaos.",

However, the rapidly increasing size of foundation\nmodels poses a daunting challenge for accommodating foundation model\nfine-tuning in most commercial devices, which often have limited memory\nbandwidth. Techniques like model sharding and tensor parallelism address this\nissue by distributing computation across multiple devices to meet memory\nrequirements. Nevertheless, these methods do not fully leverage their\nfoundation nature in facilitating the fine-tuning process, resulting in high\ncomputational costs and imbalanced workloads. We introduce a novel Distributed\nDynamic Fine-Tuning (D2FT) framework that strategically orchestrates operations\nacross attention modules based on our observation that not all attention\nmodules are necessary for forward and backward propagation in fine-tuning\nfoundation models. Through three innovative selection strategies, D2FT\nsignificantly reduces the computational workload required for fine-tuning\nfoundation models. Furthermore, D2FT addresses workload imbalances in\ndistributed computing environments by optimizing these selection strategies via\nmultiple knapsack optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed D2FT framework reduces the training computational costs by 40% and\ntraining communication costs by 50% with only 1% to 2% accuracy drops on the\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Stanford Cars datasets. Moreover, the results show\nthat D2FT can be effectively extended to recent LoRA, a state-of-the-art\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning technique.

These\nharmonics exhibit monotonically time-varying amplitudes and instantaneous\nfrequencies, unlike the full eccentric spherical harmonic modes. However,\ncomputing or extracting these harmonics are not straightforward in current\nnumerical relativity (NR) simulations and eccentric waveform models. To address\nthis, Patterson \\textit{et al} have developed a framework to extract the\neccentric harmonics directly from effective-one-body formalism waveforms. In\nthis paper, we build on the ideas presented in Patterson \\textit{et al} and\npropose a data-driven framework, utilizing singular-value decomposition (SVD),\nthat incorporates additional features based on PN intuition to ensure\nmonotonicity in the extracted harmonics. We further demonstrate that the phase\n(frequency) of these harmonics is simply $j\\phi_{\\lambda}+\\phi_{\\rm ecc}$\n($jf_{\\lambda}+f_{\\rm ecc}$) where $\\phi_{\\lambda}$ ($f_{\\lambda}$) is related\nto the secular orbital phase (frequency) and $\\phi_{\\rm ecc}$ ($f_{\\rm ecc}$)\nis an additional phase (frequency) that only depends on the eccentricity. We\nalso provide simple analytical fits to obtain the harmonics as a function of\nthe mean anomaly. These relations may prove useful in constructing faithful\nmodels that can be employed in cheap and efficient searches and parameter\nestimation of eccentric mergers. Our framework is modular and can be extended\nfor any other eccentric waveform models or simulation frameworks. The framework\nis available through the \\texttt{gwMiner} package.",

While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on\ndownstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM\nrepresentations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some\nconcepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause\nthese representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data\nfrequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find\nevidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to\npretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact\ntriplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning\naccuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations.\nThis is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we\ndiscover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms\nwhen the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k\ntimes, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during\npretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear\nrepresentation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term\nwas seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a\ndifferent model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method\nfor estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data\nmodels. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains\nsignal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for\ncontrolling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the\nmodels' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.",

The adaptive KIK error mitigation method has\ndemonstrated significant advantages, including resilience to noise parameter\ntime-drift, applicability to non-Clifford gates, and guaranteed performance\nbounds. However, its reliance on global noise amplification introduces\nlimitations, such as incompatibility with mid-circuit measurements and dynamic\ncircuits, as well as small unaccounted errors due to higher-order Magnus noise\nterms.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved significant success in 3D point cloud\nclassification while relying on large-scale, annotated point cloud datasets,\nwhich are labor-intensive to build. Compared to capturing data with LiDAR\nsensors and then performing annotation, it is relatively easier to sample point\nclouds from CAD models. Yet, data sampled from CAD models is regular, and does\nnot suffer from occlusion and missing points, which are very common for LiDAR\ndata, creating a large domain shift. Therefore, it is critical to develop\nmethods that can generalize well across different point cloud domains. %In this\npaper, we focus on the 3D point cloud domain generalization problem. Existing\n3D domain generalization methods employ point-based backbones to extract point\ncloud features. Yet, by analyzing point utilization of point-based methods and\nobserving the geometry of point clouds from different domains, we have found\nthat a large number of point features are discarded by point-based methods\nthrough the max-pooling operation. This is a significant waste especially\nconsidering the fact that domain generalization is more challenging than\nsupervised learning, and point clouds are already affected by missing points\nand occlusion to begin with. To address these issues, we propose a novel method\nfor 3D point cloud domain generalization, which can generalize to unseen\ndomains of point clouds. Our proposed method employs multiple 2D projections of\na 3D point cloud to alleviate the issue of missing points and involves a simple\nyet effective convolution-based model to extract features. The experiments,\nperformed on the PointDA-10 and Sim-to-Real benchmarks, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms different baselines,\nand can transfer well from synthetic domain to real-world domain.",

Unlike previous methods that struggle with\ncomplex or non-standard topologies, UniRig accurately predicts topologically\nvalid skeleton structures thanks to a new Skeleton Tree Tokenization method\nthat efficiently encodes hierarchical relationships within the skeleton.

Our method works seamlessly across\ndiverse object categories, from detailed anime characters to complex organic\nand inorganic structures, demonstrating its versatility and robustness.

As teachers may be overwhelmed\nby help requests in a classroom, may lack programming expertise themselves, or\nmay be unavailable in independent learning scenarios, automated hint generation\nis desirable. Automated program repair (APR) can provide the foundation for\nthis, but relies on multiple assumptions: (1) APR usually targets isolated\nbugs, but learners may fundamentally misunderstand tasks or request help for\nsubstantially incomplete code. (2) Software tests are required to guide the\nsearch and localize broken blocks, but tests for block-based programs are\ndifferent to those in past APR research: They consist of system tests, and very\nfew of them already fully cover the code. At the same time, they have vastly\nlonger runtimes due to animations and interactions on Scratch programs, which\ninhibits the applicability of search. (3) The plastic surgery hypothesis\nassumes the code necessary for repairs already exists in the codebase.\nBlock-based programs tend to be small and may lack this redundancy. To study if\nAPR of such programs is still feasible, we introduce, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first APR approach for Scratch based on evolutionary search. Our\nRePurr prototype includes novel refinements of fault localization to improve\nthe guidance of test suites, recovers the plastic surgery hypothesis by\nexploiting that learning scenarios provide model and student solutions, and\nreduces the costs of fitness evaluations via test parallelization and\nacceleration.

To alleviate this, we introduce 3D-PointZshotS, a\ngeometry-aware zero-shot segmentation framework that enhances both feature\ngeneration and alignment using latent geometric prototypes (LGPs).\nSpecifically, we integrate LGPs into a generator via a cross-attention\nmechanism, enriching semantic features with fine-grained geometric details. To\nfurther enhance stability and generalization, we introduce a self-consistency\nloss, which enforces feature robustness against point-wise perturbations.\nAdditionally, we re-represent visual and semantic features in a shared space,\nbridging the semantic-visual gap and facilitating knowledge transfer to unseen\nclasses. Experiments on three real-world datasets, namely ScanNet,\nSemanticKITTI, and S3DIS, demonstrate that our method achieves superior\nperformance over four baselines in terms of harmonic mIoU.

In recent\nyears, learning models such as autoencoders (AE) have been studied for CSI\ncompression, aiming to eliminate model assumptions and reduce compression loss.\nHowever, current learning methods are often designed and trained mainly for\nindividual channel scenarios, with limited generalizability across different\nscenarios, of which the channel characteristics are prominently discrepant.\nMotivated by this, we propose a novel AE-based learning method named\nattention-infused autoencoder network (AiANet), which can parallelly and\nadaptively extract channel-wise and spatial features of CSI with an attention\nfusion mechanism. In addition, a locally-aware self-attention mechanism is\ndeveloped to extract both global and local spatial patterns, to better capture\nthe unique CSI features of different scenarios. Moreover, a mixed-training\nscheme is introduced to enable the proposed AiANet to gain generalizability\nacross indoor and outdoor scenarios. Results show that when trained and tested\nin the same scenario, AiANet can substantially outperform the existing AE-based\nmethods such as ACRNet, with an improvement of up to 3.42 dB in terms of\nnormalized mean squared error (NMSE).

Purpose: Our study\naimed to develop an innovative hybrid artificial intelligence/computer aided\ndiagnosis (AI/CADx)-based pipeline to distinguish between benign and malignant\nadnexal masses on ultrasound imaging based upon automatic segmentation and\nechogenic-based classification. Methods: The retrospective study was conducted\non a consecutive dataset of patients with an adnexal mass. There was one image\nper mass. Mass borders were segmented from the background via a supervised\nU-net algorithm. Masses were spatially subdivided automatically into their\nhypo- and hyper-echogenic components by a physics-driven unsupervised\nclustering algorithm. The dataset was separated by patient into a\ntraining/validation set (95 masses; 70%) and an independent held-out test set\n(41 masses; 30%). Eight component-based radiomic features plus a binary measure\nof the presence or absence of solid components were used to train a linear\ndiscriminant analysis classifier to distinguish between malignant and benign\nmasses. Classification performance was evaluated using the area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), along with sensitivity,\nspecificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and accuracy\nat target 95% sensitivity. Results: The cohort included 133 patients with 136\nadnexal masses.

Ongoing HPAI outbreaks on U.S. cattle farms have\nraised concerns about potential spillover of virus from birds to cattle in\nother countries, including Denmark. In the EU, the Bird Flu Radar tool,\ncoordinated by EFSA, monitors the spatio-temporal risk of HPAIV infection in\nwild bird populations. A preparedness tool to assess the spillover risk to the\ncattle industry is currently lacking, despite its critical importance. This\nstudy aims to assess the temporal and spatial risk of HPAI virus (HPAIV)\nspillover from wild birds, particularly waterfowl, into cattle populations in\nDenmark. To support this assessment, a spillover transmission model is\ndeveloped by integrating two well-established surveillance tools, eBird and\nBird Flu Radar, in combination with global cattle density data. The generated\nquantitative risk maps reveal the heterogeneous temporal and spatial\ndistribution of HPAIV spillover risk from wild birds to cattle across Denmark.\nThe highest risk periods are observed during calendar weeks 50 to 10. The\nestimated total number of spillover cases nationwide is 1.93 (95% CI: 0.48,\n4.98) in 2024, and 0.62 cases (95% CI: 0.15, 1.25) in 2025 (up to April).

Even under highly\nconservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training\ndatasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models\nthemselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers.\nIn the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack\nof compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions\nthat could enable fairer practices in the future.",

    "abstract": "Battery degradation is a major challenge in electric vehicles (EV) and energy\nstorage systems (ESS). However, most degradation investigations focus mainly on\nestimating the state of charge (SOC), which fails to accurately interpret the\ncells' internal degradation mechanisms. Differential capacity analysis (DCA)\nfocuses on the rate of change of cell voltage about the change in cell\ncapacity, under various charge/discharge rates. This paper developed a battery\ncell degradation testing model that used two types of lithium-ions (Li-ion)\nbattery cells, namely lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides (LiNiCoAlO2) and\nlithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), to evaluate internal degradation during\nloading conditions. The proposed battery degradation model contains distinct\ncharge rates (DCR) of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, and 1.5C, as well as discharge rates\n(DDR) of 0.5C, 0.9C, 1.3C, and 1.6C to analyze the internal health and\nperformance of battery cells during slow, moderate, and fast loading\nconditions. Besides, this research proposed a model that incorporates the\nExtended Kalman Filter (EKF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to validate experimental data. The proposed\nmodel yields excellent modelling results based on mean squared error (MSE), and\nroot mean squared error (RMSE), with errors of less than 0.001% at DCR and DDR.\nThe peak identification technique (PIM) has been utilized to investigate\nbattery health based on the number of peaks, peak position, peak height, peak\narea, and peak width. At last, the PIM method has discovered that the cell aged\ngradually under normal loading rates but deteriorated rapidly under fast\nloading conditions. Overall, LiFePO4 batteries perform more robustly and\nconsistently than (LiNiCoAlO2) cells under varying loading conditions.",

We divide visits into 4 groups based on the patient's treatment regimen\nbefore the visit, and further divide them into subgroups based on the\nrecommended treatment during the visit. Since each subgroup has observational\ndata, which has confounding bias (sicker patients are prescribed more\naggressive treatments), we used machine learning and optimization to remove\nsome datapoints so that the remaining data resembles a randomized trial. On\neach subgroup, we train AI-backed tree-based models to prescribe treatment\nchanges. Once we train these tree models, we manually combine the models for\nevery group to create an end-to-end prescription pipeline for all patients in\nthat group. In this process, we prioritize stepping up to a more aggressive\ntreatment before considering less aggressive options.

Alternatively, prenatal encounters can be\nused to identify pregnancies, including those with unobserved outcomes.\nHowever, this prenatal approach requires methods to address missing data.\nMethods: We simulated 10,000,000 pregnancies and estimated the total effect of\ninitiating treatment on the risk of preeclampsia. We generated data for 36\nscenarios in which we varied the effect of treatment on miscarriage and/or\npreeclampsia; the percentage with missing outcomes (5% or 20%); and the cause\nof missingness: (1) measured covariates, (2) unobserved miscarriage, and (3) a\nmix of both. We then created three analytic samples to address missing\npregnancy outcomes: observed deliveries, observed deliveries and miscarriages,\nand all pregnancies. Treatment effects were estimated using non-parametric\ndirect standardization. Results: Risk differences (RDs) and risk ratios (RRs)\nfrom the three analytic samples were similarly biased when all missingness was\ndue to unobserved miscarriage (log-transformed RR bias range: -0.12-0.33 among\nobserved deliveries; -0.11-0.32 among observed deliveries and miscarriages; and\n-0.11-0.32 among all pregnancies). When predictors of missingness were\nmeasured, only the all pregnancies approach was unbiased (-0.27-0.33;\n-0.29-0.03; and -0.02-0.01, respectively).

Localization in\nconstruction sites is a particularly challenging problem due to the presence of\nrepetitive features such as flat plastered walls and perceptual aliasing due to\napartments with similar layouts inter and intra floors. In this paper, we focus\non the global re-positioning of a robot with respect to an accurate scanned\nmesh of the building solely using LiDAR data. In our approach, a neural network\nis trained on synthetic LiDAR point clouds generated by simulating a LiDAR in\nan accurate real-life large-scale mesh. We train a diffusion model with a\nPointNet++ backbone, which allows us to model multiple position candidates from\na single LiDAR point cloud. The resulting model can successfully predict the\nglobal position of LiDAR in confined and complex sites despite the adverse\neffects of perceptual aliasing. The learned distribution of potential global\npositions can provide multi-modal position distribution. We evaluate our\napproach across five real-world datasets and show the place recognition\naccuracy of 77% +/-2m on average while outperforming baselines at a factor of 2\nin mean error.",

In this study, we\ninvestigate a large sample of distant edge-on galaxies (approximately 1,000\nobjects) in order to examine the frequency and characteristics of stellar disc\nwarps up to a redshift of $z \\sim 2$. For the selected galaxies, we utilize HST\ndata from the Cosmic Evolution Survey field and JWST observations from the\nCosmic Dawn Center Archive. We measured the properties of disc warps and\ninvestigate their evolution as a function of redshift. Our results indicate a\npotential evolution in the observed frequency of strong S-shaped warps (with an\namplitude greater than 4$^\\circ$) in stellar discs as a function of redshift.\nAt $z \\approx 2$, the frequency of strong warps reaches approximately 50%,\nwhile at $z \\approx 0$, this fraction decreases to around 10-15%. We attribute\nthe observed evolution in the occurrence of strong warps to the changing\nfrequency of galaxy interactions and mergers.

The\ndeveloped filter exploits the nodal plane in acoustic pressure distribution,\neffectively minimizing microphone exposure to targeted ultrasonic frequencies.\nFabrication via stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing ensures high dimensional\naccuracy, which is crucial for high-frequency acoustic filters. Finite element\nmethod (FEM) simulations guided filter optimization for suppression frequencies\nat 40 kHz and 60 kHz, achieving high transmission loss (TL) around 60 dB.\nExperimental validations confirm the filter's superior performance in\nsignificantly reducing spurious acoustic signals, as reflected in frequency\nresponse, beam pattern, and propagation curve measurements. The proposed filter\nensures stable and precise acoustic characterization, independent of\nmeasurement distances and incidence angles. This new approach not only improves\nmeasurement accuracy but also enhances reliability and reproducibility in\nparametric array research and development.",

    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for\nfinetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to\nmethod for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly\ncustomized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a\nmultiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire\nturn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can\nbegin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter\narchitecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the\ntokens in the sequence \\emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked.

This enables building what we call \\emph{intrinsics},\ni.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions\nof an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by\ndefault. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating\ncompetitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference\nbenefits.

Second, the framework introduces a scalable adapter with stacked\ntransformer encoders, which effectively processes open-domain character\nfeatures and seamlessly interacts with the latent space of modern diffusion\ntransformers. Third, to effectively train the framework, we construct a\nlarge-scale character dataset containing 10-million-level samples. The dataset\nis systematically organized into paired (multi-view character) and unpaired\n(text-image combinations) subsets. This dual-data structure enables\nsimultaneous optimization of identity consistency and textual editability\nthrough distinct learning pathways.

Obtaining predictions is challenging and primarily limited by\nour ability to simulate scattering between DM and baryonic particles within\nN-body and hydrodynamics simulations. We have developed the first scheme\nallowing for the simulation of these interacting dark matter (IDM) models,\naccurately accounting for their angular and velocity dependence, as well as the\nmass ratio between the DM and baryonic scattering partners. To describe\nDM-baryon interactions, we used an N-body code together with its implementation\nof smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and meshless finite mass. The interaction is\nrealised in a pairwise fashion by creating a virtual scattering partner from\nthe baryonic particle and allowing it to interact with a DM particle using a\nscattering routine initially developed for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM).\nAfter the interaction, the virtual particle is rejoined with the baryonic\nparticle, fulfilling the requirements of energy and momentum conservation.\nThrough several test problems, we demonstrated that we are able to reproduce\nthe analytic solutions with our IDM scheme. This includes a test for scattering\nwith a physical mass ratio of 1:1000, which is beyond the limits of SIDM\nsimulations. We comment on various numerical aspects and challenges, and we\ndescribe the limitations of our numerical scheme. Furthermore, we study the\nimpact of IDM on halo formation with a collapsing over-density. We find that it\nis possible to accurately model IDM within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations\ncommonly used in astrophysics.

As applications of this general\nframework, we calculate the two-point correlator between pairs of jets on the\ndataspace, and the measure of the non-Gaussian fluctuations in a finite\ndataset. For the non-Gaussianities, our calculations validate the existence of\na universal structure that had been previously observed in simulated data. As\nbyproducts of this analysis, we also calculate the two-loop anomalous dimension\nof the SEMD metric and show that the original Energy Mover's Distance metric is\nidentical to the SEMD through next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.",

The\nintersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising\ntransition is a novel tricritical point.

    "abstract": "A variety of dust attenuation/extinction curves have been observed in\nhigh-redshift galaxies, with mixed results regarding their correlations with\nglobal galaxy properties. These variations are likely driven by factors such as\nintrinsic dust properties, total dust content, and the dust-star geometry. In\nthis work, we explore how the shape of dust attenuation curves-quantified by\nthe UV-optical slope (S) and UV bump strength (B)-correlates with galaxy\nproperties. Our goal is to identify the key physical mechanisms shaping\nattenuation curves through cosmic time. We build on arXiv:2402.05996, analyzing\n173 dusty galaxies at z ~ 2-11.5, with attenuation curves inferred via SED\nfitting of JWST data using a modified version of BAGPIPES (arXiv:2304.11178).\nWe investigate trends between S, B, and properties inferred from SED fitting:\nAV, SFR, stellar mass (M*), specific SFR (sSFR), mass-weighted stellar age\n(a*), ionization parameter (U), and metallicity (Z). For a subset, we also\nconsider oxygen abundance (12 + log(O/H)), derived via Te-based methods. We\nfind that lower AV galaxies tend to have steeper slopes and stronger UV bumps,\nconsistent with radiative transfer predictions involving dust geometry and\ncontent. S also correlates with a* and sSFR, suggesting that strong radiation\nfields in young, bursty galaxies may destroy small grains, flattening the\nslope. B correlates with 12 + log(O/H), possibly due to metallicity-driven dust\ncomposition changes. Overall, attenuation curve shapes appear most strongly\nlinked to: (1) redshift (dust evolution), (2) AV (RT effects), (3) a* or sSFR\n(radiation field), and (4) oxygen abundance (dust composition). Disentangling\nthese effects requires spatially resolved data and theoretical models including\ndust evolution.",

However, it\nis not clear from this numerical data how to obtain an explicit formula for the\nmurmuration density. Convergence of similar averages was proved by Zubrilina\n[32] for modular forms of weight 2 (of which elliptic curves form a thin\nsubset) and analogous results for other families of automorphic forms have been\nobtained in further work [6,23]. Each of these works gives an explicit formula\nfor the murmuration density. We consider a variant problem where the elliptic\ncurves are ordered by naive height, and the $p$th coefficients are averaged\nover $p/N$ in a fixed interval. We give a conjecture for the murmuration\ndensity in this case, as an explicit but complicated sum of Bessel functions.\nThis conjecture is motivated by a theorem about a variant problem where we sum\nthe $n$th coefficients for $n$ with no small prime factors against a smooth\nweight function. We test this conjecture for elliptic curves of naive height up\nto $2^{28}$ and find good agreement with the data. The theorem is proved using\nthe Voronoi summation formula, and the method should apply to many different\nfamilies of $L$-functions. This is the first work to give an explicit formula\nfor the murmuration density of a family of elliptic curves, in any ordering.",

In a three-class\ndisease setting, the volume under the receiver operating characteristic surface\nand the three-class Youden index are commonly used summary measures of a\nbiomarker's discriminatory ability. However, these measures rely on a\nstochastic ordering assumption for the distributions of biomarker outcomes\nacross the three groups. This assumption can be restrictive, particularly when\ncovariates are involved, and its violation may lead to incorrect conclusions\nabout a biomarker's ability to distinguish between the three disease classes.\nEven when a stochastic ordering exists, the order may vary across different\nbiomarkers in discovery studies involving dozens or even thousands of candidate\nbiomarkers, complicating automated ranking. To address these challenges and\ncomplement existing measures, we propose the underlap coefficient, a novel\nsummary index of a biomarker's ability to distinguish between three (or more)\ndisease groups, and study its properties. Additionally, we introduce Bayesian\nnonparametric estimators for both the unconditional underlap coefficient and\nits covariate-specific counterpart.

    "abstract": "We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a\nclass of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization\n- corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED\nof Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into\nnon-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time\nbehavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a\ncoarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the\nMinkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied\nvariant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson\ntransmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We\nthen apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived\nbound states - \"Schwinger atoms\" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed\ncentral charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give\nrise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others\nsuch formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a\nrigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite\ncomputational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation\ntoward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a\nconstruction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum\nsimulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results\ndemonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for\nprobing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.",

However, this model may suffer from\ntheoretical problems, since it requires a large initial field value,\nthreatening the validity of the effective field theory. This is quantified by\nthe Swampland Distance Conjecture, which predicts the appearance of a tower of\nlight states associated with an effective ultra-violet cutoff. This could be\nlower than the inflation scale for cases with an extended period of inflation,\nleading to an additional problem of initial conditions. No-scale supergravity\nmodels can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model and accommodate\nthe CMB data at the expense of fine-tuning of parameters at the level of\n$10^{-5}$. Here, we propose a solution to this problem based on an explicit\nrealisation of the Starobinsky model in string theory, where this `deformation'\nparameter is calculable and takes a value of order of the one corresponding to\nthe Starobinsky inflaton potential. Within this range, there are parameter\nvalues that accommodate more easily the combination of Planck, ACT and DESI BAO\ndata, while also restricting the range of possible inflaton field values,\nthereby avoiding the swampland problem and predicting that the initial\nconditions for inflation compatible with the CMB data are generic.",

In a series of papers, it has been shown that for every\n$q \\geq 3$, the $q$-Coloring problem parameterized by the vertex cover number\n$k$ admits a kernel of bit-size $\\widetilde{O}(k^{q-1})$, but admits no kernel\nof bit-size $O(k^{q-1-\\varepsilon})$ for $\\varepsilon >0$ unless $\\mathsf{NP}\n\\subseteq \\mathsf{coNP/poly}$ (Jansen and Kratsch, 2013; Jansen and Pieterse,\n2019).

While advanced\nmachine learning and deep learning algorithms excel at analyzing EO imagery\ndata, they often overlook crucial geospatial metadata information that could\nenhance scalability and accuracy across regional, continental, and global\nscales. To address this limitation, we propose BRIDGE-LC (Bi-level\nRepresentation Integration for Disentangled GEospatial Land Cover), a novel\ndeep learning framework that integrates multi-scale geospatial information into\nthe land cover classification process. By simultaneously leveraging\nfine-grained (latitude/longitude) and coarse-grained (biogeographical region)\nspatial information, our lightweight multi-layer perceptron architecture learns\nfrom both during training but only requires fine-grained information for\ninference, allowing it to disentangle region-specific from region-agnostic land\ncover features while maintaining computational efficiency. To assess the\nquality of our framework, we use an open-access in-situ dataset and adopt\nseveral competing classification approaches commonly considered for large-scale\nland cover mapping. We evaluated all approaches through two scenarios: an\nextrapolation scenario in which training data encompasses samples from all\nbiogeographical regions, and a leave-one-region-out scenario where one region\nis excluded from training. We also explore the spatial representation learned\nby our model, highlighting a connection between its internal manifold and the\ngeographical information used during training. Our results demonstrate that\nintegrating geospatial information improves land cover mapping performance,\nwith the most substantial gains achieved by jointly leveraging both fine- and\ncoarse-grained spatial information.",

The study of\nthis graph quantity is motivated by applications in distributed storage and by\nits intimate relations to the index coding problem from the area of network\ninformation theory. In the latter, one wishes to minimize the amount of\ninformation that has to be transmitted to a collection of receivers, in a way\nthat enables each of them to discover its required data using some prior side\ninformation.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of the Storage Capacity and Index Coding\nproblems from the perspective of parameterized complexity.

    "abstract": "The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin\nglasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take\nplace in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the\naging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in\nan unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any\npreviously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve\nan analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has\nrecently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the\ndynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new\nintegration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large\nintegration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin\nmodel, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero\ntemperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for\nstrong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin\nglass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium\ndynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is\nnever forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to\nconfigurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging\ndynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.",

It is widely reported that\nanisotropic MAEs exhibit much stronger magneto-mechanical coupling than\nisotropic MAEs. However, most efforts to model effective magneto-mechanical\nproperties of MAEs via homogenization focused on isotropic microstructures or\nthose with large separations between particles, to use analytical solutions. In\nthis work, we introduce a periodic homogenization approach to compute effective\nmagneto-mechanical properties of anisotropic MAEs, and analyze microstructural\nfeatures that enhance the magneto-mechanical coupling. Using the finite element\nmethod, we numerically determine the effect of particle shape, gap, and voids\non the effective stiffness, permeability, and magneto-mechanical coupling\ntensors for chain-like periodic microstructures. Using insights gained from the\nfull-field simulations, we derive an analytical expression for the\nmagneto-mechanical coupling in the chain direction, in terms of the volume\nfraction, gap size, and properties of the matrix and particles. Results show\nthat the overall magnetostriction of anisotropic MAEs is most sensitive to the\ngap between particles and the waviness of the particle chains, with smaller gap\nsizes and straighter chains yielding higher overall magnetostriction.\nSimulations also show that while isotropic MAEs elongate in a uniform magnetic\nfield, anisotropic MAEs contract with much larger strain amplitudes, a result\nof the attractive forces between particles being much stronger in anisotropic\nMAEs than in isotropic MAEs. Results provide fundamental insights into the\nmechanisms that govern magneto-mechanical coupling in anisotropic MAEs, and\nconstitute a toolbox of homogenized MAE material properties.",

However, benchmarks and tooling to comprehensively evaluate LLMs for\nHLS design tasks remain scarce.\n  To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first complete benchmark and\nevaluation framework for LLM-driven HLS design. HLS-Eval targets two core\ntasks: (1) generating HLS code from natural language descriptions, and (2)\nperforming HLS-specific code edits to optimize performance and hardware\nefficiency. The benchmark includes 94 unique designs drawn from standard HLS\nbenchmarks and novel sources. Each case is prepared via a semi-automated flow\nthat produces a natural language description and a paired testbench for\nC-simulation and synthesis validation, ensuring each task is \"LLM-ready.\"\n  Beyond the benchmark, HLS-Eval offers a modular Python framework for\nautomated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs. It includes a\nparallel evaluation engine, direct HLS tool integration, and abstractions for\nto support different LLM interaction paradigms, enabling rapid prototyping of\nnew benchmarks, tasks, and LLM methods.\n  We demonstrate HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of open-source LLMs on\nVitis HLS, measuring outputs across four key metrics - parseability,\ncompilability, runnability, and synthesizability - reflecting the iterative HLS\ndesign cycle.

    "abstract": "The mean-variance portfolio model, based on the risk-return trade-off for\noptimal asset allocation, remains foundational in portfolio optimization.\nHowever, its reliance on restrictive assumptions about asset return\ndistributions limits its applicability to real-world data. Parametric copula\nstructures provide a novel way to overcome these limitations by accounting for\nasymmetry, heavy tails, and time-varying dependencies. Existing methods have\nbeen shown to rely on fixed or static dependence structures, thus overlooking\nthe dynamic nature of the financial market. In this study, a semiparametric\nmodel is proposed that combines non-parametrically estimated copulas with\nparametrically estimated marginals to allow all parameters to dynamically\nevolve over time. A novel framework was developed that integrates time-varying\ndependence modeling with flexible empirical beta copula structures. Marginal\ndistributions were modeled using the Skewed Generalized T family. This\neffectively captures asymmetry and heavy tails and makes the model suitable for\npredictive inferences in real world scenarios. Furthermore, the model was\napplied to rolling windows of financial returns from the USA, India and Hong\nKong economies to understand the influence of dynamic market conditions. The\napproach addresses the limitations of models that rely on parametric\nassumptions. By accounting for asymmetry, heavy tails, and cross-correlated\nasset prices, the proposed method offers a robust solution for optimizing\ndiverse portfolios in an interconnected financial market.

In this\nstudy, we analyzed 658,078 artifacts, of which 635,003 had at least one\nrelease. Among these, 93,101 artifacts (15.4%) were identified as independent\n(in-degree = 0), while the rest were classified as dependent. We looked at the\nimpact of separate artifacts using PageRank and out-degree centrality and\ndiscovered that they were very important to the ecosystem. Further analysis\nacross 18 different metrics revealed several advantages and comparability of\nindependent artifacts with dependent artifacts: comparable popularity (25.58\nvs. 7.30), fewer vulnerabilities (60 CVEs vs. 179 CVEs), and zero propagated\nvulnerabilities. Based on these results, it seems that independent artifacts\nmake a big difference in the ecosystem and give developers a safe,\nself-contained alternative to traditional dependencies. These findings suggest\nthat independent artifacts might be a beneficial choice for dependencies but\nhave some maintainability issues. Therefore, developers should carefully\nincorporate independent artifacts into their projects, and artifact maintainers\nshould prioritize this group of artifacts to mitigate the risk of transitive\nvulnerability propagation and improve software sustainability.",

    "abstract": "The two-metric projection method is a simple yet elegant algorithm proposed\nby Bertsekas to address bound/box-constrained optimization problems. The\nalgorithm's low per-iteration cost and potential for using Hessian information\nmake it a favorable computation method for this problem class. Inspired by this\nalgorithm, we propose a two-metric adaptive projection method for solving the\n$\\ell_1$-norm regularization problem that inherits these advantages. We\ndemonstrate that the method is theoretically sound - it has global convergence.\nFurthermore, it is capable of manifold identification and has superlinear\nconvergence rate under the error bound condition and strict complementarity.\nTherefore, given sparsity in the solution, the method enjoys superfast\nconvergence in iteration while maintaining scalability, making it desirable for\nlarge-scale problems. We also equip the algorithm with competitive complexity\nto solve nonconvex problems. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate\nthe advantages of this algorithm implied by the theory compared to other\ncompetitive methods, especially in large-scale scenarios. In contrast to the\noriginal two-metric projection method, our algorithm directly solves the\n$\\ell_1$-norm minimization problem without resorting to the intermediate\nreformulation as a bound-constrained problem, so it circumvents the issue of\nnumerical instability.",

Inspired by this temporal non-uniformity, we\npropose VGDFR, a training-free approach for Diffusion-based Video Generation\nwith Dynamic Latent Frame Rate. VGDFR adaptively adjusts the number of elements\nin latent space based on the motion frequency of the latent space content,\nusing fewer tokens for low-frequency segments while preserving detail in\nhigh-frequency segments. Specifically, our key contributions are: (1) A dynamic\nframe rate scheduler for DiT video generation that adaptively assigns frame\nrates for video segments. (2) A novel latent-space frame merging method to\nalign latent representations with their denoised counterparts before merging\nthose redundant in low-resolution space. (3) A preference analysis of Rotary\nPositional Embeddings (RoPE) across DiT layers, informing a tailored RoPE\nstrategy optimized for semantic and local information capture.

The spin\ndistribution can self-arrange into an array of half-skyrmions and we also find\na half-antiskyrmion fence separating vortex-antivortex pairs. Our study\nindicates that one can manipulate the emergence of exotic quantum states via\nthe interplay of the SOC, interaction and potential geometry and the abundant\nstate variations might also provide potential resources for quantum metrology.",

Our method computes a finite\nstutter-insensitive bisimulation quotient of the system under analysis,\nrepresented as a decision tree.

Our technique is sound,\nentirely automated, and yields abstractions that are succinct and effective for\nformal verification and system diagnostics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our\nmethod on diverse benchmarks comprising concurrent software, communication\nprotocols and robotic scenarios.

Moreover, the randomness and variability of moir\\'e\npattern generation pose challenges to the robustness of existing methods when\napplied to real-world data. To address these issues, this paper presents SIDME\n(Self-supervised Image Demoir\\'eing via Masked Encoder-Decoder Reconstruction),\na novel model designed to generate high-quality visual images by effectively\nprocessing moir\\'e patterns. SIDME combines a masked encoder-decoder\narchitecture with self-supervised learning, allowing the model to reconstruct\nimages using the inherent properties of camera sampling frequencies. A key\ninnovation is the random masked image reconstructor, which utilizes an\nencoder-decoder structure to handle the reconstruction task. Furthermore, since\nthe green channel in camera sampling has a higher sampling frequency compared\nto red and blue channels, a specialized self-supervised loss function is\ndesigned to improve the training efficiency and effectiveness. To ensure the\ngeneralization ability of the model, a self-supervised moir\\'e image generation\nmethod has been developed to produce a dataset that closely mimics real-world\nconditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDME outperforms existing\nmethods in processing real moir\\'e pattern data, showing its superior\ngeneralization performance and robustness.",

We also analyze the\nupdated panchromatic afterglow data to find that there is no significant\nevidence for any new afterglow component (e.g. due to the ejecta that gave rise\nto the kilonova) and that the jet must be still in a mildly relativistic phase.\nThe decline in the afterglow light curve is significantly shallower compared to\nthat expected from the standard synchrotron afterglow jet models with sideways\nspreading, indicating either an additional energy injection at late times or\nthe velocity dependence on the microphysics parameters.

First, many models prioritize predictive accuracy but overlook\nhuman-centered machine learning principles, limiting trust among students and\nreducing their usefulness for educators and institutional decision-makers.\nSecond, most models require at least a month of data before making reliable\npredictions, delaying opportunities for early intervention. Third, current\nmodels primarily rely on sporadically collected, classroom-derived data,\nmissing broader behavioral patterns that could provide more continuous and\nactionable insights.

In this work, we focus on\n3D Keller-Segel equation with a quadratic logistic damping term $-\\mu \\rho^2$\n(modeling density-dependent mortality rate) and show the existence of\nfinite-time blowup solutions with nonnegative density and finite mass for any\n$\\mu \\in \\big[0,\\frac{1}{3}\\big)$. This range of $\\mu$ is sharp; for $\\mu \\ge\n\\frac{1}{3}$, the logistic damping effect suppresses the blowup as shown in\n[Kang-Stevens, 2016] and [Tello-Winkler, 2007]. A key ingredient is to\nconstruct a self-similar blowup solution to a related aggregation equation as\nan approximate solution, with subcritical scaling relative to the original\nmodel. Based on this construction, we employ a robust weighted $L^2$ method to\nprove the stability of this approximate solution, where modulation ODEs are\nintroduced to enforce local vanishing conditions for the perturbation lying in\na singular-weighted $L^2$ space. As a byproduct, we exhibit a new family of\ntype I blowup mechanisms for the classical 3D Keller-Segel equation.",

In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions\nbecomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition $g$-modes\nin the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we\nintroduce the dynamical sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent\ngeneralization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring\nforce and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak\nreaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the\ncomplex frequencies of composition $g$-modes with finite-temperature profiles.\nWe find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with\ntemperature and can completely suppress composition $g$-modes. In contrast, the\n$f$-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly\ndivergence-free character.

This approach is limited due to the compute time required\nfor a solution. When faced with an emerging biothreat, public health decisions\nneed to be made quickly and solutions for integrating near real-time data with\nanalytic tools are needed.\n  We propose an integrated Bayesian UQ framework for agent-based models based\non sequential Monte Carlo sampling.

These estimates of the spread of a disease may be provided to\npublic health agencies seeking to abate the spread.\n  By coupling agent-based simulations with Bayesian modeling in a data\nassimilation, our proposed framework provides a powerful tool for modeling\ndynamical systems in silico. We propose a method which reduces model error and\nprovides a range of realistic possible outcomes. Moreover, our method addresses\ntwo primary limitations of ABMs: the lack of UQ and an inability to assimilate\ndata.

The interplay\nbetween exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and dipolar couplings in determining\nthe chirality of spin waves is discussed. When the magnetization is saturated\nalong an axis, the spin waves propagating along it are symmetric under the\ninversion of the wave vector. However, magnetochirality, mainly driven by\nexchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya couplings, is observed in the azimuthal\nstanding modes. In the vortex state, frequency nonreciprocity occurs for waves\npropagating along the tube, while the azimuthal modes remain reciprocal. For\npositive Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and depending on the helicity of\nthe vortex, the asymmetry induced by the dipolar interaction is reinforced,\nwhereas a negative coupling opposes this asymmetry. The influence of radial\nanisotropy is also examined. It is found that radial anisotropy reduces the\nfrequency of the modes and shifts the dispersion minimum to a finite wave\nvector in the vortex state.

Thus, verifying the integrity of\ncomputation is important in the client-server setting. The cryptographic method\nknown as Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is renowned for facilitating private and\nverifiable computing. ZKP allows the client to validate that the results from\nthe server are computed correctly without violating the privacy of the server's\nintellectual property. Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of\nKnowledge (zkSNARKs), in particular, has been widely applied in various\napplications like blockchain and verifiable machine learning. Despite their\npopularity, existing zkSNARKs approaches remain highly computationally\nintensive. For instance, even basic operations like matrix multiplication\nrequire an extensive number of constraints, resulting in significant overhead.\nIn addressing this challenge, we introduce \\textit{zkVC}, which optimizes the\nZKP computation for matrix multiplication, enabling rapid proof generation on\nthe server side and efficient verification on the client side. zkVC integrates\noptimized ZKP modules, such as Constraint-reduced Polynomial Circuit (CRPC) and\nPrefix-Sum Query (PSQ), collectively yielding a more than 12-fold increase in\nproof speed over prior methods.

    "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning\ncapabilities that benefits from online reinforcement learning (RL). These\ncapabilities have primarily been demonstrated within the left-to-right\nautoregressive (AR) generation paradigm. In contrast, non-autoregressive\nparadigms based on diffusion generate text in a coarse-to-fine manner. Although\nrecent diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have achieved competitive\nlanguage modeling performance compared to their AR counterparts, it remains\nunclear if dLLMs can also leverage recent advances in LLM reasoning. To this\nend, we propose d1, a framework to adapt pre-trained masked dLLMs into\nreasoning models via a combination of supervised finetuning (SFT) and RL.\nSpecifically, we develop and extend techniques to improve reasoning in\npretrained dLLMs: (a) we utilize a masked SFT technique to distill knowledge\nand instill self-improvement behavior directly from existing datasets, and (b)\nwe introduce a novel critic-free, policy-gradient based RL algorithm called\ndiffu-GRPO, the first integration of policy gradient methods to masked dLLMs.\nThrough empirical studies, we investigate the performance of different\npost-training recipes on multiple mathematical and planning benchmarks. We find\nthat d1 yields the best performance and significantly improves performance of a\nstate-of-the-art dLLM. Our code is released at\nhttps://dllm-reasoning.github.io/.",

We propose an uncertainty-guided, coarse-to-fine segmentation\nframework that combines full-volume tumor localization with refined\nregion-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, enhanced by anatomically aware\npost-processing. The first-stage model generates a coarse prediction, followed\nby anatomically informed filtering based on lung overlap, proximity to lung\nsurfaces, and component size. The resulting ROIs are segmented by a\nsecond-stage model trained with uncertainty-aware loss functions to improve\naccuracy and boundary calibration in ambiguous regions. Experiments on private\nand public datasets demonstrate improvements in Dice and Hausdorff scores, with\nfewer false positives and enhanced spatial interpretability. These results\nhighlight the value of combining uncertainty modeling and anatomical priors in\ncascaded segmentation pipelines for robust and clinically meaningful tumor\ndelineation.

It has been shown to influence human\nperception and decision-making, often leading to biased judgments that favor\nthose deemed attractive in what is referred to as the \"attractiveness halo\neffect\". While extensively studied in human judgments in a broad set of\ndomains, including hiring, judicial sentencing or credit granting, the role\nthat attractiveness plays in the assessments and decisions made by multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) is unknown. To address this gap, we conduct an\nempirical study with 7 diverse open-source MLLMs evaluated on 91 socially\nrelevant scenarios and a diverse dataset of 924 face images - corresponding to\n462 individuals both with and without beauty filters applied to them. Our\nanalysis reveals that attractiveness impacts the decisions made by MLLMs in\n86.2% of the scenarios on average, demonstrating substantial bias in model\nbehavior in what we refer to as an attractiveness bias. Similarly to humans, we\nfind empirical evidence of the existence of the attractiveness halo effect in\n94.8% of the relevant scenarios: attractive individuals are more likely to be\nattributed positive traits, such as intelligence or confidence, by MLLMs than\nunattractive individuals. Furthermore, we uncover gender, age and race biases\nin a significant portion of the scenarios which are also impacted by\nattractiveness, particularly in the case of gender, highlighting the\nintersectional nature of the algorithmic attractiveness bias. Our findings\nsuggest that societal stereotypes and cultural norms intersect with perceptions\nof attractiveness in MLLMs in a complex manner.

So far, the dynamical impact of bipolar outflows on the\ncommon-envelope phase remains uncertain and we aim to quantify its importance.\nWe illustrate the impact on common-envelope evolution by comparing two\nsimulations -- one with magnetic fields and one without -- using the\nthree-dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO. We focus on the\nspecific case of a $10 M_\\odot$ red supergiant star with a $5 M_\\odot$ black\nhole companion. By the end of the magnetohydrodynamic simulations (after $\\sim\n1220$ orbits of the core binary system), about $6.4 \\%$ of the envelope mass is\nejected via the bipolar outflow, contributing to angular momentum extraction\nfrom the disk structure and core binary. The resulting enhanced torques reduce\nthe final orbital separation by about $24 \\%$ compared to the hydrodynamical\nscenario, while the overall envelope ejection remains dominated by\nrecombination-driven equatorial winds. We analyze field amplification and\noutflow launching mechanisms, confirming consistency with earlier studies:\nmagnetic fields are amplified by shear flows, and outflows are launched by a\nmagneto-centrifugal process, supported by local shocks and magnetic pressure\ngradients. These outflows originate from $\\sim 1.1$ times the orbital\nseparation. We conclude that the magnetically driven outflows and their role in\nthe dynamical interaction are a universal aspect, and we further propose an\nadaptation of the $\\alpha_\\mathrm{CE}$-formalism by adjusting the final orbital\nenergy with a factor of $1+ M_\\mathrm{out}/\\mu$, where $M_\\mathrm{out}$ is the\nmass ejected through the outflows and $\\mu$ the reduced mass of the core\nbinary.

A\nkey challenge is the lack of diverse, large scale training data that captures\nthe complexities of low-light conditions and imaging pipelines. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel image signal processing (ISP) driven data synthesis pipeline\nthat addresses these challenges by generating unlimited paired training data.\nSpecifically, our pipeline begins with easily collected high-quality\nnormal-light images, which are first unprocessed into the RAW format using a\nreverse ISP. We then synthesize low-light degradations directly in the RAW\ndomain. The resulting data is subsequently processed through a series of ISP\nstages, including white balance adjustment, color space conversion, tone\nmapping, and gamma correction, with controlled variations introduced at each\nstage. This broadens the degradation space and enhances the diversity of the\ntraining data, enabling the generated data to capture a wide range of\ndegradations and the complexities inherent in the ISP pipeline.

The increasing emphasis on data quantity in research infrastructures\nhas highlighted the need for equally robust mechanisms ensuring data quality,\nparticularly in bibliographic and citation datasets. This paper addresses the\nchallenge of maintaining high-quality open research information within\nOpenCitations, a community-guided Open Science Infrastructure, by introducing\ntools for validating and monitoring bibliographic metadata and citation data.\n  Methods. We developed a custom validation tool tailored to the OpenCitations\nData Model (OCDM), designed to detect and explain ingestion errors from\nheterogeneous sources, whether due to upstream data inconsistencies or internal\nsoftware bugs. Additionally, a quality monitoring tool was created to track\nknown data issues post-publication. These tools were applied in two scenarios:\n(1) validating metadata and citations from Matilda, a potential future source,\nand (2) monitoring data quality in the existing OpenCitations Meta dataset.\n  Results. The validation tool successfully identified a variety of structural\nand semantic issues in the Matilda dataset, demonstrating its precision. The\nmonitoring tool enabled the detection of recurring problems in the\nOpenCitations Meta collection, as well as their quantification. Together, these\ntools proved effective in enhancing the reliability of OpenCitations' published\ndata.\n  Conclusion. The presented validation and monitoring tools represent a step\ntoward ensuring high-quality bibliographic data in open research\ninfrastructures, though they are limited to the data model adopted by\nOpenCitations.

For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a\nmoderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a N\\'eel\nantiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a\nplanar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling.

Rather than match\ndetections across time, poses are updated directly from a new input image,\nwhich enables online tracking through occlusion.

Our method leverages\na tagging-based approach to generate structure-aware positive samples and\nutilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate counterfactual negative\nsamples with diverse sentence patterns. By applying contrastive learning, SALAD\nenables the model to focus on learning the structural relationships between key\nsentence components while minimizing reliance on spurious correlations. We\nvalidate our approach through experiments on three tasks: Sentiment\nClassification, Sexism Detection, and Natural Language Inference.

However,\nthe primary focus is often placed solely on optimality. This implies that while\nobtained solutions are globally optimal, they are frequently not comprehensible\nto humans, in particular when obtained by black-box routines. In contrast,\nexplainability is a standard requirement for results in Artificial\nIntelligence, but it is rarely considered in optimization yet. There are only a\nfew studies that aim to find solutions that are both of high quality and\nexplainable. In recent work, explainability for optimization was defined in a\ndata-driven manner: a solution is considered explainable if it closely\nresembles solutions that have been used in the past under similar\ncircumstances. To this end, it is crucial to identify a preferably small subset\nof features from a presumably large set that can be used to explain a solution.\nIn mathematical optimization, feature selection has received little attention\nyet. In this work, we formally define the feature selection problem for\nexplainable optimization and prove that its decision version is NP-complete. We\nintroduce mathematical models for optimized feature selection. As their global\nsolution requires significant computation time with modern mixed-integer linear\nsolvers, we employ local heuristics.

The characteristic curvature radiation spectrum has been updated from\nthe well known one-dimensional dependence into a general two-dimensional form,\nand contribution from each soliton along observer's line of sight (LOS) has\nbeen added to reproduce the pulsar emission. The outflowing plasma is formed by\nsparking discharges above the stellar surface that are located within\nconcentric rings resembling the core-cone emission beam, and uniform\ndistribution of solitons along any LOS has been assumed. The observed effects\nof radius to frequency mapping, where the lower frequency emission originates\nfrom higher altitudes, is seen in this setup. The power law spectrum and\nrelative steepening of the core spectra with respect to the cones also emerges.\nThe estimated polarization position angle reflects the geometrical\nconfiguration of pulsars as expected.

The question then arises whether this notion in fact\nthat of a monoid in a suitable sense. Category theorists have answered this\nquestion by providing a notion of monoid in a monoidal category, or more\ngenerally in a multicategory. While this encompasses many examples, it is\nunsuitable in other cases, such as the notion of relative monad, and the\nmodelling of call-by-push-value sequencing. In each of these examples, the\nleftmost and/or the rightmost factor of a multiplication or associativity law\nseems to be distinguished. To include such examples, we generalize the\nmulticategorical framework in two stages. Firstly, we move to the framework of\na left-skew multicategory (due to Bourke and Lack), which generalizes both\nmulticategory and left-skew monoidal category. The notion of monoid in this\nframework encompasses examples where only the leftmost factor is distinguished,\nsuch as the notion of relative monad. Secondly, we consider monoids in the\nnovel framework of a bi-skew multicategory. This encompasses examples where\nboth the leftmost and the rightmost factor are distinguished, such as the\nnotion of a category on a span, and the modelling of call-by-push-value\nsequencing. In the bi-skew framework (which is the most general), we give a\ncoherence result saying that a monoid corresponds to an unbiased monoid, i.e. a\nmap from the unit bi-skew multicategory.",

    "abstract": "In many applications, especially those involving prediction, models may yield\nnear-optimal performance yet significantly disagree on individual-level\noutcomes. This phenomenon, known as predictive multiplicity, has been formally\ndefined in binary, probabilistic, and multi-target classification, and\nundermines the reliability of predictive systems. However, its implications\nremain unexplored in the context of survival analysis, which involves\nestimating the time until a failure or similar event while properly handling\ncensored data. We frame predictive multiplicity as a critical concern in\nsurvival-based models and introduce formal measures -- ambiguity, discrepancy,\nand obscurity -- to quantify it. This is particularly relevant for downstream\ntasks such as maintenance scheduling, where precise individual risk estimates\nare essential. Understanding and reporting predictive multiplicity helps build\ntrust in models deployed in high-stakes environments. We apply our methodology\nto benchmark datasets from predictive maintenance, extending the notion of\nmultiplicity to survival models. Our findings show that ambiguity steadily\nincreases, reaching up to 40-45% of observations; discrepancy is lower but\nexhibits a similar trend; and obscurity remains mild and concentrated in a few\nmodels. These results demonstrate that multiple accurate survival models may\nyield conflicting estimations of failure risk and degradation progression for\nthe same equipment. This highlights the need to explicitly measure and\ncommunicate predictive multiplicity to ensure reliable decision-making in\nprocess health management.",

This has spurred the development\nof (Bayesian) methods that use these generative models for inverse problems in\nimage restoration, such as denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution. In\nrecent years, generative modeling for Bayesian inference on sensory data has\nalso gained traction. Nevertheless, the direct application of generative\nmodeling techniques initially designed for natural images on raw sensory data\nis not straightforward, requiring solutions that deal with high dynamic range\nsignals acquired from multiple sensors or arrays of sensors that interfere with\neach other, and that typically acquire data at a very high rate. Moreover, the\nexact physical data-generating process is often complex or unknown. As a\nconsequence, approximate models are used, resulting in discrepancies between\nmodel predictions and the observations that are non-Gaussian, in turn\ncomplicating the Bayesian inverse problem. Finally, sensor data is often used\nin real-time processing or decision-making systems, imposing stringent\nrequirements on, e.g., latency and throughput.

To address\nthese issues, we propose KAN-MCP, a novel framework that integrates the\ninterpretability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with the robustness of the\nMultimodal Clean Pareto (MCPareto) framework. First, KAN leverages its\nunivariate function decomposition to achieve transparent analysis of\ncross-modal interactions. This structural design allows direct inspection of\nfeature transformations without relying on external interpretation tools,\nthereby ensuring both high expressiveness and interpretability. Second, the\nproposed MCPareto enhances robustness by addressing modality imbalance and\nnoise interference. Specifically, we introduce the Dimensionality Reduction and\nDenoising Modal Information Bottleneck (DRD-MIB) method, which jointly denoises\nand reduces feature dimensionality. This approach provides KAN with\ndiscriminative low-dimensional inputs to reduce the modeling complexity of KAN\nwhile preserving critical sentiment-related information. Furthermore, MCPareto\ndynamically balances gradient contributions across modalities using the\npurified features output by DRD-MIB, ensuring lossless transmission of\nauxiliary signals and effectively alleviating modality imbalance. This synergy\nof interpretability and robustness not only achieves superior performance on\nbenchmark datasets such as CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS v2 but also offers\nan intuitive visualization interface through KAN's interpretable architecture.\nOur code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/KAN-MCP.",

In this study, we have qualitatively classified and\nquantified all the main errors affecting the workflow of the back-stripping\ntechnique using linear interpolation and combinatorics.

We then assessed the error ranges\nand their probability of occurrence.

PEO is known for producing coatings with high corrosion resistance\nand strong adhesion to the substrate. The process involves generating\nshort-lived microdischarges on the material surface through anodic dielectric\nbreakdown in a conductive aqueous solution. To investigate single\nmicrodischarges during PEO, a single microdischarge setup was developed, where\nthe active anode surface is reduced to the tip of a wire with a diameter of 1\nmm. In this work the focus is on the effect of electrolyte concentration, anode\nmaterial, and electrical parameters on the microdischarges. The electrolyte is\ncomposed of distilled water with varying concentrations of potassium hydroxide\n(0.5 - 4 g/l). High-speed optical measurements are conducted to gain insights\ninto the formation and temporal evolution of individual microdischarges and the\ninduced gas bubble formation. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to estimate\nsurface and electron temperatures by fitting Bremsstrahlung and Planck's law to\nthe continuum spectrum of the microdischarges. To evaluate the impact of the\nmicrodischarges on coating morphology, the resulting oxide layers on the metal\ntips are analysed using scanning electron microscopy. The study demonstrates\nthat microdischarge behaviour is significantly influenced by the substrate\nmaterial, treatment time, and electrolyte concentration, all of which impact\nthe coating morphology. Under the conditions studied in this work, aluminium\nexhibits longer microdischarge and bubble lifetimes, with fewer cracks on the\ntop layer of the coating, whereas titanium showed faster, shorter-lived bubbles\ndue to more rapid microdischarge events.",

It is\ncommonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each\nWSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are\nconsidered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large\nnumber of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when\nutilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders\nmost existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical\npractice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification\n(WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number\nof bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the\nabsence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image\nclassification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images\nunsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a\nconcise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem\nthrough two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two\nheterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance\nclassification and bag classification. The fundamental idea is to establish\ncross-consistency supervision at both the bag-level and instance-level between\nthe two branches during training. Extensive experiments conducted on four\ndatasets demonstrate that CroCo achieves superior bag classification and\ninstance classification performance compared to other comparative methods when\nlimited WSIs with bag labels are available. To the best of our knowledge, this\npaper presents for the first time the WSWC problem and gives a successful\nresolution.",

Emotions,\nwhich play a crucial role in human interactions, can improve the naturalness\nand transparency of human-robot interactions (HRI) when embodied in artificial\nagents. This study aims to employ Affect Control Theory (ACT), a psychological\nmodel of emotions deeply rooted in interaction, for the generation of synthetic\nemotions. A platform-agnostic framework inspired by ACT was developed and\nimplemented in a humanoid robot to assess its impact on human perception.\nResults show that the frequency of emotional displays impacts how users\nperceive the robot. Moreover, appropriate emotional expressions seem to enhance\nthe robot's perceived emotional and cognitive agency. The findings suggest that\nACT can be successfully employed to embed synthetic emotions into robots,\nresulting in effective human-robot interactions, where the robot is perceived\nmore as a social agent than merely a machine.",

    "abstract": "According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed by accreting the\ncircum-terrestrial debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the\nproto-Earth. The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the\nEarth-Moon system, however, simulations of giant impact between a planetary\nembryo and the growing proto-Earth indicate that the materials in the\ncircum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the impact originate mainly from the\nimpactor. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining the Moon's\nEarth-like isotopic compositions. More materials from the proto-Earth could be\ndelivered to the circum-terrestrial debris disk when a slightly sub-Mars-sized\nbody collides with a fast rotating planet of rigid rotation but the resulting\nangular momentum is too large compared with that of the current Earth-Moon\nsystem. Since planetesimals accreted by the proto-Earth hit the surface of the\nproto-Earth, enhancing the rotation rate of the surface of the proto-Earth. The\nsurface's fast rotation rate relative to the slow rotation rate of the inner\nregion of the proto-Earth leads to transfer of angular momentum from surface to\ninner, resulting in the differential rotation. Here, we show that the giant\nimpact of a sub-Mars-sized body on a differential rotating proto-Earth with a\nfast rotating outer region and a relative slow rotating inner region could\nresult in a circum-terrestrial debris disk with materials predominately from\nthe proto-Earth without violating the angular momentum constraint. The theory\nproposed here may provide a viable way of explaining the similarity in the\nisotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon.",

Our results show that when convective\nmixing is considered, the atmospheric metallicity increases with time and that\nthis time evolution encodes information about the primordial planetary\nstructure. Additionally, the degree of compositional mixing affects the\nplanetary radius, altering its evolution in a measurable way. By applying mock\nobservations, we demonstrate that combining radius and atmospheric composition\ncan help to constrain the planetary formation history.

However, this\ntask faces several challenges, including the scarcity of large-scale datasets\ntailored for off-road scenarios, the high cost and potential errors of manual\nannotation, the stringent real-time requirements of motion planning, and the\nlimited computational power of onboard units. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel traversability learning method that leverages\nself-supervised learning, eliminating the need for manual annotation. For the\nfirst time, a Birds-Eye View (BEV) representation is used as input, reducing\ncomputational burden and improving adaptability to downstream motion planning.\nDuring vehicle operation, the proposed method conducts online analysis of\ntraversed regions and dynamically updates prototypes to adaptively assess the\ntraversability of the current environment, effectively handling dynamic scene\nchanges. We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art benchmarks on both\npublic datasets and our own dataset, covering diverse seasons and geographical\nlocations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly\noutperforms recent approaches.

Applying the analytical model with envelope approximation, we derive\nthe general expressions of GW spectrum in the presence of PBHs.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Metric-Solver, a novel sliding anchor-based metric depth estimation\nmethod that dynamically adapts to varying scene scales. Our approach leverages\nan anchor-based representation, where a reference depth serves as an anchor to\nseparate and normalize the scene depth into two components: scaled near-field\ndepth and tapered far-field depth. The anchor acts as a normalization factor,\nenabling the near-field depth to be normalized within a consistent range while\nmapping far-field depth smoothly toward zero. Through this approach, any depth\nfrom zero to infinity in the scene can be represented within a unified\nrepresentation, effectively eliminating the need to manually account for scene\nscale variations. More importantly, for the same scene, the anchor can slide\nalong the depth axis, dynamically adjusting to different depth scales. A\nsmaller anchor provides higher resolution in the near-field, improving depth\nprecision for closer objects while a larger anchor improves depth estimation in\nfar regions. This adaptability enables the model to handle depth predictions at\nvarying distances and ensure strong generalization across datasets.

Although recent VRD models have\nachieved impressive performance, they are all restricted to pre-defined\nrelation categories, while failing to consider the semantic ambiguity\ncharacteristic of visual relations. Unlike objects, the appearance of visual\nrelations is always subtle and can be described by multiple predicate words\nfrom different perspectives, e.g., ``ride'' can be depicted as ``race'' and\n``sit on'', from the sports and spatial position views, respectively. To this\nend, we propose to model visual relations as continuous embeddings, and design\ndiffusion models to achieve generalized VRD in a conditional generative manner,\ntermed Diff-VRD. We model the diffusion process in a latent space and generate\nall possible relations in the image as an embedding sequence. During the\ngeneration, the visual and text embeddings of subject-object pairs serve as\nconditional signals and are injected via cross-attention. After the generation,\nwe design a subsequent matching stage to assign the relation words to\nsubject-object pairs by considering their semantic similarities. Benefiting\nfrom the diffusion-based generative process, our Diff-VRD is able to generate\nvisual relations beyond the pre-defined category labels of datasets. To\nproperly evaluate this generalized VRD task, we introduce two evaluation\nmetrics, i.e., text-to-image retrieval and SPICE PR Curve inspired by image\ncaptioning.

However, existing approaches prompt the\n\\textit{black box LLMs} to produce their confidence (\\textit{verbalized\nconfidence}), which can be subject to many biases and hallucinations. Inspired\nby a different aspect of overconfidence in cognitive science called\n\\textit{overprecision}, we designed a framework for its study in black box\nLLMs. This framework contains three main phases: 1) generation, 2) refinement\nand 3) evaluation. In the generation phase we prompt the LLM to generate\nanswers to numerical questions in the form of intervals with a certain level of\nconfidence. This confidence level is imposed in the prompt and not required for\nthe LLM to generate as in previous approaches. We use various prompting\ntechniques and use the same prompt multiple times to gauge the effects of\nrandomness in the generation process. In the refinement phase, answers from the\nprevious phase are refined to generate better answers. The LLM answers are\nevaluated and studied in the evaluation phase to understand its internal\nworkings. This study allowed us to gain various insights into LLM\noverprecision: 1) LLMs are highly uncalibrated for numerical tasks 2) there is\nno correlation between the length of the interval and the imposed confidence\nlevel, which can be symptomatic of a a) lack of understanding of the concept of\nconfidence or b) inability to adjust self-confidence by following instructions,\n{3) LLM numerical precision differs depending on the task, scale of answer and\nprompting technique 4) Refinement of answers doesn't improve precision in most\ncases.

The nature of SW1's many outbursts,\nwhich regularly brighten the comet by five magnitudes or more, and what\nprocesses power them has been of particular interest since SW1's discovery in\nthe 1920s. In this paper, we present and model four epochs of low-resolution\nnear-infrared spectroscopy of SW1 taken with the NASA Infrared Telescope\nFacility and Lowell Discovery Telescope between 2017 and 2022. This dataset\nincludes one large outburst, two periods of low activity (\"quiescence\" or\n\"quiescent activity\"), and one mid-sized outburst a few days after one of the\nquiescent observations. The two quiescent epochs appear similar in both\nspectral slope and modeled grain size distributions, but the two outbursts are\nsignificantly different. We propose that the two can be reconciled if smaller\ndust grains are accelerated more than larger ones, such that observations\ncloser to the onset of an outburst are more sensitive to the finer-grained dust\non the outside of the expanding cloud of material. These outbursts can thus\nappear very rapid but there is still a period in which the dust and gas are\nwell-coupled. We find no strong evidence of water ice absorption in any of our\nspectra, suggesting that the areal abundance of ice-dominated grains is less\nthan one percent.

We present a\ngraph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a\nfrustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from\nbarren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a\nclustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the\nmaximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally\ndisconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division\noffers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively\nmodeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed\nwithin the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current\nparadigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended\nbeyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical\nmethods in addressing complex optimization problems.",

Next to the graph $\\mathcal{G}$, this is the only other known\ncounterexample. Using a computer search, we show that there are no smaller\ncounterexamples of girth 8 and show that there are no other counterexamples up\nto at least 42 vertices of any girth.

    "abstract": "Given a single labeled example, in-context segmentation aims to segment\ncorresponding objects. This setting, known as one-shot segmentation in few-shot\nlearning, explores the segmentation model's generalization ability and has been\napplied to various vision tasks, including scene understanding and image/video\nediting. While recent Segment Anything Models have achieved state-of-the-art\nresults in interactive segmentation, these approaches are not directly\napplicable to in-context segmentation. In this work, we propose the Dual\nConsistency SAM (DC-SAM) method based on prompt-tuning to adapt SAM and SAM2\nfor in-context segmentation of both images and videos. Our key insights are to\nenhance the features of the SAM's prompt encoder in segmentation by providing\nhigh-quality visual prompts. When generating a mask prior, we fuse the SAM\nfeatures to better align the prompt encoder. Then, we design a cycle-consistent\ncross-attention on fused features and initial visual prompts. Next, a\ndual-branch design is provided by using the discriminative positive and\nnegative prompts in the prompt encoder. Furthermore, we design a simple\nmask-tube training strategy to adopt our proposed dual consistency method into\nthe mask tube. Although the proposed DC-SAM is primarily designed for images,\nit can be seamlessly extended to the video domain with the support of SAM2.\nGiven the absence of in-context segmentation in the video domain, we manually\ncurate and construct the first benchmark from existing video segmentation\ndatasets, named In-Context Video Object Segmentation (IC-VOS), to better assess\nthe in-context capability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method achieves 55.5 (+1.4) mIoU on COCO-20i, 73.0 (+1.1) mIoU on\nPASCAL-5i, and a J&F score of 71.52 on the proposed IC-VOS benchmark.

After\nrandomly sampling masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial\nmass function, we assign to each object a half-mass radius, metallicity, and\ndistance from the galaxy centre. We consider up to 2000 individual star\nclusters per galaxy and evolve their properties over time taking into account\nstellar evolution, two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, dynamical friction, and a\nre-positioning during galaxy mergers. Our simulation successfully reproduces\nseveral observational quantities, such as the empirical relationship between\nthe absolute V -band magnitude of the brightest young star clusters and the\nhost galaxy star formation rate, the mass function of young star clusters, or\nmean metallicities of the star cluster distributions versus galaxy masses.

While these semantic relations\nbear key importance, detection tasks are often formulated independently,\nrequiring multi-shot analysis pipelines. Importantly, spatial correlation could\nconstitute a fundamental prior facilitating learning of more meaningful\nrepresentations for tasks like instance segmentation. This knowledge has, thus\nfar, not been utilised by the biomedical computer vision community. We argue\nthat the instance segmentation of two or more categories of objects can be\nachieved in parallel. We achieve this via two architectures HydraStarDist (HSD)\nand the novel (HSD-WBR) based on the widely-used StarDist (SD), to take\nadvantage of the star-convexity of our target objects. HSD and HSD-WBR are\nconstructed to be capable of incorporating their interactions as constraints\ninto account. HSD implicitly incorporates spatial correlation priors based on\nobject interaction through a joint encoder. HSD-WBR further enforces the prior\nin a regularisation layer with the penalty we proposed named Within Boundary\nRegularisation Penalty (WBR). Both architectures achieve nested instance\nsegmentation in a single shot. We demonstrate their competitiveness based on\n$IoU_R$ and AP and superiority in a new, task-relevant criteria, Joint TP rate\n(JTPR) compared to their baseline SD and Cellpose.

For the temporal\ndiscretisation, the generalized convolution quadrature method (gCQ) developed\nby Lopez-Fernandez and Sauter is used. The spatial discretisation is done\nclassically using low-order shape functions.\n  Essentially, the gCQ requires to establish boundary element matrices of the\ncorresponding elliptic problem in Laplace domain at several complex\nfrequencies. Consequently, an array of system matrices is obtained. This array\nof system matrices can be interpreted as a three-dimensional array of data\nwhich should be approximated by a data-sparse representation, for which the\ngeneralised Adaptive Cross Approximation (3D-ACA) can be applied. The rank of\nthe three-dimensional data array is increased adaptively until a prescribed\naccuracy is obtained. On a pure algebraic level, it is decided whether a\nlow-rank approximation of the three-dimensional data array is close enough to\nthe original matrix. Within the data slices corresponding to the BEM\ncalculations for each frequency, either the standard $\\mathcal{H}$-matrices\napproach with ACA or a fast multipole (FMM) approach can be used. The third\ndimension of the data array represents the complex frequencies. Hence, the\nalgorithm does not only sparsify the data array in the two spatial dimensions\nbut also adaptively detects how much frequencies are necessary for which matrix\nblock.\n  he two versions, either using ACA or FMM within the slices, are briefly\ndiscussed.

However, existing methods often fail to effectively\nutilize execution histories or fully exploit DAG structures, limiting their\nability to identity bottlenecks and determine the optimal parallelism. In this\npaper, we propose StreamTune, a novel approach for adaptive paralelism tuning\nin stream processing systems. StreamTune incorporates a pre-training and\nfine-tuning framework that leverages global knowledge from historical execution\ndata for job-specific parallelism tuning. In the pre-training phase, Stream\nTune clusters the historical data with Graph Edit Distance and pre-trains a\nGraph Neural Networkbased encoder per cluster to capture the correlation\nbetween the operator parallelism, DAG structures, and the identified\noperator-level bottlenecks. In the online tuning phase, StreamTune iteratively\nrefines operator parallelism recommendations using an operator-level bottleneck\nprediction model enforced with a monotonic constraint, which aligns with the\nobserved system performance behavior. Evaluation results demonstrate that\nStreamTune reduces reconfigurations by up to 29.6% and parallelism degrees by\nup to 30.8% in Apache Flink under a synthetic workload.

However, practical implementations often\nrequire better error-correction performance than what SC decoding provides,\nparticularly at short to moderate code lengths. Successive-cancellation flip\n(SCF) decoding algorithm was proposed to improve error-correction performance\nwith an aim to detect and correct the first wrongly estimated bit in a codeword\nbefore resuming SC decoding. At each additional SC decoding trial, i.e.,\ndecoding attempt beyond the initial unsuccessful trial, one bit estimated as\nthe least reliable is flipped. Dynamic SCF (DSCF) is a variation of SCF, where\nmultiple bits may be flipped simultaneously per trial.

In this work, we propose the generalized restart mechanism (GRM) that\nallows to skip decoding computations that are identical between the initial\ntrial and any additional trial. Under DSCF decoding with up to 3-bit flips per\ndecoding trial, our proposed GRM is shown to reduce the average execution time\nby 25% to 60% without any negative effect on error-correction performance.

The performance of the mesoscopic\nconstitutive model is assessed through a comparison with a micromechanical\nmodel for carbon/PEEK, with the original isotropic viscoplastic version for the\npolymer matrix and with hyperelastic fibers. The micromodel is first used to\ndetermine the material parameters of the mesoscale model with a few\nstress-strain curves. It is demonstrated that the mesoscale model gives a\nsimilar response to the micromodel under various loading conditions. Finally,\nthe mesoscale model is validated against off-axis experiments on unidirectional\nthermoplastic composite plies.",

    "abstract": "When excited states decay the time evolution operator $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$ does\nnot obey $U^{\\dagger}(t)U(t)=I$. Nonetheless, probability conservation is not\nlost if one includes both excitation and decay, though it takes a different\nform. Specifically, if the eigenspectrum of a Hamiltonian is complete, then due\nto $CPT$ symmetry, a symmetry that holds for all physical systems, there must\nexist an operator $V$ that effects $VHV^{-1}=H^{\\dagger}$, so that\n$V^{-1}U^{\\dagger}(t)VU(t)=I$. In consequence, the time delay associated with\ndecay must be accompanied by an equal and opposite time advance for excitation.\nThus when a photon excites an atom the spontaneous emission of a photon from\nthe excited state must occur without any decay time delay at all. An effect of\nthis form together with an associated negative time delay appear to have\nrecently been reported by Sinclair et. al., PRX Quantum \\textbf{3}, 010314\n(2022) and Angulo et. al., arXiv:2409.03680 [quant-ph].",

A critical factor for understanding and analyzing the behavior\nof these systems is the collection of monitoring data such as logs, metrics,\nand traces. These data modalities can be used for anomaly detection and root\ncause analysis of failures. In particular, multi-modal methods utilizing\nseveral types of this data at once have gained traction in the research\ncommunity since these three modalities capture different dimensions of system\nbehavior. Aim. We provide a dataset that supports research on anomaly detection\nand architectural degradation in microservice systems. We generate a\ncomprehensive dataset of logs, metrics, and traces from a production\nmicroservice system to enable the exploration of multi-modal fusion methods\nthat integrate multiple data modalities. Method. We dynamically tested the\nvarious APIs of the MS-based system, implementing the OAuth2.0 protocol using\nthe Locust tool. For each execution of the prepared test suite, we collect logs\nand performance metrics for correct and erroneous calls with data labeled\naccording to the error triggered during the call. Contributions. We collected\napproximately 657,000 individual log files, totaling over two billion log\nlines. In addition, we collected more than 45 million individual metric files\nthat contain 485 unique metrics. We provide an initial analysis of logs,\nidentify key metrics through PCA, and discuss challenges in collecting traces\nfor this system. Moreover, we highlight the possibilities for making a more\nfine-grained version of the data set. This work advances anomaly detection in\nmicroservice systems using multiple data sources.",

    "abstract": "The study of infectious disease propagation is essential for understanding\nand controlling epidemics. One of the most useful tools for gaining insights\ninto the spread of infectious diseases is mathematical modelling. In terms of\nmathematical epidemiology, the main models are based on compartments, such as\nSI, SIR, and SEIR. These models offer mathematical frameworks for representing\nthe proliferation dynamics of various diseases, for instance flu and smallpox.\nIn this work, we explore these models using two distinct mathematical\napproaches, Cellular Automata (CA) and ODEs. They are able to reproduce the\nspread dynamics of diseases with their own individuality. CA models incorporate\nthe local interaction among individuals with discrete time and space, while\nODEs provide a continuous and simplified view of a disease propagation in large\nand homogeneous populations. By comparing these two approaches, we find that\nthe shape of the curves of all models is similar for both representations.\nAlthough, the growth rates differ between CA and ODE. One of our results is to\nshow that the CA yields a power-law growth, while the ODE growth rate is\nwell-represented by an exponential function. Furthermore, a substantial\ncontribution of our work is using a hyperbolic tangent to fit the initial\ngrowth of infected individuals for all the considered models. Our results\ndisplay a strong correlation between simulated data and adjusted function. We\nmainly address this successful result by the fact that the hyperbolic function\ncaptures both growing: the power-law (when considered the first terms of\ninfinite sums) and combinations of exponential (when the hyperbolic function is\nwritten via exponential). Therefore, our work shows that when modelling a\ndisease the choice of mathematical representation is crucial, in particular to\nmodel the onset of an\n  epidemic.",

Instead, they generally take a cascading approach where a\nsequence of ranking models are applied in multiple re-ranking stages. Thereby,\nthey balance the quality of the top-K ranking with computational costs by\nlimiting the number of documents each model re-ranks. However, the cascading\napproach is not the only way models can interact to form a retrieval system.\n  We propose the concept of compound retrieval systems as a broader class of\nretrieval systems that apply multiple prediction models. This encapsulates\ncascading models but also allows other types of interactions than top-K\nre-ranking. In particular, we enable interactions with large language models\n(LLMs) which can provide relative relevance comparisons. We focus on the\noptimization of compound retrieval system design which uniquely involves\nlearning where to apply the component models and how to aggregate their\npredictions into a final ranking. This work shows how our compound approach can\ncombine the classic BM25 retrieval model with state-of-the-art (pairwise) LLM\nrelevance predictions, while optimizing a given ranking metric and efficiency\ntarget. Our experimental results show optimized compound retrieval systems\nprovide better trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency than cascading\napproaches, even when applied in a self-supervised manner.\n  With the introduction of compound retrieval systems, we hope to inspire the\ninformation retrieval field to more out-of-the-box thinking on how prediction\nmodels can interact to form rankings.",

These\ntwo classes of models, called here Highly Competitive and Highly Reproductive\nmodels, may lead to hierarchical and non-hierarchical dynamics, depending on\nthe number of highly reactive species. The fundamental feature of these models\nis the fact that hierarchical models may as well support biodiversity, however,\nwith a higher probability of extinction than the non-hierarchical ones, which\nare in fact more robust. This analysis is done by evaluating the probability of\nextinction as a function of mobility. In particular, we have analyzed how the\ndominance scheme changes depending on the highly reactive species for\nnon-hierarchical models, where the findings lead to the conclusion that highly\nreactive species are usually at a disadvantage compared to the others.\nMoreover, we have investigated the power spectrum and the characteristic length\nof each species, including more information on the behavior of the several\nsystems considered in the present work.",

In these setups, a detector monitors the\ntarget site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked\nafter a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from\nthe time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked\nup to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional\nlattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\\alpha}$\nwith the distance $d$, for $\\alpha\\in(0,\\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays\nwith a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\\alpha$. At short\ntimes, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of\n$\\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal\nresetting rate. For $\\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by\nthe velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For\n$\\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The\noptimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as\n$\\alpha\\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results,\nshedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries,\nand local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium.

    "abstract": "Just in time defect prediction (JIT DP) leverages ML to identify defect-prone\ncode commits, enabling quality assurance (QA) teams to allocate resources more\nefficiently by focusing on commits that are most likely to contain defects.\nAlthough JIT DP techniques have introduced improvements in terms of predictive\naccuracy, they are still susceptible to misclassification errors such as false\npositives and negatives. This can lead to wasted resources or undetected\ndefects, a particularly critical concern when QA resources are limited. To\nmitigate these challenges and preserve the practical utility of JIT DP tools,\nit becomes essential to estimate the reliability of the predictions, i.e.,\ncomputing confidence scores. Such scores can help practitioners determine the\ntrustworthiness of predictions and thus prioritize them efficiently. A simple\napproach to computing confidence scores is to extract, alongside each\nprediction, the corresponding prediction probabilities and use them as\nindicators of confidence. However, for these probabilities to reliably serve as\nconfidence scores, the predictive model must be well-calibrated. This means\nthat the prediction probabilities must accurately represent the true likelihood\nof each prediction being correct. Miscalibration, common in modern ML models,\ndistorts probability scores such that they do not align with the actual\ncorrectness probability. In this study, we evaluate the calibration of three\nJIT DP techniques to determine whether and to what extent they exhibit poor\ncalibration. Furthermore, we assess whether post-calibration methods can\nimprove the calibration of existing JIT defect prediction models. Our results\nreveal that all evaluated JIT DP models exhibit some level of miscalibration,\nwith ECE ranging from 2-35%.

Existing methods mainly\nrely on a pre-trained text encoder to capture the semantic information and\nperform cross attention with the encoded text prompt to guide the generation of\nvideo. However, when it comes to complex prompts that contain dynamic scenes\nand multiple camera-view transformations, these methods can not decompose the\noverall information into separate scenes, as well as fail to smoothly change\nscenes based on the corresponding camera-views. To solve these problems, we\npropose a novel method, i.e., Modular-Cam. Specifically, to better understand a\ngiven complex prompt, we utilize a large language model to analyze user\ninstructions and decouple them into multiple scenes together with transition\nactions. To generate a video containing dynamic scenes that match the given\ncamera-views, we incorporate the widely-used temporal transformer into the\ndiffusion model to ensure continuity within a single scene and propose\nCamOperator, a modular network based module that well controls the camera\nmovements. Moreover, we propose AdaControlNet, which utilizes ControlNet to\nensure consistency across scenes and adaptively adjusts the color tone of the\ngenerated video. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments prove our\nproposed Modular-Cam's strong capability of generating multi-scene videos\ntogether with its ability to achieve fine-grained control of camera movements.\nGenerated results are available at https://modular-cam.github.io.",

Tensor networks are accu?rate, but\ntheir application is often limited to low-dimensional systems due to the high\ncomputational complexity in high-dimensional systems. The neural network method\napplies to systems with general topology. However, as a variational method, it\nis not as accurate as tensor networks. In this work, we propose an integrated\napproach, tensor-network-based variational autoregressive networks (TNVAN),\nthat leverages the strengths of both tensor networks and neural networks:\ncombining the variational autoregressive neural network's ability to compute an\nupper bound on free energy and perform unbiased sampling from the variational\ndistribution with the tensor network's power to accurately compute the\npartition function for small sub-systems, resulting in a robust method for\nprecisely estimating free energy. To evaluate the proposed approach, we\nconducted numerical experiments on spin glass systems with various topologies,\nincluding two-dimensional lattices, fully connected graphs, and random graphs.\nOur numerical results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method compared\nto existing approaches.

We derive an analytic model to explore how the maximum planetary\nalbedo depends on the above-cloud optical depth and scattering versus absorbing\nproperties, even in the limit of a perfectly reflective grey cloud layer. We\napply this framework to sub-Neptune K2-18b, for which a high planetary albedo\nhas recently been invoked to argue for the possibility of maintaining a liquid\nwater ocean surface, despite K2-18b receiving an energy flux from its host star\nthat places it inside of its estimated `habitable zone' inner edge. We use a\nnumerical multiple-scattering line-by-line radiative transfer model to retrieve\nthe albedo of K2-18b based on the observational constraints from the\nabove-cloud atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that K2-18b's observed\ntransmission spectrum already restricts its possible planetary albedo to values\nbelow the threshold required to be potentially habitable, with the data\nfavouring a median planetary albedo of 0.17-0.18. Our results thus reveal that\ncurrently characteriseable sub-Neptunes are likely to be magma-ocean or\ngas-dwarf worlds.

Our results\nindicate that temporal and spatial attention maps affect not only the timing\nand layout of the videos but also the complexity of spatiotemporal elements and\nthe aesthetic quality of the synthesized videos. Notably, high-entropy\nattention maps are often key elements linked to superior video quality, whereas\nlow-entropy attention maps are associated with the video's intra-frame\nstructure. Based on our findings, we propose two novel methods to enhance video\nquality and enable text-guided video editing. These methods rely entirely on\nlightweight manipulation of the attention matrices in T2V models. The efficacy\nand effectiveness of our methods are further validated through experimental\nevaluation across multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple\nparties while preserving privacy. However, most FL systems assume clients hold\nonly unimodal data, limiting their real-world applicability, as institutions\noften possess multimodal data. Moreover, the lack of labeled data further\nconstrains the performance of most FL methods. In this work, we propose FedEPA,\na novel FL framework for multimodal learning. FedEPA employs a personalized\nlocal model aggregation strategy that leverages labeled data on clients to\nlearn personalized aggregation weights, thereby alleviating the impact of data\nheterogeneity. We also propose an unsupervised modality alignment strategy that\nworks effectively with limited labeled data. Specifically, we decompose\nmultimodal features into aligned features and context features. We then employ\ncontrastive learning to align the aligned features across modalities, ensure\nthe independence between aligned features and context features within each\nmodality, and promote the diversity of context features. A multimodal feature\nfusion strategy is introduced to obtain a joint embedding. The experimental\nresults show that FedEPA significantly outperforms existing FL methods in\nmultimodal classification tasks under limited labeled data conditions.",

In fact, sign language tasks\nrequire focusing on sign-related regions, including the collaboration between\ndifferent regions (\\eg left hand region and right hand region) and the\neffective content in a single region. To capture such region-related features,\nwe introduce MixSignGraph, which represents sign sequences as a group of mixed\ngraphs and designs the following three graph modules for feature extraction,\n\\ie Local Sign Graph (LSG) module, Temporal Sign Graph (TSG) module and\nHierarchical Sign Graph (HSG) module.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) in graphs has garnered significant attention,\nparticularly in employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with pretext tasks\ninitially designed for other domains, such as contrastive learning and feature\nreconstruction. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods effectively\nreflect essential graph properties, precisely representation similarity with\nits neighbors. We observe that existing methods position opposite ends of a\nspectrum driven by the graph embedding smoothness, with each end corresponding\nto outperformance on specific downstream tasks. Decomposing the SSL objective\ninto three terms via an information-theoretic framework with a neighbor\nrepresentation variable reveals that this polarization stems from an imbalance\namong the terms, which existing methods may not effectively maintain. Further\ninsights suggest that balancing between the extremes can lead to improved\nperformance across a wider range of downstream tasks. A framework, BSG\n(Balancing Smoothness in Graph SSL), introduces novel loss functions designed\nto supplement the representation quality in graph-based SSL by balancing the\nderived three terms: neighbor loss, minimal loss, and divergence loss. We\npresent a theoretical analysis of the effects of these loss functions,\nhighlighting their significance from both the SSL and graph smoothness\nperspectives. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets across node\nclassification and link prediction consistently demonstrate that BSG achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel imaging and reconstruction framework for\ndual-energy cone-beam CT (DECBCT) using only two orthogonal X-ray projections\nat different energy levels (2V-DECBCT). The goal is to enable fast and low-dose\nDE volumetric imaging with high spectral fidelity and structural accuracy,\nsuitable for DECBCT-guided radiation therapy. We introduce a framework for\n2V-DECBCT based on physics-informed dual-domain diffusion models. A\ncycle-domain training strategy is employed to enforce consistency between\nprojection and volume reconstructions through a differentiable physics-informed\nmodule. Furthermore, a spectral-consistency loss is introduced to preserve\ninter-energy contrast during the generative process. The model is trained and\nevaluated using 4D XCAT phantom data under realistic anatomical motion. The\nmethod produces high-fidelity DECBCT volumes from only two views, accurately\npreserving anatomical boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Subtraction maps\ncomputed from the reconstructed energy volumes show strong visual and numerical\nagreement with ground truth. This work presents the first diffusion model-based\nframework for 2V-DECBCT reconstruction, demonstrating accurate structural and\nspectral recovery from extremely sparse inputs.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in Integrated Sensing and Communication have led to new\nadversarial models in wireless security through Integrated Sensing and Jamming\n(ISAJ) adversaries. ISAJ adversaries, owing to their sensing capabilities, are\nknown to inject jamming energy over the victim's frequency band, and also use\ngeneralized energy measurements on various network frequencies to detect the\npresence of countermeasures. Existing countermeasures against such ISAJ\nadversaries are laid under the assumption that the adversary does not have the\nknowledge of the countermeasure. However, according to Kerchoffs' principle in\ncryptography, security of a countermeasure should only rely on the secret-keys,\nnot on the obfuscation of the countermeasure. On testing the security of\nexisting countermeasures, we observe that they violate Kerchoffs' principle,\nthus motivating the need for new countermeasures. In this regard, we propose a\nnovel network-centric countermeasure against ISAJ adversaries, wherein a group\nof users in the network assist the victim to reliably communicate her messages\nin a covert manner. Firstly, we analyse the error performance of the proposed\ncountermeasure, and study its behavior on the number of assisting users in the\nnetwork. Subsequently, to validate its security against Kerchoffs' principle,\nwe study the Shannon's entropy associated with the presence of the victim's\nmessages in the network and analyse its behaviour as a function of the number\nof assisting users. Finally, to study the interplay between reliability and\ncovertness, we pose interesting optimization problems and solve them to choose\nthe underlying parameters of the countermeasure and the number of assisting\nusers.",

    "abstract": "Extreme weather events, rare yet profoundly impactful, are often accompanied\nby severe conditions. Increasing global temperatures are poised to exacerbate\nthese events, resulting in greater human casualties, economic losses, and\necological destruction. Complex global climate interactions, known as\nteleconnections, can lead to widespread repercussions triggered by localized\nextreme weather. Understanding these teleconnection patterns is crucial for\nweather forecasting, enhancing safety, and advancing climate science. Here, we\nemploy climate network analysis to uncover teleconnection patterns associated\nwith extreme temperature fluctuations, including both extreme warming and\ncooling events occurring on a daily basis. Our study results demonstrate that\nthe distances of significant teleconnections initially conform to a power-law\ndecay, signifying a decline in connectivity with distance. However, this\npower-law decay tendency breaks beyond a certain threshold distance, suggesting\nthe existence of long-distance connections. Additionally, we uncover a greater\nprevalence of long-distance connectivity among extreme cooling events compared\nto extreme warming events. The global pattern of teleconnections is, in part,\ndriven by the mechanism of Rossby waves, which serve as a rapid conduit for\ninducing correlated fluctuations in both pressure and temperature. These\nresults enhance our understanding of the multiscale nature of climate\nteleconnections and hold significant implications for improving weather\nforecasting and assessing climate risks in a warming world.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a significant trend toward using large\nlanguage model (LLM)-based recommender systems (RecSys). Current research\nprimarily focuses on representing complex user-item interactions within a\ndiscrete space to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models.\nHowever, this approach faces limitations due to its discrete nature: (i)\ninformation is often compressed during discretization; (ii) the tokenization\nand generation for the vast number of users and items in real-world scenarios\nare constrained by a limited vocabulary. Embracing continuous data presents a\npromising alternative to enhance expressive capabilities, though this approach\nis still in its early stages. To address this gap, we propose a novel\nframework, DeftRec, which incorporates \\textbf{de}noising di\\textbf{f}fusion\nmodels to enable LLM-based RecSys to seamlessly support continuous\n\\textbf{t}oken as input and target. First, we introduce a robust tokenizer with\na masking operation and an additive K-way architecture to index users and\nitems, capturing their complex collaborative relationships into continuous\ntokens. Crucially, we develop a denoising diffusion model to process user\npreferences within continuous domains by conditioning on reasoning content from\npre-trained large language model. During the denoising process, we reformulate\nthe objective to include negative interactions, building a comprehensive\nunderstanding of user preferences for effective and accurate recommendation\ngeneration. Finally, given a continuous token as output, recommendations can be\neasily generated through score-based retrieval. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that DeftRec\nsurpasses competitive benchmarks, including both traditional and emerging\nLLM-based RecSys.",

While a\nspeaker can produce varying utterances from a single script with different\nintonations, conventional voice conversion models were limited to producing\nonly one result per source input. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nnovel approach for voice conversion with diverse intonations using conditional\nvariational autoencoder (CVAE). Experiments have shown that the speaker's style\nfeature can be mapped into a latent space with Gaussian distribution. We have\nalso been able to convert voices with more diverse intonation by making the\nposterior of the latent space more complex with inverse autoregressive flow\n(IAF). As a result, the converted voice not only has a diversity of\nintonations, but also has better sound quality than the model without CVAE.",

I\nintroduce a realistic flavor symmetry to generate the fermion mass and mixing,\nfrom which the relationship between the quark mixing and the lepton mixing is\nderived, and the source of the difference between them is revealed. In\nparticular, I derive a neutrino mass matrix which has a special structure form\nand contains five parameters, but its numerical solutions are precisely fitting\nto all the measured data of the neutrino mass spectrum, quark mixing and lepton\nmixing, and finely predict $m_{\\nu_{2}}=0.01288$ eV. In addition, I discuss a\nnew scenario of the leptogenesis in the model, which arises from two\nCP-asymmetric decays of a super-heavy neutral Dirac fermion, this scenario is\nclosely related to the neutrino mass and mixing, so the baryon asymmetry is\ndetermined by the neutrino flavor parameters.

To guide the\npre-training process, polarimetric decomposition loss and power\nself-supervision loss are constructed. The former aligns the predicted\ncoefficients with Yamaguchi coefficients, while the latter reconstructs power\nfrom the predicted coefficients and compares it to the input image's power.

Online source-free UDA has emerged\nas a solution for practical scenarios where access to source data is restricted\nand target data is received as a continuous stream. However, the open-world\nnature of many real-world applications additionally introduces category shifts\nmeaning that the source and target label spaces may differ. Online source-free\nuniversal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA) addresses this challenge. Existing\nmethods mainly rely on self-training with pseudo-labels, yet the relationship\nbetween pseudo-labeling and adaptation outcomes has not been studied yet. To\nbridge this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis through controlled\nexperiments with simulated pseudo-labeling, offering valuable insights into\npseudo-labeling for online SF-UniDA. Our findings reveal a substantial gap\nbetween the current state-of-the-art and the upper bound of adaptation achieved\nwith perfect pseudo-labeling. Moreover, we show that a contrastive loss enables\neffective adaptation even with moderate pseudo-label accuracy, while a\ncross-entropy (CE) loss, though less robust to pseudo-label errors, achieves\nsuperior results when pseudo-labeling approaches perfection. Lastly, our\nfindings indicate that pseudo-label accuracy is in general more crucial than\nquantity, suggesting that prioritizing fewer but high-confidence pseudo-labels\nis beneficial.

    "abstract": "A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum\nmassive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the\ninvestigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as\nthe quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational\ndecoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an\nelectromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more\nconducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise,\nthe quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower\ntemperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In\nthis work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation\n[1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian\nquantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated\nFokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic\ndynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a\ngraviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all\ntemperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the\nderivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for\nquantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the\noff-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time\nlogarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the\ntemperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian\ncase. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this\nproblem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in\n[77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where\nexperimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be\nimplemented.",

In the case of three-body\ninteractions, the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) potential is highly relevant for\nthe quantitative prediction of material properties. The computation of the\nresulting energies in d-dimensional lattice systems is challenging, as a\nhigh-dimensional lattice sum needs to be evaluated to high precision. This work\nsolves this long-standing issue. We present an efficiently computable\nrepresentation of many-body lattice sums in terms of singular integrals over\nproducts of Epstein zeta functions. For three-body interactions in 3D, this\napproach reduces the runtime for computing the ATM lattice sum from weeks to\nminutes. Our approach further extends to a broad class of n-body lattice sums.\nWe demonstrate that the computational cost of our method only increases\nlinearly with n, evading the exponential increase in complexity of direct\nsummation. The evaluation of 51-body interactions on a two-dimensional lattice,\ncorresponding to a 100-dimensional sum, can be performed within seconds on a\nlaptop. We discuss techniques for computing the arising singular integrals and\ncompare the accuracy of our results against computable benchmarks, achieving\nfull precision for exponents greater than the system dimension. Finally, we\napply our method to study the stability of a three-dimensional lattice system\nwith Lennard-Jones two-body interactions under the inclusion of an ATM\nthree-body term at finite pressure, finding a transition from the\nface-centered-cubic to the body-centered-cubic lattice structure with\nincreasing ATM coupling strength.

    "abstract": "This essay proposes an interpretive analogy between large language models\n(LLMs) and quasicrystals, systems that exhibit global coherence without\nperiodic repetition, generated through local constraints. While LLMs are\ntypically evaluated in terms of predictive accuracy, factuality, or alignment,\nthis structural perspective suggests that one of their most characteristic\nbehaviors is the production of internally resonant linguistic patterns. Drawing\non the history of quasicrystals, which forced a redefinition of structural\norder in physical systems, the analogy highlights an alternative mode of\ncoherence in generative language: constraint-based organization without\nrepetition or symbolic intent. Rather than viewing LLMs as imperfect agents or\nstochastic approximators, we suggest understanding them as generators of\nquasi-structured outputs. This framing complements existing evaluation\nparadigms by foregrounding formal coherence and pattern as interpretable\nfeatures of model behavior. While the analogy has limits, it offers a\nconceptual tool for exploring how coherence might arise and be assessed in\nsystems where meaning is emergent, partial, or inaccessible. In support of this\nperspective, we draw on philosophy of science and language, including\nmodel-based accounts of scientific representation, structural realism, and\ninferentialist views of meaning. We further propose the notion of structural\nevaluation: a mode of assessment that examines how well outputs propagate\nconstraint, variation, and order across spans of generated text. This essay\naims to reframe the current discussion around large language models, not by\nrejecting existing methods, but by suggesting an additional axis of\ninterpretation grounded in structure rather than semantics.",

    "abstract": "Non-orientable manifolds, such as the M\\\"obius strip and the Klein bottle,\ndefy conventional geometric intuition through their twisted boundary\nconditions. As a result, topological defects on non-orientable manifolds give\nrise to novel physical phenomena. We study the adiabatic transport of\nexceptional points (EPs) along non-orientable closed loops and uncover distinct\ntopological responses arising from the lack of global orientation. Notably, we\ndemonstrate that the cyclic permutation of eigenstates across an EP depends\nsensitively on the loop orientation, yielding inequivalent braid\nrepresentations for clockwise and counterclockwise encirclement; this is a\nfeature unique to non-orientable geometries. Orientation-dependent geometric\nquantities, such as the winding number, cannot be consistently defined due to\nthe absence of a global orientation. However, when a boundary is introduced,\nsuch quantities become well defined within the local interior, even though the\nglobal manifold remains non-orientable. We further demonstrate the adiabatic\nevolution of EPs and the emergence of orientation-sensitive observables in a\nKlein Brillouin zone, described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that\npreserves momentum-space glide symmetry. Finally, we numerically implement\nthese ideas in a microdisk cavity with embedded scatterers using synthetic\nmomenta.",

In this study, we investigate\nbioconvection in shallow suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii confined\nwithin spiral-shaped boundaries, combining detailed experiments with\nthree-dimensional simulations. Under open liquid-air interfaces, cells\naccumulate near the surface via negative gravitaxis, generating spiral-shaped\ndensity patterns that subsequently fragment into lattice-like clusters, leading\nto plume formation. Space-time analyses demonstrate coherent rotational\ndynamics, with predominantly inward-directed motion near the spiral core and\nbidirectional motion further out. Introducing confinement by sealing the upper\nboundary with an air-impermeable wall triggers dramatic pattern transitions due\nto oxygen depletion: initially stable arrangements reorganize into new\nstructures with significantly reduced wavelengths. Complementary numerical\nsimulations, based on incompressible Navier-Stokes equations incorporating\nnegative buoyancy and active swimmer stress, successfully replicate initial\npattern formation, subsequent instability, fragmentation into plumes, and\nemergence of strong vortical flows-nearly an order of magnitude faster than\nindividual cell swimming. However, these models do not capture oxygen\ndepletion-driven transitions observed experimentally.

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing (RC) is attracting attention as a machine-learning\ntechnique for edge computing. In time-series classification tasks, the number\nof features obtained using a reservoir depends on the length of the input\nseries. Therefore, the features must be converted to a constant-length\nintermediate representation (IR), such that they can be processed by an output\nlayer. Existing conversion methods involve computationally expensive matrix\ninversion that significantly increases the circuit size and requires processing\npower when implemented in hardware. In this article, we propose a simple but\neffective IR, namely, dot-product-based reservoir representation (DPRR), for RC\nbased on the dot product of data features. Additionally, we propose a\nhardware-friendly delayed-feedback reservoir (DFR) consisting of a nonlinear\nelement and delayed feedback loop with DPRR. The proposed DFR successfully\nclassified multivariate time series data that has been considered particularly\ndifficult to implement efficiently in hardware. In contrast to conventional DFR\nmodels that require analog circuits, the proposed model can be implemented in a\nfully digital manner suitable for high-level syntheses.

Fine-scale structures of the solar chromosphere, particularly\nfibrils, are known to host various types of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves\nthat can transport energy to the corona.

We aimed to detect a high-frequency transverse\noscillation in fibrils. Methods. We conducted a case study on a high-frequency\ntransverse oscillation in a chromospheric fibril. A chromospheric fibril was\nobserved on 24 August 2018, in the H{\\alpha} spectral line, with the prototype\nMicrolensed Hyperspectral Imager (MiHI) at the Swedish 1- meter Solar\nTelescope. The MiHI instrument is an integral field spectrograph capable of\nachieving ultra-high resolution simultaneously in the spatial, temporal, and\nspectral domains. Results. The detected oscillation characteristics include a\nperiod of 15 s and a displacement amplitude of 42 km. Using the bisector\nmethod, we derived Doppler velocities and determined that the polarisation of\nthe oscillation was elliptical. Conclusions.

However, there are indications that cold dark matter may\nencounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly\nat galactic scales. Observational data suggest that dark matter models\nincorporating a pressure component could provide solutions to these small-scale\nproblems. In this work, we investigate the possibility that present-day dark\nmatter may result from a decaying non-cold dark matter sector transitioning\ninto the dark energy sector. As the sensitivity of astronomical surveys rapidly\nincreases, we explore an interacting scenario between dark energy and non-cold\ndark matter, where dark energy has a constant equation of state ($w_{\\rm de}$),\nand dark matter, being non-cold, also has a constant (non-zero) equation of\nstate ($w_{\\rm dm}$). Considering the phantom and quintessence nature of dark\nenergy, characterized by its equation of state, we separately analyze\ninteracting phantom and interacting quintessence scenarios. We constrain these\nscenarios using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and their\ncombination with external probes, such as DESI-BAO and PantheonPlus. From our\nanalyses, we find that a very mild preference for non-cold dark matter cannot\nbe excluded based on the employed datasets. Additionally, for some datasets,\nthere is a pronounced preference for the presence of an interaction at more\nthan 95\\% confidence level (CL). Moreover, when the dark energy equation of\nstate lies in the phantom regime, the $S_8$ tension can be alleviated. This\nstudy suggests that cosmological models incorporating a non-cold dark matter\ncomponent should be considered as viable scenarios with novel phenomenological\nimplications, as reflected in the present work.",

    "abstract": "Extractive reading comprehension question answering (QA) datasets are\ntypically evaluated using Exact Match (EM) and F1-score, but these metrics\noften fail to fully capture model performance. With the success of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), they have been employed in various tasks, including\nserving as judges (LLM-as-a-judge). In this paper, we reassess the performance\nof QA models using LLM-as-a-judge across four reading comprehension QA\ndatasets. We examine different families of LLMs and various answer types to\nevaluate the effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge in these tasks. Our results show\nthat LLM-as-a-judge is highly correlated with human judgments and can replace\ntraditional EM/F1 metrics. By using LLM-as-a-judge, the correlation with human\njudgments improves significantly, from 0.22 (EM) and 0.40 (F1-score) to 0.85.\nThese findings confirm that EM and F1 metrics underestimate the true\nperformance of the QA models. While LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect for more\ndifficult answer types (e.g., job), it still outperforms EM/F1, and we observe\nno bias issues, such as self-preference, when the same model is used for both\nthe QA and judgment tasks.",

This paper introduces a fast and\naccurate parameter optimization method for the reservoir layer utilizing\nbackpropagation and gradient descent by adopting a modular DFR model. A\ntruncated backpropagation strategy is proposed to reduce memory consumption\nassociated with the expansion of the recursive structure while maintaining\naccuracy. The computation time is significantly reduced compared to grid\nsearch. Additionally, an in-place Ridge regression for the output layer via 1-D\nCholesky decomposition is presented, reducing memory usage to be 1/4.

When topological systems are extended into the\nnonlinear regime, linear topological edge states bifurcate into nonlinear\ncounterparts, and topological gap solitons emerge in the bulk of the\nstructures. Despite extensive studies of these two types of nonlinear states,\nself-induced topological edge states localized at the physical boundaries of\noriginally nontopological structures remain underexplored. Unlike the\npreviously reported self-induced topological transitions driven by nonlinear\ncouplings, which are conceptually straightforward but less common in realistic\ninteracting systems, here we experimentally realize self-induced topological\nedge states in a lattice with onsite nonlinearity. Leveraging the strong and\ntunable nonlinearity of electrical circuits, we systematically investigate the\nlocalized states in a nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Besides revisiting\nthe nonlinear topological edge states and topological gap solitons, we uncover\na novel type of self-induced topological edge states which exhibit the hallmark\nfeatures of linear topological edge states, including sublattice polarization,\nphase jumps, and decaying tails that approach zero. A distinctive feature of\nthese states is the boundary-induced power threshold for existence.

The objective of this work is to identify conditions under which\nRNNs exhibit perpetual oscillatory behavior, without converging to static fixed\npoints. We establish that skew-symmetric weight matrices are fundamental to\nenable stable limit cycles in both linear and nonlinear configurations. We\nfurther demonstrate that hyperbolic tangent-like activation functions (odd,\nbounded, and continuous) preserve these oscillatory dynamics by ensuring motion\ninvariants in state space. Numerical simulations showcase how nonlinear\nactivation functions not only maintain limit cycles, but also enhance the\nnumerical stability of the system integration process, mitigating those\ninstabilities that are commonly associated with the forward Euler method.

    "abstract": "We present a detailed study of the effective stress tensor of gravitational\nwave (GW) as the source for the background Einstein equation and examine three\ncandidates in literature. The second order perturbed Einstein tensor\n$G^{(2)}_{\\mu\\nu}$, up to a coefficient, proposed by Brill, Hartle, and\nIsaacson, has long been known to be covariantly nonconserved with respect to\nthe background spacetime. We observe that $G^{(2)}_{\\mu\\nu}$ is not a true\ntensor on the background spacetime. More importantly, we find that, by\nexpressing $G^{(2)}_{\\mu\\nu}$ in terms of the perturbed Hilbert-Einstein\nactions,\n  the nonconserved part of $G^{(2)}_{\\mu\\nu}$ is actually canceled out by the\nperturbed fluid stress tensors in the back-reaction equation, or is vanishing\nin absence of fluid. The remaining part of $G^{(2)}_{\\mu\\nu}$ is just the\nconserved effective stress tensor $\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$ proposed by Ford and Parker.\nAs the main result, we derive $\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$ for a general curved spacetime by\nvarying the GW action and show its conservation using the equation of GW. The\nstress tensor $T_{\\text{MT}}^{\\mu\\nu}$ proposed by MacCallum and Taub was based\non an action $J_2$. We derive $T_{\\text{MT}}^{\\mu\\nu}$ and find that it is\nnonconserved, and that $J_2$ does not give the correct GW equation in presence\nof matter. The difficulty with $J_2$ is due to a background Ricci tensor term,\nwhich should be also canceled out by the fluid term or vanishing in absence of\nfluid. We also demonstrate these three candidates in a flat Robertson-Walker\nspacetime. The conserved $\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$ has a positive energy density\nspectrum, and is adequate for the back-reaction in a perturbation scheme, while\nthe two nonconserved stress tensors have a negative spectrum at long\nwavelengths and are unphysical.",

Inspired by drug delivery applications, the proposed study aims to\nexamine the numerical modeling of a two-dimensional, axisymmetric, and\ntime-dependent hybrid nanofluid composed of copper $(Cu)$, alumina\n$(Al_{2}O_{3})$ nanoparticles, and blood as base fluid. Blood, modeled by the\nnon-Newtonian Casson model, flows through an elliptical stenotic artery. The\npulsatile nature of the pressure gradient and magnetic field impact with the\nHall current parameter are also taken into account in this study. A finite\ndifference technique, forward in time and central in space (FTCS), is deployed\nto numerically discretize the transformed dimensionless model using MATLAB.\nComprehensive visualization of the effects of hemodynamic, geometric, and\nnanoscale parameters on transport characteristics, and extensive graphical\nresults for blood flow characteristics are provided. A comparison is made among\nblood, regular nanofluid, and hybrid nanofluid to analyze their properties in\nrelation to fluid flow and heat transfer. An augmentation in the non-Newtonian\nparameter results in an amplification of velocity and in a reduction of the\ntemperature profile. Incorporating $Cu$ and $Al_2O_3$ nanoparticles into the\nfluid results in a decrease of velocity and an increase of temperature. These\nfindings possess significant practical implications for applications where\nefficient heat transfer is essential, such as in drug delivery systems and the\nthermal management of biomedical devices.

Recent deep learning\nmethods have improved robustness through learned representations, but remain\nconstrained by their dependence on extensive training data and computational\ndemands. We present Flow Intelligence, a paradigm-shifting approach that moves\nbeyond spatial features by focusing on temporal motion patterns exclusively.\nInstead of detecting traditional keypoints, our method extracts motion\nsignatures from pixel blocks across consecutive frames and extract temporal\nmotion signatures between videos. These motion-based descriptors achieve\nnatural invariance to translation, rotation, and scale variations while\nremaining robust across different imaging modalities. This novel approach also\nrequires no pretraining data, eliminates the need for spatial feature\ndetection, enables cross-modal matching using only temporal motion, and it\noutperforms existing methods in challenging scenarios where traditional\napproaches fail.

Previous work related to the above\nquestions include the celebrated result of Ab\\'ert and Vir\\'ag on the\ncompleteness of the finitely generated Hausdorff spectrum of the group of\n$p$-adic automorphisms $W_p$. We extend their result to any level-transitive\niterated wreath product acting on a regular rooted tree, and more importantly,\nprovide the first explicit examples of finitely generated subgroups with\nprescribed Hausdorff dimension. In fact, in $W_p$ such subgroups can be taken\nto be 2-generated, giving further evidence to a conjecture of Ab\\'ert and\nVir\\'ag. Furthermore, we extend a well-known result of Klopsch (1999) for\nbranch groups to closed level-transitive groups with fully dimensional rigid\nstabilizers: these have full Hausdorff spectrum with respect to the\nlevel-stabilizer filtration. In turn, we determine, for the first time, the\nHausdorff spectum of many well-studied families of weakly branch groups. As an\nadditional new contribution, we define {\\it nice filtrations} (which include\nthe level-stabilizer filtration). In fact, the first and the last result can be\nproven more generally with respect to these filtrations (under possibly some\nfurther assumptions). Finally, we also consider two standard filtrations,\nnamely the $2$-central lower series, and the dimension subgroup or\nJenning-Zassenhaus series in the closure of the first Grigorchuck group, and\nshow that its finitely generated Hausdorff spectra with respect to these\nfiltrations is the full interval [0,1], answering a recent question of de las\nHeras and Thillaisundaram (2022).

Endowed with the direct sum and product, functional digraphs\nform a semiring with an interesting multiplicative structure. For instance, we\ndo not know if the following division problem can be solved in polynomial time:\ngiven two functional digraphs $A$ and $B$, does $A$ divide $B$? That $A$\ndivides $B$ means that there exists a functional digraph $X$ such that $AX$ is\nisomorphic to $B$, and many such $X$ can exist. We can thus ask for the number\nof solutions $X$. In this paper, we focus on the case where $B$ is a sum of\ncycles (a disjoint union of cycles, corresponding to the limit behavior of\nfinite discrete-time dynamical systems). There is then a na\\\"ive\nsub-exponential algorithm to compute the non-isomorphic solutions $X$, and our\nmain result is an improvement of this algorithm which has the property to be\npolynomial when $A$ is fixed. It uses a divide-and-conquer technique that\nshould be useful for further developments on the division problem.",

    "abstract": "Current sign language machine translation systems rely on recognizing hand\nmovements, facial expressions and body postures, and natural language\nprocessing, to convert signs into text. Recent approaches use Transformer\narchitectures to model long-range dependencies via positional encoding.\nHowever, they lack accuracy in recognizing fine-grained, short-range temporal\ndependencies between gestures captured at high frame rates. Moreover, their\nhigh computational complexity leads to inefficient training. To mitigate these\nissues, we propose an Adaptive Transformer (ADAT), which incorporates\ncomponents for enhanced feature extraction and adaptive feature weighting\nthrough a gating mechanism to emphasize contextually relevant features while\nreducing training overhead and maintaining translation accuracy. To evaluate\nADAT, we introduce MedASL, the first public medical American Sign Language\ndataset. In sign-to-gloss-to-text experiments, ADAT outperforms the\nencoder-decoder transformer, improving BLEU-4 accuracy by 0.1% while reducing\ntraining time by 14.33% on PHOENIX14T and 3.24% on MedASL. In sign-to-text\nexperiments, it improves accuracy by 8.7% and reduces training time by 2.8% on\nPHOENIX14T and achieves 4.7% higher accuracy and 7.17% faster training on\nMedASL. Compared to encoder-only and decoder-only baselines in sign-to-text,\nADAT is at least 6.8% more accurate despite being up to 12.1% slower due to its\ndual-stream structure.",

Refining the concept of $k$-admissible matching\nof a graph defined by Erey and Hibi, we introduce the notion of generalized\n$k$-admissible matching for any hypergraph. Using this, we give a sharp lower\nbound on the (Castelnuovo-Mumford) regularity of $I^{[k]}$, where $I^{[k]}$\ndenotes the $k^{\\text{th}}$ square-free power of $I$. In the special case when\n$I$ is equigenerated in degree $d$, this lower bound can be described using a\ncombinatorial invariant $\\mathrm{aim}(\\mathcal{H}_I,k)$, called the\n$k$-admissible matching number of $\\mathcal{H}_I$. Specifically, we prove that\n$\\mathrm{reg}(I^{[k]})\\ge (d-1)\\mathrm{aim}(\\mathcal{H}_I,k)+k$, whenever\n$I^{[k]}$ is non-zero. Even for the edge ideal $I(G)$ of a graph $G$, it turns\nout that $\\mathrm{aim}(G,k)+k$ is the first general lower bound for the\nregularity of $I(G)^{[k]}$. In fact, when $G$ is a forest, $\\mathrm{aim}(G,k)$\ncoincides with the $k$-admissible matching number introduced by Erey and Hibi.\nNext, we show that if $G$ is a block graph, then $\\mathrm{reg}(I(G)^{[k]})=\n\\mathrm{aim}(G,k)+k$, and this result can be seen as a generalization of the\ncorresponding regularity formula for forests. Additionally, for a\nCohen-Macaulay chordal graph $G$, we prove that $\\mathrm{reg}(I(G)^{[2]})=\n\\mathrm{aim}(G,2)+2$.

This progression, in turn, lays the\ngroundwork for satisfying the necessary conditions for the Weak Gravity\nConjecture (WGC). Preliminary studies indicate that black holes such as the\nReissner-Nordstr$\\\"o$m (RN) model, in their initial form, lack the capacity to\nsustain super-extremality of the charge parameter. If such conditions arise,\nthese black holes transition into naked singularities-a scenario that is highly\nundesirable due to the loss of causality and the breakdown of space-time\ngeometry. This raises whether the inability to sustain super-extremality is an\ninherent property of the model or a consequence of the approximations and\nprecision limitations employed in its construction. To address this, we turned\nto the ModMax model, which represents an extension of the RN model. Our\nanalysis revealed that the ModMax model not only accommodates super-extremality\nof the charge parameter but also, under certain conditions, emerges as a\npromising candidate for investigating the WGC. Furthermore, we independently\nobserved how the inclusion of the de Sitter radius ($\\ell$) in the AdS model\nand $f(R)$ gravitational corrections-both of which enhance and complicate the\nmodel-can have a direct impact on the range of super-extremal charge tolerance\nwhich, in turn, provides the realization of the conditions necessary for the\nWGC.",

The separate-universe approach consists in describing the\nuniverse as a collection of homogeneous and isotropic patches, giving us an\neffective description of perturbation theory at large scales through\nphase-space reduction. This approximation is a necessary step in stochastic\ninflation, an effective theory of coarse-grained, super-Hubble, scalar fields\nfluctuations. One needs a stochastic inflation description in the context of\nprimordial black hole productions since it needs enhancements of the curvature\npower spectrum. It easily achievable in multifield inflation models but\nnecessarily comes with strong diffusive effects. We study and compare\ncosmological perturbation theory and the separate-universe approach in said\nnon-linear sigma models as a typical framework of multifield inflation and\nemploying the Hamiltonian formalism to keep track of the complete phase space\n(or the reduced isotropic phase space in the separate-universe approach). We\nfind that the separate-universe approach adequately describes the cosmological\nperturbation theory provided the wavelength of the modes considered is greater\nthat several lower bounds that depend on the cosmological horizon and the\ninverse of the effective Hamiltonian masses of the fields; the latter being\nfixed by the coupling potential and the field-space geometry.

A rich\nvariety of seismic events also distinguishes Azerbaijan, located in its south\npart. In this research, we consider the earthquakes, specifically spatial\nearthquake patterns that occurred in Azerbaijan and adjacent areas from 2010 to\n2023. Applying density-based clustering algorithms to the earthquake catalog,\nthe proper partitions of spatial earthquake distributions were obtained. The\nstatistical properties of the catalog's partition into 7 clusters are studied\nin more detail. In particular, we consider the random variable, which is the\ndistance from the fixed point of the earth's surface to earthquake epicenters.\nThe analytical approximation of the cumulative distribution function is\nconstructed for the case when the fixed point coincides with the cluster center\nand epicenters in the cluster are distributed by the bi-variate normal\ndistribution. For comparison, the numerical distribution functions are\nevaluated on the basis of Johnson curves and good agreement is observed.\nAnother case is also considered when the fixed point lies outside of a cluster.\nUnder the assumption that a cluster is a circle and epicenters in it are\ndistributed uniformly, the cumulative and probability distribution functions\nare derived. Applying these functions to the approximation of histograms for\nthe distances from the Shamkir hydroelectric power station to the clusters\nshows that satisfactory agreement can be achieved. These results are promising\nfor performing the seismic risk assessment for the Shamkir station or other\nobjects of Azerbaijan's critical infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to adversarial samples,\nraising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical tasks. Currently,\nmethods of evaluating adversarial robustness are primarily categorized into\nattack-based and certified robustness evaluation approaches. The former not\nonly relies on specific attack algorithms but also is highly time-consuming,\nwhile the latter due to its analytical nature, is typically difficult to\nimplement for large and complex models. A few studies evaluate model robustness\nbased on the model's decision boundary, but they suffer from low evaluation\naccuracy. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel adversarial\nrobustness evaluation metric, Robustness Difference Index (RDI), which is based\non model statistical features. RDI draws inspiration from clustering evaluation\nby analyzing the intra-class and inter-class distances of feature vectors\nseparated by the decision boundary to quantify model robustness. It is\nattack-independent and has high computational efficiency. Experiments show\nthat, RDI demonstrates a stronger correlation with the gold-standard\nadversarial robustness metric of attack success rate (ASR). The average\ncomputation time of RDI is only 1/30 of the evaluation method based on the PGD\nattack. Our open-source code is available at: https://github.com/BUPTAIOC/RDI.",

As MLLM\ncapabilities continue to advance, this study is the first to deliver an\nend-to-end VLM-based IAD solution that demonstrates the transformative\npotential of ROAM-enhanced GRPO, positioning our framework as a forward-looking\ncornerstone for next-generation intelligent anomaly detection systems in\nindustrial applications with limited defective data.",

Engaging deeply with\nstories and spotting plot holes -- inconsistencies in a storyline that break\nthe internal logic or rules of a story's world -- requires nuanced reasoning\nskills, including tracking entities and events and their interplay, abstract\nthinking, pragmatic narrative understanding, commonsense and social reasoning,\nand theory of mind. As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly generate,\ninterpret, and modify text, rigorously assessing their narrative consistency\nand deeper language understanding becomes critical. However, existing\nbenchmarks focus mainly on surface-level comprehension. In this work, we\npropose plot hole detection in stories as a proxy to evaluate language\nunderstanding and reasoning in LLMs. We introduce FlawedFictionsMaker, a novel\nalgorithm to controllably and carefully synthesize plot holes in human-written\nstories. Using this algorithm, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' plot\nhole detection abilities in stories -- FlawedFictions -- , which is robust to\ncontamination, with human filtering ensuring high quality. We find that\nstate-of-the-art LLMs struggle in accurately solving FlawedFictions regardless\nof the reasoning effort allowed, with performance significantly degrading as\nstory length increases. Finally, we show that LLM-based story summarization and\nstory generation are prone to introducing plot holes, with more than 50% and\n100% increases in plot hole detection rates with respect to human-written\noriginals.",

In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat a straightforward nearest-neighbor search framework can surpass\nstate-of-the-art performance in both single-class and multi-class FSAD\nscenarios. Our proposed method, VisionAD, consists of four simple yet essential\ncomponents: (1) scalable vision foundation models that extract universal and\ndiscriminative features; (2) dual augmentation strategies - support\naugmentation to enhance feature matching adaptability and query augmentation to\naddress the oversights of single-view prediction; (3) multi-layer feature\nintegration that captures both low-frequency global context and high-frequency\nlocal details with minimal computational overhead; and (4) a class-aware visual\nmemory bank enabling efficient one-for-all multi-class detection.

    "abstract": "This article is an engineering note, and formal abstract is omitted in\naccordance with the requirements of the journal. The main idea of this note is\nas follows. In endoatmospheric landing of reusable rockets, there exist various\nkinds of disturbances that can induce the trajectory dispersion. The trajectory\ndispersion propagates with flight time and ultimately determines landing\naccuracy. Therefore, to achieve high-precision landing, this note proposes a\nnovel online trajectory dispersion control method. Based on a Parameterized\nOptimal Feedback Guidance Law (POFGL), two key components of the proposed\nmethod are designed: online trajectory dispersion prediction and real-time\nguidance parameter tuning for trajectory dispersion optimization. First, by\nformalizing a parameterized probabilistic disturbance model, the closed-loop\ntrajectory dispersion under the POFGL is predicted online. Compared with the\ncovariance control guidance method, a more accurate trajectory dispersion\nprediction is achieved by using generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion\nand pseudospectral collocation methods. Second, to ensure computational\nefficiency, a gradient descent based real-time guidance parameter tuning law is\ndesigned to simultaneously optimize the performance index and meet the landing\nerror dispersion constraint, which significantly reduces the conservativeness\nof guidance design compared with the robust trajectory optimization method.\nNumerical simulations indicate that the trajectory dispersion prediction method\ncan achieve the same accuracy as the Monte Carlo method with smaller\ncomputational resource; the guidance parameter tuning law can improve the\noptimal performance index and meet the desired accuracy requirements through\ndirectly shaping the trajectory dispersion.",

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a powerful representation\nfor scene reconstruction, integrating it with open-vocabulary frameworks\nreveals a key challenge: cross-view granularity inconsistency. This issue,\nstemming from 2D segmentation methods like SAM, results in inconsistent object\nsegmentations across views (e.g., a \"coffee set\" segmented as a single entity\nin one view but as \"cup + coffee + spoon\" in another).

CAGS constructs local graphs to propagate contextual features across\nGaussians, reducing noise from inconsistent granularity, employs mask-centric\ncontrastive learning to smooth SAM-derived features across views, and leverages\na precomputation strategy to reduce computational cost by precomputing\nneighborhood relationships, enabling efficient training in large-scale scenes.\nBy integrating spatial context, CAGS significantly improves 3D instance\nsegmentation and reduces fragmentation errors on datasets like LERF-OVS and\nScanNet, enabling robust language-guided 3D scene understanding.",

We present a new method of detecting\nthe most significant contributions of wave activity within localised areas of\nthe domain, aided by Discrete Fourier Transforms and frequency filtering. We\ncorrelate oscillations in the vertical & horizontal magnetic field, velocities\nparallel & perpendicular to the magnetic field, and pressure to infer the\nnature of the dominant wave modes. Results. Our method captures the most\npowerful frequencies and wavenumbers, as well as providing a new diagnostic for\ndamping processes. We infer the presence of magnetoacoustic waves in the\nboundaries of prominent chromospheric/coronal swirling features. We find these\nwaves are likely damped by viscous heating in the swirl boundaries,\ncontributing to heating in the upper atmosphere. Conclusions. Using the most\nsignificant frequencies decomposition, we highlight that energy can be\ntransported from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere through waves and\nfluctuations along the swirl boundaries. Although further analysis is needed to\nconfirm these findings, our new method provides a path forward to investigate\nwave activity in the solar atmosphere",

Existing methods generally train pre-defined\nnetworks or subnetworks with capacities specifically designed for\npre-determined platforms, using compatible learning. Nevertheless, these\nmethods suffer from limited flexibility for multi-platform deployment. For\nexample, when introducing a new platform into the retrieval systems, developers\nhave to train an additional model at an appropriate capacity that is compatible\nwith existing models via backward-compatible learning.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in\npsychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models\noften struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance.\nTo address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal\ncues, which allows the AI therapist to better align its responses with the\nclient's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic\ndataset, Mirror (Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance), which is a\nnovel synthetic dataset that pairs each client's statements with corresponding\nfacial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline vision language models\n(VLMs) so that they can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate\nempathetic responses to effectively manage client resistance. These models are\nthen evaluated in terms of both their counseling skills as a therapist, and the\nstrength of therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our\nresults demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's\nability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT\napproaches. Human expert evaluations further confirm the effectiveness of our\napproach in managing client resistance and fostering therapeutic alliance.",

Estimating their shape, which is the\nfoundation of their state, is essential for establishing control.

To our knowledge, no existing work has\nsuccessfully achieved shape estimation using only onboard sensors such as\nInertial Measurement Units (IMUs).

We systematically analyze the characteristics of the threat:\ndynamism, time-exciting impact, and low prior knowledge dependency.

While CAN's integrity\nchecks mitigate attacks, Ethernet migration (e.g., DoIP/SOME/IP) introduces new\nsurfaces. We further investigate the feasibility of time-exciting threat under\nSOME/IP. To detect time-exciting threat, we introduce MDHP-Net, leveraging\nMulti-Dimentional Hawkes Process (MDHP) and temporal and message-wise feature\nextracting structures. Meanwhile, to estimate MDHP parameters, we developed the\nfirst GPU-optimized gradient descent solver for MDHP (MDHP-GDS).

We first investigate pure exploration for the BAR\nproblem under different criteria, and then minimize the regret with specific\nconstraints, in the context of further exploration in streaming algorithms.\n  - We begin by revisiting the lower bound for the $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-PAC\nalgorithm for Best Arm Identification (BAI) and adapt the classical\nKL-divergence argument to derive optimal bounds for $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-PAC\nalgorithms for BAR.\n  - We further study another variant of the problem, called $r$-BAR, which\nrequires the expected gap between the best arm and the optimal arm retained is\nless than $r$.

    "abstract": "Gray-box optimization employs Walsh decomposition to obtain non-linear\nvariable dependencies and utilize them to propose masks of variables that have\na joint non-linear influence on fitness value. These masks significantly\nimprove the effectiveness of variation operators. In some problems, all\nvariables are non-linearly dependent, making the aforementioned masks useless.\nWe analyze the features of the real-world instances of such problems and show\nthat many of their dependencies may have noise-like origins. Such noise-caused\ndependencies are irrelevant to the optimization process and can be ignored. To\nidentify them, we propose extending the use of Walsh decomposition by measuring\nvariable dependency strength that allows the construction of the weighted\ndynamic Variable Interaction Graph (wdVIG). wdVIGs adjust the dependency\nstrength to mixed individuals. They allow the filtering of irrelevant\ndependencies and re-enable using dependency-based masks by variation operators.\nWe verify the wdVIG potential on a large benchmark suite. For problems with\nnoise, the wdVIG masks can improve the optimizer's effectiveness. If all\ndependencies are relevant for the optimization, i.e., the problem is not\nnoised, the influence of wdVIG masks is similar to that of state-of-the-art\nstructures of this kind.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations\n(DAOs) have emerged in public good auctions, allowing \"small\" bidders to gather\ntogether and enlarge their influence in high-valued auctions. However, models\nand mechanisms in the existing research literature do not guarantee\nnon-excludability, which is a main property of public goods. As such, some\nmembers of the winning DAO may be explicitly prevented from accessing the\npublic good. This side effect leads to regrouping of small bidders within the\nDAO to have a larger say in the final outcome. In particular, we provide a\npolynomial-time algorithm to compute the best regrouping of bidders that\nmaximizes the total bidding power of a DAO. We also prove that such a\nregrouping is less-excludable, better aligning the needs of the entire DAO and\nthe nature of public goods. Next, notice that members of a DAO in public good\nauctions often have a positive externality among themselves. Thus we introduce\na collective factor into the members' utility functions. We further extend the\nmechanism's allocation for each member to allow for partial access to the\npublic good. Under the new model, we propose a mechanism that is incentive\ncompatible in generic games and achieves higher social welfare as well as\nless-excludable allocations.",

The study is carried out by\nmeasuring the C 1s line shape evolution for two hydrogenated samples one kept\nin the UHV chamber and the other progressively exposed to air. In particular,\nthe $sp^3$ relative intensity in the C 1s core-level spectrum, represented by\nthe area ratio $\\frac{sp^3}{sp^2+sp^3}$, was used as a marker for the\nhydrogenation-level and it resulted to vary by (4 $\\pm$ 2)$\\%$ in UHV after\nfour months. Thus, a long-term stability of hydrogenated monolayer graphene was\nfound, that indicates this material as a good candidate for hydrogen (or\ntritium) storage as long as it is kept in vacuum. On the other hand, the C 1s\nspectrum of the sample exposed to air shows a significant oxidation. A rapid\ngrowth up to saturation of the carbon oxides was observed with a time constant\n$\\tau$ = 1.8 $\\pm$ 0.2 hours. Finally, the re-exposure of the oxidised sample\nto atomic hydrogen was found to be an effective method for the recovery of\nhydrogenated graphene.

    "abstract": "Large text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image\nsynthesis capabilities, but their indiscriminate training on Internet-scale\ndata has led to learned concepts that enable harmful, copyrighted, or otherwise\nundesirable content generation. We address the task of concept erasure in\ndiffusion models, i.e., removing a specified concept from a pre-trained model\nsuch that prompting the concept (or related synonyms) no longer yields its\ndepiction, while preserving the model's ability to generate other content. We\npropose a novel method, Attentional Concept Erasure (ACE), that integrates a\nclosed-form attention manipulation with lightweight fine-tuning. Theoretically,\nwe formulate concept erasure as aligning the model's conditional distribution\non the target concept with a neutral distribution. Our approach identifies and\nnullifies concept-specific latent directions in the cross-attention modules via\na gated low-rank adaptation, followed by adversarially augmented fine-tuning to\nensure thorough erasure of the concept and its synonyms. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate on multiple benchmarks, including object classes, celebrity faces,\nexplicit content, and artistic styles, that ACE achieves state-of-the-art\nconcept removal efficacy and robustness. Compared to prior methods, ACE better\nbalances generality (erasing concept and related terms) and specificity\n(preserving unrelated content), scales to dozens of concepts, and is efficient,\nrequiring only a few seconds of adaptation per concept.

Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), which uses\nlaser lithotripsy to fragment stones for removal via a ureteroscope, is widely\nadopted due to its safety and effectiveness.

However, as the\nnumber of users surges and the sensing tasks become increasingly\ncompute-intensive, the huge amount of computation workloads and data\ntransmissions may overwhelm the edge system of limited resources. Accordingly,\nwe propose in this paper a scalable edge sensing framework for multi-task\nexecution, in the sense that the computation workload and communication\noverhead of the ES do not increase with the number of downstream users or\ntasks. By exploiting the task-relevant correlations, the proposed scheme\nimplements a unified encoder at the ES, which produces a common low-dimensional\nmessage from the sensing data and broadcasts it to all users to execute their\nindividual tasks. To achieve high sensing accuracy, we extend the well-known\ninformation bottleneck theory to a multi-task scenario to jointly optimize the\ninformation gathering and broadcast processes. We also develop an efficient\ntwo-step training procedure to optimize the parameters of the neural\nnetwork-based codecs deployed in the edge sensing system.

The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a\nharmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of\nBloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first\ndemonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride\n(hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane\ncomponents of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative,\nwhile the out-of-plane component is positive.

Behavior of such RB-I modes in\na polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored.

We\nattribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order\nphonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum\nmodulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal.

    "abstract": "Graph Transformers (GTs), which simultaneously integrate message-passing and\nself-attention mechanisms, have achieved promising empirical results in some\ngraph prediction tasks. Although these approaches show the potential of\nTransformers in capturing long-range graph topology information, issues\nconcerning the quadratic complexity and high computing energy consumption\nseverely limit the scalability of GTs on large-scale graphs. Recently, as\nbrain-inspired neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), facilitate the\ndevelopment of graph representation learning methods with lower computational\nand storage overhead through the unique event-driven spiking neurons. Inspired\nby these characteristics, we propose a linear-time Graph Transformer using\nSpiking Vector Quantization (GT-SVQ) for node classification. GT-SVQ\nreconstructs codebooks based on rate coding outputs from spiking neurons, and\ninjects the codebooks into self-attention blocks to aggregate global\ninformation in linear complexity. Besides, spiking vector quantization\neffectively alleviates codebook collapse and the reliance on complex machinery\n(distance measure, auxiliary loss, etc.) present in previous vector\nquantization-based graph learning methods. In experiments, we compare GT-SVQ\nwith other state-of-the-art baselines on node classification datasets ranging\nfrom small to large. Experimental results show that GT-SVQ has achieved\ncompetitive performances on most datasets while maintaining up to 130x faster\ninference speed compared to other GTs.",

While cloud environments offer several advantages for running\nbenchmarks, it is often reported that benchmark results can vary significantly\nbetween repetitions -- making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about\nreal-world performance. In this paper, we empirically quantify the impact of\ncloud performance variability on benchmarking results, focusing on stream\nprocessing applications as a representative type of data-intensive,\nperformance-critical system. In a longitudinal study spanning more than three\nmonths, we repeatedly executed an application benchmark used in research and\ndevelopment at Dynatrace.

Our study confirms that performance variability exists,\nbut it is less pronounced than often assumed (coefficient of variation of <\n3.7%). Unlike related studies, we find that performance does exhibit a daily\nand weekly pattern, although with only small variability (<= 2.5%). Re-using\nbenchmarking infrastructure across multiple repetitions introduces only a\nslight reduction in result accuracy (<= 2.5 percentage points). These key\nobservations hold consistently across different cloud regions and machine types\nwith different processor architectures.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have demonstrated significant potential\nin 3D medical image segmentation tasks. However, their high computational cost\nand inability to fully capture global 3D contextual information limit their\npractical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\ntext-guided diffusion model framework, TextDiffSeg. This method leverages a\nconditional diffusion framework that integrates 3D volumetric data with natural\nlanguage descriptions, enabling cross-modal embedding and establishing a shared\nsemantic space between visual and textual modalities. By enhancing the model's\nability to recognize complex anatomical structures, TextDiffSeg incorporates\ninnovative label embedding techniques and cross-modal attention mechanisms,\neffectively reducing computational complexity while preserving global 3D\ncontextual integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that TextDiffSeg\nconsistently outperforms existing methods in segmentation tasks involving\nkidney and pancreas tumors, as well as multi-organ segmentation scenarios.\nAblation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components,\nhighlighting the synergistic interaction between text fusion, image feature\nextractor, and label encoder.

    "abstract": "Cooperative path planning is gaining its importance due to the increasing\ndemand on using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for complex missions.\nThis work addresses the problem by introducing a new algorithm named MultiRRT\nthat extends the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) to generate paths for a\ngroup of UAVs to reach multiple goal locations at the same time. We first\nderive the dynamics constraint of the UAV and include it in the problem\nformulation. MultiRRT is then developed, taking into account the cooperative\nrequirements and safe constraints during its path-searching process. The\nalgorithm features two new mechanisms, node reduction and Bezier interpolation,\nto ensure the feasibility and optimality of the paths generated. Importantly,\nthe interpolated paths are proven to meet the safety and dynamics constraints\nimposed by obstacles and the UAVs. A number of simulations, comparisons, and\nexperiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed\napproach. The results show that MultiRRT can generate collision-free paths for\nmultiple UAVs to reach their goals with better scores in path length and\nsmoothness metrics than state-of-the-art RRT variants including Theta-RRT,\nFN-RRT, RRT*, and RRT*-Smart. The generated paths are also tested in practical\nflights with real UAVs to evaluate their validity for cooperative tasks.

    "abstract": "Motivated by large intelligent surface applications, the electric field\nproperties of near field focusing using phase conjugation method are analyzed\nfor cylindrical dipole arrays. Firstly, for the transmitting antennas featuring\nvertical polarization, the polarization characteristic is decomposed along the\nx, y, and z directions. Three typical cases are studied when the focal points\nare at (xf , 0, 0), (0, yf , 0), and (0, 0, zf ). When the length of the\ncylindrical dipole array is significantly larger compared to its radius,\ncertain unique insights emerge. When the focal point is positioned along (0, 0,\nzf ), apart from the region on both sides, the ratio between Ez and Ex/Ey\nremains {\\pi}/2. Additionally, When the focal point is located within the\ncylinder, the electric field of each polarization is approximately the same\neverywhere. In other words, beam focusing does not incur losses due to\ndifferent positions. The focusing resolution of Ez is the same in the\ntransverse and longitudinal directions. Different from the situation where the\n3 - dB focal beam depth is much smaller than the focal beam width for the most\nof arrays, the resolution in the longitudinal can be improved, respectively.\nThrough a comprehensive grasp of these design principles, we can gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the specific areas with significant potential for practical\napplications.",

Existing methods\ninsufficiently consider the diversity of structure misalignment in raw depth\nmaps, which leads to poor generalization in real-world depth recovery. Notably,\nrandom structure misalignments are not limited to raw depth data but also\naffect GT depth in real-world datasets. In the proposed method, we tackle the\ngeneralization problem from both input and output perspectives. For input, we\nenrich the diversity of structure misalignment in raw depth maps by designing a\nnew raw depth generation pipeline, which helps the network avoid overfitting to\na specific condition. Furthermore, a structure uncertainty module is designed\nto explicitly identify the misaligned structure for input raw depth maps to\nbetter generalize in unseen scenarios. Notably the well-trained depth\nfoundation model (DFM) can help the structure uncertainty module estimate the\nstructure uncertainty better. For output, a robust feature alignment module is\ndesigned to precisely align with the accurate structure of RGB images avoiding\nthe interference of inaccurate GT depth.

Particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) is widely adopted among SI algorithms due to its simplicity\nand efficiency. Despite numerous learning strategies proposed to enhance PSO's\nperformance in terms of convergence speed, robustness, and adaptability, no\ncomprehensive and systematic analysis of these strategies exists.

However, deep\nlearning models often require large datasets and significant computational\nresources at training and inference due to their high-dimensional\nparameterizations. To address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning\nframework that discovers a low-dimensional manifold within the parameter space\nof an over-parameterized neural network architecture. This manifold is learned\nfrom a meta-dataset of input-output sequences generated by a class of related\ndynamical systems, enabling efficient model training while preserving the\nnetwork's expressive power for the considered system class. Unlike bilevel\nmeta-learning approaches, our method employs an auxiliary neural network to map\ndatasets directly onto the learned manifold, eliminating the need for costly\nsecond-order gradient computations during meta-training and reducing the number\nof first-order updates required in inference, which could be expensive for\nlarge models. We validate our approach on a family of Bouc-Wen oscillators,\nwhich is a well-studied nonlinear system identification benchmark.

One approach to this question is to\ncompare the cognitive dynamics of humans and large language models (LLMs).\nHowever, such a comparison requires a method to quantitatively analyze AI\ncognitive behavior under controlled conditions. While anecdotal observations\nsuggest that certain prompts can dramatically change LLM behavior, these\nobservations have remained largely qualitative. Here, we propose a two-part\nframework to investigate this phenomenon: a Transition-Inducing Prompt (TIP)\nthat triggers a rapid shift in LLM responsiveness, and a Transition Quantifying\nPrompt (TQP) that evaluates this change using a separate LLM. Through\ncontrolled experiments, we examined how LLMs react to prompts embedding two\nsemantically distant concepts (e.g., mathematical aperiodicity and traditional\ncrafts)-either fused together or presented separately-by changing their\nlinguistic quality and affective tone. Whereas humans tend to experience\nheightened engagement when such concepts are meaningfully blended producing a\nnovel concept-a form of conceptual fusion-current LLMs showed no significant\ndifference in responsiveness between semantically fused and non-fused prompts.\nThis suggests that LLMs may not yet replicate the conceptual integration\nprocesses seen in human intuition.

Since\nat the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure\nstate, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's\nconjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum\namplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the\nsystem always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the\ninitial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical\npotential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat\nflowing to the environment.

Enhancing the robustness of the\nextracted feature representations is a main challenge in Re-ID. Existing\nmethods usually improve feature representation by improving model architecture,\nbut most methods ignore the potential contextual information, which limits the\neffectiveness of feature representation and retrieval performance. Neighborhood\ninformation, especially the potential information of multi-order neighborhoods,\ncan effectively enrich feature expression and improve retrieval accuracy, but\nthis has not been fully explored in existing research. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel model DMON-ARO that leverages latent neighborhood information to enhance\nboth feature representation and index performance.

Due to the\ninherent decoding ambiguity in DAC, the number of candidate paths grows\nexponentially with the increase in source length. To select the correct\ndecoding path from the set of candidates, DAC decoders utilize the Maximum A\nPosteriori (MAP) metric to rank the decoding sequences, outputting the path\nwith the highest MAP metric as the decoding result of the decoder. However,\nthis method may still inadvertently output incorrect paths that have a MAP\nmetric higher than the correct decoding path, despite not being the correct\ndecoding path. To address the issue, we propose Distributed Arithmetic Coding\nAided by Linear Codes (DALC), which employs linear codes to constrain the\ndecoding process, thereby eliminating some incorrect paths and preserving the\ncorrect one. During the encoding phase, DALC generates the parity bits of the\nlinear code for encoding the source data. In the decoding phase, each path in\nthe set of candidate paths is verified in descending order according to the MAP\nmetric until a path that meets the verification criteria is encountered, which\nis then outputted as the decoding result. DALC enhances the decoding\nperformance of DAC by excluding candidate paths that do not meet the\nconstraints imposed by linear codes.

To\naddress this, we develop CSEBenchmark, a fine-grained cybersecurity evaluation\nframework based on 345 knowledge points expected of cybersecurity experts.\nDrawing from cognitive science, these points are categorized into factual,\nconceptual, and procedural types, enabling the design of 11,050 tailored\nmultiple-choice questions. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs on CSEBenchmark and find\nthat even the best-performing model achieves only 85.42% overall accuracy, with\nparticular knowledge gaps in the use of specialized tools and uncommon\ncommands. Different LLMs have unique knowledge gaps. Even large models from the\nsame family may perform poorly on knowledge points where smaller models excel.\nBy identifying and addressing specific knowledge gaps in each LLM, we achieve\nup to an 84% improvement in correcting previously incorrect predictions across\nthree existing benchmarks for two cybersecurity tasks. Furthermore, our\nassessment of each LLM's knowledge alignment with specific cybersecurity roles\nreveals that different models align better with different roles, such as GPT-4o\nfor the Google Senior Intelligence Analyst and Deepseek-V3 for the Amazon\nPrivacy Engineer.

Also, recent literature exhibits that quantum generative\nintelligences encompass superior potential than their classical counterpart,\nmotivating us to develop quantum generative adversarial networks (GANs) for\nSRS. However, existing quantum GANs are restricted by the limited quantum bit\n(qubit) resources of current quantum computers and process merely a small 2x2\ngrayscale image, far from being applicable to SRS. Recently, the novel concept\nof hybrid quantum-classical GAN, a quantum generator with a classical\ndiscriminator, has upgraded the order to 28x28 (still grayscale), whereas it is\nstill insufficient for SRS. This motivates us to design a radically new hybrid\nframework, where both generator and discriminator are hybrid architectures. We\ndemonstrate this feasibility, leading to a breakthrough of processing 128x128\nhyperspectral images for SRS. Specifically, we design the quantum part with\nmathematically provable quantum full expressibility (FE) to address core signal\nprocessing tasks, wherein the FE property allows the quantum network to realize\nany valid quantum operator with appropriate training. The classical part,\ncomposed of convolutional layers, treats the read-in (compressing the optical\ninformation into limited qubits) and read-out (addressing the quantum collapse\neffect) procedures.

Specifically,\nthis approach enriches linguistic diversity while preserving semantic meaning.\nWe further introduce an evaluation metric, Total Agreement Rate with\nSemantically Equivalent Input and Correct Answer (TAR-SC), which assesses a\nmodel's capability to generate consistent and correct responses to semantically\nequivalent linguistic variations.

Using the SEQA\nframework, we augmented the benchmarked MVQA public datasets of SLAKE, VQA-RAD,\nand PathVQA.

    "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) and Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are\nrapidly evolving, providing unprecedented capabilities for human-computer\ninteraction. However, their integration introduces a new attack surface for\nsocial engineering. In this paper, we systematically investigate the\nfeasibility of orchestrating AR-driven Social Engineering attacks using\nMultimodal LLM for the first time, via our proposed SEAR framework, which\noperates through three key phases: (1) AR-based social context synthesis, which\nfuses Multimodal inputs (visual, auditory and environmental cues); (2)\nrole-based Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which dynamically\nretrieves and integrates contextual data while preserving character\ndifferentiation; and (3) ReInteract social engineering agents, which execute\nadaptive multiphase attack strategies through inference interaction loops. To\nverify SEAR, we conducted an IRB-approved study with 60 participants in three\nexperimental configurations (unassisted, AR+LLM, and full SEAR pipeline)\ncompiling a new dataset of 180 annotated conversations in simulated social\nscenarios. Our results show that SEAR is highly effective at eliciting\nhigh-risk behaviors (e.g., 93.3% of participants susceptible to email\nphishing). The framework was particularly effective in building trust, with 85%\nof targets willing to accept an attacker's call after an interaction. Also, we\nidentified notable limitations such as ``occasionally artificial'' due to\nperceived authenticity gaps. This work provides proof-of-concept for AR-LLM\ndriven social engineering attacks and insights for developing defensive\ncountermeasures against next-generation augmented reality threats.",

    "abstract": "With the growing density of wireless networks and demand for multi-hop\ntransmissions, precise delay Quality of Service (QoS) analysis has become a\ncritical challenge. This paper introduces a multi-hop delay QoS analysis\nframework based on the sliding block martingale, addressing the loose boundary\nissue of prior methods that rely on service process martingales and min-plus\ntransformations. By constructing a sliding block martingale with a window, we\ncapture both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in the backlog,\neliminating the reliance on the generalized incremental property. The framework\nredefines delay unreliability events using cascading attributes, deriving a\nmore compact Delay Unreliability Probability Boundary (DUPB). To improve the\nefficiency of solving the key parameter $\\theta$, we propose a Micrometric\nIntervals based Supermartingale Upcrossing Estimate Theorem, quantifying the\nupper bound of event occurrence frequency to constrain the solution space of\n$\\theta$. Simulations based on the 3GPP UMa/UMi channel model validate the\nframework's effectiveness. Results show that in 2-7 hop scenarios, the maximum\ndeviation between theoretical boundaries and Monte Carlo simulations is $4.116\n\\times 10^{-5}$, with a lower RMSE than existing methods. Iteration count and\nCPU time for solving $\\theta$ are reduced by $59\\%-72\\%$ and $60.6\\%-70.5\\%$,\nrespectively, improving analysis efficiency. Furthermore, the derived minimum\nservice rate for multi-hop queues offers a valuable reference for resource\nallocation.

    "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) face increasing inference latency as\ninput context length and model size continue to grow. In particular, the\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which enhances LLM responses by\nincorporating external knowledge, exacerbates this issue by significantly\nincreasing the number of input tokens. This expansion in token length leads to\na substantial rise in computational overhead, particularly during the prefill\nstage, resulting in prolonged time-to-first-token (TTFT). To address this\nissue, this paper proposes a method to reduce TTFT by leveraging a disk-based\nkey-value (KV) cache to lessen the computational burden during the prefill\nstage. We also introduce a disk-based shared KV cache management system, called\nShared RAG-DCache, for multi-instance LLM RAG service environments. This\nsystem, together with an optimal system configuration, improves both throughput\nand latency under given resource constraints. Shared RAG-DCache exploits the\nlocality of documents related to user queries in RAG, as well as the queueing\ndelay in LLM inference services. It proactively generates and stores disk KV\ncaches for query-related documents and shares them across multiple LLM\ninstances to enhance inference performance. In experiments on a single host\nequipped with 2 GPUs and 1 CPU, Shared RAG-DCache achieved a 15~71% increase in\nthroughput and up to a 12~65% reduction in latency, depending on the resource\nconfiguration.",

To address this, we devise a novel GNN-based\nmesh learning framework with two key components to extend the message-passing\nrange with minimal overhead, namely the Laplacian-Smoothed Dual Message-Passing\n(LSDMP) and the Geodesic Self-Attention (GSA) modules. LSDMP enhances\nmessage-passing with a Laplacian features smoothing process, which efficiently\npropagates the impact of each vertex to nearby vertices. Concurrently, GSA\nintroduces geodesic distance embeddings to represent the spatial relationship\nbetween vertices and utilises attention mechanisms to capture global mesh\ninformation.

Here, we performed computational\nsimulations to investigate this surface reaction process. Specifically, we\nsimulated the gas-solid reactions of Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl(LPSC) solid-state\nelectrolytes in pure CO$_2$ and in mixed CO$_2$/O$_2$ atmospheres using\nab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine-learning force fields\n(MLFF)-accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) approaches.

While in CO$_2$/O$_2$\nmixed atmosphere, O$_2$ molecules preferentially adsorb onto LPSC, which\nsupplies oxygen sites for subsequent CO$_2$ adsorption to form carbonate\n-CO$_3$ units. This reaction pathway ultimately generates an interfacial\nproduct dominated by Li$_2$CO$_3$.

    "abstract": "This study introduces a computationally efficient algorithm, delayed\nacceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC), designed to improve posterior\nsimulation in quasi-Bayesian inference. Quasi-Bayesian methods, which do not\nrequire fully specifying a probabilistic model, are often computationally\nexpensive owing to the need to evaluate the inverse and determinant of large\ncovariance matrices. DA-MCMC addresses this challenge by employing a two-stage\nprocess: In the first stage, proposals are screened using an approximate\nposterior, whereas a final acceptance or rejection decision is made in the\nsecond stage based on the exact target posterior. This reduces the need for\ncostly matrix computations, thereby improving efficiency without sacrificing\naccuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DA-MCMC through applications to\nboth synthetic and real data. The results demonstrate that, although DA-MCMC\nslightly reduces the effective sample size per iteration compared with the\nstandard MCMC, it achieves substantial improvement in terms of effective sample\nsize per second, approximately doubling the efficiency.

Further, we delve into the computational trade-offs and\nrobustness characteristics of RC architectures, extending the discussion to\ntheir applications in signal processing, time-series prediction, and control\nsystems. The analysis is complemented by theoretical insights into\noptimization, training methodologies, and scalability, highlighting open\nchallenges and potential directions for advancing the theoretical underpinnings\nof RC.",

    "abstract": "Modern analytical query engines (AQEs) are essential for large-scale data\nanalysis and processing. These systems usually provide numerous query-level\ntunable knobs that significantly affect individual query performance. While\nseveral studies have explored automatic DBMS configuration tuning, they have\nseveral limitations to handle query-level tuning. Firstly, they fail to capture\nhow knobs influence query plans, which directly affect query performance.\nSecondly, they overlook query failures during the tuning processing, resulting\nin low tuning efficiency. Thirdly, they struggle with cold-start problems for\nnew queries, leading to prolonged tuning time. To address these challenges, we\npropose AQETuner, a novel Bayesian Optimization-based system tailored for\nreliable query-level knob tuning in AQEs. AQETuner first applies the attention\nmechanisms to jointly encode the knobs and plan query, effectively identifying\nthe impact of knobs on plan nodes. Then, AQETuner employs a dual-task Neural\nProcess to predict both query performance and failures, leveraging their\ninteractions to guide the tuning process. Furthermore, AQETuner utilizes\nParticle Swarm Optimization to efficiently generate high-quality samples in\nparallel during the initial tuning stage for the new queries. Experimental\nresults show that AQETuner significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing\nquery latency by up to 23.7% and query failures by up to 51.2%.",

Out\nof the 17 observations, 5 showed lags of a few 10s of seconds with an asymmetry\nin the CCF between the soft and hard bands in their cross-correlation function\n(CCF) analysis. Interestingly, during these observations, a ballistic-type\nradio jet of Ultra-relativistic(UR) nature was reported. The observed lags and\nassociated cross-correlation coefficients were validated using simulations. The\nrest of the 12 observations' CCFs were symmetric, and their associated Power\nDensity Spectrum (PDS) displayed Normal Branch(NBO)/Normal + Horizontal Branch\nOscillations(NBO+HBO). The X-ray spectral study of 2 obs. where radio core\nemission was seen with abrupt variation in both PDS and CCF showed a black-body\nflux variation of 10-20%, but no spectral parameter varied. We suggest that the\nballistic jet caused a disturbance in the inner accretion region, viz., the\nBoundary Layer plausibly along with the Corona, that caused the lags observed\nin the CCFs along with the absence of any oscillatory features in the PDS\ntracing only a flat-topped noise. Whereas the regions with no lags showed a\npersistent NBO/NBO+HBO feature, suggesting a steady accretion flow. Although\nthe UR jet can't be related to NBO or HBO, we suggest it could be related to\nthe phenomena that cause NBO since the majority of PDSs displayed NBO. We also\nconstrain the inner accretion region size to 20-30 km, which is responsible for\nthe accretion ejecta in Sco X-1.",

We analyze performance dynamics using fine-grained\noperator-to-kernel trace analysis, facilitated by our novel profiler SKIP and\nmetrics like Total Kernel Launch and Queuing Time (TKLQT). Results show that\nclosely-coupled (CC) GH200 significantly outperforms loosely-coupled (LC)\nsystems at large batch sizes, achieving 1.9x-2.7x faster prefill latency for\nLlama 3.2-1B. However, our analysis also reveals that GH200 remains CPU-bound\nup to 4x larger batch sizes than LC systems. In this extended CPU-bound region,\nwe identify the performance characteristics of the Grace CPU as a key factor\ncontributing to higher inference latency at low batch sizes on GH200. We\ndemonstrate that TKLQT accurately identifies this CPU/GPU-bound transition\npoint.

    "abstract": "The initial Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma_{\\text{0}}$) plays a crucial role in\nuncovering the physical characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previous\nstudies have indicated that the ambient medium density index $k$ for GRBs falls\nin the range of 0 - 2, rather than exactly equal to 0 (homogeneous interstellar\nambient) or 2 (typical stellar wind). In this work, we aim to constrain the\n$\\Gamma_0$ of GRBs considering their distinct circumburst medium. We select a\ntotal of 33 GRBs for our analysis, comprising 7 X-ray GRBs and 26 optical GRBs.\nSubsequently, by utilizing the deceleration time of fireball $t_{\\rm p}$, we\nderive the $\\Gamma_0$ for the 33 GRBs assuming the radiation efficiency of\n$\\eta =$ 0.2. The inferred initial Lorentz factor was found to be from 50 to\n500, consistent with previous studies. We then investigate the correlation\nbetween the $\\Gamma_0$ and the isotropic energy $E_{\\rm \\gamma,iso}$ (as well\nas the mean isotropic luminosity $L_{\\rm \\gamma,iso}$), finding very tight\ncorrelations between them, i.e., $\\Gamma_0$ $\\propto$ $E^{0.24}_{\\rm\n\\gamma,iso,52}$ ($\\Gamma_0$ $\\propto$ $L^{0.20}_{\\rm \\gamma,iso.49}$) with\n$\\eta$=0.2. Additionally, we verify the correlation among $\\Gamma_0$, the\nisotropic energy $E_{\\rm \\gamma,iso}$ (or $L_{\\rm \\gamma,iso}$) and the peak\nenergy $E_{\\rm{p,z}}$, i.e., $E_{\\rm \\gamma,iso,52}$ $\\propto$\n$\\Gamma^{1.36}_0$$E^{0.82}_{\\rm{p,z}}$ ($L_{\\rm \\gamma,iso,49}$ $\\propto$\n$\\Gamma^{1.05}_0$$E^{0.66}_{\\rm{p,z}}$) under the same radiation efficiency\n($\\eta$=0.2).",

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel, universal SPI configuration for tracking and\nimaging moving objects.Unlike traditional motion compensation methods, our\napproach enables the recovery of targets undergoing arbitrary motion, including\ntranslation, rotation, periodic, or non-periodic movements, within a\ntwo-dimensional plane without increasing the number of modulation frames.By\nleveraging the centroid positions from multiple wavelength channels, we\ndetermine the target's motion state from a kinematic perspective. Moreover, we\ndeveloped an adapted reconstruction method, the (P-IT) pseudo-inverse\ntransformation method, which allows for the efficient reconstruction of objects\nwith composite motion. With a maximum flip rate of 20 kHz for the digital\nmicromirror device (DMD), the theoretical perception frame rate can reach up to\n2222 Hz, comparable to that of conventional motion-compensated SPI for purely\ntranslational objects.",

Our benchmark is comprised\nof a collection of Chinese and English menus, characterized by intricate\nlayouts, a variety of fonts, and culturally specific elements across different\nlanguages, along with precise human annotations. Experiments show that our\nautomatic evaluation results are highly consistent with professional human\nevaluation. We evaluate a range of publicly available state-of-the-art LVLMs,\nand through analyzing their output to identify the strengths and weaknesses in\ntheir performance, offering valuable insights to guide future advancements in\nLVLM development. MOTBench is available at https://github.com/gitwzl/MOTBench.",

    "abstract": "When we deal with a matroid ${\\mathcal M}=(U,{\\mathcal I})$, we usually\nassume that it is implicitly given by means of the independence (IND) oracle.\nTime complexity of many existing algorithms is polynomially bounded with\nrespect to $|U|$ and the running time of the IND-oracle. However, they are not\nefficient any more when $U$ is exponentially large in some context. In this\npaper, we propose two algorithms for enumerating matroid bases such that the\ntime complexity does not depend on $|U|$. For some integer $L$, the first\nalgorithm enumerates the first $L$ minimum-weight bases in\nincremental-polynomial time and the remaining ones in polynomial-delay. To\ndesign the algorithm, we assume two oracles other than the IND-oracle: the\nMinB-oracle that returns a minimum basis and the REL-oracle that returns a\nrelevant element one by one in non-decreasing order of weight. The proposed\nalgorithm is applicable to enumeration of minimum bases of binary matroids from\ncycle space and cut space, all of which have exponentially large $U$ with\nrespect to a given graph. The highlight in this context is that, to design the\nREL-oracle for cut space, we develop the first polynomial-delay algorithm that\nenumerates all relevant cuts of a given graph in non-decreasing order of\nweight. The second algorithm enumerates all sets of linearly independent\n$r$-dimensional $r$ vectors over $\\mathit{GF}(2)$ in polynomial-delay, which\nimmediately yields a polynomial-delay algorithm %%with respect to the matroid\nrank $r$ that enumerates all unweighted bases of a binary matroid such that\nelements are closed under addition.",

However, it is difficult to label micro-activities\nin massive IMU data due to the hardness of understanding raw IMU data and the\nlack of ground truth. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained user\nperception approach, called Saga, which only needs a small amount of labelled\nIMU data to achieve stunning user perception accuracy. The core idea of Saga is\nto first pre-train a backbone feature extraction model, utilizing the rich\nsemantic information of different levels embedded in the massive unlabelled IMU\ndata. Meanwhile, for a specific downstream user perception application,\nBayesian Optimization is employed to determine the optimal weights for\npre-training tasks involving different semantic levels. We implement Saga on\nfive typical mobile phones and evaluate Saga on three typical tasks on three\nIMU datasets. Results show that when only using about 100 training samples per\nclass, Saga can achieve over 90% accuracy of the full-fledged model trained on\nover ten thousands training samples with no additional system overhead.",

Since this\nQ-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for\nboth synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method\napplies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems.

We validate our approach in a comprehensive\nin-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator\nwith black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in \"driving on the edge\"\nscenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF\nassistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter.\nExperimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF\nimproves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or\ncomfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF\nboosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.",

    "abstract": "Sparse linear system solvers ($Ax=b$) are critical computational kernels in\nElectronic Design Automation (EDA), underpinning vital simulations for modern\nIC and system design. Applications like power integrity verification and\nelectrothermal analysis fundamentally solve large-scale, sparse algebraic\nsystems from Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) or Finite Element/Volume Method\n(FEM/FVM) discretizations of PDEs. Problem dimensions routinely reach\n$10^6-10^9$ unknowns, escalating towards $10^{10}$+ for full-chip power grids\n\\cite{Tsinghua21}, demanding stringent solver scalability, low memory\nfootprint, and efficiency. This paper surveys predominant sparse solver\nparadigms in EDA: direct factorization methods (LU, Cholesky), iterative Krylov\nsubspace methods (CG, GMRES, BiCGSTAB), and multilevel multigrid techniques. We\nexamine their mathematical foundations, convergence, conditioning sensitivity,\nimplementation aspects (storage formats CSR/CSC, fill-in mitigation via\nreordering), the critical role of preconditioning for ill-conditioned systems\n\\cite{SaadIterative, ComparisonSolversArxiv}, and multigrid's potential optimal\n$O(N)$ complexity \\cite{TrottenbergMG}. Solver choice critically depends on the\nperformance impact of frequent matrix updates (e.g., transient/non-linear),\nwhere iterative/multigrid methods often amortize costs better than direct\nmethods needing repeated factorization \\cite{SaadIterative}. We analyze\ntrade-offs in runtime complexity, memory needs, numerical robustness, parallel\nscalability (MPI, OpenMP, GPU), and precision (FP32/FP64). Integration into EDA\ntools for system-level multiphysics is discussed, with pseudocode\nillustrations.

Specifically, learned systems for scene\nmeasurement and state estimation tend to degrade when the application scenarios\ndeviate from the training data, resulting to unreliable depth and pose\nestimation. Toward addressing this problem, this work aims to develop a visual\nodometry system that can fast adapt to diverse novel environments in an online\nmanner. To this end, we construct a self-supervised online adaptation framework\nfor monocular visual odometry aided by an online-updated depth estimation\nmodule.

The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) offers\nsignificant potential in realizing these goals. However, existing efforts that\nleverage LLMs for wireless communication often overlook the considerable gap\nbetween human natural language and the intricacies of real-world communication\nsystems, thus failing to fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs. To address\nthis gap, we propose a novel LLM-driven paradigm for wireless communication\nthat innovatively incorporates the nature language to structured query language\n(NL2SQL) tool. Specifically, in this paradigm, user personal requirements is\nthe primary focus. Upon receiving a user request, LLMs first analyze the user\nintent in terms of relevant communication metrics and system parameters.\nSubsequently, a structured query language (SQL) statement is generated to\nretrieve the specific parameter values from a high-performance real-time\ndatabase. We further utilize LLMs to formulate and solve an optimization\nproblem based on the user request and the retrieved parameters. The solution to\nthis optimization problem then drives adjustments in the communication system\nto fulfill the user's requirements. To validate the feasibility of the proposed\nparadigm, we present a prototype system. In this prototype, we consider\nuser-request centric semantic communication (URC-SC) system in which a dynamic\nsemantic representation network at the physical layer adapts its encoding depth\nto meet user requirements.

How are language and\nimages organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and\nmodality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)\non the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,\nand AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of\nlearned directions, or \"concepts\". We find that, compared to other methods of\nlinear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,\nwhile also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different\nseeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts\ncaptured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that\ncommonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,\nwhile most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not\nmerely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace\nthat defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good\nmodality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To\nquantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that\nidentifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text\ninputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even\nsingle-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We\nrelease interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to\nexplore the organization of the concept spaces.

To this end, future\nnetworks are evolving toward an integrated heterogeneous service provisioning\n(IHSP) platform, which seeks to integrate a broad range of heterogeneous\nservices beyond the dual-function scope of ISAC. Nevertheless, this trend\nintensifies conflicts among concurrent heterogeneous service requirements under\nconstrained resource sharing. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the\njoint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value\nassessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently,\nwe propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA)\nmechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric\nby incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and\ncompromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained\nresources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services\nand enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing\ndemands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using\nappropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This\nprotocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation\ncapabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts\nand co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the\nsystem's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA and power allocation. Since this\nproblem is non-convex, we develop a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic\nprogramming algorithm for the optimal solution and a VoS-prioritized successive\nconvex approximation algorithm for efficient suboptimal computation.",

These challenges become even more pronounced when\nstudying the resonance states of nuclear systems, which are governed by the\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Quantum computing, particularly for quantum\nmany-body systems, offers a promising alternative, especially within the\nconstraints of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This\nwork aims to simulate nuclear resonances using quantum algorithms by developing\na variational framework compatible with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and\nimplementing it fully on a quantum simulator. We employ the complex scaling\ntechnique to extract resonance positions classically and adapt it for quantum\nsimulations using a two-step algorithm. First, we transform the non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian into a Hermitian form by using the energy variance as a cost\nfunction within a variational framework. Second, we perform theta-trajectory\ncalculations to determine optimal resonance positions in the complex energy\nplane. To address resource constraints on NISQ devices, we utilize Gray Code\n(GC) encoding to reduce qubit requirements. We first validate our approach\nusing a schematic potential model that mimics a nuclear potential, successfully\nreproducing known resonance energies with high fidelity. We then extend the\nmethod to a more realistic alpha-alpha nuclear potential and compute the\nresonance energies with a basis size of 16, using only four qubits. This study\ndemonstrates, for the first time, that the complete theta-trajectory method can\nbe implemented on a quantum computer without relying on any classical input\nbeyond the Hamiltonian.

This planet serves to illustrate several\nimportant features. Assuming different chemical compositions for its atmosphere\n(e.g., H$_2$/He only and $Z \\in \\{1, 12\\}$ times solar metallicity), the\noutgoing radiative flux is computed using full radiative transfer that folds in\nthe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel instrument characteristics. We\nfind that the observed variability depends strongly on the the assumed\nchemistry and the instrument wavelength range, hence the probed altitude of the\natmosphere. With H$_2$/He only, the flux and variability originate near the\n10$^5$~Pa level; with solar and higher metallicity, $\\sim$10$^3$~Pa level is\nprobed, and the variability is distinguishably reduced. Our calculations show\nthat JWST and Ariel have the sensitivity to capture the atmospheric variability\nof exoplanets like \\WASPP, depending on the metallicity -- both in repeated\neclipse and phase-curve observations.",

As multivalent batteries, Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs),\nwhile inherently low voltage, offer a promising low cost alternative to Li-ion\nbatteries due to viable use of zinc as the anode. However, to maximize the\npotential impact of ZIBs, rechargable cathodes with improved Zn diffusion are\nneeded. To better understand the chemical and structural factors influencing\nZn-ion mobility within battery electrode materials, we employ a high-throughput\ncomputational screening approach to systematically evaluate candidate\nintercalation hosts for ZIB cathodes, expanding the chemical search space on\nempty intercalation hosts that do not contain Zn. We leverage a high-throughput\nscreening funnel to identify promising cathodes in ZIBs, integrating screening\ncriteria with DFT-based calculations of Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation and diffusion\ninside the host materials. Using this data, we identify the design principles\nthat favor Zn-ion mobility in candidate cathode materials. Building on previous\nwork on divalent ion cathodes, this study broadens the chemical space for\nnext-generation multivalent energy storage systems.",

    "abstract": "Testing Android apps effectively requires a systematic exploration of the\napp's possible states by simulating user interactions and system events. While\nexisting approaches have proposed several fuzzing techniques to generate\nvarious text inputs and trigger user and system events for UI state\nexploration, achieving high code coverage remains a significant challenge in\nAndroid app testing. The main challenges are (1) reasoning about the complex\nand dynamic layout of UI screens; (2) generating required inputs/events to deal\nwith certain widgets like pop-ups; and (3) coordination between current test\ninputs and previous inputs to avoid getting stuck in the same UI screen without\nimproving test coverage. To address these problems, we propose a novel,\nautomated fuzzing approach called VLM-Fuzz for effective UI testing of Android\napps. We present a novel heuristic-based depth-first search (DFS) exploration\nalgorithm, assisted with a vision language model (VLM), to effectively explore\nthe UI states of the app. We use static analysis to analyze the Android\nManifest file and the runtime UI hierarchy XML to extract the list of\ncomponents, intent-filters and interactive UI widgets. VLM is used to reason\nabout complex UI layout and widgets on an on-demand basis. Based on the inputs\nfrom static analysis, VLM, and the current UI state, we use some heuristics to\ndeal with the above-mentioned challenges. We evaluated VLM-Fuzz based on a\nbenchmark containing 59 apps obtained from a recent work and compared it\nagainst two state-of-the-art approaches: APE and DeepGUI. VLM-Fuzz outperforms\nthe best baseline by 9.0%, 3.7%, and 2.1% in terms of class coverage, method\ncoverage, and line coverage, respectively. We also ran VLM-Fuzz on 80 recent\nGoogle Play apps (i.e., updated in 2024). VLM-Fuzz detected 208 unique crashes\nin 24 apps, which have been reported to respective developers.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of simulating human\nbehavior, offering cost-effective ways to estimate user responses to various\nsurveys and polls. However, the questions in these surveys usually reflect\nsocially understood attitudes: the patterns of attitudes of old/young,\nliberal/conservative, as understood by both members and non-members of those\ngroups. It is not clear whether the LLM binding is \\emph{deep}, meaning the LLM\nanswers as a member of a particular in-group would, or \\emph{shallow}, meaning\nthe LLM responds as an out-group member believes an in-group member would. To\nexplore this difference, we use questions that expose known in-group/out-group\nbiases. This level of fidelity is critical for applying LLMs to various\npolitical science studies, including timely topics on polarization dynamics,\ninter-group conflict, and democratic backsliding. To this end, we propose a\nnovel methodology for constructing virtual personas with synthetic user\n\"backstories\" generated as extended, multi-turn interview transcripts. This\napproach is justified by the theory of \\emph{narrative identity} which argues\nthat personality at the highest level is \\emph{constructed} from\nself-narratives. Our generated backstories are longer, rich in detail, and\nconsistent in authentically describing a singular individual, compared to\nprevious methods. We show that virtual personas conditioned on our backstories\nclosely replicate human response distributions (up to an 87% improvement as\nmeasured by Wasserstein Distance) and produce effect sizes that closely match\nthose observed in the original studies of in-group/out-group biases.\nAltogether, our work extends the applicability of LLMs beyond estimating\nsocially understood responses, enabling their use in a broader range of human\nstudies.",

Unlike the beam-induced Langmuir waves ($\\omega \\gtrsim\n\\omega_{pe}$) in the standard radio emission plasma model, the primary wave\nexcitations of cooler and/or denser beams have predominantly downshifted\nfrequencies. Broadbands of such downshifted excitations are also confirmed by\nin situ observations in association with terrestrial foreshock and electron\nbeams (in contrast to narrowband Langmuir waves), but their involvement in\nradiative processes has not been examined so far. We revisit three radiative\nscenarios specific to downshifted primary excitations, and the results\ndemonstrate their direct or indirect involvement in plasma radio emission.\nDownshifted excitations of an electron beam primarily play an indirect role,\ncontributing to the relaxation to a plateau-on-tail still able to induce\nLangmuir beam waves that satisfy conditions for nonlinear wave-wave\ninteractions leading to free radio waves. At longer time scales, the primary\nexcitations can become predominantly downshifted, and then directly couple with\nthe secondary (backscattered) Langmuir waves to generate the second harmonic of\nradio emissions. Two counterbeams are more efficient and lead to faster\nradiative mechanisms, involving counterpropagating downshifted excitations,\nwhich couple to each other and generate intense, broadband and isotropic radio\nspectra of downshifted second harmonics. Such a long-lasting (second) radio\nharmonic can thus be invoked to distinguish regimes with downshifted ($\\omega\n\\gtrsim \\omega_{pe}$) primary excitations.",
