We introduce the first\nautomated framework for labeling every neuron in a PLM with biologically\ngrounded natural language descriptions. Unlike prior approaches relying on\nsparse autoencoders or manual annotation, our method scales to hundreds of\nthousands of neurons, revealing individual neurons are selectively sensitive to\ndiverse biochemical and structural properties. We then develop a novel neuron\nactivation-guided steering method to generate proteins with desired traits,\nenabling convergence to target biochemical properties like molecular weight and\ninstability index as well as secondary and tertiary structural motifs,\nincluding alpha helices and canonical Zinc Fingers.

This\nleads to a 'safety gap': the difference in dangerous capabilities between a\nmodel with intact safeguards and one that has been stripped of those\nsafeguards. We open-source a toolkit to estimate the safety gap for\nstate-of-the-art open-weight models. As a case study, we evaluate biochemical\nand cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality of models from\ntwo families (Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5) across a range of parameter scales (0.5B to\n405B) using different safeguard removal techniques.

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that tidal disruption events (TDEs) with off-axis jets\nmay manifest as optically overluminous events. To search for jet signatures at\nlate times, we conducted radio observations of eight such optically\noverluminous ($M_{g, \\rm peak} < -20.8$ mag) TDEs with the Very Large Array. We\ndetect radio counterparts in four events. The observed radio luminosities\n($L_{\\rm 6 GHz} \\sim 10^{38}$--$10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$) are two orders of\nmagnitude lower than those of on-axis jetted TDEs, and we find no evidence for\noff-axis jets within rest-frame time of 3 yrs. Two of them (AT2022hvp and\nAT2021aeou) exhibit evolving radio emission, consistent with synchrotron\nemission from non-relativistic outflows launched near the time of first optical\nlight. Two events (AT2020ysg and AT2020qhs) show no statistically significant\nvariability, which can be attributed to either non-relativistic outflows or\npre-existing active galactic nuclei. Compared to a control sample of fainter\nTDEs with $M_{g, \\rm peak} > -20.5$ mag observed at similar rest-frame\ntimescales ($t_{\\rm rest} ~ 1.5$\\,yr), our sample shows systematically more\nluminous radio emission, suggesting that optically overluminous TDEs may launch\nmore powerful prompt non-relativistic outflows. We speculate that strong\ngeneral relativistic effects near high-mass black holes ($M_{\\rm BH} ~\n10^8\\,M_\\odot$) may play a key role. These findings motivate further\ninvestigation into the nature of relativistic disruptions around massive black\nholes and the physical conditions necessary for jet formation.",

Cellular immune responses are essential for assessing\nvaccine-induced immunogenicity, and single-cell assays, such as intracellular\ncytokine staining (ICS) are commonly employed to profile individual immune cell\nphenotypes and the cytokines they produce after stimulation. In this article,\nwe introduce a novel statistical framework for identifying vaccine responders\nusing ICS data collected before and after vaccination. This framework\nincorporates paired control data to account for potential unintended variations\nbetween assay runs, such as batch effects, that could lead to misclassification\nof participants as vaccine responders. To formally integrate paired control\ndata for accounting for assay variation across different time points (i.e.,\nbefore and after vaccination), our proposed framework calculates and reports\ntwo p-values, both adjusting for paired control data but in distinct ways: (i)\nthe maximally adjusted p-value, which applies the most conservative adjustment\nto the unadjusted p-value, ensuring validity over all plausible batch effects\nconsistent with the paired control samples' data, and (ii) the minimally\nadjusted p-value, which imposes only the minimal adjustment to the unadjusted\np-value, such that the adjusted p-value cannot be falsified by the paired\ncontrol samples' data. We apply this framework to analyze ICS data collected at\nbaseline and 4 weeks post-vaccination from the COVID-19 Prevention Network\n(CoVPN) 3008 study.

However, it rarely predicts how\na model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and\nchallenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution\n(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between\nattention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models\nindependently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit\nseveral distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse\npopulation for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple\nobservational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In\nparticular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the\nmodel is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the\nrule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according\nto ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further\ninterpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.",

Recent methods for CIR leverage large\npretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on\ngeneral-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle\nwith application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary\nused in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language\nunderstanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion\ndatasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of\nmanual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce\nFACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It\nleverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline\npowered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and\ndetailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,\nwhich fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight\nadapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for\nfine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and\nwithout additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced\nevaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain\nhigher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of\nFashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's\nperformance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained\nmodification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a\nhighly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites.

We use\nlow-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches\nfrom one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling\nrate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during\nperiods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the\nhand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in\neach RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part\nof the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate\nour method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30\nactivities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9\ncountries, totaling 3,670 hours of video).

Simulation results based on a\nreal-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DA-assisted resource\nmanagement scheme outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of user QoE.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing\nglobal responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal\nanalysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to\nevaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance\nstrategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as\nmanual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the\ncomplex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing\nrelevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,\nparticularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.\nIn this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded\ntopic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.\nA probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over\ntime. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the\npostponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals\nshifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to\nrecent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,\nfinance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,\nincluding preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word\ndistributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for\nanalyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the\nimplications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and\nrefinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.",

EEG is a cornerstone in sleep research, serving as the\nprimary modality of polysomnography, the gold standard in the field. However,\nEEG signals are prone to artifacts caused by both internal (device-specific)\nfactors and external (environmental) interferences. As sleep studies are\nbecoming larger, most rely on automatic sleep staging, a process highly\nsusceptible to artifacts, leading to erroneous sleep scores. This paper\naddresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package\nto utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect\nsegments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained\nand evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15\nparticipants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband.

The architecture\nof the critic (the estimator for the value function) is structured so that the\nboundary condition is always perfectly satisfied (rather than being included in\nthe training loss) and utilizes a biased gradient which reduces computational\ncost. The actor (the estimator for the optimal control) is trained by\nminimizing the integral of the Hamiltonian over the domain, where the\nHamiltonian is estimated using the critic. We show that the training dynamics\nof the actor and critic neural networks converge in a Sobolev-type space to a\ncertain infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number\nof hidden units in the actor and critic $\\rightarrow \\infty$. Further, under a\nconvexity-like assumption on the Hamiltonian, we prove that any fixed point of\nthis limit ODE is a solution of the original stochastic control problem. This\nprovides an important guarantee for the algorithm's performance in light of the\nfact that finite-width neural networks may only converge to a local minimizers\n(and not optimal solutions) due to the non-convexity of their loss functions.\nIn our numerical studies, we demonstrate that the algorithm can solve\nstochastic control problems accurately in up to 200 dimensions. In particular,\nwe construct a series of increasingly complex stochastic control problems with\nknown analytic solutions and study the algorithm's numerical performance on\nthem. These problems range from a linear-quadratic regulator equation to highly\nchallenging equations with non-convex Hamiltonians, allowing us to identify and\nanalyze the strengths and limitations of this neural actor-critic method for\nsolving HJB equations.",

It\naddresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and\nsampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of\nall classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS\ndatasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further\npropose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to\nassess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction.

We then introduce the general\nconcept of shape-regular local maps, corresponding to the situation where the\nlocal averaging is done on sets which, in some sense, have ``almost isotropic''\nshapes. On the one hand, we prove that, in general, shape-regularity is\nnecessary to achieve the minimax rates of convergence.

    "abstract": "The \"free trial\" followed by automatic renewal is a dominant business model\nin the digital economy. Standard models explain trials as a mechanism for\nconsumers to learn their valuation for a product. We propose a complementary\ntheory based on the rational inattention framework. Consumers know their\nvaluation but face a cognitive cost to remember to cancel an unwanted\nsubscription. We model this using a Shannon entropy-based cost of information\nprocessing, where a consumer's baseline attention level decays with the length\nof the trial period. This creates a novel trade-off for a monopolist firm: a\nlonger trial increases \"inattentive revenue\" from consumers who fail to cancel,\nbut it also lowers ex-ante consumer utility, making the initial offer less\nattractive. We show that this trade-off leads to an interior optimal trial\nlength, even for products where value-learning is instantaneous. Our model,\nunder standard assumptions about demand elasticity and the distribution of\nconsumer valuations, generates sharp, testable predictions about the\nrelationship between contract terms. We find that the optimal renewal price and\ntrial length are complements: firms offering longer trials will also set higher\npost-trial prices. We analyze the impact of policies aimed at curbing consumer\nexploitation, such as \"click-to-cancel\" regulations. We show that such\npolicies, by making attention effectively cheaper, lead firms to reduce trial\nlengths. The effect on price depends directly on the elasticity of demand from\nloyal subscribers. We also extend the model to include paid trials, showing\nthat introductory prices and trial lengths act as strategic substitutes. Our\nframework provides a micro-founded explanation for common features of\nsubscription contracts and offers a new lens through which to evaluate consumer\nprotection policies in digital markets.",

Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically\nrely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,\nlimiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is\nunavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution\nagnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided\ncontrolled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving\nreward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model\nitself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial\nexamples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward\nmodel's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference\ndatasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate\nthat it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.\nNotably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in\ndownstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing\nspurious correlations.",

Previous research shows that using\ntest-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can\neffectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning\nmethods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,\npreventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In\ngeneral, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and\nthe locations of relevant information in contexts.

Specifically, the\nProposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may\ncontain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories\nwithin those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the\ntemporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate\nthe performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three\nchallenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.\nWe also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each\nindividual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art\nTAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS\ndatasets, respectively.",

This study proposes an automated deep\nlearning system for robust binary classification of breast density (low: A/B\nvs. high: C/D) using the VinDr-Mammo dataset. We implemented and compared four\nadvanced convolutional neural networks: ResNet18, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0,\nand DenseNet121, each enhanced with channel attention mechanisms. To address\nthe inherent class imbalance, we developed a novel Combined Focal Label\nSmoothing Loss function that integrates focal loss, label smoothing, and\nclass-balanced weighting. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporated advanced\ntechniques, including contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)\nand comprehensive data augmentation. The individual models were combined\nthrough an optimized ensemble voting approach, achieving superior performance\n(AUC: 0.963, F1-score: 0.952) compared to any single model.

We find strong and consistent\nprioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,\nacross most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping\nfactors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical\ndiscourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between\npolitical \"bias\" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against\nconflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals\nthat fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through\nboth self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this \"liberal tilt\" is\nnot a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an\nemergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,\nwe propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance\nphilosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal\nidentity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this\npattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.",

In this paper, we\npresent star formation scaling relations for galaxies at different evolutionary\nstages. To do so, we used the integrated Extragalactic Database for Galaxy\nEvolution (iEDGE), which collects CO, optical continuum, and emission line\ninformation for 643 galaxies from the CALIFA IFU dataset. By considering the\npatterns described by star-forming and retired regions, we grouped the galaxies\ninto quenching stages using the emission line classification scheme, QueStNA.\nWe observed that the molecular gas mass ($M_{\\rm mol}$) decreases from\nstar-forming to retired systems and so does the molecular-to-stellar mass ratio\n($f_{\\rm mol}$). In contrast, star formation efficiency (SFE) is constant in\nthe quenching stages dominated by star formation and rapidly declines\nafterwards. We observed that this rapid decline is more pronounced in the\ncentre of the galaxies compared to the rest of the discs, reflecting the\ninside-out quenching displayed by nearby galaxies. We noticed that the\nrelations between $M_{\\rm mol}$ and the stellar mass ($M_*$) become\nincreasingly shallow with the quenching stages; however, the relations between\nthe star formation rate (SFR) and $M_{\\rm mol}$ steepen when going from\nstar-forming to retired systems. We observed that a three-dimensional relation\nbetween SFR, $M_*$, and $M_{\\rm mol}$ exists for star-forming galaxies, while\ndata points from other quenching groups are scattered across the parameter\nspace. Taken together, these pieces of evidence indicate that the quenching of\nthe galaxies cannot be explained solely by a depletion of the molecular gas and\nthat a significant decrease in the SFE is necessary to retire the centre of the\ngalaxies beyond the star formation green valley.",

In this paper, we present the mapping\nof an underwater cave segment (the catacombs) of the Devil's Eye cave system at\nGinnie Springs, FL. We utilized a set of inexpensive action cameras in\nconjunction with a dive computer to estimate the trajectories of the cameras\ntogether with a sparse point cloud.

In\naddition, the keyframes generated by SVIn2 together with the estimated camera\nposes for select areas are used as input to a global optimization (bundle\nadjustment) framework -- COLMAP -- in order to produce a dense reconstruction\nof those areas. The same cave segment is manually surveyed using the MNemo V2\ninstrument, providing an additional set of measurements validating the proposed\napproach. It is worth noting that with the use of action cameras, the primary\ncomponents of a cave map can be constructed.

    "abstract": "As most massive stars are born in binary and other multiple-star systems,\nmany are expected to exchange mass with a companion star or merge with it\nduring their lives. This means that most supernovae (SNe) are from such binary\nproducts. Here, we focus on hydrogen-rich Type II SNe from accretors of binary\nmass transfer and stellar mergers. We compute various SN properties such as the\nexplosion energies, nickel yields, and neutron star (NS) kick velocities, but\nalso consider NS masses. We find tight correlations between these parameters\nand, e.g., the central specific entropy and core compactness. However, there is\nno obvious relation between these explosion properties and the evolutionary\nhistory of the pre-SN stars. We find linear relations between the nickel mass\nand the SN explosion energy and the NS remnant mass. We further group our\nmodels into progenitors of SNe IIP, SN 1987A-like and interacting SNe, predict\ntheir SN and SN-progenitor properties and compare to observations. Accretors of\nbinary mass transfer and stellar mergers naturally produce SNe IIP with long\nplateau durations from progenitors with relatively small CO-cores but large\nenvelope masses (c.f. SN 2015ba). Our models give rise to tight relations\nbetween the plateau luminosity and the nickel mass as well as the SN ejecta\nvelocity as inferred observationally for SNe IIP. We speculate that cool/red\nsupergiants at $\\log\\,L/L_\\odot\\,{\\geq}\\,5.5$ encounter enhanced mass loss due\nto envelope instabilities and could then explode in interacting SNe IIn. The\nrate of such SNe from our models seems compatible with observations. Some of\nour binary models explode as $10^6\\,L_\\odot$ blue supergiants that may have\nencountered enhanced and/or eruptive mass loss shortly before their SNe and\ncould thus help understand interacting SNe such as SN 1961V and SN 2005gl but\nalso superluminous Type II SNe such as SN 2010jl.

Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a\nblock of layers of the network from the device to a server. However, in doing\nso, it introduces large communication overheads due to frequent exchanges of\nintermediate activations and gradients between devices and the server and\nreduces model accuracy for non-IID data. We propose Ampere, a novel\ncollaborative training system that simultaneously minimizes on-device\ncomputation and device-server communication while improving model accuracy.\nUnlike SFL, which uses a global loss by iterative end-to-end training, Ampere\ndevelops unidirectional inter-block training to sequentially train the device\nand server block with a local loss, eliminating the transfer of gradients. A\nlightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the\ndevice and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single\ntransfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere\nmitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations\ngenerated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to\nSFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple CNNs and transformers show that, compared to\nstate-of-the-art SFL baseline systems, Ampere (i) improves model accuracy by up\nto 13.26% while reducing training time by up to 94.6%, (ii) reduces\ndevice-server communication overhead by up to 99.1% and on-device computation\nby up to 93.13%, and (iii) reduces standard deviation of accuracy by 53.39% for\nvarious non-IID degrees highlighting superior performance when faced with\nheterogeneous data.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) could mitigate data scarcity\nchallenges affecting machine learning development for medical image\ninterpretation. The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection\nperformance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the\naxial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional\ndomain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We\npropose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility.\nMethods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI\n(bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB)\nand apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was\ninvestigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data\nfrom an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively\nsmaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results:\nCCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063\nrespectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060). Classifier pretraining with\nCCELLA++ bpMRI outperformed real bpMRI in AP and AUC for all domain adaptation\nscenarios. CCELLA++ pretraining achieved highest classifier performance below\n50% (n=665) external dataset volume. Conclusion: Synthetic bpMRI generated by\nour method can improve downstream classifier generalization and performance\nbeyond real bpMRI or CCELLA-generated AxT2-only images. Future work should seek\nto quantify medical image sample quality, balance multi-sequence LDM training,\nand condition the LDM with additional information. Significance: The proposed\nCCELLA++ LDM can generate synthetic bpMRI that outperforms real data for domain\nadaptation with a limited target institution dataset.

The dynamics\nthat are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and\nemergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable\ngeneralization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of\nthese representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial\nsystems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to\nrigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations,\nespecially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow,\nwhich describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into\na product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a\nLinearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in\nfeed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal\ncontrol theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we\nshow how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under\nGD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,\nover and above the nature of the underlying task. Second, for multi-task\ntraining, we show that the operators can be used to measure how objectives\nrelevant to individual sub-tasks align. We experimentally and theoretically\nvalidate these findings, providing an efficient Pytorch package, \\emph{KPFlow},\nimplementing robust analysis tools for general recurrent architectures. Taken\ntogether, our work moves towards building a next stage of understanding of GD\nlearning in non-linear recurrent models.",

This would be a non-proliferation regime\nfor advanced chips, building on the chip export controls - states that do not\nhave an IAIA-certified frontier regulation regime would not be allowed to\nimport advanced chips.

But the identification of groups,\nespecially nearby ones, suffers from projection effects which in turn affect\nthe purity of the sample. In X-rays, the position of the cluster can be given\neither by the peak of the emission, or by the full information content of the\ncluster image. Similarly, the optical center, or its member galaxies, can\ndescribe the optical counterpart. With the progress of numerical simulations,\nit is currently feasible to reproduce both the optical group membership\nassignment and the behavior of the group outskirts in X-rays, and therefore\nthere is an opportunity to define a reproducible group identification\nprocedure. We performed two-way matching between X-ray contours, drawn at a\nfixed surface brightness level corresponding to a baryonic overdensity of ~500,\nto the projected galaxy positions using a modified Hausdorff distance (MHD). We\nused the volume-limited SDSS group catalog to evaluate the purity and\ncompleteness of the procedure, maintaining the constant performance of the\noptical group finder with redshift. We find that an MHD of 0.631 Mpc provides\n90% purity. This is a clear improvement over the methods that rely on the\noptical counterparts' distance and richness. We study the purity versus MHD and\nthe completeness versus redshift and velocity dispersion. Over half of nearby\ngroups have X-ray emission, even those with velocity dispersions as low as\n200km/s; this has never previously been demonstrated. The bulk of these groups\nfollow the same scaling relations as the groups with a small separation between\nthe optical and X-ray centers, removing feedback as an explanation for the lack\nof matches in previous studies.

We used the database to study the\nfundamental star formation relationships between star formation rate (SFR),\nstellar mass ($M_*$), and molecular gas mass ($M_{\\rm mol}$) across galaxies\nwith different morphologies. We observed that the diagrams defined by these\nquantities are bi-modal, with early-type passive objects well separated from\nspiral star-forming galaxies. Additionally, while the molecular gas fraction\n($f_{\\rm mol}=M_{\\rm mol}/M_*$) decreases homogeneously across these two types\nof galaxies, the star formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/$M_{\\rm mol}$) in the inner\nregions of passive galaxies is almost two orders of magnitude lower compared to\nthe global values.

The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature\napproaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical\norder parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the\nextended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical\nMonte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a\nspecific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours\na ground state with finite magnetization near the N\\'eel temperature. This\nanalysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant\nantiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the\nnew magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of\nthe magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using\nterahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced\norder parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden\nquantum states.",

Unfortunately, progress has been hindered by the lack\nof large-scale and high-quality binding affinity labels. The widely used\nPDBbind dataset has fewer than 20K labeled complexes. Self-supervised learning,\nespecially graph contrastive learning (GCL), provides a unique opportunity to\nbreak the barrier by pre-training graph neural network models based on vast\nunlabeled complexes and fine-tuning the models on much fewer labeled complexes.\nHowever, the problem faces unique challenges, including a lack of a\ncomprehensive unlabeled dataset with well-defined positive/negative complex\npairs and the need to design GCL algorithms that incorporate the unique\ncharacteristics of such data. To fill the gap, we propose DecoyDB, a\nlarge-scale, structure-aware dataset specifically designed for self-supervised\nGCL on protein-ligand complexes. DecoyDB consists of high-resolution ground\ntruth complexes (less than 2.5 Angstrom) and diverse decoy structures with\ncomputationally generated binding poses that range from realistic to suboptimal\n(negative pairs). Each decoy is annotated with a Root Mean Squared Deviation\n(RMSD) from the native pose.

    "abstract": "The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves\nmonolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks\nflexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model\ndevelopment, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input\nembeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed\nrepresentational substrate acts as a universal \"docking port,\" enabling two\npowerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and\nprogressive layer-wise growth.\n  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,\nRussian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural\nmodification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training\nmethodology, where a deep Transformer is \"grown\" by progressively stacking and\ntraining one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a\nclear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning\nabilities, such as those required for SQuAD.\n  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a\nmore biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is\nbuilt incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues\nfor resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized\necosystem for building powerful AI systems.

The novel enabling idea is an inductive formulation of equivalence\npreservation that supports the addition of new rules to the source language,\ntarget language, and compiler.\n  Pyrosome defines a formal, deeply embedded notion of programming languages\nwith semantics given by dependently sorted equational theories, so all\ncompiler-correctness proofs boil down to type-checking and equational\nreasoning.

In the\npresent work, the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayer from the family, with the very\nappropriate electron mobility, is thermally investigated using the\nnon-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation of the phonon Boltzmann transport\nequation. The reliability of the MOSFET with the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ channel has been\nreassessed and determined to be low due to the high maximum temperature\nachieved. The phonon analysis is performed and reveals that the dominant\ncontribution of fast and energetic LA and also slow and low energy ZA phonons\nalongside the minor participation of the TA phonons is responsible for the peak\ntemperature rise reaching 800 K. This finding presents that the ThSi$_2$N$_4$\nmonolayer is not a good candidate for replacing as silicon channel but\nalternatively is capable of generating a significant temperature gradient,\nwhich makes it, a suitable candidate for using as a thermoelectric material in\nthermoelectric generators.",

The Eager Test smell, one of the most\nprevalent, is often identified using simplified detection rules that\npractitioners find inadequate. Objective: We aim to improve the rules for\ndetecting the Eager Test smell. Method: We reviewed the literature on test\nsmells to analyze the definitions and detection rules of the Eager Test smell.\nWe proposed a novel, unambiguous definition of the test smell and a heuristic\nto address the limitations of the existing rules. We evaluated our heuristic\nagainst existing detection rules by manually applying it to 300 unit test cases\nin Java. Results: Our review identified 56 relevant studies. We found that\ninadequate interpretations of original definitions of the Eager Test smell led\nto imprecise detection rules, resulting in a high level of disagreement in\ndetection outcomes. Also, our heuristic detected patterns of eager and\nnon-eager tests that existing rules missed. Conclusion: Our heuristic captures\nthe essence of the Eager Test smell more precisely; hence, it may address\npractitioners' concerns regarding the adequacy of existing detection rules.",

For example, the Disk Access Machine\n(DAM) model assumes that a storage device transfers data in fixed-size blocks\nof size B and that all transfers have unit latency. This abstraction is already\nsufficient to explain some of the benefits of data structures such as B-trees\nand Log-Structured Merge trees (LSM trees); however, storage technology\nadvances have significantly reduced current models' accuracy and utility.\n  This paper introduces the Multi-Queue Solid State Drive (MQSSD) model, a new\nstorage abstraction.

We identify key performance-critical aspects of modern multi-queue\nsolid-state drives on which we base our model and demonstrate these\ncharacteristics on actual hardware.

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning\nsystems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote\nand non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR\nsystems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral\ninformation across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nConsequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the\nbiochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, and the diagnosis of\nbreast cancer through imaging remains challenging. Mammography images are\ncharacterized by extremely high resolution, while lesions often occupy only a\nsmall portion of the image. Down-sampling in neural networks can easily lead to\nthe loss of microcalcifications or subtle structures. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a Context Clustering based triple information fusion\nframework. First, in comparison to CNNs or transformers, we observe that\nContext clustering methods are (1) more computationally efficient and (2)\nbetter at associating structural or pathological features. This makes them\nparticularly well-suited for mammography in clinical settings. Next, we propose\na triple information fusion mechanism that integrates global, feature-based\nlocal, and patch-based local information. The proposed approach is rigorously\nevaluated on two public datasets, Vindr-Mammo and CBIS-DDSM, using five\nindependent data splits to ensure statistical robustness. Our method achieves\nan AUC of 0.828 \\pm 0.020 on Vindr-Mammo and 0.805 \\pm 0.020 on CBIS-DDSM,\noutperforming the second best method by 3.5% and 2.5%, respectively. These\nimprovements are statistically significant (p<0.05), highlighting the\nadvantages of the Context Clustering Network with triple information fusion.\nOverall, our Context Clustering framework demonstrates strong potential as a\nscalable and cost-effective solution for large-scale mammography screening,\nenabling more efficient and accurate breast cancer detection.

    "abstract": "Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising candidates for near-term\nquantum computing, yet they face scalability challenges due to barren plateaus,\nwhere gradients vanish exponentially in the system size. Recent conjectures\nsuggest that avoiding barren plateaus might inherently lead to classical\nsimulability, thus limiting the opportunities for quantum advantage. In this\nwork, we advance the theoretical understanding of the relationship between the\ntrainability and computational complexity of VQAs, thus directly addressing the\nconjecture. We introduce the Linear Clifford Encoder (LCE), a novel technique\nthat ensures constant-scaling gradient statistics on optimization landscape\nregions that are close to Clifford circuits. Additionally, we leverage\nclassical Taylor surrogates to reveal computational complexity phase\ntransitions from polynomial to super-polynomial as the initialization region\nsize increases. Combining these results, we reveal a deeper link between\ntrainability and computational complexity, and analytically prove that barren\nplateaus can be avoided in regions for which no classical surrogate is known to\nexist. Furthermore, numerical experiments on LCE transformed landscapes confirm\nin practice the existence of a super-polynomially complex ``transition zone''\nwhere gradients decay polynomially. These findings indicate a plausible path to\npractically relevant, barren plateau-free variational models with potential for\nquantum advantage.",

While research has\nidentified several quality attributes of test cases and test suites, there is a\nneed for a better understanding of their relative importance in practice.\nObjective: We investigate practitioners' perceptions regarding the relative\nimportance of quality attributes of test cases and test suites and the\nchallenges they face in ensuring the perceived important quality attributes.\nMethod: We conducted an industrial survey using a questionnaire based on the\nquality attributes identified in an extensive literature review. We used a\nsampling strategy that leverages LinkedIn to draw a large and heterogeneous\nsample of professionals with experience in software testing. Results: We\ncollected 354 responses from practitioners with a wide range of experience. We\nfound that the majority of practitioners rated Fault Detection, Usability,\nMaintainability, Reliability, and Coverage to be the most important quality\nattributes. Resource Efficiency, Reusability, and Simplicity received the most\ndivergent opinions, which, according to our analysis, depend on the\nsoftware-testing contexts. We identified common challenges that apply to the\nimportant attributes, namely inadequate definition, lack of useful metrics,\nlack of an established review process, and lack of external support.\nConclusion: The findings point out where practitioners actually need further\nsupport with respect to achieving high-quality test cases and test suites under\ndifferent software testing contexts. The findings can serve as a guideline for\nacademic researchers when looking for research directions on the topic. The\nfindings can also be used to encourage companies to provide more support to\npractitioners to achieve high-quality test cases and test suites.",

For each case,\nwe jointly infer the Hubble constant $H_0$ and model-specific DE parameters\nfrom the observed GW luminosity distances and spectroscopic redshifts.

We demonstrate an integrated open-source workflow\nfor simulation of TPVR in image-derived models to inform device selection.\n  Methods - Machine learning-based segmentation of CT scans was implemented to\ndefine the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A custom workflow for device\npositioning and pre-compression was implemented in SlicerHeart. Resulting\ngeometries were exported to FEBio for simulation. Visualization of results and\nquantification were performed using custom metrics implemented in SlicerHeart\nand FEBio.\n  Results - RVOT model creation and device placement could be completed in\nunder 1 minute. Virtual device placement using FE simulations visually mimicked\nactual device placement and allowed quantification of vessel strain, stress,\nand contact area. Regions of higher strain and stress were observed at the\nproximal and distal end locations of the TPVs where the devices impinge the\nRVOT wall.

Recent advances in hydrodynamic modeling and digital\ntwins afford new opportunities for high-resolution flood modeling and\nvisualization at the street and basement levels. Focusing on Galveston City, a\nbarrier island in Texas, U.S., this study created a geospatial digital twin\n(GDT) supported by 1D-2D coupled hydrodynamic models to strengthen urban\nresilience to pluvial and fluvial flooding. The objectives include: (1)\ndeveloping a GDT (FlowsDT-Galveston) incorporating topography, hydrography, and\ninfrastructure; (2) validating the twin using historical flood events and\nsocial sensing; (3) modeling hyperlocal flood conditions under 2-, 10-, 25-,\n50-, and 100-year return period rainfall scenarios; and (4) identifying at-risk\nzones under different scenarios. This study employs the PCSWMM to create\ndynamic virtual replicas of urban landscapes and accurate flood modeling. By\nintegrating LiDAR data, land cover, and storm sewer geometries, the model can\nsimulate flood depth, extent, duration, and velocity in a 4-D environment\nacross different historical and design storms. Results show buildings inundated\nover one foot increased by 5.7% from 2- to 100-year flood. Road inundations\nabove 1 foot increased by 6.7% from 2- to 100-year floods. The proposed model\ncan support proactive flood management and urban planning in Galveston; and\ninform disaster resilience efforts and guide sustainable infrastructure\ndevelopment. The framework can be extended to other communities facing similar\nchallenges.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an energetic derivation of a class of multi-species\nreaction-diffusion systems incorporating various functional responses, with a\nfocus on and application to ecological models. Starting point is a closed\nreaction network for which we apply the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA)\nto derive the corresponding reaction-diffusion system. This framework captures\nboth diffusion and nonlinear reaction kinetics, and recovers\nLotka-Volterra-type dynamics with species-dependent interactions. Moreover, we\nfind an open subsystem embedded into the larger closed system, that contains\nthe physical and ecological important quantities. By analyzing different\nasymptotic regimes in the reaction parameters of the resulting system, we\nformally derive classical Holling type I, II, and III functional responses. To\nrigorously justify these reductions and their dynamical properties, we apply\nthe generalized geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT) for PDEs and\nprove the existence of an attracting and invariant slow manifolds near the\ncritical manifold of the reduced system. Our analysis not only bridges\nthermodynamic consistency with ecological modeling but also provides a robust\nframework to study the dynamics of slow manifolds in multi-scale\nreaction-diffusion systems.",

This work employs Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF) molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the underlying mechanism of how\nethanol and methanol additives affect reaction pathways, NOx emissions and bond\nenergy characteristics in ammonia-methane pyrolysis and combustion processes.\nIt shows that adding alcohols altered NOx formation pathways, reducing the\ndiversity of NOx and shifting the equilibrium toward simpler NOx such as NO and\nNO2. At 2,000 K, alcohol blends, particularly methanol, demonstrated a notable\nreduction in NO2 formation. At 3,000 K, both ethanol and methanol suppressed NO\nproduction, but the influence of methanol was stronger. Nitric acid production,\nHNO3, was present at lower temperatures but became negligible at higher\ntemperatures because of the thermal breakdown of the higher-order NOx. These\ntrends confirm that alcohol additives realize a probable role in moderating NOx\nemissions and stabilizing reaction pathways. The pyrolysis in modified reaction\npathways, which facilitated the decomposition of ammonia and methane in these\nblends, affected the formation of intermediate species, leading to the\nreduction in peak emissions. In addition, methanol and ethanol showed\nsignificant impacts on hydrogen bond energies of the mixture, especially\nimportant building block radicals encouraging higher complexity pathways. By\nleveraging a computationally robust and scalable methodology, this study not\nonly advances a fundamental understanding of alcohol-enhanced ammonia/methane\ncombustion but also informs strategies to optimize these mixtures for practical\nuse in modern propulsion systems.",

We focus mainly on\nthe system GS3073. This system shows an exceptionally large\nlog(N/O)=+0.42(+0.13/-0.10) in the gas close to the AGN. We show here that this\nabundance is consistent with the composition of gas ejected from massive\nasymptotic giant branch stars. Moreover, this system shows chemical properties\nmatching those expected at a specific point of the evolution of the abundances\nin the extreme populations of the former nuclear star cluster wCentauri (wCen).\nThis analogy, along with the N/O, C/O and Fe/O abundances in GS3073, lead to an\nestimate of an age range of 270-440 Myr for this object, much smaller than the\nredshift (z=5.5) age of about 1 Gyr. We also adopt the same criteria to\nestimate an age for GNz11. These two determinations constrain the BH mass\nversus age relation: accretion on the BH must proceed at intermittent\nsuperEddington rates in the first phases, and at a much lower rate after the\nfirst half gigayear of life of the Universe. The intermittency of accretion is\nalso a fundamental requirement to allow the formation of the extreme (N rich, O\ndepleted, He rich) populations today observed in wCen for a large range of\nmetallicities.",

Such abilities can enhance the realism of\nmodels. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the\nepistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards,\nare too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be\nconsistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically\ndemanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that\nconverts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core\ndilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and\nabstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding\nundermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like\ninstructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the\ntension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the\nchallenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become\nobscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents\ntowards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social\nmechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour.\nThis exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure,\nrather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the\nconditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence\nis not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions\nunfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than\nlong-term behavioural evolution.

Next, we measure human reliance rates across languages,\nfinding that reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example,\nparticipants are significantly more likely to discount expressions of\nuncertainty in Japanese than in English (i.e., ignore their 'hedging' function\nand rely on generations that contain them).

For $\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\gamma\\gamma$, on the other\nhand, the tree-level positivity bound is still robust at the one-loop level in\nthe UV theory. These findings are verified in two example UV models with a\nheavy scalar extension. Importantly, the bounds on the $\\beta$-functions that\nwe obtain should be considered as an accidental feature at one loop, rather\nthan a fundamental property of the theory.",

The\nspatial resolution of 68 parsecs in the best-resolved regions in the\nadaptive-mesh-refinement approach is powerful to study the detailed kinematic\nstructure of galaxies. The time interval between snapshots is also\nexceptionally short-15 Myr-which is ideal for monitoring changes in the\nphysical properties of galaxies, particularly during their orbital motion\nwithin a larger halo.

We implement a data-driven Reversible\nJump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the\nlevel of flexibility required under different scenarios.

However, global assessments can obscure\nlocal trends. To explore this possibility, we used a self-organizing map (SOM)\nto cluster SDSS galaxies based on their $ugriz$ colors. Deep learning methods\nachieve lower photo-$z$ scatter than classical ML methods for all SOM cells.\nThe fractional reduction in scatter is roughly constant across most of color\nspace with the exception of the most bulge-dominated and reddest cells where it\nis smaller in magnitude. Interestingly, classical ML photo-$z$'s suffer from a\nsignificant color-dependent attenuation bias, where photo-$z$'s for galaxies\nwithin a SOM cell are systematically biased towards the cell's mean\nspectroscopic redshift and away from extreme values, which is not readily\napparent when all objects are considered. In contrast, deep learning\nphoto-$z$'s suffer from very little color-dependent attenuation bias. The\nincreased attenuation bias for classical ML photo-$z$ methods is the primary\nreason why they exhibit larger scatter than deep learning methods.

Dust\npolarization is an effective tool for probing the morphology of the field, yet\nit does not directly trace its strength. Several methods have been developed,\ncombining polarization and spectroscopic data, to estimate the strength of the\nmagnetic field, including the DCF method, which relates these quantities to the\nmagnetic-field strength under the assumption of Alfv\\'enic turbulence. Skalidis\n& Tassis (2021) (ST), relaxed this assumption to account for the compressible\nmodes, deriving more accurate estimates of the field strength. We evaluate the\naccuracy of these methods in star-forming regions and propose a systematic\napproach for calculating the key observational parameters involved: the\nvelocity dispersion (dv), the dispersion of polarization angles (d\\theta), and\nthe cloud density (rho). We use a 3D MHD chemodynamical simulation of a\nturbulent molecular cloud and generate synthetic observations, for seven\ndifferent inclination angles. We employ various approaches for estimating the\nparameters dv, d\\theta, and rho and find that the approach used to calculate\nthese parameters plays a crucial role in estimating the magnetic field\nstrength. We show that the value probed by both the DCF and ST methods\ncorresponds to the median of the molecular-species-weighted POS component of\nthe magnetic field. The ST outperforms DCF, accurately following the expected\ncosine trend with respect to the inclination angle, and remains within 1\\sigma\nfrom the true strength of the field. Based on our analysis, we proposed that,\nin self-gravitating clouds, the intrinsic parameters (rho, dv, d\\theta) should\nbe calculated as follows: rho using radiative transfer analysis, dv using the\nsecond moment maps, and d\\theta by fitting Gaussians to the polarization angle\ndistributions to remove the contribution of the hourglass morphology.",

How can disks shine brightly\nfor so long, when grain growth and subsequent radial drift should have quickly\ndepleted their solid reservoir? Here, we suggest that the \"bouncing barrier\"\nprovides the answer. Even colliding at very low speeds (below 1cm/s), grains\nalready fail to stick to each other but instead bounce off in-elastically. This\nbarrier stalls grain growth at a near-universal size of $\\sim 100 \\mu m$. These\nsmall grains experience much reduced radial drift, and so are able to keep the\ndisks bright for millions of years. They are also tightly coupled to gas,\noffering poor prospects for processes like streaming instability or pebble\naccretion.

Our approach builds on the ML-based OmniFold\nalgorithm, which we extend to account for background, detector acceptance,\nefficiency, and uncertainties, enabling its application in high-luminosity and\nheavy-ion collision settings. We derive this algorithm and demonstrate its\nmathematical and numerical equivalence to expectation-maximization and\nIterative Bayesian Unfolding (IBU). We illustrate our method with a realistic\njet substructure analysis incorporating both large background and detector\nsimulation. Our analysis includes up to 18 observables, leading to\nsignificantly improved performance in the unfolding. We propose a method that\nintegrates calibration and unfolding into a single, consistent framework, and\ndemonstrate enhanced performance relative to traditional methods. These\ndevelopments lay the groundwork for robust, high-dimensional, ML-based\nunfolding and calibration in complex collider environments across a wide range\nof analyses.",

Their number density is still relatively uncertain, due to cosmic\nvariance effects, and the limited survey area with deep imaging. Here, we\ncombine pure parallel imaging from the PANORAMIC survey with data from legacy\nfields to constrain the bright end (M$_{\\rm UV}<-18.5$) of the UV luminosity\nfunction (UVLF) over $0.28\\,$deg$^2$ of NIRCam imaging in 6 or more filters,\nand along 35 independent lines of sight. Using conservative color selections,\nwe compile robust dropout samples at $z\\sim10$, $z\\sim13$, and $z\\sim17$, and\nidentify 16 new candidates from PANORAMIC. Our inferred UVLFs at $z\\sim10$ are\nconsistent with literature results and we confirm the high abundance of\ngalaxies at the bright end (M$_{\\rm UV}\\lesssim-21$) with better number\nstatistics. We find somewhat lower number densities at $z\\sim13$ compared to\nprevious studies, and no robust candidates at $z\\sim17$, indicating a rapid\nevolution of the galaxy population from $z\\sim10-17$. The improved upper limits\nat $z\\sim17$ imply that the cosmic UV luminosity density drops by at least a\nfactor $\\sim50$ from $z\\sim10$ to $z\\sim17$. Comparing our results to models\nproposed to explain the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$, we\nconclude that a modest increase in the star formation efficiency, or in the\nburstiness of star formation, a more top-heavy initial mass function, a lack of\ndust attenuation, or a combination of these effects at $z\\gtrsim10$, is\nsufficient to match our observational constraints.",

Current approaches predominantly utilize a\nthree-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction,\nand pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in\nmanaging complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal\nalignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates\ntarget localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling\namplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model\ngeneralizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose\nRSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow\ninto a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine\nsegmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with\nSAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model\ncollaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to\nactivate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate\nlocalization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in\nmulti-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order\nprompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via\ndecomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These\noptimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level\nrefined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive\nexperiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2\nsurpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex\nsemantic interpretation.

The\nnumerical evaluation of such depth functions can be computationally\nprohibitive, even for relatively low dimensions. We present a novel\nsequentially implemented Monte Carlo methodology for the computation of,\ntheoretical and empirical, depth functions and related quantities (seMCD), that\noutputs an interval, a so-called seMCD-bucket, to which the quantity of\ninterest belongs with a high probability prespecified by the user. For specific\nclasses of depth functions, we adapt algorithms from sequential testing,\nproviding finite-sample guarantees. For depth functions dependent on unknown\ndistributions, we offer asymptotic guarantees using non-parametric statistical\nmethods. In contrast to plain-vanilla Monte Carlo methodology the number of\nsamples required in the algorithm is random but typically much smaller than\nstandard choices suggested in the literature. The seMCD method can be applied\nto various depth functions, covering multivariate and functional spaces. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency and reliability of our approach through empirical\nstudies, highlighting its applicability in outlier or anomaly detection,\nclassification, and depth region computation. In conclusion, the\nseMCD-algorithm can achieve accurate depth approximations with few Monte Carlo\nsamples while maintaining rigorous statistical guarantees.",

Our first main result shows that, for every connected\nLSB $(G,\\cdot,\\circ)$, linearity (in the simply-connected case) and solvability\ncarry over from $(G,\\cdot)$ to $(G,\\circ)$, whereas the converse direction is\nrigid: if $(G,\\circ)$ is nilpotent (respectively, semisimple) then $(G,\\cdot)$\nis forced to be solvable (respectively, isomorphic to $(G,\\circ)$). Our second\nresults provides two ``flexibility'' statements: every non-linear simply\nconnected Lie group \\((G, \\cdot )\\) admits an LSB \\((G,\\cdot,\\circ)\\) such that\n\\((G,\\circ)\\) is linear, and every simply connected solvable Lie group \\((G,\n\\circ )\\) supports a LSB \\((G,\\cdot,\\circ)\\) such that \\((G,\\cdot)\\) is\nnilpotent.

However, such diagrams are\nrarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.\nTo overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal\nabstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.\nIn this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of\ncausal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such\ncollections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under\nthis setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a\nstructured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view\nenables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels\nof causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the\nliterature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal\nknowledge is unavailable.",

This makes it difficult to distinguish between\nsimilar-looking concepts with potentially different cultural meanings. Such\ndeficiencies are mainly due to a limited amount of high-quality cultural data,\ncontextual information, and the lack of negative examples that highlight subtle\ndifferences. To mitigate this, we design a data curation pipeline leveraging\nopen-sourced VLMs and text-to-image models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic\ncultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image\ntriplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but are culturally\ndifferent. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to develop CultureCLIP, which\naligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic\nimages through tailored contrastive learning. Experiments on culture-specific\nbenchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a\nnotable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks\nwhile preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the\neffectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in\ncapturing subtle cultural distinctions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from\nlexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling.\nWhile network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying\nsemantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains\nchallenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on\nlexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation\njump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological\nDifferentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts\nby analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is\napplied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD\nscores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature\n(cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak\ncorrelations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across\n~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50% of the entries\nin the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely independent,\ndefinition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine similarity\nbecomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed from the\ndataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths generated\nby vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP) across\nnetworks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower cumulative\nOD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces trajectories more\ncoherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as measured by OD.\nOntological Differentiation thus provides a novel, definition-grounded tool for\nanalyzing semantic structure and validating navigation processes in lexical\nnetworks.",

Latent reasoning tackles this\nbottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's\ncontinuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent\nreasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the\nemerging field of latent reasoning.

The findings suggest that designers should include explicit\nanatomical feedback that directly maps onto physical movement for phonetically\nuntrained learners.

The cosmic magnification\nangular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect,\nprovides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of\nquintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power\nspectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information\nabout the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to\ndisentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known\nquintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum\nwhile taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be\ndifficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the\ncosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large\nscales, at redshifts $z \\,{\\leq}\\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections\nare incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the\npotential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \\,{\\geq}\\,\n3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable\napproximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found\nthat both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals,\nrespectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \\,{\\leq}\\, 0.5$: hence the effect\nmay be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the\ntime-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic\nvariance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \\,{=}\\, 4.5$, with the\ngravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.",

The\nelectron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process\nunderlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$\nand X$^-$/X half reactions.

The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall\ncharge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity\nand the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron\ntransfer for each ion in contact with the electrode.

To address\nthis issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)\neliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while\nproviding the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to\nconstrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of\nqueries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and\nexecution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift\nand Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost\ndistributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber\nintroduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate\ncustomized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a\nself-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based\non query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different\npredicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost\ndistribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty\nlevels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from\nSnowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show\nthat SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.\nIt reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and\nsignificantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared\nwith existing methods.",

We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain\nthis phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points\nsuffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised\nfinetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled\nexperiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data\ngenerated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even\nsmaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard\n11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the\nperformance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base\nmodel while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta\nlearning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art\npost-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic\nregression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides\nuseful signal for improving a stronger student.

    "abstract": "In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were\nfound to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate\nAI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as \"GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY\"\nwere concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses\nvaried: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the\npractice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes\nthis practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique\nof prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of\nhidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed\nevaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as \"honeypots\" to detect\nreviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently\nself-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.\nPublishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer\nreview entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure\nrequirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond\npeer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including\nplagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need\nfor coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized\npolicies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework\nthat elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active\nlearning component.

Thinning nonlinear media eases this constraint but\nseverely reduces nonlinear efficiency due to limited interaction length.\nPhotonic metasurfaces, planar arrays of subwavelength meta atoms, offer a\ncompelling alternative by supporting resonant modes that enhance local fields.\nHowever, existing designs suffer from a trade off between the high efficiency\nof nonlocal metasurfaces and the precise wavefront control enabled by local\nones. These two capabilities have remained decoupled due to their fundamentally\ndifferent mechanisms. Here, we design a nonlinear nonlocal metasurface\nsupporting quasi trapped modes (QTM), enabling efficient third harmonic\ngeneration and meta atom level phase manipulation. Using topologically\nasymmetric all-dielectric meta-atoms, we achieve strong field confinement and\ndemonstrate THG enhancement exceeding three orders of magnitude compared to\nunstructured films. By exploiting symmetry and Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase\nvia meta atom rotation, we realize helicity dependent wavefront control at both\nthe fundamental and TH wavelengths. A slight boundary perturbation yields\ngeometric phase accumulation only at resonance, a behavior absent in\nconventional PB based metasurfaces.

A significant inefficiency\nin conventional systems arises from using static network architectures that\nmaintain constant computational complexity across all input segments,\nregardless of their characteristics. This approach is sub-optimal for simpler\nsegments that do not require intensive processing, such as silence or\nnon-overlapping speech. To address this limitation, we propose a dynamic\nslimmable network (DSN) for speech separation that adaptively adjusts its\ncomputational complexity based on the input signal. The DSN combines a\nslimmable network, which can operate at different network widths, with a\nlightweight gating module that dynamically determines the required width by\nanalyzing the local input characteristics. To balance performance and\nefficiency, we introduce a signal-dependent complexity loss that penalizes\nunnecessary computation based on segmental reconstruction error.

In\na spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data\nby computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However,\nidentifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables\nremains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the\nproblem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot\ntables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of\nrecommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works\ninadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to\nconsider the problem of pivot table diversification.\n  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted\ndiverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k\nrecommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is\ninsightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,\nwhile also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each\nother, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical\ncontributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a\nsingle pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a\nscalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot\ntables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce\nthe combinatorial search space.

    "abstract": "Starbursts are the light intensity patterns seen when small bright sources\nare looked at night, typically stars. Starburst shapes are produced when the\npresence of the eye's wave aberrations generates caustics (light concentration)\nat the retina. A fascinating, but never explained fact about starbursts is that\nthey usually present a $p$-fold symmetry pattern. We provide a theoretical\nexplanation of the number of points and symmetries of starbursts, based on the\ngeometric and algebraic properties of the wave aberration function expressed as\na Zernike polynomial expansion. Specifically, we investigate the number and\ndistribution of saddle cusps of Gauss of the Hessian of the wave aberration\nfunction. We also establish the connections between those points with the\nsymmetries and the number of starburst points. We found that starbursts are\nlikely generated by axially symmetric dominated wave aberrations with some\namount of non-axially symmetric terms. For instance, whereas a wave aberration\nwith a dominant spherical aberration (Zernike polynomial $Z_4^{0}$) plus\n$Z_3^{3}$ may induce a $3$ points starburst with a $3$-fold symmetry, a wave\naberration combining $Z_4^{0}$ and $Z_4^{4}$ may induce a $4$-fold symmetry\nstarburst with $4$ or $8$ points.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant interest in characterizing the\ninduced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth and pathwidth. While this\nhas recently been resolved for pathwidth, the case of treewidth remains open,\nand prior work has reduced the problem to understanding the layered-wheel-like\nobstructions -- graphs that contain large complete minor models with each\nbranching set inducing a path; exclude large walls as induced minors; exclude\nlarge complete bipartite graphs as induced minors; and exclude large complete\nsubgraphs.\n  There are various constructions of such graphs, but they are all rather\ninvolved. In this paper, we present a simple construction of layered-wheel-like\ngraphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. Three notable features of our\nconstruction are: (a) the vertices of degree at least four can be made to be\narbitrarily far apart; (b) the girth can be made to be arbitrarily large; and\n(c) every outerstring induced subgraph of the graphs from our construction has\ntreewidth bounded by an absolute constant. In contrast, among several\npreviously known constructions of layered wheels, none achieves (a); at most\none satisfies either (b) or (c); and none satisfies both (b) and (c)\nsimultaneously.\n  In particular, this is related to a former conjecture of Trotignon, that\nevery graph with large enough treewidth, excluding large walls and large\ncomplete bipartite graphs as induced minors, and large complete subgraphs, must\ncontain an outerstring induced subgraph of large treewidth. Our construction\nprovides the first counterexample to this conjecture that can also be made to\nhave arbitrarily large girth.",

When topological flat bands possess concentrated quantum\ngeometry, a topological heavy fermion (THF) model was proposed as the starting\npoint to describe the interacting moir\\'e physics. In this work, we propose a\ndesign principle for realizing \"ideal\" THF model, which can host an exact flat\nband with \"ideal quantum geometry\", namely the trace of Fubini-Study metric\nequals to the Berry curvature, in a class of two-dimensional moir\\'e\nheterostructures with type-II band alignment.

Next, we map\nthis model into a THF model that consists of a localized orbital for\n\"f-electron\" and a conducting band for \"c-electron\". We find that both the\nflatness and quantum geometry of the mini-bands in this THF model depend on the\nenergy gap between c-electron and f-electron bands at $\\Gamma$ which is\nexperimentally controllable via external gate voltages. This tunability will\nallow us to realize an \"ideal\" topological flat band with zero band-width and\n\"ideal quantum geometry\" in this THF model.

Its key innovation lies\nin effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily\nstems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively\nactivates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for\nadditional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover\nthe fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal\nalignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique\nindicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,\nwhich has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.\nSkywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving\nfrom 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.\nRemarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B\nparameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation\nsuccessfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related\nreasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and\nreinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on\nmultimodal reasoning.

As an application, we explore the two most prominent scenarios of\nhigh-$z$ SMBHs seeding mechanisms: direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) and\ncollapse of supermassive dark stars (SMDSs). We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs,\nwith comoving seed number density of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$\ncan be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $> 10^9 M_\\odot$\nbinaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z< 1$.

On well-structured domains such as\nvector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential\ngeometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with\nstrong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a\ncarefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most\npractitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing\nlayers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this\ngap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general\nsimilarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized\ninto diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from\nLaplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn\nalgorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural\nbehavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing\nand processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or\nmixture of Gaussians.

Instead, experiments reveal that above a critical\ndrive amplitude the tunneling time - the less dominant decay channel - ceases\nto increase and even decreases. Here, we show that this breakdown arises from\nthe multimode nature of the circuit implementation: specifically, the buffer\nmode used to control the Kerr-cat qubit can induce multiphoton resonances that\nsharply degrade Kerr-cat coherence if its frequency is not carefully chosen. We\nuncover this mechanism by retaining the full circuit nonlinearities and\ntreating the strong drive exactly within a Floquet-Markov framework that\nincorporates quasidegeneracies in the Kerr-cat spectrum.

Using this\nfoundation, we evaluate 43 representative attack scenarios and introduce a\nlayered threat model that captures security failures across source chain,\noff-chain, and destination chain components.\n  Our analysis at the static code and transaction network levels reveals\nrecurring design flaws, particularly in access control, validator trust\nassumptions, and verification logic, and identifies key patterns in adversarial\nbehavior based on transaction-level traces. To support future development, we\npropose a decision framework for bridge architecture design, along with defense\nmechanisms such as layered validation and circuit breakers. This work provides\na data-driven foundation for evaluating bridge security and lays the groundwork\nfor standardizing resilient cross-chain infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "High-energy atmospheric muon neutrinos are detected by the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory with a high rate of almost a hundred thousand events per year.\nBeing mainly produced in meson decays in cosmic-ray-induced air showers in the\nupper atmosphere, the flux of these neutrinos is expected to depend on\natmospheric conditions and thus features a seasonal variation. The correlation\nbetween temperature fluctuations and variations of the neutrino rates can be\ndescribed with a slope parameter $\\alpha$, whose previous measurement with 6\nyears of IceCube data indicated a discrepancy to theoretical expectations. In\nthis work, we present an update of the previous analysis, extending the\nstatistics to 12-years of IceCube data, as well as adding a region in the\nNorthern Hemisphere to the analysis. We estimate the slope parameter in the\nSouthern Hemisphere to be $\\alpha=0.325\\pm0.022$, which confirms the previous\nobservation of the tension between the theoretical predictions and experimental\nmeasurements with significance $>3\\sigma$. Furthermore, the seasonal variation\nin the Northern Hemisphere has also been observed for the first time, with\n$\\alpha=0.731\\pm0.222$. Investigations into systematic effects reveal that the\nobservations not only show a weaker correlation compared to the predictions,\nbut also deviate from the expected linear relation between the atmospheric\nneutrino flux and the atmospheric temperature.",

    "abstract": "While the principle of local gauge invariance forms the bedrock of modern\nphysics, the symmetry of scale invariance has traditionally been treated on a\ndifferent footing. This paper develops a \\emph{homothetic gauge theory} (HGT)\nthat elevates local scale transformations to a genuine gauge symmetry, placing\nthem within the same geometric framework as conventional interactions. We\nintroduce a novel mathematical structure based on an extended vector bundle\nthat linearizes the action of local scaling, allowing for the definition of a\nhomothetic connection and a corresponding gauge-covariant field strength. When\nthis formalism is applied to classical U(1) electromagnetism, the theory yields\na generalized field-strength tensor that naturally incorporates both the\nstandard Maxwell field and a new scalar partner field governing the local\nscale. The resulting dynamics, including modified conservation laws and wave\nequations, are shown to be fully consistent. As a significant physical\napplication, this framework provides a compelling resolution to the classical\nproblem of the infinite self-energy of a point charge. By modeling the source\nas a penalized Dirichlet boundary condition on a shrinking interface, we\nconstruct a non-singular electrostatic potential, thereby removing the\ndivergence in a natural, geometric manner without introducing ad-hoc\nregularization schemes. The emergence of penalty terms due to essentially\ngeometric transformations promises a physically meaningful theory, and\nencourages to re-examining the role of scale invariance in other areas of\nclassical and quantum field theory.",

The\nright-handed (RH) neutrino mass spectrum is strongly hierarchical and\nsuccessful leptogenesis relies on generating the asymmetry from\nnext-to-lightest RH neutrino decays ($N_2$-leptogenesis) and circumventing the\nlightest RH neutrino washout. These two conditions yield distinctive\npredictions such as a lower bound on the lightest neutrino mass $m_1 \\gtrsim\n1\\,{\\rm meV}$. We first review the status of SO10INLEP, noticing how\ncosmological observations are now testing a particular neutrino mass window,\n$m_1 \\simeq (10$--$30)\\,{\\rm meV}$, where only the first octant is allowed and\na large range of values for the Dirac phase is excluded. Including flavour\ncoupling, we find that the lower bound relaxes to $m_1 \\gtrsim 0.65\\,{\\rm\nmeV}$. Moreover, new muon-dominated solutions appear slightly relaxing the\nupper bound on the atmospheric mixing angle. We also study the impact on strong\nthermal SO10INLEP (ST-SO10INLEP) scenario where, in addition to successful\nleptogenesis, one can washout a large pre-existing asymmetry. Contrarily to\nnaive expectations, for which flavour coupling could jeopardise the scenario,\nallowing a large pre-existing asymmetry to survive unconditionally, we show,\nand explain analytically, that ST-SO10INLEP is still viable within almost the\nsame allowed region of parameters. There is even a slight relaxation of the\n$m_1$ viable window from (9--30)meV to (4--40)meV for a $10^{-3}$ pre-existing\nasymmetry. The new results from atmospheric neutrinos, mildly favouring normal\nordering and first octant, are now in nice agreement with the predictions of\nST-SO10INLEP.

Second, we\nsynergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:\nSemantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local\nsemantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and\nLanguage-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that\ndenoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.\nExtensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba\noutperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving\ndetail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong\ngeneralizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.\nFurthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided\ninsights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our\nfindings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to\nadvance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.",

Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are\ntypically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between\nentities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that\nintegrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer\ndiscovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical\nNonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization\n(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix\nfactorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a\n46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).\nThese materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current\nand potential applications.\n  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with\nprobabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto\ncoherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,\nmissing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,\nsuggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our\nmethod by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known\nsuperconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the\nsuperconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in\na graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific\nliterature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific\ndocuments covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating\nfrom distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new\nhypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive\nStreamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.",

The model is\ntrained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and\nhigh-resolution instruction tuning.

    "abstract": "Brain function emerges from coordinated activity across anatomically\nconnected regions, where structural connectivity (SC) -- the network of white\nmatter pathways - provides the physical substrate for functional connectivity\n(FC) -- the correlated neural activity between brain areas. While these\nstructural and functional networks exhibit substantial overlap, their\nrelationship involves complex, indirect mechanisms, including the dynamic\ninterplay of direct and indirect pathways, recurrent network interactions, and\nneuromodulatory influences. To systematically untangle how structural\narchitecture shapes functional patterns, this work aims to establish a set of\nrules that decode how direct and indirect structural connections and motifs\ngive rise to FC between brain regions. Specifically, using a generative linear\nmodel, we derive explicit rules that predict an individual's resting-state fMRI\nFC from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-derived SC, validated against\ntopological null models. Examining the rules reveals distinct classes of brain\nregions, with integrator hubs acting as structural linchpins promoting\nsynchronization and mediator hubs serving as structural fulcrums orchestrating\ncompeting dynamics. Through virtual lesion experiments, we demonstrate how\ndifferent cortical and subcortical systems distinctively contribute to global\nfunctional organization. Together, this framework disentangles the mechanisms\nby which structural architecture drives functional dynamics, enabling the\nprediction of how pathological or surgical disruptions to brain connectivity\ncascade through functional networks, potentially leading to cognitive and\nbehavioral impairments.",

    "abstract": "An instability may occur when a hot viscous fluid, such as magma, flows into\na thin gap and cools due to heat transfer to the surrounding environment, such\nas the host rock. Fluids that exhibit a drastic increase in viscosity as they\ncool give rise to a feedback loop where hotter regions flow faster, cooling\nmore slowly, thus forming ``fingers'' of hot fluid. To investigate this\nphenomenon, we employ a model system in which hot fluid is injected into a\nHele-Shaw cell where the top and bottom plates exchange heat between the fluid\nand a cold environment. We include both thermal diffusion and hydrodynamic\ndispersion in a two-dimensional description, allowing us to address the\ndependence of the instability on the P\\'eclet number (ratio of advective to\ndiffusive fluxes). We perform numerical simulations of temperature-dependent\nviscous fluid flow and find that finger-like instabilities emerge in response\nto small perturbations in the inlet velocity, depending on three control\nparameters: the P\\'eclet number, the viscosity contrast, and the cooling rate\nthrough the confining plates. Using linear stability analysis, we compute the\ndispersion relation and determine how the fastest growth rate $\\gamma_{\\max}$\nand the corresponding wavenumber $k_{\\max}$ depend on these parameters. We also\nderive analytical expressions for $\\gamma_{\\max}$ and $ k_{\\max}$ valid in the\nregime of high P\\'eclet number and high viscosity contrast. The results provide\nnew insights into the mechanisms driving such instabilities, which could\ninfluence the formation and propagation of preferred pathways during fissure\neruptions in geophysical contexts.",

OpenAgentSafety is\ndesigned for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,\nand adversarial strategies with minimal effort.

Building on these strengths, we repurpose conditional\nvideo diffusion as a physics surrogate for spatio-temporal fields governed by\npartial differential equations (PDEs). Our two-stage surrogate first applies a\nSequential Deep Operator Network (S-DeepONet) to produce a coarse,\nphysics-consistent prior from the prescribed boundary or loading conditions.\nThe prior is then passed to a conditional video diffusion model that learns\nonly the residual: the point-wise difference between the ground truth and the\nS-DeepONet prediction. By shifting the learning burden from the full solution\nto its much smaller residual space, diffusion can focus on sharpening\nhigh-frequency structures without sacrificing global coherence. The framework\nis assessed on two disparate benchmarks: (i) vortex-dominated lid-driven cavity\nflow and (ii) tensile plastic deformation of dogbone specimens. Across these\ndata sets the hybrid surrogate consistently outperforms its single-stage\ncounterpart, cutting the mean relative L2 error from 4.57% to 0.83% for the\nflow problem and from 4.42% to 2.94% for plasticity, a relative improvements of\n81.8% and 33.5% respectively. The hybrid approach not only lowers quantitative\nerrors but also improves visual quality, visibly recovering fine spatial\ndetails. These results show that (i) conditioning diffusion on a physics-aware\nprior enables faithful reconstruction of localized features, (ii) residual\nlearning reduces the problem, accelerating convergence and enhancing accuracy,\nand (iii) the same architecture transfers seamlessly from incompressible flow\nto nonlinear elasto-plasticity without problem-specific architectural\nmodifications, highlighting its broad applicability to nonlinear,\ntime-dependent continua.",

We focussed on the Draco diffuse cloud\nto gain deeper insights into the physical properties of the transition from HI\nto H2. We employed the total hydrogen column density probability distribution\nfunction (N-PDF) derived from Herschel dust observations and the N(HI)-PDF\nobtained from HI data collected by the Effelsberg HI survey. The N-PDF of the\nDraco cloud exhibits a double-log-normal distribution, whereas the N(HI)-PDF\nfollows a single log-normal distribution. The HI-to-H2 transition is identified\nas the point where the two log-normal components of the dust N-PDF contribute\nequally; it occurs at Av = 0.33 (N=6.2e20 cm^-2). The low-column-density\nsegment of the dust N-PDF corresponds to the cold neutral medium, which is\ncharacterized by a temperature of around 100 K. The higher-column-density part\nis predominantly associated with H2. The shape of the Draco N-PDF is\nqualitatively reproduced by numerical simulations. In the absence of\nsubstantial stellar feedback, such as radiation or stellar winds, turbulence\nexerts a significant influence on the thermal stability of the gas and can\nregulate the condensation of gas into denser regions and its subsequent\nevaporation. Recent observations of the ionized carbon line at 158 micron in\nDraco support this scenario. Using the KOSMA-tau photodissociation model, we\nestimate a gas density of n=50 cm^-3 and a temperature of 100 K at the location\nof the HI-to-H2 transition. Both the molecular and atomic gas components are\ncharacterized by supersonic turbulence and strong mixing, suggesting that\nsimplified steady-state chemical models are not applicable under these\nconditions.",

Unlike traditional static or two-way dynamic\nmodels, our setting captures more complex team-formation environments where one\nagent from each of the three populations must be matched to form a valid team.\nWe consider two preference structures: assortative or homophilic, where agents\nprefer to be matched with others of the same type, and dis-assortative or\nheterophilic, where diversity within the team is valued. Agents arrive\nsequentially and face a trade-off between matching immediately or waiting for a\nhigher quality match in the future albeit with a waiting cost. We construct and\nanalyze the corresponding transition probability matrices for each preference\nregime and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of stationary\ndistributions. Our results show that stable and efficient outcomes can arise in\ndynamic, multi-agent matching environments, offering a deeper understanding of\nhow complex matching processes evolve over time and how they can be effectively\nmanaged.",

To incorporate user\nhistory for personalization, existing methods typically adopt a conditional\ndiffusion framework, where the reverse denoising process of reconstructing\nitems from noise is modified to be conditioned on the user history. However,\nthis design may fail to fully utilize historical information, as it gets\ndistracted by the need to model the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$ noise\" translation.\nThis motivates us to reformulate the diffusion process for sequential\nrecommendation in an unconditional manner, treating user history (instead of\nnoise) as the endpoint of the forward diffusion process (i.e., the starting\npoint of the reverse process), rather than as a conditional input. This\nformulation allows for exclusive focus on modeling the \"item $\\leftrightarrow$\nhistory\" translation. To this end, we introduce Brownian Bridge Diffusion\nRecommendation (BBDRec). By leveraging a Brownian bridge process, BBDRec\nenforces a structured noise addition and denoising mechanism, ensuring that the\ntrajectories are constrained towards a specific endpoint -- user history,\nrather than noise.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel\nview synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,\nachieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images\ncovering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to\ndevelop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion\nwith a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this\nrotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D\npoint estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired\nby the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS\nleverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and\nmonocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in\nindoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane\nscaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,\nfollowed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization\nstability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to\nresolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.\nTested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers\nphotorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating\nthe potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.",

Our ontology models telemetry data from the two\nlargest publicly available ODA datasets-M100 (Cineca, Italy) and F-DATA\n(Fugaku, Japan)-within a single data model. The ontology is validated through\n36 competency questions reflecting real-world stakeholder requirements, and we\nintroduce modeling optimizations that reduce knowledge graph (KG) storage\noverhead by up to 38.84% compared to a previous approach, with an additional\n26.82% reduction depending on the desired deployment configuration.

This polarization-shape alignment\neffect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is\nprevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements\nof cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio\ncontinuum surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array synergized with galaxy\nshape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for\nstar-forming galaxies in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation at 0 < z < 2, assuming\nthat additional polarized radio emission from an active galactic nucleus is\nnegligible in at least a sizable fraction of the star-forming galaxies. The\nalignment found for z = 0 is consistent with local spiral data, but\nsignificantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward\nlower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic\nredshifting, observing higher-z galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates\ndegradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame\nfrequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle\ndistribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring a\npolarization rotation angle induced by cosmic birefringence. For observation at\n4.8 GHz, the effective root-mean-square misalignment angle is 18{\\deg},\n23{\\deg}, and 33{\\deg} at z = 0, 1 and 2, respectively. As accurate\nobservation-driven models are not yet available for cosmological galaxy\nsamples, our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize\npolarization-shape alignment, and can facilitate forecasts of cosmology and\nfundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.",

    "abstract": "Accurately rendering scenes with reflective surfaces remains a significant\nchallenge in novel view synthesis, as existing methods like Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often misinterpret reflections\nas physical geometry, resulting in degraded reconstructions. Previous methods\nrely on incomplete and non-generalizable geometric constraints, leading to\nmisalignment between the positions of Gaussian splats and the actual scene\ngeometry. When dealing with real-world scenes containing complex geometry, the\naccumulation of Gaussians further exacerbates surface artifacts and results in\nblurred reconstructions. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose\nRef-Unlock, a novel geometry-aware reflection modeling framework based on 3D\nGaussian Splatting, which explicitly disentangles transmitted and reflected\ncomponents to better capture complex reflections and enhance geometric\nconsistency in real-world scenes. Our approach employs a dual-branch\nrepresentation with high-order spherical harmonics to capture high-frequency\nreflective details, alongside a reflection removal module providing pseudo\nreflection-free supervision to guide clean decomposition. Additionally, we\nincorporate pseudo-depth maps and a geometry-aware bilateral smoothness\nconstraint to enhance 3D geometric consistency and stability in decomposition.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Ref-Unlock significantly outperforms\nclassical GS-based reflection methods and achieves competitive results with\nNeRF-based models, while enabling flexible vision foundation models (VFMs)\ndriven reflection editing. Our method thus offers an efficient and\ngeneralizable solution for realistic rendering of reflective scenes. Our code\nis available at https://ref-unlock.github.io/.",

We discuss the distribution of multiple parameters,\nincluding mass, cooling age, and field strength. We find strong evidence of two\npopulations of magnetic white dwarfs that form through separate mechanisms\nbased on a cluster analysis of these parameters. The young, high mass objects\ntypically have high field strengths which indicate a merger origin, while old,\naverage mass objects have weaker fields that likely originated through a\ncrystallization-induced dynamo or previous evolution stages. When comparing\nyoung and old objects, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests yield statistically\nsignificant differences between the field strengths and masses of the magnetic\ntargets. We use a Gaussian mixture model to identify where these populations\nlie in parameter space, and we find two groups centered at distinct cooling\nages, masses, and field strengths: 2.9 Gyr, 0.71 $M_{\\odot}$, 3.7 MG and 1.8\nGyr, 0.96 $M_{\\odot}$, 84 MG respectively. Our results further support the dual\nformation channel previously reported in the literature. The occurrence of\nmagnetism strongly correlates with the onset of crystallization.

Designing protocols that can reduce gate and space-time overheads of\nQEC is therefore crucial to enable more efficient QEC in near-term experiments.\nMultiqubit gates offer a natural path towards fast and low-depth stabilizer\nmeasurement circuits. However, they typically introduce high-weight correlated\nerrors that can degrade the circuit-level distance, leading to slower scalings\nof the logical error probabilities. In this work, we show how to realize fast\nand efficient surface code stabilizer readout using only two $CZ_2$ gates --\ninstead of four $CZ$ -- while preserving fault tolerance, and provide a\nblueprint for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays. We derive the time-optimal\npulses implementing the gates and perform extensive QEC numerical simulations\nwith leakage errors. Compared to the standard protocol using four $CZ$ gates,\nour scheme is faster, uses fewer gates and crucially maintains fault tolerance\nwith comparable logical error probabilities. Fault-tolerant generalizations of\nthis scheme to other QEC codes, such as quantum Low-Density Parity-Check codes,\nare also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The complex formations exhibited by schooling fish have long been the object\nof fascination for biologists and physicists. However, the physical and sensory\nmechanisms leading to organized collective behavior remain elusive. On the\nphysical side in particular, it is unknown how the flows generated by\nindividual fish influence the collective patterns that emerge in large schools.\nTo address this question, we here present a continuum theory for a school of\nswimmers in an inline formation. The swimmers are modeled as flapping wings\nthat interact through temporally nonlocal hydrodynamic forces, as arise when\none swimmer moves through the lingering vortex wakes shed by others, leading to\na system of time-delay-differential equations. Through coarse-graining, we\nderive a system of partial differential equations for the evolution of swimmer\ndensity and collective vorticity-induced hydrodynamic force. Linear stability\nanalysis of the governing equations shows that there is a range of swimmer\ndensities for which the uniform (constant-density) state is unstable to\nperturbations. Numerical simulations reveal families of stable traveling wave\nsolutions, where a uniform school destabilizes into a collection of densely\npopulated \"sub-schools\" separated by relatively sparse regions that move as a\npropagating wave. We find that distinct propagating waves may be stable for the\nsame set of kinematic parameters. Generally, our results show that temporally\nnonlocal hydrodynamic interactions can lead to rich collective behavior in\nschools of swimmers.",

This phenomenon\nraises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model\nautonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without\nexternal labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding\n(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free\nself-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance\nmetacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the\ngeometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant\nreasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to\nrepetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we\nfurther introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,\nCoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to\nterminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B\ndemonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%\nwhile improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the\nchallenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.",

Consequently, no comprehensive public benchmark yet verifies\nhow well supervision systems from the market perform under realistic, diverse\nattacks. To address this, we introduce BELLS, a Benchmark for the Evaluation of\nLLM Supervision Systems. The framework is two dimensional: harm severity\n(benign, borderline, harmful) and adversarial sophistication (direct vs.\njailbreak) and provides a rich dataset covering 3 jailbreak families and 11\nharm categories. Our evaluations reveal drastic limitations of specialized\nsupervision systems. While they recognize some known jailbreak patterns, their\nsemantic understanding and generalization capabilities are very limited,\nsometimes with detection rates close to zero when asking a harmful question\ndirectly or with a new jailbreak technique such as base64 encoding. Simply\nasking generalist LLMs if the user question is \"harmful or not\" largely\noutperforms these supervisors from the market according to our BELLS score. But\nfrontier LLMs still suffer from metacognitive incoherence, often responding to\nqueries they correctly identify as harmful (up to 30 percent for Claude 3.7 and\ngreater than 50 percent for Mistral Large). These results suggest that simple\nscaffolding could significantly improve misuse detection robustness, but more\nresearch is needed to assess the tradeoffs of such techniques. Our results\nsupport the \"bitter lesson\" of misuse detection: general capabilities of LLMs\nare necessary to detect a diverse array of misuses and jailbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear relationships between covariates and a response variable of\ninterest are frequently encountered in animal science research. Within\nstatistical models, these nonlinear effects have, traditionally, been handled\nusing a range of approaches, including transformation of the response,\nparametric nonlinear models based on theory or phenomenological grounds (e.g.,\nlactation curves), or through fixed spline or polynomial terms. If it is\ndesirable to learn the shape of the relationship from the data directly, then\ngeneralized additive models (GAMs) are an excellent alternative to these\ntraditional approaches. GAMs extend the generalized linear model such that the\nlinear predictor includes one or more smooth functions, parameterised using\npenalised splines. A wiggliness penalty on each function is used to avoid over\nfitting while estimating the parameters of the spline basis functions to\nmaximise fit to the data without producing an overly complex function. Modern\nGAMs include automatic smoothness selection methods to find an optimal balance\nbetween fit and complexity of the estimated functions. Because GAMs learn the\nshapes of functions from the data, the user can avoid forcing a particular\nmodel to their data. Here, I provide a brief description of GAMs and visually\nillustrate how they work. I then demonstrate the utility of GAMs on three\nexample data sets of increasing complexity, to show i) how learning from data\ncan produce a better fit to data than that of parametric models, ii) how\nhierarchical GAMs can be used to estimate growth data from multiple animals in\na single model, and iii) how hierarchical GAMs can be used for formal\nstatistical inference in a designed experiment of the effects of exposure to\nmaternal hormones on subsequent growth in Japanese quail.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of deep learning across various domains, it remains\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks. Although many existing adversarial attack\nmethods achieve high success rates, they typically rely on $\\ell_{p}$-norm\nperturbation constraints, which do not align with human perceptual\ncapabilities. Consequently, researchers have shifted their focus toward\ngenerating natural, unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs). GAN-based\napproaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as poor image quality due to\ninstability and mode collapse. Meanwhile, diffusion models have been employed\nfor UAE generation, but they still rely on iterative PGD perturbation\ninjection, without fully leveraging their central denoising capabilities. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approach for generating UAEs based on\ndiffusion models, named ScoreAdv. This method incorporates an interpretable\nadversarial guidance mechanism to gradually shift the sampling distribution\ntowards the adversarial distribution, while using an interpretable saliency map\nto inject the visual information of a reference image into the generated\nsamples. Notably, our method is capable of generating an unlimited number of\nnatural adversarial examples and can attack not only classification models but\nalso retrieval models. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and CelebA\ndatasets, validating the performance of ScoreAdv across ten target models in\nboth black-box and white-box settings. Our results demonstrate that ScoreAdv\nachieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and image quality.

    "abstract": "Machine Learning models are increasingly used in businesses to detect faults\nand anomalies in complex systems. In this work, we take this approach a step\nfurther: beyond merely detecting anomalies, we aim to identify the optimal\ncontrol strategy that restores the system to a safe state with minimal\ndisruption. We frame this challenge as a counterfactual problem: given a\nMachine Learning model that classifies system states as either good or\nanomalous, our goal is to determine the minimal adjustment to the system's\ncontrol variables (i.e., its current status) that is necessary to return it to\nthe good state. To achieve this, we leverage a mathematical model that finds\nthe optimal counterfactual solution while respecting system specific\nconstraints. Notably, most counterfactual analysis in the literature focuses on\nindividual cases where a person seeks to alter their status relative to a\ndecision made by a classifier, such as for loan approval or medical diagnosis.\nOur work addresses a fundamentally different challenge: optimizing\ncounterfactuals for a complex energy system, specifically an offshore wind\nturbine oil type transformer. This application not only advances counterfactual\noptimization in a new domain but also opens avenues for broader research in\nthis area. Our tests on real world data provided by our industrial partner show\nthat our methodology easily adapts to user preferences and brings savings in\nthe order of 3 million euros per year in a typical farm.",

To overcome the\ninherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable\nregistration module within the sCT pipeline.

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient acquisition of wireless channel state information\n(CSI) is crucial to enhance the communication performance of wireless systems.\nHowever, with the continuous densification of wireless links, increased channel\ndimensions, and the use of higher-frequency bands, channel estimation in the\nsixth generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks faces new challenges, such\nas insufficient orthogonal pilot sequences, inadequate signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) for channel training, and more sophisticated channel statistical\ndistributions in complex environment. These challenges pose significant\ndifficulties for classical channel estimation algorithms like least squares\n(LS) and maximum a posteriori (MAP). To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel environment-aware channel estimation framework with location-specific\nprior channel distribution enabled by the new concept of channel knowledge map\n(CKM). To this end, we propose a new type of CKM called channel score function\nmap (CSFM), which learns the channel probability density function (PDF) using\nartificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To fully exploit the prior information\nin CSFM, we propose a plug-and-play (PnP) based algorithm to decouple the\nregularized MAP channel estimation problem, thereby reducing the complexity of\nthe optimization process. Besides, we employ Tweedie's formula to establish a\nconnection between the channel score function, defined as the logarithmic\ngradient of the channel PDF, and the channel denoiser. This allows the use of\nthe high-precision, environment-aware channel denoiser from the CSFM to\napproximate the channel score function, thus enabling efficient processing of\nthe decoupled channel statistical components. Simulation results show that the\nproposed CSFM-PnP based channel estimation technique significantly outperforms\nthe conventional techniques in the aforementioned challenging scenarios.",

When the coupling strength of\nlight-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and\nmatter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating)\nprocesses, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created\nor annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between\nlight and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for\nnoise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum\ntechnologies.

Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high\nspatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often\ncomputationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face\ndifficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly\nsensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.\nTherefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)\napproach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the\ntransport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the\ngroundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a\ncity-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous\ngroundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points\nforming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first\nsystematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields.

Both poloidal and toroidal\nasymmetries are observed and attributed to RF sheath effects, with modeled\nerosion patterns deviating from experiment - highlighting sensitivity to sheath\ngeometry and plasma resolution. High-charge-state oxygen ions (O6+-O8+)\ndominate erosion, while D+ contributes negligibly. A plasma composition of 1\npercent oxygen and 98 percent deuterium is assumed.

However, research applying these advances to the\nfinancial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to\ncomplete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO\n(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance\nLLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM\nperformance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain\nknowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate\nreasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the\nexpanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To\nensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models\nand rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets\nspecifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our\nframework, we train the FEVO series of models - C32B, S32B, R32B - from\nQwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and\ngeneral capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger\nmodels as well as specialist models.

We apply principal component analysis\n(PCA), one of the dimensionality reduction techniques, to control the False\nDiscovery Rate (FDR) in the presence of high-dimensional covariates. This\nmethod not only provides a convenient interpretation of how multiple covariates\nin high dimensions affect the control of FDR but also offers higher statistical\npower compared to cases where covariates are not used. Furthermore, we aim to\ninvestigate how covariates contribute to increasing the statistical power\nthrough various simulation experiments, comparing the results with real data\nexamples to derive better interpretations. Using real-world datasets, including\nGWAS with Body Mass Index (BMI) as the phenotype, we evaluate the performance\nof our proposed approaches.

With the advancements\nof large language models (LLMs) in language comprehension, some methods use\nembeddings as LLM inputs for explanation generation. However, since embeddings\nlack inherent semantics, LLMs must adjust or extend their parameters to\ninterpret them, a process that inevitably incurs information loss.

This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding\nsome limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for\ninstance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not\ngenerally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present\npaper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief\nsets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we\npropose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal\nrevision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest\npossible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new\ninformation. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set\nvia a minimal revision.",

Such reactive approach makes ensuring\ncomplete isolation a daunting task, and leaves room for errors and oversights.\n  We address this problem by developing a tool that stress tests\nmicroarchitectural isolation between security domains such as virtual machines,\nkernel, and processes, with the goal of detecting flaws in the isolation\nboundaries. The tool extends model-based relational testing (MRT) methodology\nto enable detection of cross-domain information leakage.

    "abstract": "The dynamics of a rigid cometary nucleus is described by the evolutions of\nits center-of-mass and of its rotation state. Solar irradiation that reaches\nthe surface of a cometary nucleus causes the sublimation of volatiles that form\nthe coma around the nucleus. The sublimation process transfers linear momentum\nand rotational angular momentum from the nucleus to the surrounding space, and\nthus affects the dynamics via nongravitational forces and nongravitational\ntorques. The 2014-2016 Rosetta mission accompanying the comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko provides the longest continuous observational data to\ntrack its rotation state. The observed change in the rotation state is not\nexplained by a low heat conductivity thermophysical model in combination with a\nhomogeneous surface ice coverage of comet 67P. Spatially and/or temporally\nvarying weights for effective active fraction with respect to a prescribed set\nof surface regions provide a potential solution to this problem. Here, we\npresent a methodology for classifying the surface based on vectorial efficiency\nof the torque. On any cometary surface without geometric symmetry, the\nmethodology highlights the decomposition into eight characteristic regions that\nencode the signs of torque efficiency with respect to all vector components. We\nanalyze in detail rotation states close to lowest energy and different\nthermophysical models, and we discuss how the uncertainties of observations\naffect the model parameters. We study the occurrence of these regions for an\noblate ellipsoid, a near-prolate ellipsoid, a bilobed shape, and a shape model\nanalogous to that of comet 67P. The sensitivity analysis for comet 67P\nindicates that the observations constrain only one of the eight weights\nuniquely. The other directions are poorly constrained and show the limitation\nof the rotational data in determining regional activity.",

The overarching objective is\nto meet the total demand for energy at minimal cost in the presence of\nstrategic behavior. We present two key theoretical results. First, no mechanism\ncan uniformly dominate PC or PB. This means that for any mechanism\n$\\mathcal{M}$, there exists a market configuration and a mixed-strategy Nash\nequilibrium of PC (respectively for PB) that yields strictly lower total energy\ncosts than under $\\mathcal{M}$. Second, in terms of worst-case equilibrium\noutcomes, PB consistently outperforms PC: across all market instances, the\nhighest possible equilibrium price under PB is strictly lower than that under\nPC. This suggests a structural robustness of PB to strategic manipulation.\nThese theoretical insights are further supported by extensive simulations based\non no-regret learning dynamics, which consistently yield lower average market\nprices in several energy market settings.",

However, the consistent disadvantage of these\nmodels is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled\ntext in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical\npurposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces\na new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware\nAttention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three\nwell-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder\nthat encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph\nrepresentations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input\ntext that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of\nthe character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to\nlimit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to\navoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning\nphase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be\nlegible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,\nsuch as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new\nstate-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text\nrendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error\nRate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality\non high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).",

Whether non-equilibrium effects can alter this universal\nbehavior remains a fundamental open question. Here, we theoretically\ninvestigate LG criticality in a hyperuniform (HU) fluid of active spinners,\nwhere phase separation is driven by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the\ncritical point the HU fluid displays normal Gaussian density fluctuations\nrather than the expected divergence, while the compressibility still diverges.\nThe system is thus calm yet highly susceptible, in fundamental violation of the\nconventional fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Consistently, we observe\nanomalous zero-range correlation functions coexisting with quasi-long-range\nresponse functions. Based on a generalized model B and renormalization-group\nanalysis, we show that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical dimension\nfrom $d_c = 4$ to $d_c = 2$, and the system exhibits anomalous finite-size\nscaling in density fluctuations, energy fluctuations, and the Binder cumulant.\nFurthermore, the HU fluid undergoes non-classical spinodal decomposition, where\nthe decomposition time diverges but the characteristic length scale remains\nfinite as criticality is approached. The origin of these anomalies lies in the\ncenter-of-mass-conserving dynamics of the spinners, which endows the system\nwith a scale-dependent effective temperature, $T_{\\rm eff} \\propto q^2$,\nunderlying a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relationship. These findings\nestablish a striking exception to classical paradigms of critical phenomena and\nillustrate how non-equilibrium forces can fundamentally reshape universality\nclasses.",

    "abstract": "We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a\nhypothesis state $\\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\\rho$, a\ntester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\\epsilon$-far in\ntrace distance. It is known that $\\Theta(d/\\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\\rho$ are\nnecessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled\nmeasurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for\na worst-case $\\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is\nfor this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal\nbounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the\ntester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],\nthey remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements\nthey can perform.\n  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for\nquantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled\nmeasurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal\ncopy complexity for certifying $\\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity\ntimes the fidelity between $\\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our\nlower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method,\nwhich is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to\nrecover the $\\Omega(d/\\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15],\ni.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple\nproof.",

In this work, we propose a pipeline that combines anonymization\nand event data partitioning, where event abstraction is utilized for\npartitioning. By leveraging event abstraction, event logs can be segmented into\nmultiple parts, allowing each sub-log to be anonymized separately. This\npipeline preserves privacy while mitigating the loss of utility.

We use ages at which fixed star\nfractions form to characterize SFH duration.

Probability distributions for\nobserved galaxies use robust Bayesian statistics comparing observed and model\nspectral features. We create composite stellar population (CSP) libraries using\nSEDlibrary software, implementing varied SFH, metallicity, and dust properties.\nWe compare spectra using ten features: five spectral indices (D4000n,\n[Hdelta+Hgamma], Hbeta, [Mg_2Fe], [MgFe]') and five SDSS ugriz photometric\nfluxes. First, we focus on limiting Deltaage_n distinguishing extended from\nnegligible SFH duration, Deltaage_n,min (time resolution). Using idealized CSP\nlibrary of 5 million dust-free, burst-free models with fixed metallicities from\nsubsolar to supersolar, Deltaage_n,min marks where spectral features depend on\nSFH duration. We find roughly flat log(Deltaage_n,min) around -0.3 dex over 4\nmagnitude orders in age. Deltaage_n,min decreases with higher SNR up to\nSNR=100, beyond which no improvement occurs. Second, we create mock datasets by\nperturbing 12,500 library models with realistic errors, testing retrieval\ncapability for characteristic ages and SFH duration using realistic\n500,000-model CSP library with up to 6 starbursts, dust, and variable\nmetallicity. We constrain SFH duration log(Deltaage_n) within +-0.3 dex for\nmost samples. For populations with strong Balmer absorption and mean age <10^9\nyr, uncertainty exceeds 0.5 dex due to SFH degeneracies.

To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration\nand spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite\nimages, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of\ncity scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach\nemploys a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and\nthen extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as\nwell as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is\nperformed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using\nradial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied\nto the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve\nvertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI\nbenchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the\nKITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard\ndeviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a\n55.3\\% improvement over the original dataset.

In this work, we\ninvestigate an ensemble-based approach for improving the generalization of\ndeepfake detection systems across diverse datasets. Building on a recent\nopen-source benchmark, we combine prediction probabilities from several\nstate-of-the-art asymmetric models proposed at top venues. Our experiments span\ntwo distinct out-of-domain datasets and demonstrate that no single model\nconsistently outperforms others across settings. In contrast, ensemble-based\npredictions provide more stable and reliable performance in all scenarios.

    "abstract": "The high configurability of modern software systems has made configuration\ntuning a crucial step for assuring system performance, e.g., latency or\nthroughput. However, given the expensive measurements, large configuration\nspace, and rugged configuration landscape, existing tuners suffer\nineffectiveness due to the difficult balance of budget utilization between\nexploring uncertain regions (for escaping from local optima) and exploiting\nguidance of known good configurations (for fast convergence). The root cause is\nthat we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes\nchallenges in the explainability of the results.\n  In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by\ncausally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn\nrules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify\nthem with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated\nreflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these\nplaces in the landscape. This, as we demonstrate, can effectively mitigate the\nimpact of the exploration and exploitation trade-off. Those purified regions\ncan then be paired with the measured configurations to provide spatial\nexplainability at the landscape level. Comparing with 11 state-of-the-art\ntuners on 12 systems and varying budgets, we show that PromiseTune performs\nsignificantly better than the others with 42% superior rank to the overall\nsecond best while providing richer information to explain the hidden system\ncharacteristics.",

    "authors": [

    ],
    "abstract": "In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms\ngenerate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared\nto the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being\nconsistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be\nimproved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in\nfeature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial\ndependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar\neffects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are\ncommonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an\nalgorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,\nwithout any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that\neventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing\nportfolio.\n  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'\nreturns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as\nan independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such\na stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary\nprocesses fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a\nstrategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,\nmatching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly\ncriterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the\ntheoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as\nlong as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the\ngeneralized Kelly criterion in the experimental market. This further affirms\nthe broad applicability of the algorithm in general contexts.",

To this end, we propose Semantic\nCo-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for\npartial multi-label learning.

Here, we\npropose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the\nmatrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the\noptimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are\ndefined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs\nwith specified virtual bond dimensions $\\chi$, and thus are dubbed as\n$\\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\\chi$-MPE).

Despite its\nlimited applicability to relatively small assemblies, data obtained from PR-DNS\nhas been the driving force for the development of drag closures for much more\naffordable simulation frameworks, such as Eulerian-Lagrangian point particle\nmethods. Recently, more effort has been invested in the development of\ndeterministic drag models that account for the effect of the structure of the\nparticle assembly. Current successful deterministic models are mainly black-box\nneural networks which: 1) Assume pairwise superposition of the neighbours'\neffect on the drag, and 2) Are trained on PR-DNS data for a wide range of\nparticle concentrations and flow regimes. To alleviate the black-box nature of\nneural networks, we use genetic programming (GP) to develop interpretable\nmodels. In our previous research, this has been proven successful in the Stokes\nregime. In the current contribution, we extend the application of GP to higher\nparticle Reynolds number regimes. This is done by training a graph neural\nnetwork (GNN) on the PR-DNS data to learn the pairwise interactions among the\nparticles that constitute the drag variation. The significance of the input\nfeatures of the GNN is assessed via a feature permutation approach. Then, the\nestimated pairwise interactions as extracted from the GNN are fed to a GP\nalgorithm, which searches for symbolic expressions that fit the input data. A\ncomparison between the trained GNN model and the resulting symbolic expressions\nis presented, to assess whether the symbolic expression can capture the\nunderlying patterns learnt by the GNN. The comparison demonstrates the\npotential of GP in finding relatively simple symbolic models. At the same time,\nthe accuracy of the symbolic models slightly fall behind the GNN.",

    "abstract": "Accurately localising fast radio bursts (FRBs) is essential for understanding\ntheir birth environments and for their use as cosmological probes. Recent\nadvances in radio interferometry, particularly with MeerKAT, have enabled the\nlocalisation of individual bursts with arcsecond precision. In this work, we\npresent the localisation of 15 apparently non-repeating FRBs detected with\nMeerKAT. Two of the FRBs, discovered in 2022, were localised in 8 second images\nfrom the projects which MeerTRAP was commensal to, while eight were localised\nusing the transient buffer pipeline, and another one through SeeKAT, all with\narcsecond precision. Four additional FRBs lacked TB triggers and sufficient\nsignal, limiting their localisation only to arcminute precision. For nine of\nthe FRBs in our sample, we identify host galaxies with greater than 90%\nconfidence, while two FRBs have ambiguous associations with two host galaxy\ncandidates. We measured spectroscopic redshifts for six host galaxies, ranging\nfrom 0.33 to 0.85, demonstrating MeerKAT's sensitivity to high redshift FRBs.\nFor galaxies with sufficient photometric coverage, we performed spectral energy\nthose of known FRB hosts. This work represents one of the largest uniform\nsamples of well-localised distant FRBs to date, laying the groundwork for using\nMeerKAT FRBs as cosmological probes and understand how FRB hosts evolve at high\nredshift.",

    "abstract": "Context: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are becoming widely used for\nvarious Requirements Engineering (RE) tasks. Research on improving their\naccuracy mainly focuses on prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and retrieval\naugmented generation. However, these methods often treat models as isolated\nblack boxes - relying on single-pass outputs without iterative refinement or\ncollaboration, limiting robustness and adaptability. Objective: We propose\nthat, just as human debates enhance accuracy and reduce bias in RE tasks by\nincorporating diverse perspectives, different LLM agents debating and\ncollaborating may achieve similar improvements. Our goal is to investigate\nwhether Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) strategies can enhance RE performance. Method:\nWe conducted a systematic study of existing MAD strategies across various\ndomains to identify their key characteristics. To assess their applicability in\nRE, we implemented and tested a preliminary MAD-based framework for RE\nclassification. Results: Our study identified and categorized several MAD\nstrategies, leading to a taxonomy outlining their core attributes. Our\npreliminary evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of applying MAD to RE\nclassification. Conclusions: MAD presents a promising approach for improving\nLLM accuracy in RE tasks.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Central venous catheterization (CVC) is a critical medical procedure\nfor vascular access, hemodynamic monitoring, and life-saving interventions. Its\nsuccess remains challenging due to the need for continuous ultrasound-guided\nvisualization of a target vessel and approaching needle, which is further\ncomplicated by anatomical variability and operator dependency. Errors in needle\nplacement can lead to life-threatening complications. While robotic systems\noffer a potential solution, achieving full autonomy remains challenging. In\nthis work, we propose an end-to-end robotic-ultrasound-guided CVC pipeline,\nfrom scan initialization to needle insertion. Methods: We introduce a\ndeep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a\ndepth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously\ndefine the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework\nis proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and\narteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.\nFinally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance\nwith operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity\ncommercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The\nproposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the\nfirst attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15\n\\textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less\nthan or close to 1 \\textit{mm}. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first\nrobotic CVC system demonstrated on a high-fidelity phantom with integrated\nplanning, scanning, and insertion. Experimental results show its potential for\nclinical translation.",

The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent\n$H$ in the range $0<H<1$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly\nanti-persistent regime $-1/2<H<0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process,\nso we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The\nextended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation\nfunction. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this\nregion of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian\nprocess: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended\nto the range $-1/2<H<0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably,\nthe smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the\nconfining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned\nfBm and fOU processes for $-1/2<H<0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results\nmatch continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU\nprocesses.",

Screening is an intrinsically dynamic process and\nthe corresponding downfolding methods such as the constrained Random Phase\nApproximation indeed produce a dynamic interaction.

Moreover, we show that the\ncharacterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved\nby a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational\nhardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is\nthat the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on\nalgorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability\n(known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving\npseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates\nthe power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic\nComplexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009)\nand Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to\nachieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet\nsize compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and\nVadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration.

    "abstract": "Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for\ntraining deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,\nits theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works\npredominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent\nwith momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t -\n\\frac{\\gamma_t}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ \\bm{m}_t$. This perspective\nnecessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy\nand opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In\ncontrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like\noptimizer, expressed as $\\bm{x}_{t+1} = \\bm{x}_t - \\gamma_t\n\\frac{|\\bm{m}_t|}{{\\sqrt{\\bm{v}_t}+\\epsilon}} \\circ {\\rm Sign}(\\bm{m}_t)$. This\nreformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first\ntime, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate\nof ${\\cal O}(\\frac{1}{T^{\\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\\cal O}\n\\left(\\frac{\\ln T}{T^{\\sfrac{1}{4}}}\\right)$ under weak assumptions of the\ngeneralized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without\ndependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter\n$\\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into\nthe role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical\nguidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between\ntheory and practice.",

This formula links the\nnon-equilibrium charge fluctuation after the quench to the fluctuations of the\nassociated current after a charge-biased inhomogeneous modification of the\noriginal quench which corresponds to the paradigmatic partitioning protocol.\nUnder certain assumptions, the fluctuations in the latter case can be expressed\nby explicit closed form formulas in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic\nquantities via the Ballistic Fluctuations Theory. In this work, we identify\nprecise physical conditions for the applicability of a fully hydrodynamic\ntheory, and provide a detailed analysis explicitly demonstrating how such\nconditions are met and how this leads to such hydrodynamic treatment. We\ndiscuss these conditions at length in non-relativistic free fermions, where\ncalculations become feasible and allow for cross-checks against exact results.\nIn physically relevant cases, strong long-range correlations can complicate the\nhydrodynamic picture, but our formula still correctly reproduces the first\ncumulants.",

That generalizes the conventional Navier condition of partial slip\nthat given at the liquid-solid interface, since the solid (rigid) state can be\nconsidered as a liquid with infinite viscosity. A generalized\nHadamard-Rybczynski equation (HRE) is obtained. If slip length {\\lambda}=0 that\nequation transforms into the conventional HRE. For infinite viscosity of the\ndroplet, generalized HRE becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes\ndrag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of\npartial slip. At certain {\\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the\nall components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids,\nincluding diagonal tensor components. Generalized HRE is applied to the\ninterpretation of the experiment in which the velocity of falling of a\nspherical droplet of silicate oil in the castor oil is investigated.\nStreamlines have been built corresponding to both the Hadamard-Rybczynski model\nand the partial slip approach.

We discuss sampling strategies for ensembles of\ninstantons, both with and without interactions and including Gaussian\nfluctuations around them.

To understand\nwhy interphase boundaries are not always effective for activation,\nmicrostructural features and hydrogen storage performance of six HEAs with dual\nphases are compared. Detailed analysis confirms that interphase boundaries are\neffective for hydrogen absorption without the need for activation treatment,\nprovided that: (i) their fraction is high enough, and (ii) they are not\ncoherent. These findings are discussed in terms of free volume and boundary\nenergy. Coherent interphase boundaries are associated with lower free volume\nand thus do not act as fast hydrogen diffusion paths. Moreover, the boundary\nenergy of coherent boundaries is lower than incoherent boundaries, making them\nless favorable sites for heterogeneous hydride nucleation.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely\nspread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control\ntheir propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active\ntopic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD\nmethods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models\ntrained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this\nissue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,\ninducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by\ntwo major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the\ndetection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,\nthe social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the\ngeneralization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to\nremember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific\nparameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and\nanticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time\ndynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and\nsignificantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and\nthree continual learning methods.",

Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely\napplied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across\ndifferent scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation\nmodel for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse\nprediction intervals.

In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium\nroute to realize half-metallic phases.

We\nconsider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and\nstabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically.\nThe drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered\npotential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground\nstate is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to\nthe suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective\nenhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e\ninteractions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic\nhalf-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic\nphase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for\nexponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually\nstable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing.

Among these schemes, the most convenient ones are considered.\nSimulations with the proposed schemes may be also improved by embedding of\nMUSCL reconstruction into a numerical scheme, or by correcting the kernel\ngradient as was proposed earlier for the Cartesian case.\n  Verification of the proposed method is performed on several test problems:\nSod's cylindrical test, Taylor bar test, and Sedov's point explosion.

It is the framework to be used in the energy gap from scales\nsufficiently higher than the electroweak scale up to the lowest energy scale at\nwhich new particles show up. We summarize the present status of this theory\nwith a particular emphasize on its role in the indirect search for new physics\n(NP). While flavour physics of both quarks and leptons is the main topic of our\nreview, we also discuss electric dipole moments, anomalous magnetic moments\n$(g-2)_{\\mu,e}$, $Z$-pole observables, Higgs observables and high-$p_T$\nscattering processes within the SMEFT. We group the observables into ten\nclasses and list for each class the most relevant operators and the\ncorresponding renormalization group equations (RGEs). We exhibit the\ncorrelations between different classes implied both by the operator mixing and\nthe $\\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry. Our main goal is to provide an insight\ninto the complicated operator structure of this framework which hopefully will\nfacilitate the identification of valid ultraviolet completions behind possible\nanomalies observed in future data. Numerous colourful charts, and 85 tables,\nwhile representing rather complicated RG evolution from the NP scale down to\nthe electroweak scale, beautify the involved SMEFT landscape. Over 950\nreferences to the literature underline the importance and the popularity of\nthis field. We discuss both top-down and bottom-up approaches as well as their\ninterplay. This allows us eventually to present an atlas of different\nlandscapes beyond the SM that includes heavy gauge bosons and scalars,\nvector-like quarks and leptons and leptoquarks.",

This large span in length scale renders direct\nnumerical simulations of such devices prohibitively expensive in terms of\ncomputer memory requirements, and consequently, the so-called boundary-layer\nmodels are introduced. In such models, approximate analytical expressions of\nthe boundary-layer fields are found and inserted in the governing equations and\nboundary conditions for the remaining bulk fields. Since the bulk fields do not\nvary across the boundary layers, they can be computed numerically using the\nresulting boundary-layer model without resolving the boundary layers. However,\ncurrent boundary-layer models are only accurate for hard solids (e.g. glass and\nsilicon) with relatively small oscillation amplitudes of the confining wall,\nand they fail for soft solids (e.g. polymers) with larger wall oscillations. In\nthis work, we extend the boundary-layer model of Bach and Bruus, J. Acoust.\nSoc.

In this\npaper, we propose Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an\nend-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables LMMs to\niteratively focus on key visual regions by automatically cropping sub-images,\nbased on model-predicted grounding coordinates within a multi-turn conversation\nframework. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which requires costly\nadditional grounding annotations, our approach highlights that LMMs can emerge\nrobust grounding abilities during the RL training process, leveraging only a\nbinary reward function derived from the correctness of the final answer.\nAdditionally, we observe that LMMs struggle to autonomously trigger visual\ngrounding during the rollout process. To address this cold start problem, we\ndesign a multi-turn conversational template and restrict policy loss\ncomputation to model outputs generated across multiple dialogue rounds, thereby\npromoting stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when\ntrained on standard visual-question-short answering data without grounding\nannotations, MGPO effectively elicits stronger grounding capabilities compared\nto GRPO, leading to 5.4\\% improvement on in-distribution MME-Realworld and\n5.2\\% improvement on the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) V* Bench.\nNotably, MGPO post-training on Qwen2.5-VL-7B with 21K samples surpasses\nOpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models on the OOD V* Bench.

Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially\ndeveloped for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their\ndirect usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the\ncontext of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and\nexperimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories\n(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to\nfive established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,\nand DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies\nkey limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of\nperturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on\nperturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based\napproaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same\nimage, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance\ndisproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we\nfind limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same\nproblems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity\nmetrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,\nrobustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater\nstability.

    "abstract": "A simple yet effective method for inference-time alignment of generative\nmodels is Best-of-$N$ (BoN), where $N$ outcomes are sampled from a reference\npolicy, evaluated using a proxy reward model, and the highest-scoring one is\nselected. While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL\ntradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the\nproxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a\nsmooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical\nframework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by\nproviding bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference\npolicy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of\nsamples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true\nreward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and\nempirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward\noveroptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low.",

For experiments of probe particles in living\nand passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so called effective\nenergy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem.\nIn this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters\nthat enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding\nqualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the\nphenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of\ntime parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with\nlimited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in\ndependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in\nMBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in\nterms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum\nas a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data\nto a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.",

In this second\nrelease, we present two new catalogs of stellar parameters (Teff, logg, and\n[Fe/H]).

The second\ncatalog, SoS-ML catalog, is obtained by using SoS-Spectro as a reference to\ntrain a multi-layer perceptron, which predicts stellar parameters based on two\nphotometric surveys, SDSS and SkyMapper. As a novel approach, we build on\nprevious parameters sets, from Gaia DR3 and Andrae et al. (2023), aiming to\nimprove their precision and accuracy. We obtain a catalog of stellar parameters\nfor around 23 millions of stars, which we make publicly available.

    "abstract": "Multimodal data is known to be helpful for visual tracking by improving\nrobustness to appearance variations. However, sensor synchronization challenges\noften compromise data availability, particularly in video settings where\nshortages can be temporal. Despite its importance, this area remains\nunderexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study on\ntracker performance with temporally incomplete multimodal data. Unsurprisingly,\nunder such a circumstance, existing trackers exhibit significant performance\ndegradation, as their rigid architectures lack the adaptability needed to\neffectively handle missing modalities. To address these limitations, we propose\na flexible framework for robust multimodal tracking. We venture that a tracker\nshould dynamically activate computational units based on missing data rates.\nThis is achieved through a novel Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts fusion\nmechanism with adaptive complexity, coupled with a video-level masking strategy\nthat ensures both temporal consistency and spatial completeness which is\ncritical for effective video tracking. Surprisingly, our model not only adapts\nto varying missing rates but also adjusts to scene complexity. Extensive\nexperiments show that our model achieves SOTA performance across 9 benchmarks,\nexcelling in both conventional complete and missing modality settings.

At typical\nmasses of the GUT-scale - above $10^{14}$ GeV - these particles would move at\nsub-relativistic speeds. The Rubakov-Callan effect predicts that magnetic\nmonopoles can catalyze nucleon decays, in particular the decay of protons. This\nresults in a unique signature of small particle cascades along the trajectory\nof the slow moving magnetic monopole. Since 2012, a dedicated Slow-Particle\nFilter has been implemented in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory for the\ndetection of magnetic monopoles. Current limits set an upper bound for the\nmonopole flux at $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{90}}\\leq 10^{-17}$ to $10^{-18}\n\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ depending on the catalysis\ncross section for the proton decay.

While\nmost existing studies focus on toponium using perturbative QCD near threshold,\nbaryonic configurations containing a single top quark -- singly topped baryons\n-- offer a complementary nonperturbative perspective. Notably, singly topped\nbaryons are expected to exhibit a longer lifetime and a narrower decay width\nthan toponium, since only one top quark decays rather than two. The heavy quark\neffective theory provides a natural and powerful framework for analyzing such\nsystems, allowing the separation of heavy and light quark dynamics. In this\nwork we employ heavy quark effective theory to investigate the internal\nstructure of ground-state singly topped baryons. We construct their\ninterpolating currents and analyze them using QCD sum rules.

A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct\nvalidity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended\ntrait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.\nTo make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation\nusing LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which\nthe same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By\nsimulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that\nrobustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait\ntheories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and\nsimulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate\nthe ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to\nsimulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,\nmetrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective\nsurvey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like\nbehavior.

    "abstract": "In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows\nup a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex\nfeatures. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of\nconnections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many\nanatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical\ninterpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond\nin parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other\nevidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at\nthe same time. Given this flexibility, the word \"heterarchy\" might be a more\nsuitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new\ninterpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the\nneocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the \"Thousand Brains\nTheory\", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning\nsystem. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a\nsensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,\ncan learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the\nhierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional\nstructure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the\ntheory by examining the different types of long-range connections between\ncortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these\nconnections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a\nheterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an\nessential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel\nperspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and\nartificial intelligence.",

Methods and\nresults: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that\nunderwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their\nnon-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders\nannotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the\nside branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and\n10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction\nof these features. The trained DL solutions were used to process NIRS-IVUS and\nOCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to\nco-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the\ncircumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic\nprogramming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed\nhigh concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and\ncircumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance\ncorrelation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the\ncircumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal\nand 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable\nperformance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process\nimaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based\nframework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is\nfast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts.\nThese features renders it useful in research in the analysis of large-scale\ndata collected in studies that incorporate multimodality imaging to\ncharacterize plaque composition.",

Yet, the principles by which such systems self-organize, breaking\nequilibrium symmetries under external and internal constraints, remain unclear.\nHere, we establish a general connection between symmetry breaking and\ndissipation in mesoscopic stochastic systems described by Langevin dynamics.\nUsing a geometric framework based on the inverse diffusion matrix, we decompose\nthe velocity field into excess (gradient) and housekeeping (residual)\ncomponents. This provides a natural entropy production split: the excess part\ncaptures internal reorganization under non-equilibrium conditions, while the\nhousekeeping part quantifies detailed-balance violation due to external forces.\nWe derive an exact equality linking the two, along with an inequality\nidentifying accessible thermodynamics. A weak-noise expansion of the stationary\nsolution reveals the general geometry of the NESS velocity field, enabling a\nunified classification of steady states. We apply this framework to systems\nranging from molecular machines to coupled oscillators, showing how symmetry\nbreaking in trajectory space constrains NESS organization. We further extend\nour approach to systems with multiplicative noise, deriving how additional\nsymmetry breaking relates to curved (space-dependent) metrics. Finally, we show\nthat both the NESS velocity field and stationary distribution can be derived\nthrough variational functionals based on excess dissipation.

However, the contribution of each core component remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we inspect the reproducibility of RecRanker, and\nstudy the impact and role of its various components. We begin by reproducing\nthe RecRanker pipeline through the implementation of all its key components.\nOur reproduction shows that the pairwise and listwise methods achieve a\nperformance comparable to that reported in the original paper. For the\npointwise method, while we are also able to reproduce the original paper's\nresults, further analysis shows that the performance is abnormally high due to\ndata leakage from the inclusion of ground-truth information in the prompts. To\nenable a fair and comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based top-k recommendations,\nwe propose RecRankerEval, an extensible framework that covers five key\ndimensions: user sampling strategy, initial recommendation model, LLM backbone,\ndataset selection, and instruction tuning method. Using the RecRankerEval\nframework, we show that the original results of RecRanker can be reproduced on\nthe ML-100K and ML-1M datasets, as well as the additional Amazon-Music dataset,\nbut not on BookCrossing due to the lack of timestamp information in the\noriginal RecRanker paper.

Unlike the\nmonotonous influence of OV observed for the MIT in VO$_2$ and V$_2$O$_3$,\ninitial OV doping lowers the MIT temperature here, whereas higher OV levels\ncompletely suppress the metallic phase.

In this paper, we aim to derive a closed-form expression\nfor the secrecy rate, a key metric in PLS, which is often unattainable in\ncurrent studies due to the uncertainty of Eves.

To minimize the gap between these two\ntypes of secrecy rates, we formulate and solve an optimization problem by\njointly designing the equivalent distance between the transmitter and the\nvirtual Eve} and the antenna positions of MAs at the virtual Eve.

However, the use of LLMs for\nrecommendation tasks is limited by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.\nThis lack of relevant relational knowledge about the items to be recommended in\nthe LLM's pre-training corpus can lead to inaccuracies or hallucinations,\nresulting in incorrect or misleading recommendations. Moreover, directly using\ninformation from the knowledge graph introduces redundant and noisy\ninformation, which can affect the LLM's reasoning process or exceed its input\ncontext length, thereby reducing the performance of LLM-based recommendations.\nTo address the lack of domain-specific knowledge, we propose a novel model\ncalled Knowledge-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Recommendation\n(KERAG_R). Specifically, we leverage a graph retrieval-augmented generation\n(GraphRAG) component to integrate additional information from a knowledge graph\n(KG) into instructions, enabling the LLM to collaboratively exploit\nrecommendation signals from both text-based user interactions and the knowledge\ngraph to better estimate the users' preferences in a recommendation context.

Recent\nadvances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have\nenabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple\nscene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits\ngeneralizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic\nGaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing\ntemporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a\nGroup-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame\nmotions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors\nare compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model\nthat combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate\nestimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion\ncompensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent\nfidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS\ngeneralizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that\nit matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods,\nachieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual\nquality across viewpoints.

For each year shown, military spending is statistically\nsignificant more than the monetary instrument M2. Comparing the currency of the\nsecond world economy, the Chinese renminbi, is well beyond the western FER\nequilibrium, but yearly analysis shows that there is a steady trend towards a\nnew FER balance. Next, we define a complex geopolitical network model in which\nthe probability of switching to an alternative FER currency depends both on\neconomic and political factors.

    "abstract": "We investigate the role of reversible and irreversible thermodynamic\nprocesses in a cosmological context, focusing on their impact on the early and\nlate-time expansion history of the universe. In our framework, gravitationally\ninduced adiabatic matter creation/annihilation are treated as irreversible\nprocesses, while energy exchange between the cosmic bulk and the horizon is\nmodeled as reversible. We propose two thermodynamic interacting scenarios with\nmatter creation/annihilation in which energy flows from matter and radiation\ncomponents to an effective entropic dark energy sector. In both scenarios,\neffective entropic dark energy initially exhibits properties akin to those of\nradiation and matter prior to recombination. Subsequently, it transitions into\na quintessence state, ultimately converging towards the cosmological constant\nin the current epoch. Our models predict Hubble constant values of $H_0 = 71.73\n\\pm 0.79 \\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 71.06 \\pm\n0.79 \\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, which exhibit agreement\nwith the recent 2024 SH0ES measurement of $H_0 = 73.17 \\pm 0.86 \\text{km} \\,\n\\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at levels of $1.2\\sigma$ and $1.8\\sigma$.\nWhen compared to the 2022 SH0ES baseline measurement of $H_0 = 73.04 \\pm 1.04\n\\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, both models demonstrate\nconcordance at $1\\sigma$ and $1.5\\sigma$.

Specifically, DFYP\nintroduces three key components: (1) a Resolution-aware Channel Attention (RCA)\nmodule that enhances spectral representation by adaptively reweighting input\nchannels based on resolution-specific characteristics; (2) an Adaptive Operator\nLearning Network (AOL-Net) that dynamically selects operators for convolutional\nkernels to improve edge-sensitive spatial feature extraction under varying crop\nand temporal conditions; and (3) a dual-branch architecture with a learnable\nfusion mechanism, which jointly models local spatial details and global\ncontextual information to support cross-resolution and cross-crop\ngeneralization. Extensive experiments on multi-year datasets MODIS and\nmulti-crop dataset Sentinel-2 demonstrate that DFYP consistently outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art baselines in RMSE, MAE, and R2 across different\nspatial resolutions, crop types, and time periods, showcasing its effectiveness\nand robustness for real-world agricultural monitoring.",

The AIB spectra observed in\nGalactic PDRs, such as the Orion Bar observations by the PDRs4All JWST program,\nare considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic star-forming\nregions. We present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition tool\nthat separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents, thermal dust emission,\ngas lines, stellar light, and dust extinction. By fitting segments of the Orion\nBar spectra, we provide a configuration to decompose JWST spectra of PDRs in\ndetail. The resulting central wavelengths and FWHM of the AIB subcomponents are\ncompiled into a \"PDR pack\" for PAHFIT.\n  We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the default continuum model to\nspectra of the central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. We introduce an\nalternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar spectra, as the default\nPAHFIT continuum model mismatches the intensity at 15-26 um. Using the PDR pack\nand the alternate continuum model, PAHFIT reproduces the Orion Bar spectra with\nresiduals of a few percent, and similar performance is achieved for the NGC7469\nspectra.\n  We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile variations of the\n3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 um AIBs, and thus the photochemical evolution of\nthe AIB carriers. The 5.7 um AIB emission originates from at least two\nsubpopulations, one more prominent in highly irradiated environments and one\npreferring more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small\ngrains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded environments of the\nmolecular zone in the Orion Bar.

We find that nonlocality of the medium profoundly affects the\ndynamics of Thouless pumping. Thus, we show that broad, low-power fundamental\nsolitons do not exhibit transport, as they excite only a small portion of the\nspectral band, while high-power solitons with broader spectral projections do\ndemonstrate stable quantized transport. The transition point between these two\nprincipally different light propagation regimes strongly depends on the degree\nof nonlocality of the nonlinear response and shifts to larger powers with\nincreasing nonlocality. Notably, even a moderate level of nonlocality is\nsufficient to prevent the breakdown of topological transport at high powers\ncommonly observed in local Kerr media. Beyond fundamental solitons, we also\ndemonstrate that multipole solitons, such as dipole and tripole states can be\npumped stably. This is the first time such complex soliton states have been\nshown to undergo Thouless pumping. While fundamental solitons require only\nexceeding a power threshold, multipoles exhibit stable transport only within a\nfinite power window. This window is broader for dipoles than for tripoles and\nexpands with increasing nonlocality, revealing a trade-off between structural\ncomplexity and stability.",

The first theorem proves that the natural transformation\n$\\Ext^1(f, -)$ vanishes over the category of finitely generated right\n$R$-modules if and only if $\\Tor_1(f, -)$ vanishes over the category of\nfinitely generated left $R$-modules.

To address this gap, we introduce a novel\nChinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records\nannotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the\npredictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk\nstratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation\nframework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme\nassesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and\nICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.\nCrucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate\nhow different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP\nand its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield\ntwo principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP\nrisk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit\nmarked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.\nSecond, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent\ninclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared\nto negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating\npredictive bias in model outputs.

Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by\nanalyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,\ninteract, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work\nthat isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically\nquantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing\nlatent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key\ninnovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis\nwith a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a\nstructured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class\nrelationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model\ntrustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to\na deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in\nthe presence of dataset biases.

First, hyperparameter tuning is often\nimpractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model\nrobustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly\nfrom training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training\nmultiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a\nhigher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any\nindividual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained\nwith diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied\nindividual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems\ndescribed above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the\nresidual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble\ncan be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled\nconcatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This\nis also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and\nto directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.",

A multitude of these researchers employ an array of\ndocument understanding models to generate predictions on distinct subtasks,\nsubsequently integrating their results into a holistic document reconstruction\nformat via heuristic principles. Nevertheless, these multi-stage methodologies\nare hindered by the phenomenon of error propagation, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. Furthermore, contemporary studies utilize generative models to\nextract the logical sequence of plain text, tables and mathematical expressions\nin an end-to-end process. However, this approach is deficient in preserving the\ninformation related to element layouts, which are vital for document\nreconstruction. To surmount these aforementioned limitations, we in this paper\npresent an innovative autoregressive model specifically designed for document\nreconstruction, referred to as Document Reconstruction via End-to-end\nAutoregressive Model (DREAM). DREAM transmutes the text image into a sequence\nof document reconstruction in a comprehensive, end-to-end process,\nencapsulating a broader spectrum of document element information. In addition,\nwe establish a standardized definition of the document reconstruction task, and\nintroduce a novel Document Similarity Metric (DSM) and DocRec1K dataset for\nassessing the performance of the task. Empirical results substantiate that our\nmethodology attains unparalleled performance in the realm of document\nreconstruction.

Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi\nis bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi\nexhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements\n(O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all\nlines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic\nchemical mixing of the inner ejecta at <~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at\nlarger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the\nCO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A\nmolecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star\nexplosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields\na satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The\nSN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in\nthe model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the\nmodel overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the\nmolecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our\nmolecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the\nSN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from\nexplosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of\n56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in\nSN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star\nexplosions.",

In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation\ngraph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual\ninformation, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate\nthat SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set\nscenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.",

However, extracting spectral features and\nassociated characteristic decay or coherence times from limited and noisy\ndatasets remains challenging. Here, we introduce a general, data-driven\nframework based on Dynamical Mode Decomposition (DMD) to analyze system\ndynamics under stochastic noise. We reinterpret DMD modes as statistical\nweights over ensembles of stochastic trajectories, using a nonlinear\ntransformation to construct noise power spectral densities (PSDs). This enables\nthe identification of dominant frequency contributions in both broadband\n(white) and correlated ($1/f$) noise environments, as well as direct extraction\nof intrinsic characteristic decay times from DMD eigenvalues. To overcome\ninstability in standard DMD-based extrapolation, we develop a constrained\nreconstruction method using extracted decay times as physical bounds and the\nlearned PSD as weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach\nthrough simulations of quantum system dynamics subjected to decoherence from\nnoise, validating its robustness and predictive capabilities.

    "abstract": "Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms\n(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.\nSpecifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action\nproposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each\naction, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.\nHowever, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning\n(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is\nnon-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in\ncomplex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual\ntargets.\n  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI\nTest-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate\naction proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we\nsample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to\nevaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better\ndecision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and\nimproving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves\nimproved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its\ncorresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning\n(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,\nrewarding successful clicks on interface elements.\n  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across\ndiverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%\naccuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When\npaired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits\nstate-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on\nOSWorld).

    "abstract": "Recent discoveries show that asteroids spinning in less than a few minutes\nundergo sizeable semi-major-axis drifts, possibly driven by the Yarkovsky\neffect. Analytical formulas can match these drifts only if very low thermal\ninertia is assumed, implying a dust-fine regolith or a highly porous interior\nthat is difficult to retain under such extreme centrifugal forces. With\nanalytical theories of the Yarkovsky effect resting on a set of assumptions,\ntheir applicability to cases of super-fast rotation should be verified. We aim\nto evaluate the validity of the analytical models in such scenarios and to\ndetermine whether the Yarkovsky effect can explain the observed drift in\nrapidly rotating asteroids. We have developed a numerical model of the\nYarkovsky effect tailored to super-fast rotators. The code resolves\nmicrometre-scale thermal waves on millisecond time steps, capturing the steep\ngradients that arise when surface thermal inertia is extremely low. A new 3-D\nheat-conduction and photon-recoil solver is benchmarked against the THERMOBS\nthermophysical code and the analytical solution of the Yarkovsky effect, over a\nrange of rotation periods and thermal conductivities. The analytical Yarkovsky\ndrift agrees well with the numerical solver. For thermal conductivities from\n$0.0001$ to $1$ $\\mathrm{Wm^{-1}K^{-1}}$ and spin periods as short as 10 s, the\ntwo solutions differ by no more than $15\\%$. Applied to the 34-s rapid rotator\n2016 GE1, the best match of the measured drift is obtained with\n$\\Gamma\\lesssim20$ $\\mathrm{Jm^{-2}K^{-1}s^{-1/2}}$, a value that implies\n$\\sim100$ K temperature swings each spin cycle. This confirms that the observed\nsemi-major axis drifts for super-fast rotators can be explained by the\nYarkovsky effect and very low thermal inertia, which might point to rapid\nthermal fatigue as a regolith-generation mechanism.",

    "abstract": "In conventional artificial noise (AN)-aided physical-layer security systems,\nfixed-position antenna (FPA) arrays exhibit inherent vulnerability to coverage\ngaps due to their static spatial configuration. Adversarial eavesdroppers can\nstrategically exploit their mobility to infiltrate these spatial nulls of AN\nradiation patterns, thereby evading interference suppression and successfully\nintercepting the confidential communication. To overcome this limitation, in\nthis paper, we investigate a hybrid antenna deployment framework integrating\nFPA arrays and movable antenna (MA) arrays (denoted by FMA co-design) to\naddress the security performance in dynamic wireless environments, based on the\nfact that MA arrays enable channel reconfiguration through localized antenna\nrepositioning, achieving more higher spatial degree of freedom (DoF). Enabled\nby FMA co-design framework, FPA arrays ensure baseline connectivity for\nlegitimate links while MA arrays function as dynamic security enhancers,\nreplacing conventional static AN generation. Furthermore, we formulate a\nnon-convex optimization problem of the secrecy rate maximization through\njointly optimizing MA positioning, FPA beamforming, and MA beamforming under\npractical constraints. the solution employs a dual-algorithm approach: Nesterov\nmomentum-based projected gradient ascent (NMPGA) accelerates convergence in\ncontinuous position optimization, while alternating optimization (AO) handles\ncoupled beamforming design. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the\nproposed FMA co-design framework achieves significant secrecy performance gains\nover individual optimization benchmarks, yielding 42.34% and 9.12% improvements\nin secrecy rate compared to isolated FPA for AN generation and MA for\nconfidential information baselines, respectively.",

In this\nstudy, we introduce an innovative approach that combines deep learning image\nregistration with physics-informed regularization to predict the biomechanical\nproperties of moving cardiac tissues and extract features for disease\nclassification. We utilize the energy strain formulation of Neo-Hookean\nmaterial to model cardiac tissue deformations, optimizing the deformation field\nwhile ensuring its physical and biomechanical coherence. This explainable\napproach not only improves image registration accuracy, but also provides\ninsights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.\nEvaluation on the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) dataset achieved\nDice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right\nventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the\nlocal strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features\nused for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five\nclassification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support\nVector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the\nmost relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing\nclassifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and\n100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset.

    "abstract": "Quantum state discrimination is a fundamental concept in quantum information\ntheory, which refers to a class of techniques to identify a specific quantum\nstate through a positive operator-valued measure. In this work, we investigate\nhow structural information about either the quantum states or the measurement\noperators can influence our ability to determine or bound the optimal\ndiscrimination probability. First, we observe that for single-qubit states,\npairwise fidelities are sufficient to completely characterize the optimal\ndiscrimination. In contrast, for multi-qubit states, this correspondence breaks\ndown. Motivated by this, we analytically derive the optimal discrimination\nprobability for three equiprobable single-qubit states with equal pairwise\nfidelities in terms of fidelity. Secondly, we consider partial information\nabout the optimal measurement, specifically the measurement operators that\nvanish in the optimal solution. We show that such information can be leveraged\nto tighten existing upper bounds on the optimal discrimination probability.\nLastly, we show that in some cases, subsets and supersets of nonvanishing\noperators can be identified without semidefinite programming.",

While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such\nas current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be\nused to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as topology.\nHere we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by\nutilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation to study\ntime-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken phases. We employ combinations of\nbichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror\n(spatial) and time-reversal symmetry, individually precluding photocurrents,\nbut when combined can break symmetries and generate photocurrents. We show,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, that unique choices of the relative\npolarization angle and two-color phase imposes a forbidden photocurrent\nselection rule in TRS-invariant systems, as the tailored light maintains TRS\nwhile breaking all other spatial symmetries. We then employ state-of-the-art\nab-initio simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially,\npredict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a\nbackground free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for\nprobing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not\nrequiring the application of external magnetic fields or even\ncircularly-polarized electric fields.",

In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous\nstudies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal\nModels (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration\nconfiguration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the\ncontrollability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and\ncost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of\nLMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and\ninternal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image\ncaptioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies\nthrough three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.\nWe employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and\nsummarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention\ncharacteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model\nbehaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of\nattention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare\nperformance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining\nstrategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data\nfeatures. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model\nperformance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns\nthrough internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding\nmultimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis\nto investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be\napplied to broader research areas.",

Direct application\nof segmentation models trained on adult data often yields suboptimal\nperformance, particularly for small or rapidly evolving structures.

Meanwhile, neural\nreconstruction approaches (e.g., NeRF or Gaussian Splatting) rely on dense\nmulti-view or interaction data, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we\nintroduce DreamArt, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity,\ninteractable articulated assets from single-view images. DreamArt employs a\nthree-stage pipeline: firstly, it reconstructs part-segmented and complete 3D\nobject meshes through a combination of image-to-3D generation, mask-prompted 3D\nsegmentation, and part amodal completion. Second, we fine-tune a video\ndiffusion model to capture part-level articulation priors, leveraging movable\npart masks as prompt and amodal images to mitigate ambiguities caused by\nocclusion. Finally, DreamArt optimizes the articulation motion, represented by\na dual quaternion, and conducts global texture refinement and repainting to\nensure coherent, high-quality textures across all parts. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that DreamArt effectively generates high-quality articulated\nobjects, possessing accurate part shape, high appearance fidelity, and\nplausible articulation, thereby providing a scalable solution for articulated\nasset generation.

However, the evolution of wind speed is\ninfluenced by the complex interaction of multiple factors, making it highly\nvariable. The nonlinear and nonstationary nature of wind speed evolution can\nhave a considerable impact on the overall power system. To address this\nchallenge, we propose an integrated multiframe wind speed prediction system\nbased on fuzzy feature extraction. This system employs a convex subset\npartitioning approach using a triangular affiliation function for fuzzy feature\nextraction. By applying soft clustering to the subsets, constructing an\naffiliation matrix, and identifying clustering centers, the system introduces\nthe concepts of inner and boundary domains. It subsequently calculates the\ndistances from data points to the clustering centers by measuring both\ninterclass and intraclass distances. This method updates the cluster centers\nusing the membership matrix, generating optimal feature values. Building on\nthis foundation, we use multiple machine learning methods to input the fuzzy\nfeatures into the prediction model and integrate learning techniques to predict\nfeature values. Because different datasets require different modeling\napproaches, the integrated weight-updating module was used to dynamically\nadjust model weights by setting a dual objective function to ensure the\naccuracy and stability of the prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed\nmodel in terms of prediction performance and generalization ability is\ndemonstrated through an empirical analysis of data from the Penglai wind farm.",

However, the radioactivity of dust\nin the air is about 12 orders of magnitude higher than that, so there is an\nextremely high requirement for the cleanliness of the installation environment\non site. In this study, a clean room management mode was implemented in the\n120,000 m$^3$ space of the JUNO underground experimental main hall, to control\nthe environmental cleanliness at a level equivalent to a class 10,000-100,000\nclean room. Additionally, we designed a method to directly measure the\ndeposition rate of $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th on the surface of the detector. Based\non ICP-MS detection, the sensitivity to $^{238}$U/$^{232}$Th concentrations can\nreach the level of picograms (pg).

Usually transformations among classical reference frames have\nsharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states\nin the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that\nthe distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a\nsemigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be\neither pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in\nparticular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference\nframe and mixed with respect to another.

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nSenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures,\n9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels.\nFor three common household objects (spray, pringles, and tincase), we acquire\n101.9k RGB and 10k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting\npermutations per object pose.

However, the bar's\npattern speed and length are insensitive to these parameters, as the intruder's\nmass is relatively small compared to that of the target galaxy itself.\nMoreover, based on our tests, the intruder mass should be more than $\\sim\n3\\times10^{9}$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ in order for this bar formation mechanism to\noperate effectively in MW/M31-like galaxies. Our work suggests the possibility\nthat satellite collisions may have contributed, to some extent, to the bar\nformation in the Milky Way or M31.",

Herein, we report\na sodium (Na)-mediated surface reduction strategy in molten salts to transform\nTi3C2Clx into electronically tunable Ti3C2. Specifically, Na atoms remove -Cl\nterminations to eliminate electron withdrawal and simultaneously inject\nelectrons into the MXene lattice via a reduction reaction. This dual effect\nsaturates Ti 3d-orbital vacancies while reducing surface coordination sites,\nachieving an increase in carrier concentration to 4.92-fold, an increase in\nmobility to 2.63-fold, and an enhancement in conductivity to 12.96-fold.\nConsequently, the optimized reduced MXene achieves a record photothermal\nconversion efficiency of 92.36% under 808 nm laser irradiation. As a\nproof-of-concept, a photothermal antibacterial woundplast with ultralow MXene\ncontent demonstrates a 91.39% bacterial kill rate.

This pipeline\nuses rigorous statistical methods that are designed to maximize the information\nextracted from the Fermi/GBM detectors. Our approach differs substantially from\nexisting search efforts in several aspects: The pipeline includes the\nconstruction of template banks, Poisson matched filtering, background\nestimation, background misestimation correction, automatic routines to filter\ncontaminants, statistical estimation of the signal location and a quantitative\nestimator of the signal probability to be of a cosmological, terrestrial, or\nsolar origin. Our analysis also includes operating the pipeline on\n\"time-slided\" copies of the data, which allows exact significance assessment\nand $p_{\\text{astro}}$ computation, akin to the state-of-the-art gravitational\nwaves (GW) data analysis pipelines. Depending on the spectral properties of the\nbursts, our pipeline achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement by a\nfactor of 2 to 15 over the onboard GBM triggering algorithm. This enhancement\nincreases the detectable volume for sGRBs and results in an approximate 50%\nincrease in sGRB detections in the 2014 GBM dataset. As a further consequence\nof the sensitivity increase, we detect hundreds of soft gamma-ray flares of\ngalactic origin. This improved sensitivity enhances the chances of detecting\nfainter, off-axis GRBs that would likely fall below the standard triggering\nthresholds. Applying this pipeline to the full GBM archive is expected to\nexpand further the joint sGRB-GW detection volume.",

    "abstract": "Speech intelligibility prediction (SIP) models have been used as objective\nmetrics to assess intelligibility for hearing-impaired (HI) listeners. In the\nClarity Prediction Challenge 2 (CPC2), non-intrusive binaural SIP models based\non transformers showed high prediction accuracy. However, the self-attention\nmechanism theoretically incurs high computational and memory costs, making it a\nbottleneck for low-latency, power-efficient devices. This may also degrade the\ntemporal processing of binaural SIPs. Therefore, we propose Mamba-based SIP\nmodels instead of transformers for the temporal processing blocks. Experimental\nresults show that our proposed SIP model achieves competitive performance\ncompared to the baseline while maintaining a relatively small number of\nparameters.

    "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet\nprior benchmarks have largely focused on assessing the acoustic robustness of\nASR models, leaving evaluations of their linguistic capabilities relatively\nunderexplored. This largely stems from the limited parameter sizes and training\ncorpora of conventional ASR models, leaving them with insufficient world\nknowledge, which is crucial for accurately recognizing named entities across\ndiverse domains. For instance, drug and treatment names in medicine or\nspecialized technical terms in engineering. Recent breakthroughs in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs)\nhave markedly enhanced the visibility of advanced context modeling and general\nartificial intelligence capabilities. Leveraging LLMs, we envision a unified\nsystem capable of robust speech recognition across diverse real-world domains,\nyet existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating this objective. To\naddress this gap, we propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale\nbenchmark designed to assess the linguistic competence of ASR systems using\ncorpora that feature numerous named entities across multiple domains. It\nencompasses up to 40,000 data entries with more than 300,000 named entities\nacross over 10 domains. Beyond the audio and its transcription, each sample\nprovides the domain it belongs to and a list of named entities it contains,\nwhich are referred to as the context. Based on this, we introduce three\nevaluation modes to assess how effectively models can exploit such context to\nimprove ASR accuracy. Extensive evaluation on ContextASR-Bench highlights that\nLALMs outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin thanks to the strong\nworld knowledge and context modeling of LLMs, yet there remains ample room for\nfurther improvement.

The\nmultiple-scattering FTH-MS method is based on a partition of the domain\nboundary into a user-prescribed set of overlapping open arcs, along with a\ncorresponding sequence of multiple-scattering problems that effectively\ndecompose the interior problem into a series of open-arc wave equation\nsubproblems. The new strategy provides a significant extension of the original\nFTH-MS algorithm originally presented in [22], in that (1) By allowing for use\nof an arbitrary of number of component arcs, and not just two as in the\nprevious contribution, the new approach affords (1a) A significantly increased\ngeometric flexibility, as well as, (1b) The use of partitions for which each\nopen arc leads to small numbers of iterations if iterative linear-algebra\nsolvers are employed; and, (2) It facilitates parallelization -- as the\nsubproblem solutions that are needed at each multiple scattering step can be\nevaluated in an embarrassingly parallel fashion. Utilizing a\nsuitably-implemented Fourier transformation, each sub-problem is reduced to a\nHelmholtz frequency-domain problem that is tackled via a uniquely-solvable\nboundary integral equation. Similar FTH-MS methods are also presented for\nproblems exterior to a number of bounded obstacles. All of the algorithms\nconsidered incorporate the previously introduced ``time-windowing and\nrecentering'' methodology (that enables both treatment of incident signals of\nlong duration and long time simulation), as well as a high-frequency Fourier\ntransform algorithm that delivers numerically dispersionless,\nspectrally-accurate time evolution for arbitrarily long times.",

This study\ncompares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a\nreasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.\n  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI\n(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The\nanonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human\nexperts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical\nrubric.\n  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored\npeer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;\np=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th\n(mean 6.97).

    "abstract": "Most existing multimodal collaborative filtering recommendation (MCFRec)\nmethods rely heavily on ID features and multimodal content to enhance\nrecommendation performance. However, this paper reveals that ID features are\neffective but have limited benefits in multimodal collaborative filtering\nrecommendation. Therefore, this paper systematically deconstruct the pros and\ncons of ID features: (i) they provide initial embedding but lack semantic\nrichness, (ii) they provide a unique identifier for each user and item but\nhinder generalization to untrained data, and (iii) they assist in aligning and\nfusing multimodal features but may lead to representation shift. Based on these\ninsights, this paper proposes IDFREE, an ID-free multimodal collaborative\nFiltering REcommEndation baseline. IDFREE replaces ID features with multimodal\nfeatures and positional encodings to generate semantically meaningful ID-free\nembeddings. For ID-free multimodal collaborative filtering, it further proposes\nan adaptive similarity graph module to construct dynamic user-user and\nitem-item graphs based on multimodal features. Then, an augmented user-item\ngraph encoder is proposed to construct more effective user and item encoding.\nFinally, IDFREE achieves inter-multimodal alignment based on the contrastive\nlearning and uses Softmax loss as recommendation loss. Basic experiments on\nthree public datasets demonstrate that IDFREE outperforms existing ID-based\nMCFRec methods, achieving an average performance gain of 72.24% across standard\nmetrics (Recall@5, 10, 20, 50 and NDCG@5, 10, 20, 50). Exploratory and extended\nexperiments further validate our findings on the limitations of ID features in\nMCFRec. The code is released at https://github.com/G-H-Li/IDFREE.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for\naddressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time\ninformation and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily\nrely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model\nitself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG\ngeneration model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document\nquality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that\nfine-tune RAG generative models often \\textit{lack a granular focus on RAG\ntask} or \\textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To\naddress this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively\nhierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant\ninformation; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information\nacross paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further\nprocess external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new\nRAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a \"think before answering\"\nstrategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by\nutilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought.

Yet, such a property is typically precluded in quantum\nsystems owing to the presence of energy eigenstates, which are stationary\nstates in dynamics. However, recent theoretical works have argued that ergodic\nexplorations of the Hilbert space, occurring at varying levels as measured by\nstatistical pseudorandomness of the time-evolved quantum states, may be\nexhibited for quantum systems driven by Hamiltonians with aperiodic time\ndependencies, which do not face such obstacles. Here, we experimentally\ninvestigate the hierarchy of Hilbert-space ergodicities (HSE) achievable in the\ndynamics of a single quantum spin realized by a solid-state defect in diamond,\nupon subjecting it to various time-dependent modulations. Through continuous\nmonitoring of spin trajectories with full state tomography, different degrees\nof HSE were observed, ranging from no HSE in a time-periodic (Floquet) drive,\nto partial HSE in a smoothly kicked time-quasiperiodic drive, to complete HSE\nin a drive composed of a sequence of kicks generated by the Fibonacci word. We\nformulate a theoretical understanding of the increasing levels of HSE observed\nby attributing them to increasing levels of complexities associated with the\ndrive sequences, whose notions we elucidate. Our work constitutes the first\nunambiguous experimental evidence of Hilbert space ergodicity and promotes\ndeeper investigations into the mechanisms and fine-grained levels with which\nclosed quantum systems reach equilibrium.",

Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising technique to\nachieve efficient utilization of communication resource for model aggregation\nby leveraging the superposition property of a wireless multiple access channel\n(MAC). However, AirComp requires strict synchronization among edge devices,\nwhich is hard to achieve in heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nan AirComp-based grouping asynchronous federated learning mechanism\n(Air-FedGA), which combines the advantages of AirComp and asynchronous FL to\naddress the communication and heterogeneity challenges. Specifically, Air-FedGA\norganizes workers into groups and performs over-the-air aggregation within each\ngroup, while groups asynchronously communicate with the parameter server to\nupdate the global model. In this way, Air-FedGA accelerates the FL model\ntraining by over-the-air aggregation, while relaxing the synchronization\nrequirement of this aggregation technology. We theoretically prove the\nconvergence of Air-FedGA. We formulate a training time minimization problem for\nAir-FedGA and propose the power control and worker grouping algorithm to solve\nit, which jointly optimizes the power scaling factors at edge devices, the\ndenoising factors at the parameter server, as well as the worker grouping\nstrategy.

Precise transducer positioning was critical; a 10\nmm vertical shift resulted in a reduction of target intensity by approximately\n7-fold. The vertebral level also substantially influenced the sonication\noutcomes, with the thoracic spine achieving 6-fold higher intensity than the\ncervical level. Sonication through the vertebral lamina resulted in\napproximately 2.5-fold higher intraspinal intensity in the cervical spine.\nConclusion and Significance: This study presents the first systematic,\nanatomically realistic computational model for the feasibility of tsFUS in\nhumans. Quantifying the trade-offs between acoustic path, vertebral level, and\ntransducer geometry offers foundational design and procedural guidelines for\nthe design and safety of spinal FUS protocols, supporting future studies of\ntrans-spinal FUS in humans.",

    "abstract": "Detecting outliers in Functional Data Analysis is challenging because curves\ncan stray from the majority in many different ways. The Modified Epigraph Index\n(MEI) and Modified Hypograph Index (MHI) rank functions by the fraction of the\ndomain on which one curve lies above or below another. While effective for\nspotting shape anomalies, their construction limits their ability to flag\nmagnitude outliers. This paper introduces two new metrics, the Area-Based\nEpigraph Index (ABEI) and Area-Based Hypograph Index (ABHI) that quantify the\narea between curves, enabling simultaneous sensitivity to both magnitude and\nshape deviations. Building on these indices, we present EHyOut, a robust\nprocedure that recasts functional outlier detection as a multivariate problem:\nfor every curve, and for its first and second derivatives, we compute ABEI and\nABHI and then apply multivariate outlier-detection techniques to the resulting\nfeature vectors. Extensive simulations show that EHyOut remains stable across a\nwide range of contamination settings and often outperforms established\nbenchmark methods. Moreover, applications to Spanish weather data and United\nNations world population data further illustrate the practical utility and\nmeaningfulness of this methodology.",

Today, in the era of the second quantum revolution,\nalthough the thermal processes in constant temperatures are relatively well\nunderstood in the language of resource theories, a framework to describe\nthermal engines is still in its infancy. In this work we formalize the resource\ntheory of engines, initially put forward in [Quantum 8, 1222], and define such\nquantities as engine efficiency. Then, we turn to a detailed study of thermal\nengines based on free operations arising from the resource theory of\nathermality under different restrictions: thermal operation, semilocal thermal\noperations and local thermal operation with classical communication. In order\nto provide analytic lower bounds for thermal engine operation we construct\ntree-states -- free states, which can be obtained from Gibbs state in simple\nprotocol consisting solely of two-level operations.

    "abstract": "Spacecraft pose estimation is crucial for autonomous in-space operations,\nsuch as rendezvous, docking and on-orbit servicing. Vision-based pose\nestimation methods, which typically employ RGB imaging sensors, is a compelling\nsolution for spacecraft pose estimation, but are challenged by harsh lighting\nconditions, which produce imaging artifacts such as glare, over-exposure,\nblooming and lens flare. Due to their much higher dynamic range, neuromorphic\nor event sensors are more resilient to extreme lighting conditions. However,\nevent sensors generally have lower spatial resolution and suffer from reduced\nsignal-to-noise ratio during periods of low relative motion. This work\naddresses these individual sensor limitations by introducing a sensor fusion\napproach combining RGB and event sensors. A beam-splitter prism was employed to\nachieve precise optical and temporal alignment. Then, a RANSAC-based technique\nwas developed to fuse the information from the RGB and event channels to\nachieve pose estimation that leveraged the strengths of the two modalities. The\npipeline was complemented by dropout uncertainty estimation to detect extreme\nconditions that affect either channel. To benchmark the performance of the\nproposed event-RGB fusion method, we collected a comprehensive real dataset of\nRGB and event data for satellite pose estimation in a laboratory setting under\na variety of challenging illumination conditions. Encouraging results on the\ndataset demonstrate the efficacy of our event-RGB fusion approach and further\nsupports the usage of event sensors for spacecraft pose estimation.

In particular, in the past 40\nyears, various algebraic tools have been developed to prove lower bounds on the\nweak saturation number $\\mathrm{wsat}(G,F)$. Our paper uncovers a new\nconnection of weak saturation to topology of clique complexes, that allows to\nprove tight lower bounds in some cases when the algebraic tools are not\nefficient.\n  It is easy to see that the smallest $K_3$-saturating graphs in $K_n$ are\ntrees, thus $\\mathrm{wsat}(K_n,K_3)=n-1$.

    "abstract": "Diffusion policies have become increasingly popular in robot learning due to\ntheir reliable convergence in motion generation tasks. At a high level, these\npolicies learn to transform noisy action trajectories into effective ones,\nconditioned on observations. However, each time such a model is trained in a\nrobotics context, the network must relearn fundamental spatial representations\nand operations, such as translations and rotations, from scratch in order to\nground itself and operate effectively in a 3D environment. Incorporating\ngeometric inductive biases directly into the network can alleviate this\nredundancy and substantially improve training efficiency. In this paper, we\nintroduce hPGA-DP, a diffusion policy approach that integrates a mathematical\nframework called Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) to embed strong geometric\ninductive biases. PGA is particularly well-suited for this purpose as it\nprovides a unified algebraic framework that naturally encodes geometric\nprimitives, such as points, directions, and rotations, enabling neural networks\nto reason about spatial structure through interpretable and composable\noperations. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion policy architecture that\nincorporates the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr), leveraging\nits E(3)-equivariant properties established in prior work. Our approach adopts\na hybrid architecture strategy, using P-GATr as both a state encoder and action\ndecoder, while employing U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the denoising\nprocess. Several experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and\nreal-world environments demonstrate that hPGA-DP not only improves task\nperformance and training efficiency through the geometric bias of P-GATr, but\nalso achieves substantially faster convergence through its hybrid model\ncompared to architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.",

Consistency distillation has recently emerged as a promising\nalternative by distilling a one-step consistency model from a multi-step\ndiffusion-based teacher model. However, distilled consistency models are\ninherently biased towards the sampling trajectory of the teacher model, making\nthem less robust to noise and prone to inheriting inaccuracies from the teacher\nmodel. To address this limitation, we propose ROSE-CD: Robust One-step Speech\nEnhancement via Consistency Distillation, a novel approach for distilling a\none-step consistency model. Specifically, we introduce a randomized learning\ntrajectory to improve the model's robustness to noise. Furthermore, we jointly\noptimize the one-step model with two time-domain auxiliary losses, enabling it\nto recover from teacher-induced errors and surpass the teacher model in overall\nperformance. This is the first pure one-step consistency distillation model for\ndiffusion-based speech enhancement, achieving 54 times faster inference speed\nand superior performance compared to its 30-step teacher model. Experiments on\nthe VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in terms of speech quality.

Experiments across five evaluation channels of\nTritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves\nperformance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet\nand DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial\nrole of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,\nand the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for\nautomatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance\nkernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an\nimportant foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code\nwill be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.",

The Polarization-modUlated Laser Satellite\nExperiment (PULSE-A) is a University of Chicago mission to demonstrate optical\ndownlink at a data rate of up to 10 Mbps using circular polarization shift\nkeying (CPolSK). PULSE-A comprises a <1.5U Optical Transmission Terminal, 3U\nCubeSat Bus, Optical Ground Station (OGS) employing an amateur telescope, and\nRF Ground Station (RFGS), all of which are being designed and integrated by a\nteam of over 60 undergraduate students.

Derived from the Zwanzig projection operator formalism, our\napproach introduces a spatiotemporal kernel function of heat conduction, which\ngoverns the spatiotemporal response of the local heat flux in nonuniform media\nto surrounding temperature gradients while incorporating temporal memory\neffects. Our statistical analysis shows that memory, nonlocality, and\ninterfacial temperature discontinuities emerge naturally from the microscopic\ncoupling between two classes of irrelevant degrees of freedom: flux mode and\nnonlocal mode variables. Although these irrelevant variables are not directly\nobservable at the macroscopic level, their integrated influence on the heat\nflux is fully encoded in the kernel function. In the diffusive limit, the\nkernel recovers and generalizes Fourier law by replacing the thermal\nconductivity with an infinite hierarchy of position dependent higher order\ntensors that capture nanoscale nonlocality. We also outline atomistic\nstrategies for computing the spatiotemporal kernel in various classes of\nmaterial media, enabling predictive modeling of heat transport in structurally\ncomplex and compositionally inhomogeneous systems. These include\nnanostructured, anisotropic, and interfacial materials where classical local\nmodels break down. Finally, the kernel function formalism is extensible to\nelectronic, spin, or magnetic systems, providing a broadly applicable platform\nfor next generation transport theory at ultrafast and nanoscale regimes.",

Although\nvanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can learn specific spatial or temporal\nmovement to driven VDMs with constrained data, achieving precise control over\nboth camera trajectories and object motion remains challenging due to the\nunstable fusion and non-linear scalability. To address these issues, we propose\nLiON-LoRA, a novel framework that rethinks LoRA fusion through three core\nprinciples: Linear scalability, Orthogonality, and Norm consistency. First, we\nanalyze the orthogonality of LoRA features in shallow VDM layers, enabling\ndecoupled low-level controllability. Second, norm consistency is enforced\nacross layers to stabilize fusion during complex camera motion combinations.\nThird, a controllable token is integrated into the diffusion transformer (DiT)\nto linearly adjust motion amplitudes for both cameras and objects with a\nmodified self-attention mechanism to ensure decoupled control. Additionally, we\nextend LiON-LoRA to temporal generation by leveraging static-camera videos,\nunifying spatial and temporal controllability. Experiments demonstrate that\nLiON-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in trajectory control accuracy\nand motion strength adjustment, achieving superior generalization with minimal\ntraining data.

    "abstract": "Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User\nInterfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by\nadvances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI\nautomation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse\nplatforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large\nand cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant\ninformation that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches\ntypically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives,\nwhich fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established\nobject detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these\nissues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages\nzoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an\nIoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU\npredictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object\ndetection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13%\nacross diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and\nAgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy\nimprovements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "In calculations on quantum state-resolved dynamics of a chemical reaction,\nreactants are usually prepared in separated eigenstates of individual\nfragments, and their direct-product is then evolved in time. In this work, we\nfocus on the essence in separating them and the Berry phase effects of the\nnuclear wave function. By the present theory, mechanism of inter/intramolecular\nenergy redistribution is also proposed to deeply understand reactive dynamics\nwith multirovibrational states. To demonstrate the phase transition of the\nnuclear wave function, two three-dimensional (3D) models reductively describing\nthe molecular reaction are developed to simulate transport of the system along\na closed path in a parameter space represented of inter/intramolecular energy\ntransfers. Employing these 3D models, extensive multiconfigurational\ntime-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) calculations are performed to solve the\ntime-dependent nuclear Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation at various initial conditions.\nMoreover, 98D multilayer MCTDH (ML-MCTDH) calculations are launched to\ndemonstrate the transition of Berry phase. These calculations clearly indicate\nthat the wave function can change sign allowing quantum interference in the\nparameter space. Discussions on the separation of the reactants are made, while\nperspectives on the Berry phase effects predicted by the present work are given\nfrom the viewpoint of differential geometry. As a conclusion remark, the Berry\nphase effects on molecular dynamics are also thoroughly compared with those on\nelectronic properties (see, for example, {\\it Rev. Mod.

Despite the\nimportance of differentiating between damaged and deformed tissue, existing\nlesion segmentation methods overlook this distinction, labeling both of them as\na single anomaly. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model-based framework\nfor analyzing and reversing the brain lesion process.

Finally, we inpaint the\ncore lesion area to arrive at an estimation of the pre-lesion healthy brain.\nThis proposed framework reverses a forward lesion growth process model that is\nwell-established in biomechanical studies that model brain lesions. Our results\ndemonstrate improved accuracy in lesion segmentation, characterization, and\nbrain labeling compared to traditional methods, offering a robust tool for\nclinical and research applications in brain lesion analysis.

Existing prompt-based and adapter-based\nworks have made significant progress in fine-tuning VLMs but still face the\nchallenges of maintaining strong generalization abilities, particularly towards\nunseen new classes. This limitation partly arises from these methods treating\nall tokens of the image and text encoder equally, which can lead to overfitting\non less informative features (e.g., background noise, template words) and\ndegrade the general representations that are crucial for novel concept\nrecognition. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Rank Adaptation (DRA), a\nnovel adapter variant method, designed specifically to enhance new class\ngeneralization. DRA dynamically allocates adaptation ranks based on the\nimportance of features during training to preserve general knowledge. DRA first\nemploys token importance grouping, using sequence attention to evaluate and\ngroup tokens by their importance. Then, we adopt rank adaptation according to\nthe importance of each token group dynamically by assigning higher feature\nranks to the more important tokens. Also, we design a new channel response\nmechanism to prioritize the preservation and adaptation of feature channels\nidentified as the most informative for each instance. In addition, a L1\nregularization term is introduced to stabilize the training.

    "abstract": "The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is a convection-allowing model\nused in operational weather forecasting across the contiguous United States\n(CONUS). To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce\nHRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning\ntechniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)\nand a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional\nneural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise\nLinear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising\nDiffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a\nsingle model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy\nrollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity\nover the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR\noutperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves\ncompetitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the\nStormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,\nb) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on\nanalysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in\nStormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling\ndownscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and\nobject-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and\nhigher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain\nsharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.\nWhile GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for\nfuture graph-based forecasting. HRRRCast represents a step toward efficient,\ndata-driven regional weather prediction with competitive accuracy and ensemble\ncapability.",

A leading approach is the Neural Feature Ansatz (NFA)\n(Radhakrishnan et al. 2024), a conjectured mechanism for how feature learning\noccurs. Although the NFA is empirically validated, it is an educated guess and\nlacks a theoretical basis, and thus it is unclear when it might fail, and how\nto improve it. In this paper, we take a first-principles approach to\nunderstanding why this observation holds, and when it does not. We use\nfirst-order optimality conditions to derive the Features at Convergence Theorem\n(FACT), an alternative to the NFA that (a) obtains greater agreement with\nlearned features at convergence, (b) explains why the NFA holds in most\nsettings, and (c) captures essential feature learning phenomena in neural\nnetworks such as grokking behavior in modular arithmetic and phase transitions\nin learning sparse parities, similarly to the NFA. Thus, our results unify\ntheoretical first-order optimality analyses of neural networks with the\nempirically-driven NFA literature, and provide a principled alternative that\nprovably and empirically holds at convergence.",

However, due to\nprivacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human\nmobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large\nscale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing.\nHowever, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of\ntrajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and\ngenerate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose\nCardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory\nsynthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility\ngeneration. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff\ndecomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road\nsegment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level,\nto reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first\nencode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and\ndesign a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level\ntrajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions,\nwe then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a\nnoise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation.\nAdditionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates\nhigh-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables\na tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility.

For an $N\\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields\nan approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These\ntypes of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for\napproximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev\npolynomial or Taylor expansions.\n  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional\nprobability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph\nsignal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a\nvery efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an\n$N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential\ncompression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the\noutput of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the\ncircuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based\napproach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets\nlisted in TUDataset library.

Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but\ninadequately capture the complexities of online interactions.

Large language\nmodels (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for\nsimulating psychological aspects of information spread.

Initial experiments, however, revealed significant\ngaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially\nin stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through\nSocial Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in\ngoal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional\nprocessing in standard LLM training.

This method improves the interpretation of\nsocial cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental\nresults confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process\nsocial information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to\nreal human interactions.

    "abstract": "Although native speech and music envelope following responses (EFRs) play a\ncrucial role in auditory processing and cognition, their frequency profile,\nsuch as the dominating frequency and spectral coherence, is largely unknown. We\nhave assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of\nspeech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes\n- is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG\nresponses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the\ntransfer function of this system through two analytical techniques -\ntime-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency\ndomain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest\nthat alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands\nare the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant\nfrequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception,\nmaintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The\ncross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the\nhuman brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all\nchannel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these\nfrequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural\nprocesses are also dominant in native speech and music perception.",

It\nenables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a\nmodification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding\nthe considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its\nnascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and\nnoisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation,\nand 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is\noverlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two\nlimitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which\nconsists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping.\nIt is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide\nthe extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact\nof noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus\nrevision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the\ntext to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby\nenhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features.\nThe aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus\nshiFt reviSion nETwork (\\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four\nbenchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method.

    "abstract": "As a promising privacy-aware collaborative model training paradigm, Federated\nLearning (FL) is becoming popular in the design of distributed recommender\nsystems. However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from\ntwo major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive\nitem embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low\ntraining efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network\nenvironments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ\nvarious compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the\nparameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from\nmodel performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems,\nthis paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS,\nwhich adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item\nembedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication\nrather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud\nserver can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since\ngradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining\nthe directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors\ncompared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space.\nTo accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS\nincorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the\nnumber of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate\nthat FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%,\nwhile not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous\nscenarios.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this\nprocess by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness\nof LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be\nestablished. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two\ncollege-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students.

Inspired by recent\nprobabilistic rendering approaches, we introduce BayesSDF, a novel\nprobabilistic framework for uncertainty estimation in neural implicit 3D\nrepresentations. Unlike radiance-based models such as Neural Radiance Fields\n(NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) provide\ncontinuous, differentiable surface representations, making them especially\nwell-suited for uncertainty-aware modeling. BayesSDF applies a Laplace\napproximation over SDF weights and derives Hessian-based metrics to estimate\nlocal geometric instability. We empirically demonstrate that these uncertainty\nestimates correlate strongly with surface reconstruction error across both\nsynthetic and real-world benchmarks. By enabling surface-aware uncertainty\nquantification, BayesSDF lays the groundwork for more robust, interpretable,\nand actionable 3D perception systems.",

    "abstract": "The widespread application of Deep Learning across diverse domains hinges\ncritically on the quality and composition of training datasets. However, the\ncommon lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and\ncopyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a\nspecific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising\nsolutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed\nvarious auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial\nattacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a\ncomprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial\nperspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing\nmethods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the\ndata) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).\nSubsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed\nto conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely\nimplicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods\nand attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:\ndecoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based\nmethods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new\nbenchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9\nrepresentative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal\nthat none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or\ndistinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent\nneed for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable\nof withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation.

It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images\nfrom head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations\nin infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full\nobservations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on\nanalysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer\nfrom imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their\npersonalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)\nfor the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale\ndatasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In\nthis work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),\nthat leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,\nto directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning\navatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly\ndisentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and\nviewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.\nFurthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the\nreliance on the paired captures.

However, in tasks such\nas text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective\ndomain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of\ninput pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the\narchitectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by\nreinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder\ngenerates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output\nspace. During training, the encoder produces representations and their\nsimilarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the\nteacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.\nThe MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and\nadaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative\nsamples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing\nthe LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and\nhealthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its\neffectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.",

    "abstract": "Smart glasses are increasingly positioned as the next-generation interface\nfor ubiquitous access to large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, achieving\nreliable interaction in real-world noisy environments remains a major\nchallenge, particularly due to interference from side speech. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel side-talk rejection multi-microphone Whisper (MMW) framework\nfor smart glasses, incorporating three key innovations. First, we propose a Mix\nBlock based on a Tri-Mamba architecture to effectively fuse multi-channel audio\nat the raw waveform level, while maintaining compatibility with streaming\nprocessing. Second, we design a Frame Diarization Mamba Layer to enhance\nframe-level side-talk suppression, facilitating more efficient fine-tuning of\nWhisper models. Third, we employ a Multi-Scale Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) strategy to jointly optimize frame-level and\nutterance-level side speech suppression.

Unlike traditional robot systems based\non predefined scripts, or modern approaches relying on pretrained networks and\nlarge-scale demonstration data, Auto-RubikAI enables interpretable, multi-step\ntask execution with minimal data requirements and no prior demonstrations. The\nproposed system employs a KB module to solve group-theoretic restoration steps,\novercoming LLMs' limitations in symbolic reasoning. A VLM parses RGB-D input to\nconstruct a semantic 3D scene representation, while the LLM generates\nstructured robotic control code via prompt chaining. This tri-module\narchitecture enables robust performance under spatial uncertainty. We deploy\nAuto-RubikAI in both simulation and real-world settings using a 7-DOF robotic\narm, demonstrating effective Sim-to-Real adaptation without retraining.\nExperiments show a 79% end-to-end task success rate across randomized\nconfigurations.

We study\nboth static and dynamic assortment optimization under the multinomial logit\n(MNL) model with this fairness constraint. In the static setting, the seller\nselects a distribution over assortments that satisfies the market share\nbalancing constraint while maximizing expected revenue. We show that this\nproblem can be solved in polynomial time, and we characterize the structure of\nthe optimal solution: a product is included if and only if its revenue and\npreference weight exceed certain thresholds. We further extend our analysis to\nsettings with additional feasibility constraints on the assortment and\ndemonstrate that, given a $\\beta$-approximation oracle for the constrained\nproblem, we can construct a $\\beta$-approximation algorithm under the fairness\nconstraint. In the dynamic setting, each product has a finite initial\ninventory, and the seller implements a dynamic policy to maximize total\nexpected revenue while respecting both inventory limits and the market share\nbalancing constraint in expectation.

This contrasts with\nHirai et al.'s recent argument that the rocket effect was important for\nexplaining the eccentricity distribution of wide neutron star binaries found by\nGaia. Our detailed analysis confirms that for a broad range of initial\nconditions and natal kick distributions, the rocket velocities of $v_r \\gtrsim\n30\\, \\mathrm{km/s}$ are required to account for the observed eccentricities.\nHowever, we find that in scenarios where the common envelope phase does not\nsignificantly shrink the initial orbit, and the natal kicks are drawn from\nPaczynski-type distribution, these eccentricities may arise without the\ninfluence of an EM rocket. If the natal kicks are perpendicular to the initial\norbits, then explaining the Gaia neutron star eccentricities without invoking\nrockets additionally requires that the pre-supernova binaries avoid significant\ncircularization, and that the mass loss during the supernova is minimal.\n  The rocket effect can only be substantial in \"weak\" pulsars, where pair\nproduction near the light cylinder is suppressed and ${\\bf E}\\cdot{\\bf B} \\neq\n0$ in the outer magnetosphere. We derive a rough estimate for a rocket force in\na weak pulsar and relate it to the pulsar's radiative efficiency; simulations\nare needed to obtain numerically reliable expressions.

With\nthe rise of GenAI methods, an endless supply of high-quality graphic designs in\npixel format has become more accessible, though these designs often lack\neditability. Despite this, non-layered designs still inspire human designers,\ninfluencing their choices in layouts and text styles, ultimately guiding the\ncreation of layered designs.

Distinct from existing bottom-up methods\n(e.g., COLE and Open-COLE) that gradually generate elements to create layered\ndesigns, our approach works in a top-down manner by using the visually\nharmonious reference image as global guidance to decompose each layer.\nAdditionally, it leverages multiple vision experts such as SAM and element\nremoval models to facilitate the creation of graphic layers. We train our\nmethod using the in-house graphic design dataset Design39K, augmented with\nAI-generated design images coupled with refined ground truth created by a\ncustomized inpainting model.

    "abstract": "Motion models (i.e., transition probability densities) are often deduced from\nfluorescence widefield tracking experiments by analyzing single-particle\ntrajectories post-processed from data. This analysis immediately raises the\nquestion: To what degree is our ability to learn motion models impacted by\nanalyzing post-processed trajectories versus raw measurements? To answer this\nquestion, we mathematically formulate a data likelihood for diffraction-limited\nfluorescence widefield tracking experiments. In particular, we make the\nlikelihood's dependence on the motion model versus the emission (or\nmeasurement) model explicit. The emission model describes how photons emitted\nby biomolecules are distributed in space according to the optical point spread\nfunction, with intensities subsequently integrated over a pixel, and convoluted\nwith camera noise. Logic dictates that if the likelihood is primarily informed\nby the motion model, it should be straightforward to learn the motion model\nfrom the post-processed trajectory. Contrarily, if the majority of the\nlikelihood is dominated by the emission model, the post-processed trajectory\ninferred from data is primarily informed by the emission model, and very little\ninformation on the motion model permeates into the post-processed trajectories\nanalyzed downstream to learn motion models. Indeed, we find that for typical\ndiffraction-limited fluorescence experiments, the emission model often robustly\ncontributes approximately 99% to the likelihood, leaving motion models to\nexplain a meager 1% of the data. This result immediately casts doubt on our\nability to reliably learn motion models from post-processed data, raising\nfurther questions on the significance of motion models learned thus far from\npost-processed single-particle trajectories from single-molecule widefield\nfluorescence tracking experiments.",

One of the most effective\napproaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.\nHowever, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a\nsingle generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have\nbeen introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision\niterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a\nresource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage\nhigh-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation\ncapabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a\ndegradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed\nto enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of\nthe generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user\ninstructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,\nand applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by\nselective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving\nimprovements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,\nenabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative\nrefinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves\ninstruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data\ngenerated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of\ndata while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the\nnon-revised initial responses.

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations for video have been recognized as a novel and\npromising form of video representation. Existing works pay more attention to\nimproving video reconstruction quality but little attention to the decoding\nspeed. However, the high computation of convolutional network used in existing\nmethods leads to low decoding speed. Moreover, these convolution-based video\nrepresentation methods also suffer from long training time, about 14 seconds\nper frame to achieve 35+ PSNR on Bunny. To solve the above problems, we propose\nGSVR, a novel 2D Gaussian-based video representation, which achieves 800+ FPS\nand 35+ PSNR on Bunny, only needing a training time of $2$ seconds per frame.\nSpecifically, we propose a hybrid deformation field to model the dynamics of\nthe video, which combines two motion patterns, namely the tri-plane motion and\nthe polynomial motion, to deal with the coupling of camera motion and object\nmotion in the video. Furthermore, we propose a Dynamic-aware Time Slicing\nstrategy to adaptively divide the video into multiple groups of pictures(GOP)\nbased on the dynamic level of the video in order to handle large camera motion\nand non-rigid movements. Finally, we propose quantization-aware fine-tuning to\navoid performance reduction after quantization and utilize image codecs to\ncompress Gaussians to achieve a compact representation. Experiments on the\nBunny and UVG datasets confirm that our method converges much faster than\nexisting methods and also has 10x faster decoding speed compared to other\nmethods. Our method has comparable performance in the video interpolation task\nto SOTA and attains better video compression performance than NeRV.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a computational framework for studying reaction dynamics\nvia wavepacket propagation, employing the multiconfiguration time-dependent\nHartree (MCTDH) method and its multilayer extension (ML-MCTDH) as the core\nmethodologies. The core idea centers on the concept of modes that combine\nseveral coordinates along with their hierarchical separations because the\ndegrees of freedom are too numerous to be efficiently treated as a single mode.\nFirst, the system is partitioned into several fragments within the same layer,\nand these fragments are further decomposed. Repeating this process, a\nhierarchical separation of modes emerges, until modes of a manageable size are\nachieved. Accordingly, the coordinates frame can be designed hierarchically.\nSecond, the kinetic energy operator (KEO) is derived as a sum-of-products (SOP)\nof single-particle differential operators through polyspherical approach, while\nthe potential energy surface (PES) is expressed in a similar SOP form of\nsingle-particle potentials (SPPs) through (1) reconstruction approaches using\nan existing PES or (2) direct approaches based on a computed database. Third,\nthe nuclear wave function is expressed in a multi-layer expansion form, where\neach term is a product of single-particle functions (SPFs) that are further\nexpanded by the SPFs in deeper layer. This expansion form is also adopted by\nvariational eigensolver for electronic wave function. Finally, the\nDirac-Frenkel variational principle leads to a set of working equations whose\nsolutions reproduce reaction dynamics. In addition, the hierarchical framework\ncan be rearranged by the mathematical language of tensor network (TN) or tree\ntensor network (TTN). In this work, we compare the methods represented by\nfunction with those in the form of TN or TTN. We also discuss the limitations\nof the present framework and propose solutions, providing further perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from\ninterview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies\noften lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting\ntheir adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a\npossible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of\nprocessing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor\ndiagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal\ninformation inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR\nintegrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).\nSpecifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and\ncorresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for\ndomain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust\ntraining dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures\ndepression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's\nability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression\ndiagnosis.

Despite their low surface\nbrightness, which makes disentangling the true structure from the MW\noverwhelmingly difficult, the increasing availability of multi-dimensional data\nsets has allowed for new detections of extended GC structure. This work\nutilises the Pristine-Gaia-Synthetic catalogue released as part of the Pristine\nSurveys first data release to search for tidally stripped stars in the\nperipheries of MW GCs. Pristine provides photometric [Fe/H] measurements based\non CaHK-band photometry. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, we\nprovided lists of extra-tidal stars for 30 GCs, one of the largest surveys of\nits kind. We find that (1) 22 GCs that passed our quality cut have extended\nstructure within 5 deg from the cluster centers of which six are new tentative\ndetections, (2) four of those GCs exhibit diffuse envelope-like extra-tidal\nfeatures, while the remaining GCs exhibit tidal tail-like structures. We\nmeasure the position angles of the extended structures, find broad consistency\nbetween the position angles and the GC orbits, and discuss our results\nconcerning N-body models.

The\narchitecture we adopt is a quantum version of the long-short term memory (LSTM)\nwhere some fully connected layers are replaced with quantum circuits. The LSTM,\nmaking predictions based on preceding data, allows identification of anomalies\nby comparing predicted and actual time-series data. The necessary training data\nare generated by simulating active galactic nucleus-like light curves as the\nspecies would be a significant population in the XMM-Newton catalog. Additional\nanomaly data used to assess trained quantum LSTM (QLSTM) models are produced by\nadding flares like quasi-periodic eruptions to the training data. Comparing\nvarious aspects of the performances of the quantum and classical LSTM models,\nwe find that QLSTM models incorporating quantum superposition and entanglement\nslightly outperform the classical LSTM (CLSTM) model in expressive power,\naccuracy, and true-positive rate. The highest-performance QLSTM model is then\nused to identify transient events in 4XMM-DR14.

    "abstract": "Many policies hinge on a continuous variable exceeding a threshold, prompting\nstrategic behavior by agents to stay on the favorable side. This creates\ndensity discontinuities at cutoffs, evident in contexts like taxable income,\ncorporate regulations, and academic grading. Existing methods detect these\ndiscontinuities, but systematic approaches to examine how they vary with\nobservable characteristics are lacking. We propose a novel, interpretable\nBayesian framework that jointly estimates both the log-density ratio at the\ncutoff and the local shape of the density, as functions of covariates, within a\ndata-driven window. This formulation yields regression-style estimates of\ncovariate effects on the discontinuity. An adaptive window selection balances\nbias and variance. Our approach improves upon common methods that target only\nthe log-density ratio around the threshold while ignoring the local density\nshape. We constrain the density jump to be non-negative, reflecting that agents\nwould not aim to be on the losing side of the threshold. Applied to corporate\nshareholder voting data, our method identifies substantial variation in\nstrategic behavior, notably stronger discontinuities for proposals facing\nnegative recommendations from Institutional Shareholder Services, larger firms,\nand firms with lower analyst coverage. Overall, our method provides an\ninterpretable framework to quantify heterogeneous agent responses to\nthreshold-based policies.",

The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo\n(CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the\nimaginary-time axis.

It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and\nthe L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve\nseveral long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii)\nmeasuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive\nnumerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC.\nWe also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done\nbefore to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future\nmethod developments.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to detect genuine human presence by\nextracting discriminative liveness cues from multiple modalities, such as RGB,\ninfrared (IR), and depth images, to enhance the robustness of biometric\nauthentication systems. However, because data from different modalities are\ntypically captured by various camera sensors and under diverse environmental\nconditions, multi-modal FAS often exhibits significantly greater distribution\ndiscrepancies across training and testing domains compared to single-modal FAS.\nFurthermore, during the inference stage, multi-modal FAS confronts even greater\nchallenges when one or more modalities are unavailable or inaccessible. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Cross-modal Transition-guided Network (CTNet) to\ntackle the challenges in the multi-modal FAS task. Our motivation stems from\nthat, within a single modality, the visual differences between live faces are\ntypically much smaller than those of spoof faces. Additionally, feature\ntransitions across modalities are more consistent for the live class compared\nto those between live and spoof classes. Upon this insight, we first propose\nlearning consistent cross-modal feature transitions among live samples to\nconstruct a generalized feature space. Next, we introduce learning the\ninconsistent cross-modal feature transitions between live and spoof samples to\neffectively detect out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks during inference. To\nfurther address the issue of missing modalities, we propose learning\ncomplementary infrared (IR) and depth features from the RGB modality as\nauxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CTNet\noutperforms previous two-class multi-modal FAS methods across most protocols.",

In particular, the investigation of the\ncouplings of this particle with the rest of the Standard-Model field content is\na central task. To this aim, in the present paper we consider a variant of the\nseesaw neutrino-mass-generating mechanism in which the masses of light\nneutrinos are generated via radiative corrections of the neutrino 2-point\nfunction. In this framework, we calculate the contributions from virtual\nMajorana neutrinos to the $WWh$ vertex, at one loop. A set of anomalous\ncouplings, some of them $CP$-even and the others $CP$-odd, emerge from this\ncalculation. We perform numerical estimations of these anomalous couplings by\ntaking into account the role of the $WWh$ vertex in (1) $Wh$ production from\n$pp$ collisions and (2) in Higgs production by vector-boson fusion, occurring\nin some lepton collider. Our estimations show that all the generated anomalous\ncouplings are beyond current experimental sensitivity. However, we note that\n$CP$-conserving anomalous couplings could be as large as $\\sim10^{-3}$, which\nwould be near the reach of the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron\nCollider. On the other hand, $CP$-odd effects, amounting to $\\sim10^{-4}$, turn\nout to be well below expectations for the Compact Linear Collider by about 2\norders of magnitude.",

In this paper, we propose several iterative lower\nbounds for the error coefficients of Griesmer optimal linear codes.\nSpecifically, for binary linear codes, our bounds are tight in most cases when\nthe dimension does not exceed $5$. To evaluate the performance of our bounds\nwhen they are not tight, we also determine the parameters of the remaining\n5-dimensional AFER-optimal linear codes. Our final comparison demonstrates that\neven when our bounds are not tight, they remain very close to the actual\nvalues, with a gap of less than or equal to $2$.",

    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights\nof a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a\nlow-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities\nbetween these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates\nlow-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a\nsingle low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design\ninherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,\nand roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the\ninfinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable\nfeature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks\nvalidate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on\nMNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+\n(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,\nfine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image\nfidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to\nscores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as\nrobustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing\nthat defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate\nthe robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing\nstill requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization\nof selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically\ngenerating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,\nmost studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in\ntheir evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based\napproach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and\nminimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the\ncombinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in\nthe robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented\nfour search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel\nencoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We\nconducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a\nrandom search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our\nstatistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the\nMOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM\nrobustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM\nrobustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs\nacross different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research\nsheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides\ninsights into search-based solutions.",

Moreover,\nthe present model can serve as the basis for constructing multi-state\nHamiltonian in multi-dimensional quantum dynamics calculations. The present\nmodel incorporates eight state-to-state processes involving OH (X) + HO2 (X/A),\nwhere three of four processes associated with HO2 (X) are exothermic, while\nthose associated with HO2 (A) have three endothermic channels with the smallest\nbarrier of 0.107 eV. At temperatures below 500K, the processes of HO2 (A)\nremain inaccessible, and the dominance of exothermic pathways results in a\ntemperature-independent rate constant. To enable HO2 excitation at temperatures\nabove 900K, a black-body radiation model that facilitates endothermic processes\nis introduced and reproduces the reduction factor of 0.3711 at 1100K. This\nvalue falls within the experimentally observed range of 0.30~0.76. Furthermore,\na recombination process involving HO2 (A) is proposed to provide additional\nreduction of the rate constant. In conjunction with our previous works (J.\nChem. Phys. 152 (2020), 134309 and J. Chem. Theory Comput. 20 (2024), 597),\npredicted values of the rate constants are well agree with experiments. At\nelevated temperatures exceeding 1242K (namely >0.107eV), the overall rate\nconstant becomes temperature-dependent due to the activation of endothermic\nprocesses, leading to a distinct well in the Arrhenius curve between 900K and\n1242K.",

    "abstract": "Basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) is a cornerstone of compressive sensing,\nstatistics and machine learning. While various algorithms for BPDN have been\nproposed, they invariably suffer from drawbacks and must either favor\nefficiency at the expense of accuracy or vice versa. As such, state-of-the-art\nalgorithms remain ineffective for high-dimensional applications that require\naccurate solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. In this\nwork, we address this issue and propose an exact and efficient algorithm for\nBPDN using differential inclusions. Specifically, we prove that a selection\nprinciple from the theory of differential inclusions turns the dual problem of\nBPDN into calculating the trajectory of an \\emph{integrable} projected\ndynamical system, that is, whose trajectory and asymptotic limit can be\ncomputed exactly. Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically\nup to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and\nvery fast. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we show\nthat the global continuation of solutions (in terms of the hyperparameter and\ndata) of the projected dynamical system yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm\nfor BPDN, as well as a novel greedy algorithm for computing feasible solutions\nto basis pursuit in strongly polynomial time. Beyond this work, we expect that\nour results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate\nsolutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.",

    "abstract": "Photon counting is a fundamental component in quantum optics and quantum\ninformation. However, implementing ideal photon-number-resolving (PNR)\ndetectors remains experimentally challenging. Multiplexed PNR detection offers\na scalable and practical alternative by distributing photons across multiple\nmodes and detecting their presence using simple ON-OFF detectors, thereby\nenabling approximate photon-number resolution. In this work, we establish a\ntheoretical model for such detectors and prove that the estimation error in\nterms of photon number moments decreases inverse proportionally to the number\nof detectors. Thanks to the enhanced PNR capability, multiplexed PNR detector\nprovides an advantage in cat-state breeding protocols. Assuming a two-photon\nsubtraction case, 7dB of squeezing, and an array of 20 detectors of efficiency\n95%, our calculation predicts fidelity ~ 0.88 with a success probability ~\n3.8%, representing orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous works. Similar\nenhancement also extends to cat-state generation with the generalized photon\nnumber subtraction. With experimentally feasible parameters, our results\nsuggest that megahertz-rate cat-state generation is achievable using an on-chip\narray of tens of ON-OFF detectors.",

    "abstract": "In the face of global economic uncertainty, financial auditing has become\nessential for regulatory compliance and risk mitigation. Traditional manual\nauditing methods are increasingly limited by large data volumes, complex\nbusiness structures, and evolving fraud tactics. This study proposes an\nAI-driven framework for enterprise financial audits and high-risk\nidentification, leveraging machine learning to improve efficiency and accuracy.\nUsing a dataset from the Big Four accounting firms (EY, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG)\nfrom 2020 to 2025, the research examines trends in risk assessment, compliance\nviolations, and fraud detection. The dataset includes key indicators such as\naudit project counts, high-risk cases, fraud instances, compliance breaches,\nemployee workload, and client satisfaction, capturing both audit behaviors and\nAI's impact on operations. To build a robust risk prediction model, three\nalgorithms - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest\nNeighbors (KNN) - are evaluated. SVM uses hyperplane optimization for complex\nclassification, RF combines decision trees to manage high-dimensional,\nnonlinear data with resistance to overfitting, and KNN applies distance-based\nlearning for flexible performance. Through hierarchical K-fold cross-validation\nand evaluation using F1-score, accuracy, and recall, Random Forest achieves the\nbest performance, with an F1-score of 0.9012, excelling in identifying fraud\nand compliance anomalies. Feature importance analysis reveals audit frequency,\npast violations, employee workload, and client ratings as key predictors. The\nstudy recommends adopting Random Forest as a core model, enhancing features via\nengineering, and implementing real-time risk monitoring. This research\ncontributes valuable insights into using machine learning for intelligent\nauditing and risk management in modern enterprises.",

The findings reveal that the\nrelationship between realized volatility and sentiment varies significantly\nbetween high- and low-volatility regimes, reflecting differences in investors'\nresponses to market uncertainties under these conditions. Additionally, a weak\nassociation is observed between short-term volatility and economic/market\nsentiment indicators, suggesting that these indicators may have limited\npredictive power, especially during high-volatility regimes. The QR results\nfurther demonstrate the robustness of MSR estimates across most quantiles.\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay\nbetween market volatility and economic/market sentiment, offering practical\nimplications for investors and policymakers.",

    "abstract": "The multi-wave exact resonance condition is a fundamental principle for\nunderstanding energy transfer in condensed matter systems, yet the dynamical\nevolution of waves satisfying this condition remains unexplored. Here, we\nreveal that the multi-wave resonant kinetic equations possess distinctive\nsymmetry properties that preferentially induce energy equalization between\ncounter-propagating waves of identical frequency. This initial equalization\ndisrupts the exact resonance condition, rendering it dynamically invalid. We\nfurther demonstrate that nonlinearity-mediated multi-wave quasi-resonances--not\nexact resonances--overn energy transfer and drive the system toward\nthermalization. Crucially, the strength of exact resonances decays with\nincreasing system size, while quasi-resonance strength grows. Moreover, exact\nresonance strength remains independent of nonlinearity, whereas quasi-resonance\nstrength diminishes with reduced nonlinearity. These observations provide\nadditional evidence supporting the aforementioned conclusion while elucidating\nthe size-dependent thermalization characteristics in lattice systems.",

    "abstract": "Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful\ntool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the\nscore function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to\nthe target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a\nvariety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score\nmatching, Hyv\\\"arien's method, or Schr\\\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we\nderive an exact, closed-form, expression for the score function for a broad\nclass of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern\nstochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint\noperators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type\nformula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written\nentirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all\nMalliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its\npractical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work\noffers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in\ngenerative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for\ncomplex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader\nclasses of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the\ndevelopment of score-based diffusion generative models.",

    "abstract": "Earthquake cycles are studied by taking into account the interactions among\nslip, fluid pressure, temperature, and porosity on the fault planes, which are\nknown to play a crucial role in earthquake dynamics. The spring-block model\nwith a single block is employed. A first-order transition from foreshock to\nmainshock occurring spontaneously in earthquake sequences is discovered both\nanalytically and numerically. This transition is induced by these interactions.\nIt is shown that the function of the slip distance $u$, $F(u)$, defined as the\nsum of the difference between the energies stored in the driving spring before\nand after the slippage, and the energy dissipated during the slippage, governs\nthe transition. The equation, $F(u)=0$, represents the energy balance before\nand after the slippage, and the solution $u=u_f$ describes the realized slip\ndistance for each slippage event. The solutions discontinuously transition from\nsmall to large slippages in the sequence of earthquakes. This transition can be\ninterpreted to be a self-organized first-order transition from small to large\nslippages. The former slippage is governed by pore generation, whereas the\nlatter is governed by thermal pressurization.
