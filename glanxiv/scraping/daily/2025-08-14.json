    "abstract": "Identification of appropriate supporting evidence is critical to the success\nof scientific fact checking. However, existing approaches rely on off-the-shelf\nInformation Retrieval algorithms that rank documents based on relevance rather\nthan the evidence they provide to support or refute the claim being checked.\nThis paper proposes +VeriRel which includes verification success in the\ndocument ranking. Experimental results on three scientific fact checking\ndatasets (SciFact, SciFact-Open and Check-Covid) demonstrate consistently\nleading performance by +VeriRel for document evidence retrieval and a positive\nimpact on downstream verification. This study highlights the potential of\nintegrating verification feedback to document relevance assessment for\neffective scientific fact checking systems. It shows promising future work to\nevaluate fine-grained relevance when examining complex documents for advanced\nscientific fact checking.",

    "abstract": "Spreadsheet manipulation software are widely used for data management and\nanalysis of tabular data, yet the creation of conditional formatting (CF) rules\nremains a complex task requiring technical knowledge and experience with\nspecific platforms. In this paper we present TaFo, a neuro-symbolic approach to\ngenerating CF suggestions for tables, addressing common challenges such as user\nunawareness, difficulty in rule creation, and inadequate user interfaces. TaFo\ntakes inspiration from component based synthesis systems and extends them with\nsemantic knowledge of language models and a diversity preserving rule\nranking.Unlike previous methods focused on structural formatting, TaFo uniquely\nincorporates value-based formatting, automatically learning both the rule\ntrigger and the associated visual formatting properties for CF rules. By\nremoving the dependency on user specification used by existing techniques in\nthe form of formatted examples or natural language instruction, TaFo makes\nformatting completely predictive and automated for the user. To evaluate TaFo,\nwe use a corpus of 1.8 Million public workbooks with CF and manual formatting.\nWe compare TaFo against a diverse set of symbolic and neural systems designed\nfor or adapted for the task of table formatting. Our results show that TaFo\ngenerates more accurate, diverse and complete formatting suggestions than\ncurrent systems and outperforms these by 15.6\\%--26.5\\% on matching user added\nground truth rules in tables.",

To solve this, we introduce a framework called RAMP\nthat iteratively plans, calls tools, verifies the output, and generates\nsuggestions to improve the quality of the audience generated. Additionally, we\nequip the model with a long-term memory store, which is a knowledge base of\nclient-specific facts and past queries. Overall, we demonstrate the use of LLM\nplanning and memory, which increases accuracy by 28 percentage points on a set\nof 88 evaluation queries. Moreover, we show the impact of iterative\nverification and reflection on more ambiguous queries, showing progressively\nbetter recall (roughly +20 percentage points) with more verify/reflect\niterations on a smaller challenge set, and higher user satisfaction.

    "abstract": "Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have been promoted as fast, mesh-invariant\nsurrogates for partial-differential equation solvers, with seismic studies\nreporting orders-of-magnitude speedup over classical methods. We revisit those\nclaims by benchmarking a state-of-the-art Tucker-tensorized FNO (TFNO) against\nhighly optimized, GPU-accelerated finite-difference (FD) codes for four\nwave-physics formulations: isotropic acoustic, TTI-acoustic, isotropic elastic,\nand VTI-elastic. To isolate inference cost, we do not train networks as the\nruntime depends on architecture, and not specific weight values. When TFNO and\nFD share the same spatial grid (10 m cells) but TFNO runs at the temporal\nNyquist rate (coarser than the CFL-limited FD step), TFNO is consistently\nslower, by factors from 1.4x to 80x, across all physics. Allowing TFNO to\noperate on a Nyquist-rate spatial grid (2.5x coarser per dimension than FD)\nnarrows the gap: small architectures (4-8 layers, 12-24 hidden channels)\nachieve up to 10x faster runtime (VTI-elastic), whereas larger networks (12\nlayers, 36 channels) produce mixed results: Elastic cases are 1.09x and 1.30x\nfaster (isotropic and VTI, respectively), while TTI-acoustic and isotropic\nacoustic are 1.41x and 5.9x slower. A decisive advantage appears only in a\n\"surface-only\" configuration that predicts the boundary time history\nu(x,y,z=0,t): TFNO can be up to 4e3 faster than FD. Overall, TFNOs offer\narchitecture-dependent gains and, for full-volume high-fidelity simulations at\nmatched resolution, are generally slower than optimized FD; by contrast, for\nboundary-field predictions they can deliver orders-of-magnitude acceleration.",

We finish this work by applying this newly derived\nregularity theory to: i) define and appropriate Stokes operator and study its\nspectral and regularity properties, ii) establish $\\mathrm{L}^p$-based\n($1<p<\\infty$) existence and well-posedness for the (stationary) tangent Oseen\nand Navier--Stokes equations via a Galerkin method and bootstrapping, and\nhigher $\\mathrm{L}^p$-based Sobolev regularity results. iii) transfer our\nregularity results to other choices of vector Laplace operators.",

While recent octree-based diffusion\nmodels offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through\nhierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing\nmethods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their\nsemantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic\nhigh-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world\nobjects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for\nlayered generation.

This research introduces a new\nframework named FGAT, which leverages a hierarchical graph representation\ntogether with graph attention mechanisms to address this problem. The framework\nconstructs a three-tier graph of users, outfits, and items, integrating visual\nand textual features to jointly model outfit compatibility and user\npreferences. By dynamically weighting node importance during representation\npropagation, the graph attention mechanism captures key interactions and\nproduces precise embeddings for both user preferences and outfit compatibility.\nEvaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT outperforms strong baselines such as HFGN,\nachieving notable improvements in accuracy, precision, HR, recall, and NDCG.\nThese results demonstrate that combining multimodal visual and textual features\nwith a hierarchical graph structure and attention mechanisms significantly\nenhances the effectiveness and efficiency of personalized fashion\nrecommendation systems.",

We demonstrate that the initial\nconditions of the mirrors' motion concentrate around the fundamental frequency\nof the pendulum and are not related to the frequency range of our interest.\nAlthough in the ideal case, there is a consensus that the shot noise for the\nlaser in the high-frequency range in the signal-referred noise spectral density\ndecreases if the injected laser power is increased, our obtained noise spectral\ndensity shows that the shot noise does not decrease even if the injected laser\npower is increased. This is due to the leakage of the classical radiation\npressure forces from the classical carrier field to the output port, and the\nclassical carrier field is used as the reference in the DC readout scheme.\nSince the classical radiation pressure forces affect the mirror motion as a\nclassical constant force, this classical constant force changes the equilibrium\npoint of the pendulum of mirrors' motion. To recover the ideal case, we must\nconsider adjusting the interferometer's tuning point to place the mirrors in\nequilibrium points.

Once the combined belief exceeds a\nthreshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the\ndesired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in\nthe operator's intent. Future work will evaluate the system on Isaac Sim using\na Franka Emika arm on a Ridgeback base, with a focus on real-time assistance.",

Models for early\nforecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks,\nsuggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address\nthe challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the\nbeginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical\nnotes and tabular events captured in electronic health records. The model\nintegrates pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to\nlearn optimal representations across modalities and balance their presence at\nevery temporal point.

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion in the size of new datasets has created a need for fast\nand efficient parameter-learning techniques. Compressive learning is a\nframework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear\nfeatures to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving\nrepresentations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples\nand can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level\nsummaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying\ndata distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an\nefficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding\nand decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing\nto exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a\nframework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive\nlearning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate\nsystems than the current state-of-the-art approaches.

Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume\nRSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow\nthe hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of\nradial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre-\nand post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a\nfunction of initial mass. We demonstrate that inferring core masses, let alone\ninitial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of\nhigh-mass RSGs is inadvisable, as these can vary by an order of magnitude\nduring the pulsation. We find that pulsations can naturally lead to\n``early-excess\" emission in SN light curves and to variations in early\nphotospheric velocities, which can help break degeneracies in type-II SNe. We\ncompare to SN~2023ixf, for which a pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We\ndemonstrate that its pre- and post-SN characteristics agree very well with our\nexploding pulsating RSG model, whereas hydrostatic stellar models are not\nwell-suited. The data coverage at early times is insufficient to break all\ndegeneracies, but we find constraints on the explosion phase. We find no\nevidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN~2024ggi progenitor, as it\nmatches Spitzer's orbital period. This study underscores the importance of\nhydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models. It implies an important shift in our\nunderstanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation\nof pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the\nmissing RSG problem.",

    "abstract": "Proton PBS treatment planning for H&N cancers involves numerous conflicting\nobjectives, requiring significant effort from human planners to balance and\nsatisfy multiple clinical goals during planning. To achieve this,\nexperience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally\nexpensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts\nhave been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most\ntime-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on\ntheory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and\nintegrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to\nautomatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning\ntime. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by\nlearning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we\nintegrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed\nfor LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability\nissue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop\nvirtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy\nnetwork, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The\ninner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based\non objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in\nthis study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves\nthe effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In\nconjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our\nframework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR\nsparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription\ndose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with\nhuman-generated plans.",

The ALU employs a parallelized schoolbook multiplier,\ncompleting a 512$\\times$512-bit multiplication in 22 clock cycles and enabling\na full Montgomery modular multiplication in 87 cycles. The constant-time\nCSIDH-512 design requires $1.03\\times10^{8}$ clock cycles per key generation.\nWhen implemented on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA, the architecture achieves a\n200 MHz clock frequency, corresponding to a 515 ms latency.

    "abstract": "We investigated binary lens events from the 2022-2024 microlensing surveys,\naiming to identify events suitable for lens mass measurements. We focused on\ntwo key light curve features: distinct caustic spikes with resolved crossings\nfor measuring the angular Einstein radius ($\\theta_{\\rm E}$), and long\ndurations enabling microlens-parallax ($\\pi_{\\rm E}$) measurements. Four events\nmet these criteria: KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, OGLE-2024-BLG-0142,\nand KMT-2024-BLG-1309. We estimated the angular Einstein radius by combining\nthe normalized source radius measured from modeling the resolved caustic spikes\nwith the angular source radius derived from the source color and magnitude.\nAdditionally, we determined the microlens parallax through light curve\nmodeling, considering higher-order effects caused by the orbital motions of\nEarth and the binary lens. With measurements of the event timescale, angular\nEinstein radius, and microlens parallax, we uniquely determined the mass and\ndistance of the lens. For the events KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, and\nKMT-2024-BLG-1309, both components of the binary lens have masses lower than\nthat of the Sun, consistent with M-type dwarfs, which are the most common type\nof lenses in Galactic microlensing events. These lenses are relatively nearby,\nwith distances $\\lesssim 2.5$ kpc, indicating their location within the\nGalactic disk. In contrast, for OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, the primary lens component\nhas a mass similar to that of the Sun, while the companion lens component has\nabout half the mass of the primary. This lens system is situated at a greater\ndistance, roughly 4.5 kpc.",

    "abstract": "Red supergiants (RSGs), which are progenitors of hydrogen-rich Type II\nsupernovae (SNe), have been known to pulsate from both observations and theory.\nThe pulsations can be present at core collapse and affect the resulting SN.\nHowever, SN light curve models of such RSGs commonly use hydrostatic progenitor\nmodels and ignore pulsations. Here, we model the final stages of a 15\nsolar-mass RSG and self-consistently follow the hydrodynamical evolution. We\nfind the growth of large amplitude radial pulsations in the envelope. After a\ntransient phase where the envelope restructures, the pulsations settle to a\nsteady and periodic oscillation with a period of 817 days. We show that they\nare driven by the $\\kappa\\gamma$-mechanism, which is an interplay between\nchanging opacities and the release of recombination energy of hydrogen and\nhelium. This leads to complex and non-coherent expansion and contraction in\ndifferent parts of the envelope, which greatly affect the SN progenitor\nproperties, including its location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We\nsimulate SN explosions of this model at different pulsations phases. Explosions\nin the compressed state result in a flat light curve (Type II-P). In contrast,\nthe SN light curve in the expanded state declines rapidly, reminiscent of a\nType II-L SN. For cases in between, we find light curves with various decline\nrates. Features in the SN light curves are directly connected to features in\nthe density profiles. These are in turn linked to the envelope ionization\nstructure, which is the driving mechanism of the pulsations. We predict that\nsome of the observed diversity in Type II SN light curves can be explained by\nRSG pulsations. For more massive RSGs, we expect stronger pulsations that might\neven lead to dynamical mass ejections of the envelope and to an increased\ndiversity in SN light curves.",

While gradient-free methods have been\ndeveloped for smooth nonconvex problems, extending these techniques to the\nnonsmooth setting remains challenging. The primary difficulty arises from the\nabsence of a Taylor series expansion for Clarke subdifferentials, which limits\nthe ability to approximate and analyze the behavior of the objective function\nin a neighborhood of a point. We propose a two time-scale zeroth-order\nprojected stochastic subgradient method leveraging Gaussian smoothing to\napproximate Clarke subdifferentials.

Second, we design a novel algorithm with coupled\nupdates: a fast timescale tracks the subgradient approximation, while a slow\ntimescale drives convergence. Using continuous-time dynamical systems theory\nand robust perturbation analysis, we prove that iterates converge almost surely\nto a neighborhood of the set of Clarke stationary points, with neighborhood\nsize controlled by the smoothing parameter.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of AI tools and implementation of LLMs within\ndownstream tasks has been paralleled by a surge in research exploring how the\noutputs of such AI/LLM systems embed biases, a research topic which was already\nbeing extensively explored before the era of ChatGPT. Given the high volume of\nresearch around the biases within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs, it is\nimperative to conduct systematic literature reviews to document throughlines\nwithin such research. In this paper, we conduct such a review of research\ncovering AI/LLM bias in four premier venues/organizations -- *ACL, FAccT,\nNeurIPS, and AAAI -- published over the past 10 years. Through a coverage of\n189 papers, we uncover patterns of bias research and along what axes of human\nidentity they commonly focus. The first emergent pattern within the corpus was\nthat 82% (155/189) papers did not establish a working definition of \"bias\" for\ntheir purposes, opting instead to simply state that biases and stereotypes\nexist that can have harmful downstream effects while establishing only\nmathematical and technical definition of bias. 94 of these 155 papers have been\npublished in the past 5 years, after Blodgett et al. (2020)'s literature review\nwith a similar finding about NLP research and recommendation to consider how\nsuch researchers should conceptualize bias, going beyond strictly technical\ndefinitions. Furthermore, we find that a large majority of papers -- 79.9% or\n151/189 papers -- focus on gender bias (mostly, gender and occupation bias)\nwithin the outputs of AI systems and LLMs. By demonstrating a strong focus\nwithin the field on gender, race/ethnicity (30.2%; 57/189), age (20.6%;\n39/189), religion (19.1%; 36/189) and nationality (13.2%; 25/189) bias, we\ndocument how researchers adopt a fairly narrow conception of AI bias by\noverlooking several non-Western communities in fairness research, as we\nadvocate for a stronger coverage of such populations. Finally, we note that\nwhile our corpus contains several examples of innovative debiasing methods\nacross the aforementioned aspects of human identity, only 10.6% (20/189)\ninclude recommendations for how to implement their findings or contributions in\nreal-world AI systems or design processes. This indicates a concerning\nacademia-industry gap, especially since many of the biases that our corpus\ncontains several successful mitigation methods that still persist within the\noutputs of AI systems and LLMs commonly used today. We conclude with\nrecommendations towards future AI/LLM fairness research, with stronger focus on\ndiverse marginalized populations.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2\ndiabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with\nobesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal\nphenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed\nmeasurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D\nclinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define\nbody composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using\nlarge-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms\nabdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through\nsegmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random\nforest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection\nthrough SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns\n(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences\n(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.\nThere were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal\nmuscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or\nfat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of\n14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:\nOur findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be\nconsistent across weight classes.",

This study proposes a reusable,\ngranular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases\nin LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines\npolarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated\nbalanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of\nsemantic categories.\n  As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the\nRussia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3,\nMistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with\na general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework\nallowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic\ncategories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation\nto prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and\ncitizenship modification.\n  Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained\nbias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios\nand topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.",

Through an\nexploratory field deployment, we found that using the system supported novice\nmetacognition, helped mentors plan emotionally attuned strategies, and improved\nmeeting depth, intentionality, and focus--while also surfaced key tensions\naround trust, misdiagnosis, and expectations of AI. We contribute design\nprinciples for proactive AI systems that scaffold metacognition and human-human\ncollaboration in complex, ill-defined domains, offering implications for\nsimilar domains like healthcare, education, and knowledge work.",

    "abstract": "The direct ring coupled-cluster doubles (drCCD)-based random phase\napproximation (RPA) has provided an attractive framework for the development\nand application of RPA-related methods. However, a potential unphysical\nsolution issue recently reported by Rekkedal and co-workers (J. Chem. Phys.\n139, 081101, 2013) has raised significant concerns regarding the general\napplicability of coupled-cluster-based RPA, particularly in small-gap systems\nwhere RPA is anticipated to outperform commonly employed second-order\nperturbation theory. In this work, we elucidate the underlying origin of the\nmulti-solution issue in drCCD and develop both a practical criterion for\nvalidating drCCD solutions and improved preconditioners based on level shifting\nand regularized MP2 methods for stabilizing the iterative solution of the drCCD\nequation. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach\nthrough representative systems -- including molecules with stretched bonds,\nlarge conjugated systems, and metallic clusters -- where standard drCCD\niteration encounters convergence difficulties. Furthermore, we extend our\napproach to various recently developed reduced-scaling drCCD-based RPA methods,\nthereby establishing a foundation for their stable application to large-scale\nproblems. The extension of our approach to RPA with exchange, quasiparticle\nRPA, and particle-particle RPA is also discussed.",

We present results for both the high- and\nlow-temperature limits. We propose the effective number of accessible states as\na measure of nonextensivity. The calculation shows that the nonextensive\nframework further restricts the number of accessible states.

Numerical results confirm\nthe strong effect of nonextensive behavior in the low-temperature regime\n(precisely low to moderate temperature), where the ratio of generalized\ninternal energy and internal energy calculated from the Boltzmann Gibbs (BG)\nformula develops a nontrivial dip structure for \\( q < 1 \\).

However, chiral phonons in graphyne remain unexplored owing to\nthe existence of inversion ($\\mathscr{P}$) and time-reversal ($\\mathscr{T}$)\nsymmetries.

These deformations lift phonon degeneracies away from $\\Gamma$\npoint and give rise to circularly polarized vibrational modes. We further\nestablished a strong correlation between chiral phonon angular momentum and\nelectron affinity of dopants. Electron-rich dopants increase local electron\ndensity which could enable chiral phonon modes to couple more effectively with\nelectronic environment.

Active states support chemical flux and exist in an\non or off switch configuration, whereas inactive states lack flux, introducing\na distinction absent in conventional phosphorylation models.

    "abstract": "Using current empirical data from 10,000 BCE to 2023 CE, we re-examine a\nhyperbolic pattern of human population growth, which was identified by von\nFoerster et al. in 1960 with a predicted singularity in 2026. We find that\nhuman population initially grew exponentially in time as $N(t)\\propto e^{t/T}$\nwith $T$=2080 years. This growth then gradually evolved to be super-exponential\nwith a form similar to the Bose function in statistical physics. Around 1700,\npopulation growth further accelerated, entering the hyperbolic regime as\n$N(t)\\propto(t_s-t)^{-1}$ with the extrapolated singularity year $t_s$=2030,\nwhich is close to the prediction by von Foerster et al. We attribute the switch\nfrom the super-exponential to the hyperbolic regime to the onset of the\nIndustrial Revolution and the transition to massive use of fossil fuels. This\nclaim is supported by a linear relation that we find between the increase in\nthe atmospheric CO$_2$ level and population from 1700 to 2000. In the 21st\ncentury, we observe that the inverse population curve $1/N(t)$ deviates from a\nstraight line and follows a pattern of \"avoided crossing\" described by the\nsquare root of the Lorentzian function. Thus, instead of a singularity, we\npredict a peak in human population at $t_s$=2030 of the time width $\\tau$=32\nyears. We also find that the increase in CO$_2$ level since 1700 is well fitted\nby ${\\rm arccot}[(t_s-t)/\\tau_F]$ with $\\tau_F$=40 years, which implies a peak\nin the annual CO$_2$ emissions at the same year $t_s$=2030.",

    "abstract": "Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language\nModels (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular\ndata. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in\ntackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches\noften suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table\nstructure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in\ninvalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these\nissues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for\nSQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style\nrepresentations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance\nunderstanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve\nquery quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates\nSQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby\nreducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both\nclosed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that\nChain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and\nreduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior\neffectiveness in table understanding.

    "abstract": "Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising\nparadigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing\ngreat potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has\nbeen partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various\nfine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned\nvariants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data\nthat often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional\nshifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range\nof medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a\ntraining-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both\ngeneralist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical\nimage segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that\nrely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we\npropose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal\nlayer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we\ndevelop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and\ngeneralizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and\nmulti-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical\nsegmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias\nand consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and\ngeneralization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%\non multi-task evaluations.",

We devise a\nspecialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning\nproblem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for\nrelevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes\nenvironmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages.

    "abstract": "This chapter serves as an introduction to systems engineering focused on the\nbroad issues surrounding realizing complex integrated systems. What is a\nsystem? We pose a number of possible definitions and perspectives, but leave\nopen the opportunity to consider the system from the target context where it\nwill be used. Once we have a system in mind, we acknowledge the fact that this\nsystem needs to integrate a variety of pieces, components, subsystems, in order\nfor it to accomplish its task. Therefore, we concern ourselves at the\nboundaries and interfaces of different technologies and disciplines to\ndetermine how best to achieve that integration. Next we raise the specter that\nthis integrated system is complex. Complexity can be defined in a number of\nways. For one, the sheer number of subsystems or components can be a measure of\ncomplexity. We could also consider the functions being performed by the system\nand how those functions interact with one another. Further, we could consider\ncomputational aspects such as the time or memory that may be needed to\naccomplish one or more tasks. The extent to which new behaviors might emerge\nfrom the system can also be regarded as an element of complexity. In the end,\ncomplexity is that characteristic of a system that defines the associated\nchallenges along the life of the system, so we are concerned with how to manage\nthat complexity. Finally, realization refers to the process by which our\ncomplex integrated system moves from concept to deployment and subsequent\nsupport. It refers to the entire design, development, manufacture, deployment,\noperation, and support life cycle. Of particular note here, however, is that we\nfocus on systems that, by their very nature, are complex. In other words, we\nare interested in large, complicated, interacting beasts that are intended to\nperform difficult tasks and meet a wide variety of end-user needs.",

While we can\napply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we\nfocus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression\ntasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification\nsettings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible\nclasses. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for\ndetecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical\nexperiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than\ninterval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while\nachieving a similar coverage over the test data.",

We\nperformed 3D radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the MURaM code,\nwhich incorporates solar convection and radiative transfer. A flat magnetic\nflux sheet was introduced into the convection zone to trigger flux emergence.\nFor comparison with previous observations, we used the RH1.5D code to\nsynthesize H{\\alpha} and Si IV spectral line profiles, and generated\nultraviolet images using the optically thin approximation. The simulations show\nthat flux emergence occurs as the imposed flux tube crosses the photosphere. In\nthe lower solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection forms thin, elongated current\nsheets, and plasmoid-like structures develop, producing numerous small twisted\nmagnetic flux ropes that are expelled toward both ends of the reconnection\nregion. This process results in the coexistence of hot plasma exceeding 20,000\nK and cooler plasma below 10,000 K. Synthetic images and spectral line profiles\nthrough the reconnection region exhibit features characteristic of Ellerman\nbombs (EBs) and UV bursts. Cooler plasma associated with EBs can be found above\nhot plasma at altitudes exceeding 2 Mm above the solar surface, while hot\nplasma associated with UV bursts can extend downward into the lower\nchromosphere, reaching approximately 0.7 Mm above the surface. These results\nindicate that turbulent reconnection mediated by plasmoid instability can occur\nin small-scale events such as EBs and UV bursts, and that the coexistence of\nhot and cool plasma in such reconnection processes can account for UV bursts\nthat are temporally and spatially connected to EBs.",

    "abstract": "Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector\nidentifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language\nModels (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting\nsafety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open\ndatasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction\nsafety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,\nlimiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In\nthis paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction\nsite images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image\ncaptioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and\nconstruction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current\nstate-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities\nin zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make\nthem applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers\nto train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,\nproviding a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.",

    "abstract": "Uterine fibroids (myomas) are the most common benign tumors of the female\nreproductive system, particularly among women of childbearing age. With a\nprevalence exceeding 70%, they pose a significant burden on female reproductive\nhealth. Clinical symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility,\npelvic pain, and pressure-related discomfort play a crucial role in guiding\ntreatment decisions, which are largely influenced by the size, number, and\nanatomical location of the fibroids. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a\nnon-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians\nfor the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a\nprecise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including\nmeasurements of volume, shape, and spatial location. However, this process is\nlabor intensive and time consuming and subjected to variability due to intra-\nand inter-expert differences at both pre- and post-treatment stages. As a\nresult, there is a critical need for an accurate and automated segmentation\nmethod for uterine fibroids. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have\nshown re-markable improvements in medical image segmentation, outperforming\ntraditional methods. These approaches offer the potential for fully automated\nsegmentation. Several studies have explored the use of deep learning models to\nachieve automated segmentation of uterine fibroids. However, most of the\nprevious work has been conducted using private datasets, which poses challenges\nfor validation and comparison between studies. In this study, we leverage the\npublicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset (UMD) to establish a baseline for\nautomated segmentation of uterine fibroids, enabling standardized evaluation\nand facilitating future research in this domain.",

    "abstract": "The wakeup problem addresses the fundamental challenge of symmetry breaking.\nThere are $n$ devices sharing a time-slotted multiple access channel. In any\nfixed slot, if a single device sends a packet, it succeeds; however, if two or\nmore devices send, then there is a collision and none of the corresponding\npackets succeed. For the static version of wakeup, all packets are initially\nactive (i.e., can send and listen on the channel); for the dynamic version, the\npackets become active at arbitrary times. In both versions, the goal is to\nsuccessfully send a single packet.\n  Prior results on wakeup have largely focused on the number of slots until the\nfirst success; that is, the latency. However, in many modern systems,\ncollisions introduce significant delay, an aspect that current wakeup\nalgorithms do not address. For instance, while existing results for static\nwakeup have polylogarithmic-in-$n$ latency, they can incur additional latency\nthat is {\\it linear} in the cost of a collision $C$. Thus, the total latency is\nlarge and dominated by the contributions from collisions.\n  Here, we design and analyze a randomized wakeup algorithm, Aim-High. For\nsufficiently large $C$ and with bounded error, Aim-High has latency and\nexpected collision cost that is nearly $O(\\sqrt{C})$ for both the static and\ndynamic versions. Otherwise, the latency and expected collision cost are\n$O(\\texttt{poly}{(\\log n)})$ for the static setting, and\n$O(n\\,\\texttt{poly}{(\\log n)})$ for the dynamic setting.

Through extensive\nexperimentation on diverse directed graphs with varying structural properties,\nwe demonstrate that HDBMS not only maintains competitive computational\nefficiency but also outperforms traditional algorithms in identifying\nmeaningful paths. By integrating probabilistic decision-making, HDBMS\nconstructs an adaptive and structured traversal order that balances exploration\nacross depth and breadth, making it particularly effective in applications such\nas information retrieval, social network analysis, and recommendation systems.\nOur results highlight the robustness of HDBMS in scenarios where the most\nvaluable connections emerge unpredictably, positioning it as a powerful\nalternative to traditional graph-searching techniques.",

Here we use analytical\narguments and numerical evidence to illuminate how spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of a non-invertible symmetry is similar yet distinct from ordinary,\ninvertible, symmetry breaking. We consider one-dimensional chains of\ngroup-valued qudits, whose local Hilbert space is spanned by elements of a\nfinite group $G$ (reducing to ordinary qubits when $G=\\mathbb{Z}_2$). We\nconstruct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose\ngenerators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible\nrepresentations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is\nnon-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per\nirrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order\nparameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have\ndistinct entanglement patterns. We show that for each irrep of dimension\ngreater than one the corresponding ground state exhibits string order,\nentanglement spectrum degeneracies, and has gapless edge modes on an open chain\n-- features usually associated with symmetry-protected topological order.\nConsequently, domain wall excitations behave as one-dimensional non-Abelian\nanyons with non-trivial internal Hilbert spaces and fusion rules.

We further validate\nQESEM's versatility across arbitrary quantum circuits and devices through\nhigh-accuracy error-mitigated molecular VQE circuits executed on IBM Heron and\nIonQ trapped-ion devices. Compared with multiple variants of the widely used\nzero-noise extrapolation method, QESEM consistently achieves higher accuracy.\nThese results mark a significant step forward in accuracy and reliability for\nrunning quantum circuits on devices available today across diverse algorithmic\napplications.

The Kuramoto model\nprovides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among\ncoupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However,\nmany real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be\neffectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that\nhigher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state,\nmaking it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite\nenriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case.\nThrough extensive numerical analysis of the higher-order Kuramoto model, we\nfind that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against\nsynchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it. This\nresult is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained\nbudget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation\ninvolving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on\neither interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the\nrole of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to\ndesign principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.",

However, a small fraction of the most massive galaxies which are no\nlonger forming stars (i.e., they are quiescent) are dispersion supported, and\nare termed 'slow-rotators.' These galaxies, which are highly evolved and often\nexist in dense cluster environments, are theorized to be formed by a history of\nmerger activity that on average decreases the angular momentum of the merged\nsystem and disturbs any disk structure. At high redshift, such extreme\nslow-rotating systems are predicted to be far less common. While observations\nof massive high-redshift galaxies which enable kinematic studies are\nchallenging to obtain, all previous data have revealed systems that are\nrotating rapidly. No slow-rotators have been confirmed from stellar kinematics\nbeyond z~2. In this work we present results from James Webb Space Telescope\nnear-infrared integral field spectroscopy of XMM-VID1-2075, a massive,\nquiescent galaxy at z=3.449 with a morphology exhibiting clear low-surface\nbrightness asymmetries and with a measured spin parameter of $\\lambda _{R_e} =\n0.101 \\pm 0.018$, consistent with the lack of rotation seen in slow rotators in\nthe local Universe.

    "abstract": "The volumetric rates and luminosity functions (LFs) of core-collapse\nsupernovae (ccSN) and their subtypes are important for understanding the cosmic\nhistory of star formation and the buildup of ccSN products. To estimate these\nrates, we use data of nearby ccSNe discovered by the All-Sky Automated Survey\nfor Supernovae (ASAS-SN) from 2014--2017, when all observations were made in\nthe $V$-band. The sample is composed of 174 discovered or recovered events,\nwith high spectroscopic completeness from followup observations. This allows us\nto obtain a statistically precise and systematically robust estimate of nearby\nrates for ccSNe and their subtypes. The volumetric rates are estimated by\ncorrecting the observed number of events for the survey completeness, which was\nestimated through injection recovery simulations using ccSN light curves. We\nfind a total volumetric rate for ccSNe of $7.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \\times 10^{-5} \\\n\\textrm{yr}^{-1} \\ \\textrm{Mpc}^{-3} \\ h^{3}_{70}$, at a median redshift of\n0.0149, for absolute magnitudes at peak $M_{V,peak} \\leq -14$ mag. This result\nis in agreement with previous local volumetric rates. We obtain volumetric\nrates for the different ccSN subtypes (II, IIn, IIb, Ib, Ic, Ibn, and Ic-BL),\nand find that the relative fractions of Type II, stripped-envelope, and\ninteracting ccSNe are $63.2\\%$, $32.3\\%$, and $4.4\\%$, respectively. We also\nestimate a volumetric rate for superluminous SNe of $1.5^{+4.4}_{-1.1} \\\n\\textrm{yr}^{-1} \\ \\textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \\ h^{3}_{70}$, corresponding to a fraction\nof $0.002\\%$ of the total ccSN rate. We produce intrinsic $V$-band LFs of ccSNe\nand their subtypes, and show that ccSN rates steadily decline for increasing\nluminosities. We further investigate the specific ccSN rate as a function of\ntheir host galaxy stellar mass, and find that the rate decreases with\nincreasing stellar mass, with significantly higher rates at lower mass\ngalaxies.",

We aim to\ndetermine whether white dwarf-neutron star (WDNS) and white dwarf-black hole\n(WDBH) mergers are plausible explanations for long-duration compact merger\nGRBs, in terms of their galactocentric merger offsets and cosmological rates.\nWe model the host galaxies of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and employ binary\npopulation synthesis, to predict the offset distributions of compact mergers.\nWe compare with the observed offsets, investigate evolutionary pathways,\npredict their cosmological rates, and compare with volumetric GRB rates. We\nfind that WDNS mergers occur at lower host offsets than binary NS mergers, but\nthat in the specific cases of GRBs 211211A and 230307A, the observed offsets\nare consistent with either scenario. We predict that WDNS mergers occur at a\nsimilar rate to binary NS mergers and long GRBs, and that WDBH mergers are a\nfactor of ten rarer, with the caveat that these rates currently carry\nuncertainties at the order of magnitude level. We have demonstrated, solely in\nterms of galactocentric offsets and event rates, that WDNS mergers are a\nplausible explanation for GRBs 211211A and 230307A, and long GRBs from compact\nobject mergers more generally. WDNS binaries have lower systemic velocities\nthan binary neutron stars, but longer delay times, and ultimately merge with an\noffset distribution that is not measurably different without large samples.\nTherefore, offsets and rates alone cannot currently distinguish between compact\nbinary progenitor models for supernova-less long duration GRBs.",

Templates are assumed to approximate the true spectrum\nwhen constructed from many observations or in the high signal-to-noise limit.\nWe develop a numerical simulation that generates SPIRou-like pRV observations\nfrom PHOENIX spectra, constructs empirical templates, and estimates radial\nvelocities. This simulation solely considers photon noise and evaluates when\nempirical templates remain reliable for pRV analysis. Our results reveal a\npreviously unrecognized noise source in templates, establishing a fundamental\nfloor for template-based pRV measurements. We find that templates inherently\ninclude distortions in stellar line shapes due to imperfect interpolation at\nthe detector's sampling resolution. The magnitude of this interpolation error\ndepends on sampling resolution and RV content. Consequently, while stars with a\nhigher RV content, such as cooler M-dwarfs are expected to yield lower RV\nuncertainties, their dense spectral features can amplify interpolation errors,\npotentially biasing RV estimates. For a typical M4V star, SPIRou's spectral and\nsampling resolution imposes an RV uncertainty floor of 0.5-0.8 m/s, independent\nof the star's magnitude or the telescope's aperture. These findings reveal a\nlimitation of template-based pRV methods, underscoring the need for improved\nspectral modeling and better-than-Nyquist detector sampling to reach the next\nlevel of RV precision.",

Here we show that the Hermitian principle for flat-band formation in\nbipartite lattices, based on a sublattice degeneracy mismatch, extends directly\nto the NH regime: whenever one sublattice hosts a momentum-independent\neigenvalue with degeneracy exceeding that of its partner on the other\nsublattice, flat bands arise regardless of gain, loss, or complex couplings.\nStrikingly, at exceptional points, dispersive bands coalesce to form\n\\emph{exceptional flat bands} that persist beyond these singularities,\nexhibiting biorthogonal eigenmodes spanning both sublattices, with energies and\nlifetimes tunable via sublattice asymmetry and non-reciprocal couplings. This\ngeneral framework unifies Hermitian and NH flat-band constructions, and reveals\ndispersionless states with no closed-system analogue.

    "abstract": "Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet\nthe transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a\nsignificant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in\ngenerative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and\nanimation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present\nPuppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and\nanimation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal\nstructures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based\ntokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering\nmethodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning\ncapabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based\narchitecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly\nencodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,\nwe complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based\nanimation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being\ncomputationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations\nacross multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy\nand skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging\nfrom professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing\ntemporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in\nexisting methods.",

Existing\ncross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage\ntraining, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model\nthrough a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components\nand multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which\nleverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.\nWhile PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it\nencounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and\ncontextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an\nextension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and\ndatasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified\nframework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.\nAdditionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to\nenhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with\ndual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.\nExtensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms\nof generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.\nThese results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified\ncross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.\nThe source codes and models are available at\nhttps://github.com/BradleyWang0416/Human-in-Context.",

Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by\nrehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic\nmemory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store\ntemporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and\nthereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between\nmemory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory\nintegrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL).

We\nintroduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory\nand semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of\ntemporally dense features from temporally sparse features.

Apart from\nenriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star\nformation in the halo -- either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting\ncold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star\nformation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs -- arc-like stellar features\nlocated ~5 kpc from M82's star-forming disk along the minor axis -- using\nHubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar\npopulations, we derive SFHs over the last ~500 Myr, finding that ~85% of the\nstellar mass formed between ~150 and ~70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause,\nwith the remaining ~15% forming since ~30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations\nare co-spatial on scales of at least ~200 pc. The timing of the ~100 Myr burst\naligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star\nclusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star\nformation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In\nthe first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and\ncooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star\nformation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds\nassociated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the\nhalo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star\nformation, producing the observed episodic structure.",

Given that online and city council\ndiscourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable\ninsights to identify and track social biases.

It introduces novel\nmethods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language\nmodels (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital\nspaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from\nReddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes\nacross 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies\nof homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and\nautomate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as\nclassifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques\nto this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B\nInstruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1,\nGemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are\nsignificant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the\nin-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the\nclassification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT\nwhen averaging across all categories.

    "abstract": "This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance\nusing four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of\nthumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters\nand their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to\nhelp serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of\nstudy. The influence of various parameter selections and their value\nadjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a\npowerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be\nchallenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some\nhyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter\nvalues without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative\nto understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State\nNetwork architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the\nrequirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as\nwell as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to\nvariations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a\nseries of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including\ntime series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time\nseries classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on\nthe performance of Echo State Network.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that\nsimply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a\ndata wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged\nas a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,\nthe factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this\nwork, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that\nproduces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly\nextends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and\nNemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1\npercentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of\n14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web\ndata and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly\noptimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and\npractical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,\npotentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative\nimprovements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.",

Toward this end, the fabrication of new ultrapure thin\nfilm materials is critical to discover and understand novel properties that can\nallow further development of technology. Oxide materials are a vast material\nclass abound with diverse properties, and, therefore, harnessing such phases is\ncritical for realizing emerging technologies. Pushing forward, however,\nrequires understanding basic properties of insulating, semiconducting and\nmetallic oxides, as well as the more complex phases that arise out of strong\nelectronic correlations unique to this class of materials. In this review, we\nwill focus on one of the unique aspects of oxides: the ultra-high conductivity\nmetallic state, which can be a critical component for future all-oxide\nmicroelectronics such as low-loss interconnects and gate-metals, spintronics,\nas well as future quantum technologies that employ emergent magnetic or\nsuperconducting ground states. Like most oxides, a critical challenge to\nunderstanding and ultimately integrating high-conductivity metals into new\ntechnologies is the ability to synthesize high-quality materials. Therefore, we\nwill frame the discussions in the context of epitaxial film growth via\nmolecular beam epitaxy (MBE), which has provided insights into the electronic\nbehavior of specific materials while providing samples with unprecedented\nquality. We will highlight and underscore how MBE has enabled developments and\ndeeper understanding of their properties and how it plays a critical role in\nthe future of this unique class of materials.",

Despite recent\nadvances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading\nto error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches\nstruggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame\nsketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring\nas few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels\nwith sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal\nlocation for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual\nworkload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.\nTo evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring\nhuman-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,\nmotion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more\nflexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.",

A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws:\n(1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced\nframe sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss\nintroduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3)\nencoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized\nduring text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query\nblack-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our\nlarge-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness\nomission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly\npresent in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it.

    "abstract": "The widespread deployment of LLM-based agents is likely to introduce a\ncritical privacy threat: malicious agents that proactively engage others in\nmulti-turn interactions to extract sensitive information. These dynamic\ndialogues enable adaptive attack strategies that can cause severe privacy\nviolations, yet their evolving nature makes it difficult to anticipate and\ndiscover sophisticated vulnerabilities manually. To tackle this problem, we\npresent a search-based framework that alternates between improving attacker and\ndefender instructions by simulating privacy-critical agent interactions. Each\nsimulation involves three roles: data subject, data sender, and data recipient.\nWhile the data subject's behavior is fixed, the attacker (data recipient)\nattempts to extract sensitive information from the defender (data sender)\nthrough persistent and interactive exchanges. To explore this interaction space\nefficiently, our search algorithm employs LLMs as optimizers, using parallel\nsearch with multiple threads and cross-thread propagation to analyze simulation\ntrajectories and iteratively propose new instructions. Through this process, we\nfind that attack strategies escalate from simple direct requests to\nsophisticated multi-turn tactics such as impersonation and consent forgery,\nwhile defenses advance from rule-based constraints to identity-verification\nstate machines. The discovered attacks and defenses transfer across diverse\nscenarios and backbone models, demonstrating strong practical utility for\nbuilding privacy-aware agents.",

We focus on\nthe Dark Scattering (DS) model, describing pure momentum transfer between dark\nmatter -- dark energy through the parameter $A_{\\rm ds}$. To capture DS\neffects, we adopt the halo model reaction framework within $\\tt{ReACT}$,\ncompute the nonlinear DS spectrum, and validate it against $N$-body\nsimulations. We further include baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos,\nfinding degeneracies between DS and baryonic effects but not with neutrinos. We\nthen constrain DS using cosmic shear from KiDS-1000, accelerated by neural\nemulators from $\\tt{CosmoPower}$, which speed up predictions by\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$. Our DS emulator, trained on halo model reaction outputs,\npreserves percent-level accuracy and incorporates baryonic feedback. Analysing\nKiDS shear statistics, we obtain $\\vert A_{\\rm ds}\\vert \\lesssim 20$ b/GeV at\n$68 \\%$ C.L. Combining KiDS with Planck CMB and BAO data, we find $A_{\\rm\nds}=10.6^{+4.5}_{-7.3}$ b/GeV at $68 \\%$ C.L., suggesting the DS model as a\npromising resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Finally, we present weak lensing\nforecasts for Stage IV surveys using an automatically differentiable pipeline\nwith $\\tt{jax-cosmo}$ and gradient-based samplers in $\\tt{NumPyro}$, reducing\ncomputational cost from months on CPUs to days on GPUs. Model evidence is\nevaluated with $\\tt{harmonic}$ under multiple scale cuts. To put things into\nperspective, the modelling strategies and machine learning accelerations\ndeveloped here provide powerful tools for the next generation of LSS cosmology.",

By\ngenerating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs\npossess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing\nbidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the\ngeneration process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent\nadvancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their\nautoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various\nnatural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic\noverview of the current DLM landscape.

Our work offers\nan up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current\ntechniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.\nAnother contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference\nstrategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,\ncaching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest\napproaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications\nacross various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the\nlimitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence\nhandling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research\ndirections to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field.

To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs\nvia structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our\nresults reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the\ninference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,\nincluding the challenging BrowseComp task.

Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy\nmodels provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL\ntraining, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust\nsim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world\nknowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL\ndemonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce\nhallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search\nengines without additional effort.

By\nformulating the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) within a custom\nOpenAI Gymnasium environment, our method simulates orbital dynamics using\nclassical Keplerian elements. The agent progressively learns to adjust five of\nthe orbital parameters - semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right\nascension of ascending node, and the argument of perigee-to achieve targeted\nterrestrial coverage. Comparative evaluation against Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) demonstrates A2C's superior performance, achieving 5.8x\nhigher cumulative rewards (10.0 vs 9.263025) while converging in 31.5x fewer\ntimesteps (2,000 vs 63,000).

This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally\nrich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties\ntrust that the provided attributions are indeed \"good,\" especially when they\nare used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this\npaper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification\nparadigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover\nlearns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a\nresource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides\nformal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of\nProbably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover\nand Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that\nare {\\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean\nSquared Error) with probability 1-{\\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover\narbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this\nis detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with\nprobability {\\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's\nworkload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must\nperform, scales only as O(1/{\\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset\nsize. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any\nlinear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them\nbroadly applicable to various attribution tasks.",

PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across\nfour hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video\ncontent with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency\nusing boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories\nfor realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency\nbetween narrative and visuals.

An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an\nindividual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable.\nHowever, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can\nsurpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and\nsynthetic fake IDs.

Parametric sensitivity analyses and illustrative\nnumerical simulations demonstrate how phased-array architectures improve power\ndensity and end-to-end efficiency at operational lunar distances.

We propose CrossDenoise, a\nnovel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by\ndisentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific\nfactors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity\nin user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation\nfactors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average\ntraining losses.

Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and\nAmazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that\nCrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with\nNeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead.

However, the level\nof disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication\nprotocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the\nimpurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this\nwork, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric\nfield, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics,\nquantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure\nfrom the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room\ntemperature.

With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase\nin the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and\nalso the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder,\nthereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered\ngraphene.

We point out the similarity of the rings in the Cir X-1 CCSN\nremnant to a ring in the Cygnus Loop CCSN remnant. While the X-ray binary\nsystem Cir X-1 actively launches jets, no such activity exists in the Cygnus\nLoop. In both CCSN remnants, we attribute the rings to jets that are part of\nthe explosion process in the framework of the jittering jets explosion\nmechanism (JJEM). We also identify such a ring in the CCSN remnant 107.7-5.1,\nwhich we also attribute to exploding jets. We conduct three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations of late jets inside an exploding massive stellar\ncore, and demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario for ring formation. The\nCir X-1 CCSN remnant has a large blowout, similar to that of the Cygnus Loop\nand to a large protrusion in the CCSN remnant G0.9+0.1 . Based on these\nsimilarities, we suggest that other exploding jets inflated the blowout of the\nCir X-1 nebula, identical to an earlier claim on the formation of the blowout\nof the Cygnus Loop. We identify a point-symmetric structure in the Cir X-1 CCSN\nremnant, strengthening the JJEM.

    "abstract": "We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input\nbased on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance\non both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand\nhigh-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on\nQwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /\n50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,\nScreenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including\nopen-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5. To show UI-Venus's summary and\nplaning ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI\nnavigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%\nsuccess rate, also beating existing models. To achieve this, we introduce\ncarefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks\nand corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies. To further boost\nnavigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment &\nSparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and balances\nthe distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more coherent\nplanning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our contributions\ninclude the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive data cleaning\nprotocols and a novel self-evolving framework for improving navigation\nperformance, which encourage further research and development in the community.\nCode is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/UI-Venus.",

In this article, we present a theoretical\nframework for realizing a field-free SDE based on a two-dimensional (2D) Shiba\nlattice featuring a conical spin texture. Using the real-space Bogoliubov-de\nGennes (BdG) calculations, we illustrate that the conical spin configuration\nalone is sufficient to break the necessary inversion and time reversal\nsymmetries, enabling nonreciprocal supercurrent flow without any external\nmagnetic field, yielding diode efficiency exceeding 40%. Furthermore, we find\nthat the efficiency of such a diode effect becomes strongly dependent on the\ndirection of current flow, revealing a pronounced angular dependence that can\nbe tuned by varying the pitches of the spin texture along the two spatial\nlattice directions.

In contrast, this paper introduces a novel scalable fluid antenna\nsystem (SFAS) that can dynamically adjust its aperture configuration to\noptimize performance for different localization tasks. Within this framework,\nwe develop a two-stage source localization strategy based on the exact spatial\ngeometry (ESG) model: the first stage uses a compact aperture configuration for\ninitial direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, while the second stage employs\nan expanded aperture for enhanced DOA and range estimation. The proposed\napproach eliminates the traditional need for signal separation or isolation to\nclassify source types and enables a single SFAS array to achieve high\nlocalization accuracy without field-specific assumptions, model\nsimplifications, or approximations, representing a new paradigm in array-based\nsource localization. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of the\nproposed method in terms of localization accuracy, computational efficiency,\nand robustness to different source types.",

However, the\ncomputationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation\nmodels (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of\nexoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning\n(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of\narbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.\nA new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type\nhost stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network\n(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to\npredict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To\nensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,\nHATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all\ntargets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the\ntwo ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are\nto such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but\none planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.\nThe developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature\nfield of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to\nM-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional\nGCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is\nsuch that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud\nformation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.",

    "abstract": "Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of\ngeneral human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving\ncapabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation\ncapabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent\nto which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when\ninterpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey\nstudy with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed\nvision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and\nrecognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct\nprompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,\nvarying the included information on vision information and example image\nresponses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and\nparticipants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer\nbeyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in\nlow agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'\nresponses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example\nimage responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both\nsignificantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single\nexample combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers\nsignificant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while\nadditional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).",

    "abstract": "Excel is a pervasive yet often complex tool, particularly for novice users,\nwhere runtime errors arising from logical mistakes or misinterpretations of\nfunctions pose a significant challenge. While large language models (LLMs)\noffer promising assistance by explaining formula errors, the automated\ncorrection of these semantic runtime errors remains an open problem. A primary\nchallenge to advancing models for such scenarios is the severe lack of\nhigh-quality, comprehensive datasets for training and rigorous evaluation. This\npaper addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach for constructing a\nbenchmark dataset specifically designed for Excel formula repair. We propose a\ndata generation pipeline, which leverages a small set of curated seed samples\nfrom online forums to synthetically expand the dataset. Our pipeline integrates\nfew-shot prompting with LLMs and employs a robust \\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}\nvalidation framework, combined with execution-based checks to ensure the\ncorrectness and semantic fidelity of the generated data. This process produced\na benchmark dataset of 618 high-quality samples, covering common runtime\nerrors. Furthermore, we propose a context-aware baseline technique for Excel\nformula repair that utilizes LLMs to leverage both the faulty formula, and\nrelevant spreadsheet context. We evaluate the performance of various LLMs\n(GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Phi-3, Mistral) on our newly generated benchmark using\nexecution-based metrics.

Wearable devices with embedded photoplethysmography (PPG) enable\ncontinuous non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity, offering a promising\nstrategy to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.

This study\nproposes a framework that combines the advantages of both signal decomposition\nand deep learning approaches. Approach. We leverage algorithm unfolding to\nintegrate prior knowledge about the PPG structure into a deep neural network,\nimproving its interpretability. A learned convolutional sparse coding model\nencodes the signal into a sparse representation using a learned dictionary of\nkernels that capture recurrent morphological patterns.

While static analyses of snap-through are well\ndocumented, the dynamics of snap-through remain under-explored, particularly in\nstructures with natural curvature. Using a combination of finite element\nsimulations and multiple-scales analysis, we show that the snap-through\ndynamics of an arch under a central point load are controlled by its\nslenderness and imperfections embedded in the system. As the slenderness\nincreases, the snap-through dynamics slow down, and the mode of snap-through\nchanges from limit-point buckling to bifurcation buckling. When bifurcation\nbuckling occurs, snap-through is preceded by an extended period of oscillatory\nbehaviour. The duration of these pre-snap-through oscillations, and hence the\nsnap-through time, is entirely controlled by imperfections in the system.\nIncreasing the strength of imperfections dramatically reduces the snap-through\ntime. Analytical expressions for the snap-through times are presented for limit\npoint and bifurcation buckling.

Existing diffusion models often produce\nlow-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological\ndetails, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection\nmodels.

Specifically, we are\nthe first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for\ndiffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion\nmodel with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote\nsensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.\nFurthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the\ngenerated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of minimizing the worst-case search time for a hidden\npoint target in the plane using multiple mobile agents of differing speeds, all\nstarting from a common origin. The search time is normalized by the target's\ndistance to the origin, following the standard convention in competitive\nanalysis. The goal is to minimize the maximum such normalized time over all\ntarget locations, the search cost. As a base case, we extend the known result\nfor a single unit-speed agent, which achieves an optimal cost of about\n$\\mathcal{U}_1 = 17.28935$ via a logarithmic spiral, to $n$ unit-speed agents.\nWe give a symmetric spiral-based algorithm where each agent follows a\nlogarithmic spiral offset by equal angular phases. This yields a search cost\nindependent of which agent finds the target. We provide a closed-form upper\nbound $\\mathcal{U}_n$ for this setting, which we use in our general result. Our\nmain contribution is an upper bound on the worst-case normalized search time\nfor $n$ agents with arbitrary speeds. We give a framework that selects a subset\nof agents and assigns spiral-type trajectories with speed-dependent angular\noffsets, again making the search cost independent of which agent reaches the\ntarget. A corollary shows that $n$ multi-speed agents (fastest speed 1) can\nbeat $k$ unit-speed agents (cost below $\\mathcal{U}_k$) if the geometric mean\nof their speeds exceeds $\\mathcal{U}_n / \\mathcal{U}_k$. This means slow agents\nmay be excluded if they lower the mean too much, motivating non-spiral\nalgorithms. We also give new upper bounds for point search in cones and conic\ncomplements using a single unit-speed agent. These are then used to design\nhybrid spiral-directional strategies, which outperform the spiral-based\nalgorithms when some agents are slow. This suggests that spiral-type\ntrajectories may not be optimal in the general multi-speed setting.",

We apply the approach to DHS data\nfrom Nigeria, Senegal, and Kenya. We find in the survey sample and general\npopulation that an additional child significantly reduces employment among\nwomen in Nigeria but has no clear average effect in Senegal or Kenya. Across\nall three countries, however, there is strong evidence of effect heterogeneity:\nyounger, less-educated women experience large employment penalties, while older\nor more advantaged women are largely unaffected.

The OCT strategy provides the highest robustness,\nmaintaining contrast above 95\\% under realistic conditions, while the DS-DBD\nstrategy sustains contrast above 90\\% for well-collimated Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. These results offer practical pathways to enhancing DBD-based\ninterferometers for precision quantum sensing and fundamental physics tests.",

While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have\nshown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining\nthese approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration\nyields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after\nstep distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint\ntraining framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention\n(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to\nfocus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware\nstep distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)\nthat directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than\ntreating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate\nBLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On\nWan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a\n50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video\nsequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup.

In ANNs, knowledge is thought to reside in connection weights or in\nattractor basins, but these two paradigms are not linked explicitly. Here we\ncomprehensively analyse mechanisms of memory formation in an 81-neuron Hopfield\nnetwork undergoing Hebbian learning by revealing bifurcations leading to\nformation and destruction of attractors and their basin boundaries. We show\nthat, by affecting evolution of connection weights, the applied stimuli induce\na pitchfork and then a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations creating new\nattractors with their basins that can code true or spurious memories, and an\nabrupt disappearance of old memories (catastrophic forgetting). With successful\nlearning, new categories are represented by the basins of newly born point\nattractors, and their boundaries by the stable manifolds of new saddles. With\nthis, memorisation and forgetting represent two manifestations of the same\nmechanism. Our strategy to analyse high-dimensional learning ANNs is universal\nand applicable to recurrent ANNs of any form. The demonstrated mechanisms of\nmemory formation and of catastrophic forgetting shed light on the operation of\na wider class of recurrent ANNs and could aid the development of approaches to\nmitigate their flaws.",

    "abstract": "In early-phase clinical trials, a predictive biomarker may identify subgroups\nthat benefit from an experimental therapy, even when the overall average\ntreatment effect is negligible. Recently proposed nonparametric interaction\ntests such as the Average Kolmogorov-Smirnov Approach (AKSA) avoid prespecified\nbiomarker cutting points and model assumptions, but their power degrades when\nthe biomarker distribution is zero-inflated. We propose a two-step test that\npartitions the analysis into a spike test for biomarker-negative patients and a\ntail test for biomarker-positive patients, then combines the resulting p-values\nusing Fisher's or Brown's method. This design isolates distinct sources of\npredictive effects, mitigates dilution, and preserves exact type I error\ncontrol through permutation calibration. We derive theoretical properties\nshowing that the proposed test retains nominal size and improves power over\nAKSA when predictive effects are concentrated in either the spike or tail\nsubpopulation. Extensive simulations confirm robust type I error control under\nvarious zero-inflation rates, sample sizes, and skewed biomarker distributions.\nWe also demonstrate consistent power gains across spike-only, tail-only, and\nmixed-effect scenarios. Our method provides a practical and flexible tool for\nearly-phase trials with sparse biomarker distributions, enabling more reliable\nidentification of predictive biomarkers to guide later-phase development.",

By using molecular dynamics simulation of a\ncoarse-grained model, it is found that initial linear scaling describes the\nfirst stage of the collision process, which is followed by power-law dynamics,\nin contrast to an initial thermal regime and a subsequent power-law behaviour\nobserved for droplet coalescence. The transition between the two regimes occurs\nfaster for surfactant-laden droplets. At higher collision velocities, the\nlinear regime dominates the process with a gradual reduction of the power-law\nbehaviour, reaching a situation in which the bridge growth is fully\ncharacterised by linear dynamics. The different behaviour of the droplets is\npresented in the form of a diagram of different scenarios, namely coalescence,\nseparation, and splattering. In particular, it is found that higher velocities\nand larger offsets increase the likelihood of separation and splattering, with\nwater droplets producing a greater number of satellite droplets due to reduced\nviscous damping. Also, a disk-like structure is observed as a result of\ncollision, but it is less pronounced in the case of surfactant-laden droplets,\ndue to higher dissipation of energy.",

Large-scale molecular\nsurveys reveal increasing chemical and physical complexity in the CMZ. A key\nstep to interpreting the molecular richness found in the CMZ is to build\nchemical templates tailored to its diverse conditions. The combined impact of\nhigh ionization, elevated temperatures, and dense gas remains insufficiently\nexplored for observable tracers. In this study, we utilized UCLCHEM, a\ngas-grain time-dependent chemical model, to link physical conditions with their\ncorresponding molecular signatures and identify key tracers of temperature,\ndensity, ionization, and shock activity. We ran a grid of models of shocks and\nprotostellar objects representative of typical CMZ conditions, focusing on\ntwenty-four species, including complex organic molecules. Shocked and\nprotostellar environments show distinct evolutionary timescales ($\\lesssim\n10^4$ vs. $\\gtrsim 10^4$ years), with 300 K emerging as a key temperature\nthreshold for chemical differentiation. We find that cosmic-ray ionization and\ntemperature are the main drivers of chemical trends.

    "abstract": "Type-Ia supernovae (SNe), or runaway thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs\n(WDs), play a critical role in the chemical evolution of galaxies, and are\nimportant cosmological distance indicators due to their 'standardizable'\nlightcurves. Growing evidence, however, suggests greater diversity in their\nobserved lightcurves (and spectra) than thought previously. This is usually\nattributed to a variety of WD explosion mechanisms and progenitor system\nproperties, but a direct link between the explosion mechanisms and Type-Ia SN\nobservables remains elusive. Here we present a novel approach to identify\nexplosion mechanisms of Type-Ia SNe, by analyzing the sizes of small-scale\nturbulent substructures of different elements in their extended ejecta, i.e.,\nin Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Our three-dimensional hydrodynamical models show\nthat substructures in an SNR dominated by iron-group elements may have a\ntypical size different from substructures dominated by intermediate mass\nelements (e.g., Si, S) in the same SNR. This size difference is governed by the\nexplosion mechanism. Applying this approach to Tycho's SNR, we find that its\nobserved structure is most consistent with the explosion of a sub-Chandrasekhar\nmass WD via the double-detonation mechanism. Extending this method to other\nwell-characterized SNRs can let us connect the inferred explosion mechanism to\nthe associated historical SNe, which often have spectra reconstructed through\nlight echo observations.",

Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.\nRegarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its\nconnection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked.

Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage\nof Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process.

Moreover,\nPass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly\ndesigning the advantage function.

The functionality of an MTJ is determined by the properties of its\nfree layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) with fixed magnetization, separated by\nan MgO tunnel barrier. This paper presents a mechanism for reconfiguring the\nRL, which is the upper layer of a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, enabling a\nreversible transition from a single-domain state to a vortex magnetic state\nwith different core positions. When the RL is in the vortex state, it generates\na spin current with a vortex-like polarization distribution, enabling stable\nvortex oscillations in the FL even in the absence of external magnetic fields.\nThis effect has been confirmed in MTJs with diameters ranging from 400 to 1000\nnm. It is demonstrated, using experimental data with comparative micromagnetic\nsimulation, that the pinning antiferromagnet retains a long term memory of\nprevious reannealing states resulting in a deformation of the vortex polarised\nspin current, which in turn introduces a strong dynamical vortex core polarity\nsymmetry breaking. The analogue reprogrammable nature of both the static and\ndynamic properties of the MTJ demonstrate different possible routes for the\nintroduction of non-volatility into radiofrequency spintronic neuromorphic\nparadigms.",

Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which\nseverely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent\npersonalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,\nwe propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via\ndual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen\nbackbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we\ndevelop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization\nand individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared\nprimary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated\nrefinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The\nanalytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains\nidentical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all\nother clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the\nsuperiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at\nleast 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum\noptimization algorithm that exploits sparsity in the Fourier spectrum of\nobjective functions, with the potential for exponential speedups over classical\nalgorithms on suitably structured problems. While highly promising in idealized\nsettings, its resilience to noise has until now been largely unexplored. To\naddress this, we conduct a rigorous analysis of DQI under noise, focusing on\nlocal depolarizing noise. For the maximum linear satisfiability problem, we\nprove that, in the presence of noise, performance is governed by a\nnoise-weighted sparsity parameter of the instance matrix, with solution quality\ndecaying exponentially as sparsity decreases. We demonstrate this decay through\nnumerical simulations on two special cases: the Optimal Polynomial Intersection\nproblem and the Maximum XOR Satisfiability problem. The Fourier-analytic\nmethods we develop can be readily adapted to other classes of random Pauli\nnoise, making our framework applicable to a broad range of noisy quantum\nsettings and offering guidance on preserving DQI's potential quantum advantage\nunder realistic noise.",

While autoregressive generative\nmodels are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,\nwhich contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent\nstudies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means\nclustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative\nmodels with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering\nperforms poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including\ntoken space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we\npropose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to\nk-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token\nsimilarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly\nused centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate\nfor the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.\nUsing an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space\ndisparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating\nlow-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play\nand integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong\nperformance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still\nstruggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects\nspecified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely\non either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity\nrepresentations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they\nstill have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects\nand overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object\ninstances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps\nof the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image\ngeneration, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at\nthe early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region\nshould be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose\n\\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to\nbe clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without\nrelying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method\npartitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time\nbased on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster\nis spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target\ndistribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\\%p in object\ncount accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity\ncontrol performance across a variety of prompts.

In this paper, we finalize the publication of near-UV imaging polarimetry\nof AGNs in the HST/FOC archives. We render available spatially resolved\npolarization maps of the [OIII] emission lines for Mrk 3 and Mrk 78, as well as\nnear-UV continuum polarization maps for Mrk 3, NGC 3862, Cygnus A, and 3C 109.\nWe used the generalized reduction pipeline presented in the first paper in this\nseries to homogeneously analyze the five remaining polarized observations of\nAGNs in the FOC archives. The polarization pattern in Mrk 3 and Mrk 78 in the\nnarrow-line regions is consistent with scattering from an obscured nucleus. For\nNGC 3862, we confirm marginal UV polarization parallel with the inner radio jet\nthat is related to synchrotron emission. In Cygnus A, we report spatially\nresolved centro-symmetric polarization patterns in the two opposite outflows,\nwhich highlights the scattering origin of the polarized light. Finally, 3C 109\nshows high nuclear polarization that is consistent with AGN-dominated emission\nand parallel with the radio axis, but differs from the polarization from\ndichroic absorption invoked by previous authors. The imaging polarimetry we\nobtained for the narrow-line region and the extended scattering medium\nsurrounding the obscured AGNs is aligned with the predictions of the unified\nAGN model and demonstrates the power of spatially resolved polarimetric\nobservation to decipher the complex morphologies at work in AGNs.",

Regulating the Stark field strength can tune the energy level structure\nof the system and the superradiant phase transition, effectively reducing\nentropy generation and quantum friction during nonequilibrium evolution of the\nsystem's states and thereby significantly increasing the engine's output work,\nefficiency, and power. Asymmetric heat engines, where the two isochoric strokes\nhave different Stark field strengths and stroke times, are more conducive to\noptimizing the heat engine's performance.

    "abstract": "Offshore wind power (OWP) exhibits significant fluctuations under typhoon\nconditions, posing substantial challenges to the secure operation of power\nsystems. Accurate forecasting of OWP is therefore essential. However, the\ninherent scarcity of historical typhoon data and stochasticity of OWP render\ntraditional point forecasting methods particularly difficult and inadequate. To\naddress this challenge and provide grid operators with the comprehensive\ninformation necessary for decision-making, this study proposes a score-based\nconditional diffusion model (SCDM) for probabilistic forecasting of OWP during\ntyphoon events. First, a knowledge graph algorithm is employed to embed\nhistorical typhoon paths as vectors. Then, a deterministic network is\nconstructed to predict the wind power under typhoon conditions based on these\nvector embeddings. Finally, to better characterize prediction errors, a\ndenoising network is developed. At the core of this approach is a\nmean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE), which transforms complex\nerror distributions into a standard Gaussian, enabling the sampling of\nforecasting errors using a reverse-time SDE. The probabilistic forecasting\nresults are reconstructed by combining deterministic forecasts with sampled\nerrors. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world data from a cluster\nof 9 offshore wind farms. Results demonstrate that under typhoon conditions,\nour approach outperforms baseline models for both deterministic and\nprobabilistic metrics, verifying the effectiveness of the approach.",

Specifically, an event\ncorrection module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image\nframes via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection\nnetwork to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling\nmodule (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image\nstructures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment.

Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD\ndatasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in\nvarious poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios.

Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training\nLLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability\nfixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging\ncurrent LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that\ntranslates language context (vulnerability description) into network\nenforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the\nOnline Agentic Validation that penalizes erroneous outputs.

    "abstract": "In the real world, a molecule is a 3D geometric structure. Compared to 1D\nSMILES sequences and 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecules represent the most\ninformative molecular modality. Despite the rapid progress of\nautoregressive-based language models, they cannot handle the generation of 3D\nmolecular conformation due to several challenges: 1) 3D molecular structures\nare incompatible with LLMs' discrete token space, 2) integrating heterogeneous\ninputs like proteins, ligands, and text remains difficult within a unified\nmodel, and 3) LLMs lack essential scientific priors, hindering the enforcement\nof physical and chemical constraints during generation. To tackle these issues,\nwe present Chem3DLLM, a unified protein-conditioned multimodal large language\nmodel. Our approach designs a novel reversible text encoding for 3D molecular\nstructures using run-length compression, achieving 3x size reduction while\npreserving complete structural information. This enables seamless integration\nof molecular geometry with protein pocket features in a single LLM\narchitecture. We employ reinforcement learning with stability-based rewards to\noptimize chemical validity and incorporate a lightweight protein embedding\nprojector for end-to-end training. Experimental results on structure-based drug\ndesign demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a Vina score of -7.21,\nvalidating our unified multimodal approach for practical drug discovery\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user\nsatisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking\ntasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large\nlanguage models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nfollowed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models\nhow to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards\nsometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency\nand personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for\npersonalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural\nlanguage feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and\nthe question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision\nsignal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and\ninternalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between\noptimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved\nresponses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at\ninference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse\ndomains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior\nquality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides\nmore effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.",

The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect\noverall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this\nmultiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the\napplication of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use\nformal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for\nmacroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with\nperiodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We\nderive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with\nthe membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry.\nOur results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to\na wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes\nwith long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling\nconditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions\nin the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes\ncalled porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily\ndominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how\nalterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin\nexpression, might affect overall transport, including when external\nconcentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of\nphysical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and\nindustrial filtration to carbon capture.",

    "abstract": "Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It\nrequires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in\noccluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many\nexisting methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views\nor train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.\nAdditionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.\nThis gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view\ntranslation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative\ncapabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from\na novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ\na camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted\nlatent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled\nusing the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,\nwe propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation\nstructure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps\npreserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we\nuse the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the\ngenerative prior of the pretrained diffusion model.

However, existing LVLMs\nfocus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human\nquality inspectors.

    "abstract": "T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization\nof the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is\nslower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on\nmultiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume\nreconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,\nT2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time\n(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this\nchallenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing\nsevere motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a\nphysics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information\nsharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo\nadult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal\nT2 mapping results at 0.55T.

This\nstudy focuses on fixed frequency air conditioners (FFACs) and proposes an\noptimization model and solution method for their participation in demand\nresponse (DR) programs. First, a probabilistic response model for FFACs is\ndeveloped based on the Markov assumption. Second, by sampling this\nprobabilistic model, the aggregate power consumption of an FFAC cluster under\ndecentralized control is obtained. Subsequently, a robust optimization model is\nformulated to maximize the profit of an aggregator managing the FFAC cluster\nduring DR events, taking into account the aggregated response power. The model\nexplicitly considers temperature uncertainty to ensure user comfort in a robust\nsense.

Existing methods typically only model\nlow-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and\nenhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been\nwidely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited\nattention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance\nmulti-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates\nglobal and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order\nspatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:\nthe global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context\nenhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal\nenhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between\nadjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we\nfurther develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential\ncross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first\nwork to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,\nsignificantly improving detection performance.

While early research focused on unconditional sampling,\npractitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise\nspecification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual\ncaching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we\nfirst profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained\ncontrol, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A\nlocality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the\ncontrol signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.\nFor temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to\nimprove efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,\nWan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image\nand video control generation without the need for training.

    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user\npreferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.\nTo achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds\nuser profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate\nrecommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep\nsemantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the\nefficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into\ndialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional\napproaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,\nwhich often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in\nrecommendations that may not align with user expectations.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender\ncentered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided\ncontext-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its\nheart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with\nknowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving\nfine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected\ninto the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a\nconversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a\nrecommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent\ncandidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task\nsemantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and\nrecommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream\nmethods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public\ndatasets.",

In\nthis paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities\ninto LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using\nstreet-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual\nquestion-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading\nto subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we\nincorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose\ncross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image\ngrafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then\nLVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through\ncross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of\ntwo-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address\nlocalization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA\ndatasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San\nFrancisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM\noutperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address\nlocalization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.",

Here, we present an alternative formulation of\nthe general spectral expansion, which clarifies the connection between the\nrelaxation dynamics of arbitrary moments and the intrinsic time scales of the\nsystem. Within this framework, we address the moment-closure problem in a way\nthat streamline the conventional treatment of open systems. The effectiveness\nof the theory is illustrated by deriving analytical expressions for two\nrepresentative cases: spectral amplification in stochastic resonance and the\nmoment dynamics of a non-Gaussian system, namely the Bessel process with\nconstant drift.

This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this\nlimitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,\nespecially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent\nhigh-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that\nintegrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information\nmaximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image\nquality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally\ninformative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we\nidentify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\\pm$27 nm) and\nreconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.\nQuantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual\nseparability of VRU from the background.

For example, impervious surfaces heat up and\nspeed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with\nconcomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth\nSystem models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric\nprocesses at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to\nforecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and\nconsequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,\nwe propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover\nchange forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem\nconditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable\nproperties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on\nimperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire\nconterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for\ndecadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline\nthat assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a\nyear held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\\geq\n0.7\\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding\ncorroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns\nfrom historical data that are significant for projecting future change.\nFinally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on\nphysical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of\ndifferent scenarios by means of driver variables.",

In this paper, we provide the\nbackground of an implementation of Isogeometric Kirchhoff--Love shells within\nthe Geometry + Simulation Modules (G+Smo). This paper accompanies multiple\nprevious publications and elaborates on the design of the software used in\nthese papers, rather than the novelty of the methods presented therein. The\npresented implementation provides patch coupling via penalty methods and\nunstructured splines, goal-oriented error estimators, several algorithms for\nstructural analysis and advanced algorithms for the modeling of wrinkling in\nhyperelastic membranes. These methods are all contained in three new modules in\nG+Smo: a module for Kirchhoff-Love shells, a module for structural analysis,\nand a module for unstructured spline constructions. As motivated in this paper,\nthe modules are implemented to be compatible with future developments. For\nexample, by providing base implementations of material laws, by using black-box\nfunctions for the structural analysis module, or by providing a standardized\napproach for the implementation of unstructured spline constructions.

Then, visually guided weighting is\napplied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from\nirrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image\nembeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text\nembeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to\nunseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference\ndynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and\nattribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.\nExtensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel\ngeneralization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot\nlearning.",

While still in its infancy, Bayesian optimization\nhas recently gained traction in bioprocess engineering. However,\nexperimentation with biological systems is highly complex and the resulting\nexperimental uncertainty requires specific extensions to classical Bayesian\noptimization. Moreover, current literature often targets readers with a strong\nstatistical background, limiting its accessibility for practitioners.\n  In light of these developments, this review has two aims: first, to provide\nan intuitive and practical introduction to Bayesian optimization; and second,\nto outline promising application areas and open algorithmic challenges, thereby\nhighlighting opportunities for future research in machine learning.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have\nbecome essential tools for anomaly detection in host systems due to their\nability to capture rich contextual and structural information, as well as their\npotential to detect unknown attacks. However, recent studies have shown that\nthese systems are vulnerable to graph manipulation attacks, where attackers\nmanipulate the graph structure to evade detection. While some previous\napproaches have discussed this type of attack, none have fully addressed it\nwith a robust detection solution, limiting the practical applicability of\nPIDSes.\n  To address this challenge, we propose MirGuard, a robust anomaly detection\nframework that combines logic-aware multi-view augmentation with contrastive\nrepresentation learning. Rather than applying arbitrary structural\nperturbations, MirGuard introduces Logic-Aware Noise Injection (LNI) to\ngenerate semantically valid graph views, ensuring that all augmentations\npreserve the underlying causal semantics of the provenance data. These views\nare then used in a Logic-Preserving Contrastive Learning framework, which\nencourages the model to learn representations that are invariant to benign\ntransformations but sensitive to adversarial inconsistencies. Comprehensive\nevaluations on multiple provenance datasets demonstrate that MirGuard\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in robustness against\nvarious graph manipulation attacks without sacrificing detection performance\nand efficiency. Our work represents the first targeted study to enhance PIDS\nagainst such adversarial threats, providing a robust and effective solution to\nmodern cybersecurity challenges.",

IoT devices suffer from\nthe inherent problem of resource constraints and are therefore susceptible to\nsuch resource-exhausting attacks. Traditional methods for detecting DDoS\nattacks are not efficient enough to cope with the dynamic nature of IoT\nnetworks, as well as the scalability of the attacks, diversity of protocols,\nhigh volume of traffic, and variability in device behavior, and variability of\nprotocols like MQTT, CoAP, making it hard to implement security across all the\nprotocols. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., the use of\nTransformer models, which have shown remarkable performance in natural language\nprocessing tasks, for detecting DDoS attacks on IoT devices. The proposed model\nextracts features from network traffic data and processes them using a\nself-attention mechanism. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional machine learning\ntechniques, which can be validated by comparing both approaches' accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1-score. The results of this study show that the\nTransformer models can be an effective solution for detecting DDoS attacks on\nIoT devices and have the potential to be deployed in real-world IoT\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) can enable precise control while maintaining low\ncomputational costs by circumventing the need for dynamic modeling. However,\nthe deployment of such black-box approaches remains challenging for heavy-duty\nwheeled mobile robots (WMRs), which are subject to strict international\nstandards and prone to faults and disturbances. We designed a hierarchical\ncontrol policy for heavy-duty WMRs, monitored by two safety layers with\ndiffering levels of authority. To this end, a DNN policy was trained and\ndeployed as the primary control strategy, providing high-precision performance\nunder nominal operating conditions. When external disturbances arise and reach\na level of intensity such that the system performance falls below a predefined\nthreshold, a low-level safety layer intervenes by deactivating the primary\ncontrol policy and activating a model-free robust adaptive control (RAC)\npolicy. This transition enables the system to continue operating while ensuring\nstability by effectively managing the inherent trade-off between system\nrobustness and responsiveness. Regardless of the control policy in use, a\nhigh-level safety layer continuously monitors system performance during\noperation. It initiates a shutdown only when disturbances become sufficiently\nsevere such that compensation is no longer viable and continued operation would\njeopardize the system or its environment. The proposed synthesis of DNN and RAC\npolicy guarantees uniform exponential stability of the entire WMR system while\nadhering to safety standards to some extent. The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach was further validated through real-time experiments using a 6,000 kg\nWMR.",

This decomposition is\nmade tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,\nallowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each\nstate. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an\nenergy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence\nlog-odds ratio-based approach to $\\Delta\\Delta G$ prediction with a new\n$\\Delta\\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate\nsuperiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep\nlearning methods in $\\Delta\\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization\nagainst SARS-CoV-2.",

The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the\nperformance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The\nresults obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the\ninstances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances\nwithin the same dataset.

Here,\ntime-resolved resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy, in conjunction with\nsimultaneous X-ray absorption imaging, is employed to investigate such complex\ndynamics in a thin copper wire driven by an optical high-intensity laser pulse,\nwith sub-picosecond temporal resolution. The diagnostic leverages the high\nbrightness and narrow spectral bandwidth of an X-ray free-electron laser, to\nselectively excite resonant transitions of highly charged ions within the hot\ndense plasma generated by the optical laser. The measurements reveal a distinct\nrise-and-fall temporal evolution of the resonant X-ray emission yield-and\nconsequently the selected ion population-over a 10 ps timescale, accompanied by\nan inversely correlated x-ray transmission. In addition, off-resonance\nemissions with comparable yields on both sides of the XFEL photon energy are\nclearly observed, indicating balanced ionization and recombination rates.\nFurthermore, experimental results are compared with comprehensive simulations\nusing atomic collisional-radiative models, PIC, and MHD codes to elucidate the\nunderlying physics. The comparison reveals that typical models overestimate the\nplasma heating under the extreme conditions achieved in our experiment,\nhighlighting the requirement for improved modeling of NLTE collisional\nprocesses for predictive capabilities.

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that\ndark-field radiography outperforms conventional radiography in diagnosing and\nstaging pulmonary diseases. However, the polychromatic nature of medical X-ray\nsources leads to beam-hardening, which introduces structured artifacts in the\ndark-field radiographs, particularly from osseous structures.

    "abstract": "Scaling laws for autoregressive generative recommenders reveal potential for\nlarger, more versatile systems but mean greater latency and training costs. To\naccelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative\nrecommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\\alpha$, identifying two efficiency\nbottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and\nthe computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that\nrelative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as\nattention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative\nforms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the\nquestion of whether some attention maps are redundant. Through empirical\nexperiments, we discovered that using the query-key attention map might degrade\nthe model's performance in recommendation tasks. To address these bottlenecks,\nwe propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation\nmodels. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which\navoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias,\nthereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key\nattention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new\nAttention-Free Token Mixer module. Furthermore, by applying this framework to\nFuXi-$\\alpha$, we introduce a new model, FuXi-$\\beta$. Experiments across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$\\beta$ outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art models and achieves significant acceleration compared to\nFuXi-$\\alpha$, while also adhering to the scaling law. Notably, FuXi-$\\beta$\nshows an improvement of 27% to 47% in the NDCG@10 metric on large-scale\nindustrial datasets compared to FuXi-$\\alpha$.

The resulting stochastic optimal control problem\nfor a noise-driven mechanical particle in a nonlinear optical potential must\naccount for unavoidable experimental imperfections such as measurement\nnonlinearities and slow drifts of the optical setup. To address these issues,\nwe simplify the model in the vicinity of the unstable equilibrium and employ\nindirect adaptive control techniques to dynamically follow changes in the\npotential landscape.

We\ndemonstrate that this strategy successfully tracks the intensity minimum and\nsignificantly reduces the nanoparticle's residual state variance, effectively\nlowering its center-of-mass temperature. While conventional optical traps rely\non confining optical forces in the light field at the intensity maxima,\ntrapping at intensity minima mitigates absorption heating, which is crucial for\nadvanced quantum experiments. Since LQG control naturally extends into the\nquantum regime, our results provide a promising pathway for future experiments\non quantum state preparation beyond the current absorption heating limitation,\nlike matter-wave interference and tests of the quantum-gravity interface.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to\nadversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their\nreal-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success\nrate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their\ntransferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to\nquery-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically\nadopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training\nloss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding\nboxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the\nattack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in\nreduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches\ntrained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on\nhigh-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving\ndatasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch\nAttack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically\noptimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,\nPractical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack\neffectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present\na tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack\ntransferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for\nhigh-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic\nScale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data\npreprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms\nstate-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,\nboth under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous\nmAP-based metrics.",

    "abstract": "Proxemics, the study of spatial behavior, is fundamental to social\ninteraction and increasingly relevant for virtual reality (VR) applications.\nWhile previous research has established that users respond to personal space\nviolations in VR similarly as in real-world settings, phase-specific\nphysiological responses and the modulating effects of facial expressions remain\nunderstudied. We investigated physiological and subjective responses to\npersonal space violations by virtual avatars, to understand how threatening\nfacial expressions and interaction phases (approach vs. standing) influence\nthese responses. Sixteen participants experienced a 2x2 factorial design\nmanipulating Personal Space (intrusion vs. respect) and Facial Expression\n(neutral vs. angry) while we recorded skin conductance response (SCR), heart\nrate variability (HRV), and discomfort ratings. Personal space boundaries were\nindividually calibrated using a stop-distance procedure. Results show that SCR\nresponses are significantly higher during the standing phase compared to the\napproach phase when personal space was violated, indicating that prolonged\nproximity within personal space boundaries is more physiologically arousing\nthan the approach itself. Angry facial expressions significantly reduced HRV,\nreflecting decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased discomfort\nratings, but did not amplify SCR responses. These findings demonstrate that\ndifferent physiological modalities capture distinct aspects of proxemic\nresponses: SCR primarily reflects spatial boundary violations, while HRV\nresponds to facial threat cues. Our results provide insights for developing\ncomprehensive multi-modal assessments of social behavior in virtual\nenvironments and inform the design of more realistic avatar interactions.",

However, their lack of\ncollaborative signals results in a misalignment with downstream discriminative\nand generative recommendation objectives. Recent studies have introduced\nvarious alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage\nframework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable\ninformation loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive\nalignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information\nmaximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method\nthat simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic\nintegrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically\nassociated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient\nalignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the\nfollowing two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative\nAlignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and\ncollaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and\nthen design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item\n(u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence\nitem-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual\nquantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads\nachieve stronger alignment. Finally, we conduct extensive offline experiments\nand online A/B tests to evaluate DAS's effectiveness, which is now successfully\ndeployed across various advertising scenarios at Kuaishou App, serving over 400\nmillion users daily.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical\nimaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts\narise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient\npopulations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need\nto train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to\nmatch local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models\ncoherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,\nremains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that\nencodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a\nshared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified\nmodels. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them\nthrough a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and\nknowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and\ndistributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two\nMedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified\nlearning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and\ntested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large\ndistribution shifts.

GJ 1132 b's co-added transmission\nspectrum is best-fit with a flat line. A thin steam atmosphere is also\nconsistent with the data, but this interpretation is driven almost entirely by\nthe first transit, which suggests an increase in cool spot coverage-fraction\nderived from the flux-calibrated stellar spectra. This demonstrates the\nimportance of always considering stellar heterogeneity evolution in multi-visit\ntransits, and also the importance of a \"leave-one-transit-out\" approach in\nmodeling efforts of co-added transits. We combine these results with MIRI/LRS\nemission data (Xue et al. 2024) to show that together, transmission and\nemission are consistent with only the thinnest of atmospheres.

Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,\nmodality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities\nof an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.\nAdditionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly\nconsistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also\nenhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.\nProject page:\n\\textcolor{brightpink}https://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/HumanSense/",

In the\npresent work, we perform detailed hydrodynamic modeling to refine and put\nrobust constraints on the progenitor and explosion parameters of SN 2024ggi.\nAmong the progenitor models in our study, the pre-SN properties of the 11\nM$_{\\odot}$ match the pre-explosion detected progenitor well.

    "abstract": "The virtual element method (VEM) is a stabilized Galerkin method that is\nrobust and accurate on general polygonal meshes. This feature makes it an\nappealing candidate for simulations involving meshes with embedded interfaces\nand evolving geometries. However, the method can yield poorly conditioned\nstiffness matrices in such scenarios due to meshes having cut cells. We propose\na novel element agglomeration algorithm for the virtual element method to\naddress this issue. The agglomeration algorithm renders the VEM robust over\nplanar polygonal meshes, particularly on finite element meshes cut by immersed\ngeometries. The algorithm relies on the element stability ratio, which we\ndefine using the extreme eigenvalues of the element stiffness matrix. The\nresulting element agglomeration criterion is free from nebulous polygon quality\nmetrics and is defined independently of polygon shapes. The algorithm proceeds\niteratively and element-wise to maximize the minimum element stability ratio,\neven at the expense of degrading elements with better ratios. Crucially,\nelement agglomeration alters the number of elements, not the degree of freedom\ncount. The resulting method, which we label as CutVEM, retains node locations\nof cut elements unchanged, and yields discretizations that conform to embedded\ninterfaces. This, in turn, facilitates straightforward imposition of boundary\nconditions and interfacial constraints. Through detailed numerical experiments\nthat sample varied element-interface intersections, we demonstrate that CutVEM\nenjoys dramatically improved condition numbers of global stiffness matrices\nover the VEM. Furthermore, simulations of prototypical heat conduction problems\nwith Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on domains with immersed\ngeometries show that element agglomeration does not noticeably degrade solution\naccuracy and that CutVEM retains the VEM's optimal convergence rate.",

We\ndemonstrate spectral accuracy and entropy stability through convergence tests,\nand validate physical fidelity via equatorial embedding diagrams of horizon\ncrossing GRMHD variables in Kerr Schild coordinates. Three dimensional scatter\nvisualizations further highlight the solver's capability to capture complex\nmagnetized plasma structures around rotating black holes. This approach paves\nthe way for high order, low dissipation GRMHD simulations on exascale\narchitectures, opening new avenues for precise modeling of strong field\nastrophysical phenomena.",

Identifying quantum advantages in these\ndomains requires a unified, first-principles framework that treats arbitrary\nquantum states of light and realistic material systems without restrictive\nassumptions.

As a\ncase study, we apply the formalism to resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization\n(REMPI) of neutral sodium atoms by momentum-entangled photons. We predict\ncross-section enhancements of several orders of magnitude compared to coherent\nlight, arising entirely from non-paraxial effects and vanishing in the paraxial\nlimit. The enhancement is strongly channel-dependent, with odd multipole\ntransitions benefiting most from favorable parity and interference conditions.\nThe predicted enhancement is accessible with current state-of-the-art photonic\nand atomic technologies, highlighting a promising avenue for exploiting quantum\nlight in high-precision ionization and spectroscopy experiments.",

However, PTQ often\nleads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT\nimposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to\nweight fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid\nquantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.\nTo address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects\ncritical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.\nContrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies\nbefore and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,\nactually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.\nThis means we better compensate for quantization errors during their\npropagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The\nproposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by\nfreezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal\nquantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as\nwell as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The\nexperimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including\nobject detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that\nour method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines.

Existing methods rely\non auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier\ninformation for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with\nreal test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic\nsupervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a\nnovel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP).

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For\nexample, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the\naverage FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous\nmethods.

While prior work\nhas acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it\nto data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first\nsystematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,\nincluding images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this\nimbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index\n(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis\nreveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested\nmodalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention\ndilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence\nof fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor\ntextual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that\neffectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for\ninstance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of\n0.86.

The numerical scheme is then applied to examine the eventual\nperiodicity of the proposed model subject to the periodic boundary conditions.\nThe implementation of proposed technique for high order fractional and integer\ntype nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) is beneficial because this\nmethod is local in nature, therefore it yields and resulted in sparse\ndifferentiation matrices instead of full and dense matrices. Only small\ndimensions of linear systems of equations are to be solved for every center in\nthe domain and hence this procedure is more reliable and efficient to solve\nlarge scale physical and engineering problems in complex domain. Laplace\ntransform is utilized for obtaining the equivalent time-independent equation in\nLaplace space and also valuable to handle time-fractional derivatives in the\nCaputo sense. Application of Laplace transform avoids the time steeping\nprocedure which commonly encounters the time instability issues. The solution\nto the transformed model is then obtained by computing the inversion of Laplace\ntransform with an appropriate contour in a complex space, which is approximated\nby trapezoidal rule with high accuracy. Also since the Laplace transform\noperator is linear, it cannot be used to transform non-linear terms therefore\nlet us use a linearization approach and an appropriate iterative scheme. The\nproposed approach is tasted for some nonlinear fractional order KdV and Burgers\nequations. The capacity, high order accuracy and efficiency of our approach are\ndemonstrated using examples and results",

    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning methods have shown promise for large-scale channel\nestimation (LCE), but their reliance on ground-truth channel labels greatly\nlimits their practicality in real-world systems. In this paper, we propose an\nunsupervised learning framework for LCE that does not require ground-truth\nchannels. The proposed approach leverages Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk\nEstimate (GSURE) as a principled unsupervised loss function, which provides an\nunbiased estimate of the projected mean-squared error (PMSE) from compressed\nnoisy measurements. To ensure a guaranteed performance, we integrate a deep\nequilibrium (DEQ) model, which implicitly represents an infinite-depth network\nby directly learning the fixed point of a parameterized iterative process. We\ntheoretically prove that, under mild conditions, the proposed GSURE-based\nunsupervised DEQ learning can achieve oracle-level supervised performance. In\nparticular, we show that the DEQ architecture inherently enforces a\ncompressible solution. We then demonstrate that DEQ-induced compressibility\nensures that optimizing the projected error via GSURE suffices to guarantee a\ngood MSE performance, enabling a rigorous performance guarantee. Extensive\nsimulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that the proposed\nframework significantly outperforms various baselines when ground-truth channel\nis unavailable.",

The recently discovered Ursa Major III/UNIONS\n1 (UMa3/U1) object, with its measured velocity dispersion, provides a rare\nobservational anchor in this regime. Despite its cluster-like compactness, its\ninferred dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M_dyn/L) suggests a dark\nmatter-dominated nature, prompting interpretations of UMa3/U1 as a microgalaxy,\nthough current measurements remain inconclusive. Thousand-level M_dyn/L values\nare not unique to galaxies; self-gravitating dark star clusters (DSCs) can\nreach comparable levels via energy injection driven by a centrally segregated\nblack hole subsystem (BHSub), which accelerates the evaporation of luminous\nstars and leads to a super-virial appearance with elevated velocity dispersion.\nTo assess whether UMa3/U1 is a DSC, we conducted direct N-body simulations and\nidentified a model that successfully reproduces both its compact structure and\nelevated M_dyn/L, supporting a self-gravitating cluster origin. We find the\ncluster entered the DSC phase around 4 Gyr ago, with its luminous stars\nexpected to be depleted within the next 1 Gyr, followed by the gradual\ndisruption of the central BHSub over the subsequent Gyr. We broaden our\nanalysis by mapping DSC evolutionary tracks in the size versus total luminosity\n(L) and M_dyn/L-L spaces, showing that DSCs occupy a region overlapping with\nfaint, ambiguous satellites.

Existing methods based on vision\ntransformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim\nto leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively\nintegrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional\nperception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to\nsimultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature\nrepresentation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to\nextract multi-scale features.

This module strengthens cross-layer\ninteraction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing\nthe model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground\nand background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder\nof GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and\nmulti-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It\nperforms adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale\nconvolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing\nMamba's local modeling capability.

While current VQA benchmarks\nconsider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically\nblend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of\nreasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic\nevaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning\nlevels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by\nprior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this\nbenchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object\nproperties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based\nquestions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings\nreveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing\nmodel only reaching 40\\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic\n(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional\nproperties, and higher counts.

    "abstract": "To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC),\nresearch in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence.\nAngle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated\nFourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation\ncapabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum\ncircuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for\nimproved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input\ndimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In\npractice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through\ntwo white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the\nrelevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable\nparameters.\n  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from\ndouble-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and\ndimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters,\nthereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential\nfrequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with\nknown interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current\nhardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two\nwhite-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional\ninterdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The\nreduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum\nsimulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.",

    "abstract": "A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model\nof language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual\nselection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major\nfacts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language\ndiversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the\ntheory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax\nand semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two\nnovel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language\npragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions\nare represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow\ngeneral inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any\nconstruction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly\napplied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics,\nand pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no\nboundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles\nof pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian\nmaximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between\nlanguage processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal\nbrains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation,\nself esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.",

The problem is typically framed as optimizing an\nLM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.\nRecently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment\nmethod that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and\nfurther improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference\ncandidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.\nHowever, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic\neffectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference\ncandidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\\times$ effectiveness\ncompared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\\times$ effectiveness for\nZephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,\nwhich divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference\ninjection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference\nfine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and\nempirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective\nalgorithm to identify the boundaries between them.

In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium\nNonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous\ntemperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration\nspace without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were\npreviously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting\nsolver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration\nspace exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry\nas RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the\nstandard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and\nscale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,\ntime-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.",

Traditional dynamical models are often\ninapplicable in these settings due to limited or sparse data, frequently\nconsisting of only a single historical trajectory. In addition, standard\nfitting approaches can introduce structural bias, particularly near the mode,\nwhere most interpretive focus lies. Using the maximum entropy principle, we\nderive a least-biased functional form constrained only by minimal prior\nknowledge, such as the starting point and estimated end. This leads to\nanalytically tractable and interpretable models.\n  We apply this method to the collapse of the Universe 25 mouse population and\nthe reindeer crash on St. Matthew Island. These case studies demonstrate the\nrobustness and flexibility of the approach in fitting diverse unimodal time\nseries with minimal assumptions. We also conduct a cross-comparison against\nestablished models, including the Richards, Skewnormal, and Generalized Gamma\nfunctions. While models typically fit their own generated data best, the\nmaximum entropy models consistently achieve the lowest off-diagonal\nroot-mean-square losses, indicating superior generalization.

However, these continual changes introduce significant\nchallenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and\nmaintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the\nchallenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined\ncontracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92%\nof compilation errors.\n  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version\nmigrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek)\nand closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these\nmodels exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes\nsignificantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt\nengineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific\nadaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.\n  Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that\nsystematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair\nmechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture\ncomprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts\nrelevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official\ndocumentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.\nExperimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our\napproach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on\nreal-world datasets, achieving near-perfect 96.97% accuracy.",

Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. Our analysis\nreveals that the predicted value of the matter density parameter $\\Omega_m$ by\nthe DESI DR2 LRG1 and LRG3+ELG1 datapoints deviates from the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM prediction and from different supernova compilations. We find that\nanalyzing the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers strongly affects the model predictions\nespecially $\\omega_0$, which shifts from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This\nsuggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is\ndriven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae\ndata, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are\nrestored to the $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in\nthe GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\\Delta =\n0$, effectively recovering $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that\nthe evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low\nredshift ($z \\lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$,\nusing a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and\nsupernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These\nresults favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\\omega_0>-1$,\n$\\omega_a<0$, and $\\omega_0+\\omega_a<-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of\nmodel evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data\nsignificantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as\nJBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when\nlow-redshift data are excluded.",

    "abstract": "Existing methods for constructing splines and Bezier curves on a Lie group G\ninvolve repeated products of exponentials deduced from local geodesics, w.r.t.\na Riemannian metric, or rely on general polynomials. Moreover, each of these\nlocal curves is supposed to start at the identity of $G$. Both assumptions may\nnot reflect the actual curve to be interpolated. This paper pursues a different\napproach to construct splines on $G$. Local curves are expressed as solutions\nof the Poisson equation on G. Therewith, the local interpolations satisfies the\nboundary conditions while respecting the geometry of $G$. A $k$th-order\napproximation of the solutions gives rise to a $k$th-order product of\nexponential (POE) spline. Algorithms for constructing 3rd- and 4th-order\nsplines are derived from closed form expressions for the approximate solutions.\nAdditionally, spline algorithms are introduced that allow prescribing a vector\nfield the curve must follow at the interpolation points. It is shown that the\nestablished algorithms, where $k$th-order POE-splines are constructed by\nconcatenating local curves starting at the identity, cannot exactly reconstruct\na $k$th-order motion. To tackle this issue, the formulations are extended by\nallowing for local curves between arbitrary points, rather than curves\nemanating from the identity. This gives rise to a global $k$th-order spline\nwith arbitrary initial conditions.

Recent approaches\ntackle the problem by modeling the conditional action distribution with\ngenerative models. One of these approaches is Diffusion Policy, which relies on\na diffusion model to denoise random points into robot action trajectories.\nWhile achieving state-of-the-art performance, it has two main drawbacks that\nmay lead the robot out of the data distribution during policy execution. First,\nthe stochasticity of the denoising process can highly impact on the quality of\ngenerated trajectory of actions. Second, being a supervised learning approach,\nit can learn data outliers from the dataset used for training. Recent work\nfocuses on mitigating these limitations by combining Diffusion Policy either\nwith large-scale training or with classical behavior cloning algorithms.\nInstead, we propose KDPE, a Kernel Density Estimation-based strategy that\nfilters out potentially harmful trajectories output of Diffusion Policy while\nkeeping a low test-time computational overhead.

Our objective is to explore how the processes at\nwork in particle-accelerating colliding-wind binaries (PACWBs) alter their\nspectral energy distribution, following a simple phenomenological description.\nWe focus mainly on the role of free-free absorption (FFA) at low frequencies.\nOur intention is to use WR 147 as a test case, before tentatively extrapolating\nto a more generic behaviour. We processed recent Karl G. Jansky Very Large\nArray data, optimised for spectral analysis, combined with older measurements\npublished in the literature at other frequencies. We analysed the radio\nspectrum considering both a more classical foreground free-free absorption\n(f-FFA) model and, for the first time, an internal free--free absorption\n(i-FFA) model. Our results show that the f-FFA model does not reproduce the\nspectral energy distribution of WR 147 at low frequencies. The i-FFA model is\nmore efficient in providing a more complete description of the SED down to 610\nMHz. This model is the only one to account for a change in the spectral index\nat low frequencies without any exponential drop in flux, as predicted by the\nf-FFA model. In addition, the upper limit at 150 MHz shows that two turnovers\noccur in the radio spectrum of WR 147, suggesting the effect of both i-FFA and\nf-FFA is seen in two regions of the spectrum.

Although advanced\nSpatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) and pre-trained models have\nachieved significant progress in traffic prediction, two key challenges remain:\n(i) limited contextual capacity when modeling complex spatio-temporal\ndependencies, and (ii) low predictability at fine-grained spatio-temporal\npoints due to heterogeneous patterns. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), we propose RAST, a universal framework that integrates\nretrieval-augmented mechanisms with spatio-temporal modeling to address these\nchallenges. Our framework consists of three key designs: 1) Decoupled Encoder\nand Query Generator to capture decoupled spatial and temporal features and\nconstruct a fusion query via residual fusion; 2) Spatio-temporal Retrieval\nStore and Retrievers to maintain and retrieve vectorized fine-grained patterns;\nand 3) Universal Backbone Predictor that flexibly accommodates pre-trained\nSTGNNs or simple MLP predictors. Extensive experiments on six real-world\ntraffic networks, including large-scale datasets, demonstrate that RAST\nachieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency.",

However, it has been argued that\nwhen resolving data values, local merges are often more appropriate, as e.g.\nsome instances of 'J.

PASS also continuously compresses salient\nfindings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding\nwhether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency.

In evaluations\nacross rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis\nsetting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic\naccuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than\nstate-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained\nanalyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,\nwith expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable\nsubstitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,\ntraditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process\nto drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and\naccurate diagnostic solution.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for\nnon-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by\nlarge model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization\n(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language\nModels (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced\ngeneralization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a\n16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key\nmechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -\nclash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation\nand dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding\nsteps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;\n2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during\niteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps\nprogress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,\nmaking overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To\naddress these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,\nwhich incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling\n(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with\nthe capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware\nActivation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's\ninteraction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)\nCertainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token\nscores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight\nquantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves\nsignificant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.",

Therefore, in this work, we use second order\nstatistics to investigate the spatio-temporal behaviour of a single-user (SU)\nRIS system. Assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) RIS to base station (BS) link, we\nderive an exact expression for the level crossing rate (LCR) of the RIS link\n(user equipment (UE)-RIS-BS path) and propose a numerically stable\napproximation for the LCR of the global UE-BS channel. Each LCR expression\nattained is then utilised to find the corresponding average fade duration\n(AFD). The temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) correlation is also derived\nassuming an LoS RIS-BS link. Assuming a Ricean RIS-BS link, expressions for the\nspatial correlation matrix of the global channel and the mean SNR loss due to\nchannel ageing are derived. All of the analyses are verified by simulation, and\nthe impact of key system parameters is investigated. We show that the use of an\nRIS does not significantly amplify changes in the channel.",

Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents\nfeature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic\naccuracy.

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide\ntailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a\ndedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual\ninformation-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.\nBy calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism\ncorrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of\nmutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,\nminority-class features.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in\ncomputer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural\ndependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains\nlargely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical\napplications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability\ntechniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight\ninto individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a\nself-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation\nas part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured\ncontext vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,\nclustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A\nlightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation\nvector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent\nembedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural\nlanguage explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)\nguiding the GNN itself via a \"text-injection\" mechanism that feeds explanations\nback into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph\ndatasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,\nand GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive\nclassification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.\nRepository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.",

    "abstract": "Real-world trajectories are often sparse with low-sampling rates (i.e., long\nintervals between consecutive GPS points) and misaligned with road networks,\nyet many applications demand high-quality data for optimal performance. To\nimprove data quality with sparse trajectories as input, we systematically study\ntwo related research problems: trajectory recovery on road network, which aims\nto infer missing points to recover high-sampling trajectories, and map\nmatching, which aims to map GPS points to road segments to determine underlying\nroutes. In this paper, we present efficient methods TRMMA and MMA for accurate\ntrajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, where MMA serves as the\nfirst step of TRMMA. In MMA, we carefully formulate a classification task to\nmap a GPS point from sparse trajectories to a road segment over a small\ncandidate segment set, rather than the entire road network. We develop\ntechniques in MMA to generate effective embeddings that capture the patterns of\nGPS data, directional information, and road segments, to accurately align\nsparse trajectories to routes. For trajectory recovery, TRMMA focuses on the\nsegments in the route returned by MMA to infer missing points with position\nratios on road segments, producing high-sampling trajectories efficiently by\navoiding evaluation of all road segments. Specifically, in TRMMA, we design a\ndual-transformer encoding process to cohesively capture latent patterns in\ntrajectories and routes, and an effective decoding technique to sequentially\npredict the position ratios and road segments of missing points. We conduct\nextensive experiments to compare TRMMA and MMA with numerous existing methods\nfor trajectory recovery and map matching, respectively, on 4 large real-world\ndatasets.

To be truly useful in practice, such explanations\nmust be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data\ndistribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches\noften enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted\nconstraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability\nand ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,\nthey rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations\nthat are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon.

RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature\ndependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the\njoint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual\ninstances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they\ncannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during\noptimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate\nthat RealAC balances realism with actionability.

Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function\nto supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token\nselection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used\nVSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark\nmodels, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and\nover 22.7\\% complexity reduction (in MACs).

The package supports binary\nand aggregated binomial responses, allows flexible choices of kernel functions\nand prior specification, and provides loss-based kernel hyperparameter tuning\nprocedures. In addition, BKP extends naturally to the Dirichlet Kernel Process\n(DKP) for modeling spatially varying multinomial or compositional data. To our\nknowledge, this is the first publicly available R package for implementing\nBKP-based methods. We illustrate the use of BKP through several synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, highlighting its interpretability, accuracy, and\nscalability.

    "abstract": "Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a widely recommended method for\nanalysing complex system safety. STPA can identify numerous Unsafe Control\nActions (UCAs) and requirements depending on the level of granularity of the\nanalysis and the complexity of the system being analysed. Managing numerous\nresults is challenging, especially during a fast-paced development lifecycle.\nExtensive research has been done to optimize the efficiency of managing and\nprioritising the STPA results. However, maintaining the objectivity of\nprioritisation and communicating the prioritised results have become common\nchallenges. In this paper, the authors present a complementary approach that\nincorporates inputs from both the safety analysts and domain experts to more\nobjectively prioritise UCAs. This is done by evaluating the severity of each\nUCA, the impact factor of each controller or decision maker that issues the\nUCA, and the ranking provided by the subject matter experts who assess the UCA\ncriticalities based on different factors. In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation\nis introduced to reduce subjectivity and relativity, thus enabling more\nobjective prioritisation of the UCAs. As part of the approach to better\ncommunicate the prioritisation results and plan the next steps of system\ndevelopment, a dynamic-scaling prioritisation matrix was developed to capture\ndifferent sets of prioritised UCAs. The approach was applied to a real project\nto improve the safe operations of Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing\n(eVTOL). The results highlighted critical UCAs that need to be prioritised for\nsafer eVTOL operation. 318 UCAs were identified in total. Based on the\napplication of the prioritisation methodology, 110 were recognized as\nhigh-priority UCAs to strengthen the system design.",

    "abstract": "Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world\napplications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the\ncomplementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing\nmethods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results\nfor both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object\nDetection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The\narchitecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative\nTeacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality\nbranch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The\nteacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,\nsimultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative\ndesign enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to\nthe unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.\nTo further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label\nquality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)\nthat trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding\nthe learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In\naddition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels\nacross modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.\nExtensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).",

The\nvalue is altered by excitation processes (electron impact or UV\nphotoexcitation) from the metastable upper level of the forbidden line, thereby\nconstraining the electron density or UV field intensity. The diagnostic has\nbeen applied mostly in electron density constraints in collisionally ionized\nplasmas using low-Z elements as was originally proposed for the Sun (Gabriel &\nJordan (1969a, MNRAS, 145, 241)), but it can also be used in photoionized\nplasmas. To make use of this diagnostic, we need to know its value in the limit\nof no excitation of metastables (R$_0$), which depends on the element, how the\nplasmas are formed, how the lines are propagated, and the spectral resolution\naffecting line blending principally with satellite lines from Li-like ions. We\nbenchmark R$_0$ for photoionized plasmas by comparing calculations using\nradiative transfer codes and observation data taken with the Resolve X-ray\nmicrocalorimter onboard XRISM. We use the Fe XXV He$\\alpha$ line complex of the\nphoto-ionized plasma in Centaurus X-3 observed during eclipse, in which the\nplasma is expected to be in the limit of no metastable excitation. The measured\nR$ = 0.65 \\pm 0.08$ is consistent with the value calculated using xstar for the\nplasma parameters derived from other line ratios of the spectrum.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive\ncapabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical\nreasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and\nmethod optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive\nknowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,\nwe introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured\nmathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance\nthe mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math\n2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level\nhierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental\nprinciples. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a\ndataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual\nexpansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and\ngenerate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a\nchallenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a\ntwo-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the\nmodel with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive\nAlignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to\nachieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We\nintroduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with\ndiverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that\nMathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used\nbenchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising\ngeneralization in mathematical reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb\nnew object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all\nwhile preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce\nContrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier\nattempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise\nconfusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,\nwe model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which\nemphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the\nspecificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an\nadaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a\nlearnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an\nadjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship\nbetween the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.\nMeanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is\nintroduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual\nprompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the\ncorrelation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a\nconcise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive\nexperiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that\nCRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the\nlong-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification\nperformance.

Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of\nMIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for\nglobal evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict\nthe same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a\nhighly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic\nimplementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between\nencryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run,\nreflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses\nand attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails.

We consider a continuous transmission system and focus on the design\nof the transmission signal and a receiving filter in the time domain for an\ninterleaved transmission architecture. For communication performance,\nconstructive interference (CI) is integrated into the optimization problem. For\nradar sensing performance, the integrated mainlobe-to-sidelobe ratio (IMSR) of\nthe beampattern is considered to ensure desirable directivity. Additionally, we\ntackle the challenges of inter-block interference and eliminate the spurious\npeaks, which are crucial for accurate target detection. Regarding the hardware\nimplementation aspect, the power of each time sample is constrained to manage\nthe peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The design problem is addressed using\nan alternating optimization (AO) framework, with the subproblem for transmitted\nwaveform design being solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA)\nmethod. To further enhance computational efficiency, the alternate direction\npenalty method (ADPM) is employed to solve the subproblems within the SCA\niterations. The convergence of ADPM is established, with convergence of the\ncase of more than two auxiliary variables being established for the first time.\nNumerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our transceiver design in\nachieving desirable performance in both radar sensing and communication, with\nthe fast algorithm achieving comparable performance with greater computational\nefficiency.",

Building on this\nobservation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the\ntask loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and\nefficient activations.

To address\nthese issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for\nRobust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two\ncomplementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated\nmedical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from\nreal-world EHRs.

Our model\nachieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and\nmaintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings.

    "abstract": "Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging\ndomain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving\nrelations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning\nover extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches\nremain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall\nshort due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often\noverlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within\nlong-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle\nthat narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving\ninterplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,\nanalogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the\nbrain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes\niterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.\nIn each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,\nthen integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory\npool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query\nresolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+\ntokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative\ngains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals\nthat ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global\ncomprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for\nretrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning.

In this work, we investigate the Lense-Thirring\nprecession of the spherical orbits in the Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime, with\nparticular emphasis on its connection to recent observations of black hole jet\nprecession. We analyze the reflection symmetry breaking in trajectories of the\nspherical orbits and extract their precession angular velocity. It is worth\nnoting that in the absence of spin, the spherical orbits reduce to tilted\ncircular orbits without precession, whereas for nonzero spin, the precession\nangular velocity increases with the absolute value of the NUT charge. We then\nmodel the motion of particles near the warp radius of a tilted accretion disk\nusing the spherical orbits and constrain the black hole parameter space based\non the observed jet precession of M87*. The results indicate that regions with\nlow spin and large NUT charge were excluded, and that the jet precession\nmeasurements cannot distinguish the sign of the NUT charge. The excluded region\nis larger for retrograde accretion disks than for prograde ones. We also find\nthat this observation do not allow a clear distinction between black holes and\nnaked singularities.

Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression with Delta\nVector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention mechanism,\nenabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions where it\nwould otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise suppression\nin personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which previous baselines\nwere unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly outperforms existing methods, both in terms of\nquantitative and qualitative metrics.",

Different from conventional LSRTM for\nrecovering only velocity perturbation with variable density, we focus on\nsimultaneous reconstruction of velocity and impedance perturbations after\nlogorithmic scaling, using the first-order velocity-pressure formulation of\nacoustic wave equation. The first 3D data-domain LSRTM example has been\nperformed to validate our implementation, involving expensive repetition of\nBorn modelling and migration over a number of iterations.

By using its solutions for the displacement and velocity of the\nBP, we calculate the angular momentum for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck thermal noise.\nAt long times, when the system should reach equilibrium, this momentum and,\nconsequently, the classical magnetic moment of the BP are nonzero, in contrast\nto the BvL theorem. With the help of analytical and precise numerical\ncalculations for different sets of system parameters, a simple formula for the\nangular momentum has been deduced.",

    "abstract": "Inferring seabed topography from wave height observations is fundamental to\ntsunami hazard assessment, coastal planning, and large scale ocean circulation\nmodeling. Classical inversion models typically rely on direct sensing or\noptimization based schemes that must contend with the strongly nonlinear\ncoupling between free surface dynamics and topography. However, data driven\napproaches are capable of tackling strongly nonlinear problems by learning the\nunderlying data distributions. This study introduces DiffTopo, a conditional\ndiffusion model that reconstructs topography from surface wave field data\ngoverned by shallow water equations. Leveraging classifier free guidance,\nDiffTopo not only generates a series of solutions but also applies a\nthresholding mechanism that ensures, via the solver, the validation results are\nphysically plausible. This study evaluates both observed wave fields and three\ndistinct topography configurations, demonstrating that DiffTopo exhibits robust\ngeneralization and remains consistent with the shallow water equations even\nunder full observations.

    "abstract": "Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream\napplications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial\nmemory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities\nhave steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few\ndecades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates\nthe challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade\nincreased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present\nXQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude\nreduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial\naccuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.\nWe accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,\ninstead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and\nValues on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\\times$\nmemory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to\n$\\sim 7.7\\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to\nthe FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values\nare similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce\nXQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for\nextreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to\n10$\\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01\nperplexity degradation, and 12.5$\\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$\nperplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute\ncapabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while\nsurpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving\nnear-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large\nLanguage Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is\noften compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete\ninformation. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

    "abstract": "While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or\nexplicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)\nlabel imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous\nobject boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,\nsuch mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data\naugmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and\nits label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's\ngeneralization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel\naugmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to\naddress such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing\ncontrolled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving\nthe original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust\nrepresentations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves\nperformance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in\naverage on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even\nwithout bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit\nlabel noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other\ntraining tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.",

    "abstract": "Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality\nimages but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to\nlimited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In\nthis work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation\nmaps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior\napproaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as\nconditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their\ncorresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the\nunderlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic\nimages. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a\nlarge image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for\nadditional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate\nvarious intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an\nautoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models\n(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by\ncarefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect\neach other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural\nlayout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the\nbase model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).",

In home-care\nscenarios, exoskeletons are expected to adapt their assistive configurations\nbased on the semantic information of the task, adjusting appropriately in\naccordance with the nature of the object being manipulated. However, existing\nsolutions often lack the ability to understand task semantics or\ncollaboratively plan actions with the user, limiting their generalizability. To\naddress this challenge, this paper introduces a semantic-aware framework that\nintegrates large language models into the task planning framework, enabling the\ndelivery of safe and intent-integrative assistance. The proposed approach\nbegins with the exoskeleton operating in transparent mode to capture the\nwearer's intent during object grasping. Once semantic information is extracted\nfrom the task description, the system automatically configures appropriate\nassistive parameters. In addition, a diffusion-based anomaly detector is used\nto continuously monitor the state of human-robot interaction and trigger\nreal-time replanning in response to detected anomalies. During task execution,\nonline trajectory refinement and impedance control are used to ensure safety\nand regulate human-robot interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method effectively aligns with the wearer's cognition, adapts to\nsemantically varying tasks, and responds reliably to anomalies.",

Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired\nmethod to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to\njudge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This\nmethodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the\npreviously reported.

Datasets often lack public accessibility, completeness, or\naudiologically relevant labels, hindering systematic comparison of machine\nlearning models. Deploying these models on resource-constrained edge devices\npresents another challenge. Our solution is two-fold: we leverage several open\nsource datasets to create AHEAD-DS, a dataset designed for scene recognition of\naudiologically relevant environments, and introduce YAMNet+, a sound\nrecognition model. AHEAD-DS aims to provide a standardised, publicly available\ndataset with consistent labels relevant to hearing aids, facilitating model\ncomparison. YAMNet+ is designed for deployment on edge devices like smartphones\nconnected to hearing devices, such as hearing aids and wireless earphones with\nhearing aid functionality; serving as a baseline model for sound-based scene\nrecognition. YAMNet+ achieved a mean average precision of 0.83 and accuracy of\n0.93 on the testing set of AHEAD-DS across fourteen categories of\naudiologically relevant environments. We found that applying transfer learning\nfrom the pretrained YAMNet model was essential. We demonstrated real-time\nsound-based scene recognition capabilities on edge devices by deploying YAMNet+\nto an Android smartphone. Even with a Google Pixel 3 (a phone with modest\nspecifications, released in 2018), the model processes audio with approximately\n50ms of latency to load the model, and an approximate linear increase of 30ms\nper 1 second of audio.

However, interpreting\ntime-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation\neffects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and\nbeam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort\nboth geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it\ndifficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model\nmaterial dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,\na time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and\nradiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially\nvarying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or\nregistration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically\nheuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural\nevolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,\nAtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data.

Literature suggests that\nstatic representations of motion in sketches may not achieve the intended\nfunctionality when realised, because it primarily depends on the designers'\nmental capabilities for motion simulation. Thus, it is important to understand\nthe cognitive phenomena when designers are exploring concepts of articulated\nproducts. The current work is an attempt to understand design neurocognition by\ncategorising the tasks and measuring the mental effort involved in these tasks\nusing EEG. The analysis is intended to validate design intervention tools to\nsupport the conceptual design involving motion exploration. A novel EEG-based\nmetric, inter-Band Relative Power Difference (inter-BRPD), is introduced to\nquantify mental effort. A design experiment is conducted with 32 participants,\nwhere they have to perform one control task and 2 focus tasks corresponding to\nthe motion exploration task (MET) and the concept generation task (CGT),\nrespectively. EEG data is recorded during the 3 tasks, cleaned, processed and\nanalysed using the MNE library in Python. It is observed from the results that\ninter-BRPD captures the essence of mental effort with half the number of\nconventionally used parameters. The reliability and efficacy of the inter-BRPD\nmetric are also statistically validated against literature-based cognitive\nmetrics.

    "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities present in a code that has been written in diverse\nprogramming languages are among the most critical yet complicated aspects of\nsource code to detect. Static analysis tools based on rule-based patterns\nusually do not work well at detecting the context-dependent bugs and lead to\nhigh false positive rates. Recent developments in artificial intelligence,\nspecifically the use of transformer-based models like CodeBERT and CodeLlama,\nprovide light to this problem, as they show potential in finding such flaws\nbetter. This paper presents the implementations of these models on various\ndatasets of code vulnerability, showing how off-the-shelf models can\nsuccessfully produce predictive capacity in models through dynamic fine-tuning\nof the models on vulnerable and safe code fragments. The methodology comprises\nthe gathering of the dataset, normalization of the language, fine-tuning of the\nmodel, and incorporation of ensemble learning and explainable AI. Experiments\nshow that a well-trained CodeBERT can be as good as or even better than some\nexisting static analyzers in terms of accuracy greater than 97%. Further study\nhas indicated that although language models can achieve close-to-perfect\nrecall, the precision can decrease. A solution to this is given by hybrid\nmodels and validation procedures, which will reduce false positives. According\nto the results, the AI-based solutions generalize to different programming\nlanguages and classes of vulnerability. Nevertheless, robustness,\ninterpretability, and deployment readiness are still being developed. The\nresults illustrate the probabilities that AI will enhance the trustworthiness\nin the usability and scalability of machine-learning-based detectors of\nvulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)\nto adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter\nupdates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter\ninteraction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for\ntransfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on\nlow-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model\nfine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a\nlightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically\ndiverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and\ntransferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual\nSoft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly\ntrained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective\nfor target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and\nlanguage-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a\nconsistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while\nhybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.",

Methods: Glo-UMF decouples\nquantification tasks by constructing three dedicated deep models: an\nultrastructure segmentation model, a glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) region\nclassification model, and an electron-dense deposits (EDD) detection model.\nTheir outputs are integrated through a post-processing workflow with adaptive\nGFB cropping and measurement location screening, enhancing measurement\nreliability and providing comprehensive quantitative results that overcome the\nlimitations of traditional grading. Results: Trained on 372 electron microscopy\nimages, Glo-UMF enables simultaneous quantification of glomerular basement\nmembrane (GBM) thickness, the degree of foot process effacement (FPE), and EDD\nlocation. In 115 test cases spanning 9 renal pathological types, the automated\nquantification results showed strong agreement with pathological reports, with\nan average processing time of 4.23$\\pm$0.48 seconds per case on a CPU\nenvironment. Conclusions: The modular design of Glo-UMF allows for flexible\nextensibility, supporting the joint quantification of multiple features.

We prove that learnability requires full\nrank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of\ndistribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to\nsemantic distortion.

By combining in situ\nsynchrotron X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy under\nhigh-pressure conditions with first-principles calculations, we capture a\npressure-induced phase transition from the hexagonal wurtzite to the cubic\nrocksalt structure near 10 GPa. This transformation is accompanied by complete\nquenching of the D0 - FJ Europium emissions near the transition threshold,\nfollowed by a partial recovery at higher pressures, likely associated with the\nemergence of structural disorder. Concurrently, the Stark components of the\nemission bands exhibit a redshift and significant broadening with increasing\npressure, reflecting enhanced crystal field strength as interatomic distances\ndecrease. Additional first-principles calculations support the observed\npressure-induced shifts in the Eu-4f states and emphasize the influence of\nlattice symmetry on their electronic environment. These results show that\nhydrostatic pressure is an effective way to adjust the optical emissions of\nrare-earth ions by changing their symmetry and local environment, providing a\nbasis for designing photonic devices and luminescent materials controlled by\npressure.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable\npolicy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region\nPolicy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each\nagent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,\nespecially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose\ntwo approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:\nHATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes\nthreshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy\nalgorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By\nconnecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold\nscheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in\nheterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods\nsignificantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and\nhigher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and\nHATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding\n22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as\nreflected by its lower variance.",

Comparison\nwith published profiles at other frequencies supports previous studies\nsuggesting that the pulse component separations of MSPs vary negligibly over a\nwide frequency range due to their compact magnetospheres. We observe that\nintegrated pulse profiles tend to be more polarised at low frequencies,\nconsistent with depolarisation due to superposed orthogonal polarisation modes.\nThe results of this census will be a valuable resource for planning future MSP\nmonitoring projects at low frequencies, and will also help to improve survey\nsimulations to forecast the detectable MSP population with the SKA-Low.",

The second,\nthe \"Perception-Sensitive Group\", includes older working women and residents of\nless urbanized areas. Their decisions are shaped by perceived risk and safety\nconcerns; notably, high-frequency use or essential nighttime commuting needs\nmay reinforce rather than alleviate avoidance behaviors. The findings\nunderscore the need for differentiated strategies: platforms should tailor\nsafety features and user interfaces by subgroup, policymakers must develop\ntargeted interventions, and female users can benefit from more personalized\nrisk mitigation strategies.

It is normally assumed that the\nwavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the\nwavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during\ntransmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a\nrelative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum\nsignals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key\ntransfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine\nlearning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light\nconversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into\nthe Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase\nmeasurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed\nsimulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new\nalgorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may\nexist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference\npulses and quantum signals.

In this\nwork, a parameterization method based on generative latent diffusion models\n(LDMs) is developed for 3D channel-levee-mud systems. Geomodels with variable\nscenario parameters, specifically mud fraction, channel orientation, and\nchannel width, are considered.

New realizations constructed using\nthe LDM procedure are shown to closely resemble reference geomodels, both\nvisually and in terms of one- and two-point spatial statistics. Flow response\ndistributions, for a specified set of injection and production wells, are also\nshown to be in close agreement between the two sets of models.

While deep-learning-based\nmethods enable single-step artifact suppression, they often produce\nover-smoothed results under significant sparsity. Though diffusion models\nimprove reconstruction via iterative refinement and generative priors, they\nrequire hundreds of sampling steps and struggle with stability in highly sparse\nregimes. To tackle these concerns, we present the Cross-view Generalized\nDiffusion Model (CvG-Diff), which reformulates sparse-view CT reconstruction as\na generalized diffusion process.

To address the inherent artifact propagation and inefficiency of\nsequential sampling in generalized diffusion model, we introduce two\ninnovations: Error-Propagating Composite Training (EPCT), which facilitates\nidentifying error-prone regions and suppresses propagated artifacts, and\nSemantic-Prioritized Dual-Phase Sampling (SPDPS), an adaptive strategy that\nprioritizes semantic correctness before detail refinement. Together, these\ninnovations enable CvG-Diff to achieve high-quality reconstructions with\nminimal iterations, achieving 38.34 dB PSNR and 0.9518 SSIM for 18-view CT\nusing only \\textbf{10} steps on AAPM-LDCT dataset.

    "abstract": "The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time\nrequired for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks\ninherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,\nnecessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we\npropose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content\nquality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our\nevaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of\ncited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements\nwithin the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published\nsurvey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we\napply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and\nestablish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an\nagent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes\ngenerated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the\nfaithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating\nnon-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate\nthat commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and\nGoogle consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than\nstandalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains\nsubstantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research\ncoverage, as well as factual consistency.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present\npromising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.\nHowever, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic\ncorrelations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained\ncollaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively\nweaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through\nLLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based\nsequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or\neven enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and\ncollaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that\nincorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified\nusing a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant\nhigh-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively\npreserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative\npreservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a\nconnection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier\nfilters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain\nfilters. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nFreLLM4Rec successfully mitigates collaborative signal attenuation and achieves\ncompetitive performance, with improvements of up to 8.00\\% in NDCG@10 over the\nbest baseline. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs process\ncollaborative information and offer a principled approach for improving\nLLM-based recommendation systems.",

To support\nlearners in these new contexts, it is essential to understand how SRL unfolds\nduring interaction with GenAI tools. Learning analytics offers powerful\ntechniques for analyzing digital trace data to infer SRL behaviors. However,\nexisting approaches often assume SRL processes are linear, segmented, and\nnon-overlapping-assumptions that overlook the dynamic, recursive, and\nnon-linear nature of real-world learning. We address this by conceptualizing\nSRL as a layered system: observable learning patterns reflect hidden tactics\n(short, purposeful action states), which combine into broader SRL strategies.\nUsing Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), we analyzed trace data from higher education\nstudents engaged in GenAI-assisted academic writing. We identified three\ndistinct groups of learners, each characterized by different SRL strategies.\nThese groups showed significant differences in performance, indicating that\nstudents' use of different SRL strategies in GenAI-assisted writing led to\nvarying task outcomes.

As they\nevolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they\nreproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining\nhegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on\nquantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which\nbiases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,\ndiscursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of\nLLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate\ngender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one\nproposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the\nprecise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better\nconditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as\ntied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery\nprocesses. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized\ndiscursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social\nimmobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial\nrevisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in\nfostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological\nfunctioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use\nand development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,\ninterdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how\nLLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.",

As\nmodel complexity grows, accelerator design spaces have expanded to O(10^17),\nbecoming highly irregular, non-convex, and exhibiting many-to-one mappings from\ndesign configurations to performance metrics. This complexity renders direct\ninverse derivation infeasible and necessitates heuristic or sampling-based\noptimization. Conventional methods - including Bayesian optimization, gradient\ndescent, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms - depend on iterative\nsampling, resulting in long runtimes and sensitivity to initialization. Deep\nlearning-based approaches have reframed DSE as classification using\nrecommendation models, but remain limited to small-scale (O(10^3)), less\ncomplex design spaces. To overcome these constraints, we propose a generative\napproach that models hardware design as 1-D image synthesis conditioned on\ntarget performance, enabling efficient learning of non-differentiable,\nnon-bijective hardware-performance mappings. Our framework achieves 0.86% lower\ngeneration error than Bayesian optimization with a 17000x speedup, and\noutperforms GANDSE with 30% lower error at only 1.83x slower search.

With large\nfoundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL\nthrough cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the\nrapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients\nto quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon\npast experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced\nInitialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and\ncross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations\nfor learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering\nprocess at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the\noptimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and\nwithin each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer\nfor each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and\nintra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that\ncollaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and\noptimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,\nincluding dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's\nadvantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously\nmodel this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional\nconsistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we\npropose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from\nvisual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically\ninterpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE\nmodels neural representations as continuous probability distributions via\nprobabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual\nsemantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic\ntransmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response\nmanifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in\nsubject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain\nadapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes\nhigh-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited\nfMRI-to-image decoding performance.

However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the\nnonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different\nspectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency\nweighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method\nto improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method\nconsists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity\nindex measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,\nPCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural\ndetails, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine\nmatching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models\nbetween two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,\nmutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of\nnoise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the\nWLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the\nperformance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to\ninfrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and\nvisible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images.

We\nbegin by establishing the quasi-orthogonality properties of CPM-SS sequences.\nThe first scheme, termed IM-CPM-SS, employs index modulation (IM) to select\nspreading sequences from the CPM-SS set, thereby improving spectral efficiency\nwhile maintaining the constant-envelope property.

Current techniques also fail to adequately address the multi-layer\nnature of social networks and node heterogeneity. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes Inf-MDE, a novel multi-layer influence maximization method\nleveraging differentiated graph embedding. Inf-MDE models social relationships\nusing a multi-layer network structure. The model extracts a self-influence\npropagation subgraph to eliminate the representation bias between node\nembeddings and propagation dynamics. Additionally, Inf-MDE incorporates an\nadaptive local influence aggregation mechanism within its GNN design. This\nmechanism dynamically adjusts influence feature aggregation during message\npassing based on local context and influence intensity, enabling it to\neffectively capture both inter-layer propagation heterogeneity and intra-layer\ndiffusion dynamics. Extensive experiments across four distinct multi-layer\nsocial network datasets demonstrate that Inf-MDE significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

While current systems have demonstrated momentum\nseparations of several hundreds of photon momenta, next-generation quantum\nsensors are targeting an LMT enhancement factor beyond $10^4$. However, the\nviability of LMT clock interferometers has recently come into question due to\nthe potential impact of laser frequency noise. Here, we resolve this concern by\nanalyzing the cumulative fidelity of sequential state inversions in an LMT atom\ninterferometer. We show that the population error from $n$ pulses applied from\nalternating directions scales linearly with $n$. This is a significant\nadvantage over the $n^2$ scaling that occurs when probing a two-level system\n$n$ times from the same direction. We further show that contributions to the\ninterferometer signal from parasitic paths generated by imperfect pulses are\nnegligible, for any loss mechanism.

    "abstract": "Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various\ndomains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing\nthe type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective\nperformance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level\nknowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While\nrecent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action\nSegmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:\nthe annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the\ninherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In\nthis work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that\nexplicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic\nprocedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure\nSkating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines\ncontrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.\nFor view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first\npublicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.\nSecond, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry\n(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the\nprocedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on\nelement-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation\nlevels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is\nparticularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the\npracticality of our approach in real-world scenarios.",

By introducing a\npolarization-maintaining fiber (PMF), the enhanced birefringence in the cavity\ninduces the differential group delay (DGD) between the polarization components\nof the pulse, leading to soliton splitting and, ultimately, the formation of\nmulti-soliton states. These multi-solitons, affected by intracavity nonlinear\nand dissipative effects, form attractors consisting of one to seven soliton\npulses. Through a combination of experiments and numerical simulations, we\nsystematically investigate the robustness and dynamical behavior of the\nmultipulse soliton attractors. In this context, we analyze disturbances\nintroduced by \"rogue\" solitons with different frequencies and conduct a\ncomprehensive study of their interaction with the multipulse soliton\nattractors. The results show that the multipulse soliton attractors are\nstructurally stable and highly resistant to external disturbances, highlighting\ntheir potential for high-precision fiber lasers and advanced multipulse\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "What grounds the rule of thumb that a(n American) retiree can safely withdraw\n4% of their initial retirement wealth in their first year of retirement, then\nincrease that rate of consumption with inflation? I investigate that question\nwith a discrete-time model of returns to a retirement portfolio consumed at a\nrate that grows by $s$ per period. The model hinges on the parameter $\\gamma$,\nan $s$-adjusted rate of return to wealth, derived from the first 2-4 moments of\nthe portfolio's probability distribution of returns; for a retirement lasting\n$t$ periods the model recommends a rate of consumption of $\\gamma / (1 - (1 -\n\\gamma)^t)$. Estimation of $\\gamma$ (and hence of the implied rate of spending\ndown in retirement) reveals that the 4% rule emerges from adjusting high\nexpected rates of return down for: consumption growth, the variance in (and\nkurtosis of) returns to wealth, the longevity risk of a retiree potentially\nunderestimating $t$, and the inclusion of bonds in retirement portfolios\nwithout leverage. The model supports leverage of retirement portfolios\ndominated by the S&P 500, with leverage ratios $> 1.6$ having been historically\noptimal under the model's approximations. Historical simulations of 30-year\nretirements suggest that the model proposes withdrawal rates having roughly\neven odds of success, that leverage greatly improves those odds for\nstocks-heavy portfolios, and that investing on margin could have allowed safe\nwithdrawal rates $> 6$% per year.",

Despite its significance, predicting\npolymorphism directly from a chemical composition remains a challenging problem\ndue to the complex interplay between molecular conformations, crystal packing,\nand symmetry constraints. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven\nanalysis of polymorphic materials from the Materials Project database,\nuncovering key statistical patterns in their composition, space group\ndistributions, and polyhedral building blocks. We discover that frequent\npolymorph pairs across space groups, such as (71, 225), display recurring\ntopological motifs that persist across different compounds, highlighting\ntopology not symmetry alone as a key factor in polymorphic recurrence. We\nreveal that many polymorphs exhibit consistent local polyhedral environments\ndespite differences in their symmetry or packing.

To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing\ncalibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.\nSpecifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial\nimages from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or\ncontinuously changing head poses.

    "abstract": "End-to-end imitation learning frameworks (e.g., VLA) are increasingly\nprominent in robotics, as they enable rapid task transfer by learning directly\nfrom perception to control, eliminating the need for complex hand-crafted\nfeatures. However, even when employing SOTA VLA-based models, they still\nexhibit limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal action efficiency,\ndue to the constraints imposed by insufficient robotic training datasets. In\naddition to addressing this problem using model-based approaches, we observe\nthat robotic action slices, which consist of contiguous action steps, exhibit\nstrong analogies to the time slices of threads in traditional operating\nsystems. This insight presents a novel opportunity to tackle the problem at the\nsystem level.\n  In this paper, we propose AMS, a robot action management system enhanced with\nOS-level primitives like exception, context switch and record-and-replay, that\nimproves both execution efficiency and success rates of robotic tasks. AMS\nfirst introduces action exception, which facilitates the immediate interruption\nof robotic actions to prevent error propagation. Secondly, AMS proposes action\ncontext, which eliminates redundant computations for VLA-based models, thereby\naccelerating execution efficiency in robotic actions. Finally, AMS leverages\naction replay to facilitate repetitive or similar robotic tasks without the\nneed for re-training efforts. We implement AMS in both an emulated environment\nand on a real robot platform. The evaluation results demonstrate that AMS\nsignificantly enhances the model's generalization ability and action\nefficiency, achieving task success rate improvements ranging from 7x to 24x and\nsaving end-to-end execution time ranging from 29% to 74% compared to existing\nrobotic system without AMS support.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update\npredictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based\non past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize\nrecurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to\ncapture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this\npaper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline\ndecomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the\nproblem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component\ndecomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method\nfirst determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component\nsolely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it\nupdates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction\nthrough online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our\nmethod fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior\nadaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various\nreal-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms\nbaselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning\nto address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data\nprivacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of\ncentralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework\ninvolving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private\nresource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is\noptimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while\npreserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage\npatterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This\nallows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while\nsharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance\nis used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and\nstability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a\ncloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study\nevaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise\ninjection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's\nrobustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as\nPrecision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in\nvarious complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical\npotential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud\ncomputing environments.",

It proposes an adaptive resource\norchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method\nintroduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows\ndifferent resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and\nschedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better\nable to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental\ncharacteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to\nintegrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy\nlearning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time\nlocal performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism\nimproves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A\nunified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a\nrepresentative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key\nmetrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy\nconvergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate\nstrong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental\nscenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with\nhigh concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency\nrelationships.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) hold the promise of improving\nsignificantly coverage, as well as spectral and energy efficiency in wireless\ncommunication systems. Techniques based on RIS form a key technology for 6G\nsystems. An important issue in RIS technology is Channel State Information\n(CSI), which is much more difficult to acquire in such systems. This work\nintroduces a Differential Space-Time Modulation (DSTM) scheme integrated with\nDifferential Reflecting Modulation (DRM) to bypass the requirement for CSI in\nsuch systems, while providing error rate gains. The DSTM scheme is based on\nunitary group codes. We first consider uncoded DRM for RIS to serve as a\nreference point. Next we provide an overview of DSTM and outline the procedures\nfor its integration with DRM. Furthermore, we explore the extension of both the\noriginal DRM and the coded DRM-DSTM scheme to a larger number of RIS reflecting\npatterns $K$, and provide tables of codes for $K= 2, 3, 4$. Encoding and\ndecoding complexities are studied as well. Extensives simulation results over\nquasi-static Rayleigh fading channels confirm the effectiveness of the DRM-DSTM\ncoded system, illustrating its advantages over uncoded DRM with proper system\nparameters.",

    "abstract": "Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become\nindispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)\ntasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to\nbackdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining\nwith clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be\nresource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning\nand Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on\ntransformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach\nrequires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the\nmodel architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.\nTechnically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a\npre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous\ntheoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists\ndetection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable\nassumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate\nthe effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy\nloss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four\nadvanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art\nretraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness\nagainst diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Efficient and reliable node deployment in Wireless Sensor Networks is crucial\nfor optimizing coverage of the area, connectivity among nodes, and energy\nefficiency. This paper proposes a hybrid meta heuristic approach combining a\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to address the\nchallenges of energy efficient and reliable node deployment. The GA PSO hybrid\nleverages GAs strong exploration capabilities and PSOs rapid convergence,\nachieving an optimum stability between coverage and energy consumption. The\nperformance of the proposed approach is evaluated against GA and PSO alone and\nthe innovatory meta heuristic based Competitive Multi Objective Marine\nPredators Algorithm (CMOMPA) across varying sensing ranges. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that GA PSO requires 15% to 25% fewer sensor nodes and maintains\n95% or more area coverage while maintaining the connectivity in comparison to\nstandalone GA or PSO algorithm. The proposed algorithm also dominates CMOMPA\nwhen compared for long sensing and communication range in terms of higher\ncoverage, improved connectivity, and reduced deployment time while requiring\nfewer sensor nodes. This study also explores key trade offs in WSN deployment\nand highlights future research directions, including heterogeneous node\ndeployment, mobile WSNs, and enhanced multi objective optimization techniques.\nThe findings underscore the effectiveness of hybrid meta heuristics in\nimproving WSN performance, offering a promising approach for real world\napplications such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, smart agriculture,\ndisaster response, and IIoT.",
