    "abstract": "Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization is an emerging deep neural network (DNN)\ntraining paradigm that offers computational simplicity and memory savings.\nHowever, this seemingly promising approach faces a significant and long-ignored\nchallenge. ZO requires generating a substantial number of Gaussian random\nnumbers, which poses significant difficulties and even makes it infeasible for\nhardware platforms, such as FPGAs and ASICs. In this paper, we identify this\ncritical issue, which arises from the mismatch between algorithm and hardware\ndesigners. To address this issue, we proposed PeZO, a perturbation-efficient ZO\nframework. Specifically, we design random number reuse strategies to\nsignificantly reduce the demand for random number generation and introduce a\nhardware-friendly adaptive scaling method to replace the costly Gaussian\ndistribution with a uniform distribution. Our experiments show that PeZO\nreduces the required LUTs and FFs for random number generation by 48.6\\% and\n12.7\\%, and saves at maximum 86\\% power consumption, all without compromising\ntraining performance, making ZO optimization feasible for on-device training.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of\non-device ZO optimization, providing valuable insights for future research.",

Their development marks a\nsignificant milestone in the field. However, even the most advanced bipedal\nrobots face challenges related to terrain variation, obstacle negotiation,\npayload management, weight distribution, and recovering from stumbles. These\nchallenges can be mitigated by incorporating thrusters, which enhance stability\non uneven terrain, facilitate obstacle avoidance, and improve recovery after\nstumbling. Harpy is a bipedal robot equipped with six joints and two thrusters,\nserving as a hardware platform for implementing and testing advanced control\nalgorithms. This thesis focuses on characterizing Harpy's hardware to improve\nthe system's overall robustness, controllability, and predictability. It also\nexamines simulation results for predicting thrust in propeller-based\nmechanisms, the integration of thrusters into the Harpy platform and associated\ntesting, as well as an exploration of motor torque characterization methods and\ntheir application to hardware in relation to closed-loop force-based impedance\ncontrol.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we initiate a cryptographically inspired theoretical study of\ndetection versus mitigation of adversarial inputs produced by attackers on\nMachine Learning algorithms during inference time.\n  We formally define defense by detection (DbD) and defense by mitigation\n(DbM). Our definitions come in the form of a 3-round protocol between two\nresource-bounded parties: a trainer/defender and an attacker. The attacker aims\nto produce inference-time inputs that fool the training algorithm. We define\ncorrectness, completeness, and soundness properties to capture successful\ndefense at inference time while not degrading (too much) the performance of the\nalgorithm on inputs from the training distribution.\n  We first show that achieving DbD and achieving DbM are equivalent for ML\nclassification tasks. Surprisingly, this is not the case for ML generative\nlearning tasks, where there are many possible correct outputs for each input.\nWe show a separation between DbD and DbM by exhibiting two generative learning\ntasks for which it is possible to defend by mitigation but it is provably\nimpossible to defend by detection. The mitigation phase uses significantly less\ncomputational resources than the initial training algorithm. In the first\nlearning task we consider sample complexity as the resource and in the second\nthe time complexity. The first result holds under the assumption that the\nIdentity-Based Fully Homomorphic Encryption (IB-FHE), publicly-verifiable\nzero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK), and\nStrongly Unforgeable Signatures exist.

Key requirements\ninclude adaptive metadata management, simplified user interaction, robust\nsecurity, and transparent data transactions. Our architecture supports both\ncompute-to-data as well as data-to-compute paradigms, implementing a\ndecentralized peer-to-peer network that scales horizontally.

Internal activations of language models\nencode additional information that could be useful for this. The baseline\napproach for activation monitoring is some variation of linear probing on a\nparticular layer: starting from a labeled dataset, train a logistic regression\nclassifier on that layer's activations. Recent work has proposed several\napproaches which may improve on naive linear probing, by leveraging additional\ncomputation. One class of techniques, which we call \"prompted probing,\"\nleverages test time computation to improve monitoring by (1) prompting the\nmodel with a description of the monitoring task, and (2) applying a learned\nlinear probe to resulting activations. Another class of techniques uses\ncomputation at train time: training sparse autoencoders offline to identify an\ninterpretable basis for the activations, and e.g. max-pooling activations\nacross tokens using that basis before applying a linear probe. However, one can\nalso prompt the model with a description of the monitoring task and use its\noutput directly. We develop and test novel refinements of these methods and\ncompare them against each other.

We characterize the billiard's emerging trajectories, exhibiting the\nonset of chaos and its alternation with regularity in the parameter space. We\ncharacterize the transition to chaos and the stabilization of the dynamics by\nrevealing the nonlinearity of the parameters (squarness, ellipticity, and\nhardness) via the computation of Poincar\\'e surfaces of section and the\nLyapunov exponent across the parameter space. We expect our work to introduce a\nvaluable tool to increase understanding of the onset of chaos in soft\nbilliards.",

However, traditional Gaussian-based models often\nunderestimate extreme pollution values, leading to biased risk assessments. To\naddress this, we present a Bayesian hierarchical data fusion framework rooted\nin extreme value theory, using the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution\nto jointly account for threshold and non-threshold exceedances while preserving\nthe temporal structure of extreme events. Our model is used to describe and\npredict censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution in the Greater London\nregion by using remote sensing observations from the EAC4 dataset, a reanalysis\nproduct from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS), and in situ\nobservation stations from the automatic urban and rural network (AURN) ran by\nthe UK government. Some of our approach's key innovations include combining\ndata with varying spatio-temporal resolutions and fully accounting for\nparameter uncertainties. Results show that our model outperforms Gaussian-based\nalternatives and standalone remote-sensing data in predicting threshold\nexceedances at the majority of observation sites and can even result in\nimproved spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution than those discernible from the\nremote-sensing data. Moreover, our approach captures greater variability and\nspatial patterns, such as higher PM2.5 concentrations near coastal areas, which\nare not evident in remote-sensing data alone.",

    "abstract": "High-order methods for convex and nonconvex optimization, particularly\n$p$th-order Adaptive Regularization Methods (AR$p$), have attracted significant\nresearch interest by naturally incorporating high-order Taylor models into\nadaptive regularization frameworks, resulting in algorithms with faster global\nand local convergence rates than first- and second-order methods. This paper\nestablishes global optimality conditions for general, nonconvex cubic\npolynomials with quartic regularization. These criteria generalise existing\nresults, recovering the optimality results for regularized quadratic\npolynomials, and can be further simplified in the low-rank and diagonal tensor\ncases. Under suitable assumptions on the Taylor polynomial, we derive a lower\nbound for the regularization parameter such that the necessary and sufficient\ncriteria coincide, establishing a connection between this bound and the\nsubproblem's convexification and sum-of-squares (SoS) convexification\ntechniques. Leveraging the optimality characterization, we develop a Diagonal\nTensor Method (DTM) for minimizing quartically-regularized cubic Taylor\npolynomials by iteratively minimizing a sequence of local models that\nincorporate both diagonal cubic terms and quartic regularization (DTM model).\nWe show that the DTM algorithm is provably convergent, with a global evaluation\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$. Furthermore, when special\nstructure is present (such as low rank or diagonal), DTM can exactly solve the\ngiven problem (in one iteration). In our numerical experiments, we propose\npractical DTM variants that exploit local problem information for model\nconstruction, which we then show to be competitive with cubic regularization\nand other subproblem solvers, with superior performance on problems with\nspecial structure.",

We present the detailed spectroscopic analysis of a nearby\nmetal-poor M subdwarf, LHS 174 from its high-resolution optical spectrum, and\napply our previously developed spectral fitting code, \\texttt{AutoSpecFit}, to\nmeasure the abundances of five elements:[O/H]=$-$0.519$\\pm$0.081,\n[Ca/H]=$-$0.753$\\pm$0.177, [Ti/H]=$-$0.711$\\pm$0.144, [V/H]=$-$1.026$\\pm$0.077,\nand [Fe/H]=$-$1.170$\\pm$0.135. We compare the abundances of O, Ti, and Fe\nderived from this work and those from previous studies and demonstrate the\nobserved data is clearly better matched with the synthetic model generated\nbased on our abundances than those from the other analyses. The accuracy of\ninferred stellar abundances strongly depends on the accuracy of physical\nparameters, which motivates us to develop a reliable technique to determine the\nparameters of low-mass M dwarfs more accurately ever than before and infer\nabundances with smaller uncertainties.",

We\napply our approach to the design and modeling of a multimode photonic crystal\ncoupled-cavity system for the generation of entangled squeezed states of light\non-chip. The system consists of a three-mode, three-defect resonant structure\ncoupled to three coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) in a square\nlattice silicon photonic crystal slab. We model the system using a basis of 184\nnon-orthogonal lossy quasi-modes. A two-mode squeezed thermal state of light is\ngenerated via degenerate spontaneous four-wave mixing in the resonant\nstructure, which is pumped with a Gaussian pulse via a pump-CROW. The generated\nentangled signal and idler pulses of light are coupled out of the resonant\nstructure into the two output-CROWs. Due to careful design of the resonant\nstructure and the CROWs, the signal and idler light in the two output CROWs\nremains entangled even after propagating tens of cavities down the CROWs. Our\napproach is general and computationally efficient and thus can be applied to\nmodeling the generation and propagation of quantum states of light in a wide\nvariety of coupled-cavity photonic structures.",

However, they struggle in mapping\nthe temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs, especially for time steps not\nexplicitly seen during training. This limits their temporal accuracy as they do\nnot leverage these dynamics in the training process. In addition, most NOs tend\nto be prohibitively costly to train, especially for higher-dimensional PDEs. In\nthis paper, we propose the Temporal Neural Operator (TNO), an efficient neural\noperator specifically designed for spatio-temporal operator learning for\ntime-dependent PDEs. TNO achieves this by introducing a temporal-branch to the\nDeepONet framework, leveraging the best architectural design choices from\nseveral other NOs, and a combination of training strategies including Markov\nassumption, teacher forcing, temporal bundling, and the flexibility to\ncondition the output on the current state or past states.

    "abstract": "In nature, granular materials fail in abrupt avalanches, earthquakes, and\nother hazardous events, and also creep over time. Proposed failure mechanisms\nfor these systems are broadly framed as friction-limited. However, mechanical\ndescriptions of friction in granular system vary, including those that consider\nthe non-linear, heterogeneous dynamics of grain-contact forces. In order to\nstudy granular controls on failure and creep, we imaged contact forces between\nquasi-2D photoelastic discs at 15-minute intervals in experiments over weeks-\nto one-month-long observation periods. In the experiments, the particles are\ndistributed in a slope below the angle of repose with a concomitant\nestablishment of the force-chain network approximately along the principal\nstatic stress directions. The discrete force-chain shifts are initially\ndescribed by an age-weakening Weibull distribution in frequency over time, with\nthe most common clusters of events $<$1000 minutes apart, but there are long\nquiescent periods that are not well described by the distribution. The\npost-settling discrete events accompany a longer term strengthening of the\nlocalized stresses. We observe that some events may be related to 2$^o$C\ntemperature change, but associated ground motions measured by a seismometer\nappear to have no correlation with particle displacements or force-chain\nchanges. The results illustrate that local, grain-scale changes in force-chain\nnetworks can occur long after a granular pile reaches a mesoscale apparently\nstable state, sometimes without obvious external forcings or imposed state\nchanges. Such force-chain dynamics may underlie transitions in natural granular\nsystems between large-scale failures and creep events.",

In\ncontrast to classical representations, where the integer appears as an explicit\nparameter, our approach encodes the number N in the set of natural numbers\nthrough the cumulative balance of a smooth function f_N(t), constructed from\nlocalized Gaussian bumps with alternating and decaying coefficients. The total\nintegral I(N) converges to zero as N tends to infinity, and the integer can be\nrecovered as the minimal point of near-cancellation.\n  This method enables continuous and differentiable representations of discrete\nstates, supports recovery through spline-based or analytical inversion, and\nextends naturally to multidimensional tuples (N1, N2, ...). We analyze the\nstructure and convergence of the encoding series, demonstrate numerical\nconstruction of the integral map I(N), and develop procedures for integer\nrecovery via numerical inversion.

This paper\nintroduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory\ncontinuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring.

Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use\nspatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational\nefficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine\nobject tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets,\ndemonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting\nerrors to 23% and 15%, respectively.

Using\nthe framework of quantum Fisher information, many strategies based on squeezed\nquantum probes and multipath multiphoton or multiqubit entangled states have\nbeen considered. In this context there is always the question of what is the\nsimplest measurement that would saturate quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB). The\nsimplest quantity to measure would be characteristics of photon flux or\npopulation distribution in case of qubits. Previous studies have shown that the\nerror sensitivity in SU(1,1) interferometry, also known by several other names\nas nonlinear interferometry, time reversed measurements; does saturate QCRB for\nsingle parameters like phase, displacement, loss. In this work we bring out\ngreat utility of generalized SU(1,1) interferometry in distributed sensing. The\ngeneralized SU(1,1) interferometry is a combination of SU(m) and SU(1,1)\nelements, where m is the number of nodes in the network. The SU(m) element is\nused to produce distributed entanglement starting from a squeezed photonic or\nmatter probe.

    "abstract": "Background: Ultra-high-dose-rate (UHDR) radiation therapy has demonstrated\npromising potential in reducing toxicity to organs-at-risk (OARs). Proton\ntherapy is uniquely positioned to deliver UHDR by leveraging the Bragg peak in\nconjunction with patient-specific range modulators (PSRMs) to generate a\nspread-out Bragg peak (SOBP). Existing proton FLASH (pFLASH) planning typically\ninvolves (1) generating a multi-energy IMPT plan for spot weights and (2)\nconverting it to single-energy delivery via PSRM optimization. However, the\nintrinsic coupling between spot weight distribution and PSRM design has not\nbeen fully investigated. Purpose: This work proposes Joint Range-Modulator and\nSpot Optimization (JRSO) that simultaneously optimizes the PSRM and spot\nweights to improve the plan quality of conformal pFLASH therapy. Methods:\nUnlike the conventional method, JRSO does not require a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between beam spots and PSRM pins. To achieve better plan\nquality, starting from an initial solution derived from a conventional IMPT\nplan, JRSO alternatively updates the PSRM design and spot weights. This process\nprogressively refines both parameters while ensuring compliance with practical\ndelivery constraints, such as the minimum monitor-unit (MMU) requirement.\nResults: JRSO obtained improved plan quality compared to the conventional\nmethod. For example, in a head-and-neck (HN) case, JRSO lowered the maximum\ntarget dose from 117.6% to 107.1%, improved the conformity index from 0.74 to\n0.87, and decreased the region-of-interest (ROI) effective dose from 6.50 Gy to\n6.10 Gy. Conclusion: A new optimization method JRSO is proposed for conformal\npFLASH radiotherapy. It outperforms the conventional approach and may extend\nthe applicability of PSRM to more complex clinical scenarios, particularly\nthose involving misalignments between beam spots and pins.",

Considering that\ndeformation fields modulate the coupling parameters, we find a general\nexpression for the weakly strained magnon Hamiltonian that depends on the\n(symmetric) strain tensor. We numerically tested our results in finite\nnanoribbon structures. We found that uniaxial deformations make the bulk bands\nmore dispersive while topologically protected in-gap edge modes become\nnonreciprocal at the boundary of the Brillouin Zone. On the other hand, when\napplying a twist deformation, the simultaneous modulation of both Heisenberg\nand Kitaev parameters enables the apparition of flat bands, promoting the\npresence of non-propagative topologically protected magnonic edge states, whose\nproperties strongly depends on the strain strength. In addition, the\ncharacteristic localization of magnon edge modes is preserved, which allows for\ntesting the robustness of the bulk-boundary correspondence under lattice\ndeformations. Our results contribute to a major understanding of\nHeisenberg-Kitaev magnets and how applying different strains allows for precise\ncontrol over magnon properties.",

    "abstract": "Neural implicit surface representation techniques are in high demand for\nadvancing technologies in augmented reality/virtual reality, digital twins,\nautonomous navigation, and many other fields. With their ability to model\nobject surfaces in a scene as a continuous function, such techniques have made\nremarkable strides recently, especially over classical 3D surface\nreconstruction methods, such as those that use voxels or point clouds. However,\nthese methods struggle with scenes that have varied and complex surfaces\nprincipally because they model any given scene with a single encoder network\nthat is tasked to capture all of low through high-surface frequency information\nin the scene simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel, neural implicit\nsurface representation approach called FreBIS to overcome this challenge.\nFreBIS works by stratifying the scene based on the frequency of surfaces into\nmultiple frequency levels, with each level (or a group of levels) encoded by a\ndedicated encoder. Moreover, FreBIS encourages these encoders to capture\ncomplementary information by promoting mutual dissimilarity of the encoded\nfeatures via a novel, redundancy-aware weighting module. Empirical evaluations\non the challenging BlendedMVS dataset indicate that replacing the standard\nencoder in an off-the-shelf neural surface reconstruction method with our\nfrequency-stratified encoders yields significant improvements. These\nenhancements are evident both in the quality of the reconstructed 3D surfaces\nand in the fidelity of their renderings from any viewpoint.",

In this work, we estimate Pauli\nnoise on detector error models, including hypergraphs, using only the syndrome\nstatistics. We apply this method to well-known codes such as the repetition,\nsurface, and 2D color codes. Under bare-ancilla syndrome extraction, two-point\ncorrelations are enough to reconstruct the detector error model for repetition\nor surface codes. For color codes or repetition codes under Steane-style\nsyndrome extraction, we show how to extend the estimation method to multi-point\ncorrelators and extract the error rates of the hypergraphs.

A\nprominent example is the nucleation of dislocations in metals, which critically\ngovern their mechanical, electronic, thermal, and chemical properties. While\natomic-level insights can be attained using, \\textit{e.g.}, molecular dynamics\nsimulations, systematically characterizing nucleation mechanisms and accurately\nquantifying kinetic rates remain challenging tasks. In this work, we\ndemonstrate how the choice of the order parameter used to track the transition\nhas a very strong effect on the accuracy of the kinetic rate predicted from the\ncorresponding free-energy barrier and diffusion coefficient, a fact that has\nbeen often overlooked in the past. By exploiting this systematic error to our\nadvantage, we demonstrate that it is possible to rigorously characterize the\nnucleation process using a data-driven scheme based on a variational principle,\nleading to optimal order parameters and a faithful mechanistic description. We\napply this method to characterize, as a representative case study, the\nnucleation of dislocations in crystalline $fcc$ copper by analyzing replica\nmolecular dynamics simulations at the elastic-plastic limit. By means of\ncommittor analysis and Langevin modeling, our approach allows to systematically\nrank candidate (dis)order parameters, identify the critical nuclei (transition\nstates), and infer the free-energy landscapes. Given its general foundations,\nthis method can be extended to nucleation phenomena in a broad class of\nmaterials.",

    "abstract": "Vehicle platooning has been a promising solution for improving traffic\nefficiency and throughput. However, a failure in a single vehicle, including\ncommunication loss with neighboring vehicles, can significantly disrupt platoon\nperformance and potentially trigger cascading effects. Similar to modern\nautonomous vehicles, platoon systems require human drivers to take control\nduring failures, leading to scenarios where vehicles are operated by drivers\nwith diverse driving styles. This paper presents a novel multi-model approach\nfor simultaneously identifying signal drop locations and driver attitudes in\nvehicular platoons using only tail vehicle measurements. The proposed method\ndistinguishes between attentive and distracted driver behaviors by analyzing\nthe propagation patterns of disturbances through the platoon system. Beyond its\napplication in platooning, our methodology for detecting driver behavior using\na multi-model approach provides a novel framework for human driver\nidentification. To enhance computational efficiency for real-time applications,\nwe introduce a blending-based identification method utilizing chosen models and\nweighted interpolation, significantly reducing the number of required models\nwhile maintaining detection accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is\nvalidated through high-fidelity CarSim/Simulink environment simulations.\nResults demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify both the\nlocation of signal drops and the corresponding driver behavior. This approach\nminimizes the complexity and cost of fault detection while ensuring accuracy\nand reliability.",

We demonstrate that a simple nuclear\nHamiltonian, based on a leading-order pionless effective field theory expansion\nand known to accurately reproduce the ground-state energies of nuclei with\n$A\\leq 20$ nucleons also provides a reliable description of the photoabsorption\ncross section.",

At the back end, Whamm provides\ninstrumentation to a Wasm engine as Wasm code, reusing existing engine\noptimizations and unlocking new ones, most notably intrinsification, to\nminimize overhead. In particular, explicitly requesting program state in match\nrules, rather than reflection, enables the engine to efficiently bundle\narguments and even inline compiled probe logic.

Thus, we find that the most visible hinge modes occur when no band\ninversions are present in the material.

In this work, we take a first step\ntoward a formal study of AI supply chains and their implications, providing two\nillustrative case studies indicating that both AI development and regulation\nare complicated in the presence of supply chains. We begin by presenting a\nbrief historical perspective on AI supply chains, discussing how their rise\nreflects a longstanding shift towards specialization and outsourcing that\nsignals the healthy growth of the AI industry. We then model AI supply chains\nas directed graphs and demonstrate the power of this abstraction by connecting\nexamples of AI issues to graph properties.

However, as these vehicles become more connected,\ncybersecurity threats have emerged as a serious concern.

This paper focuses on addressing the cybersecurity\nissues in autonomous vehicles by examining the challenges and risks involved,\nwhich are important for building a secure future. Since autonomous vehicles\ndepend on the communication between sensors, artificial intelligence, external\ninfrastructure, and other systems, they are exposed to different types of cyber\nthreats. A cybersecurity breach in an autonomous vehicle can cause serious\nproblems, including a loss of public trust and safety. Therefore, it is very\nimportant to develop and apply strong cybersecurity measures to support the\ngrowth and acceptance of self-driving cars. This paper discusses major\ncybersecurity challenges like vulnerabilities in software and hardware, risks\nfrom wireless communication, and threats through external interfaces. It also\nreviews existing solutions such as secure software development, intrusion\ndetection systems, cryptographic protocols, and anomaly detection methods.\nAdditionally, the paper highlights the role of regulatory bodies, industry\ncollaborations, and cybersecurity standards in creating a secure environment\nfor autonomous vehicles.

We have theoretically proven this can\ncontribute to both stability and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge,\nIntegration Flow is the first model with a unified structure to estimate\nODE-based generative models and the first to show the exact straightness of\n1-Rectified Flow without reflow. Through theoretical analysis and empirical\nevaluations, we show that Integration Flows achieve improved performance when\nit is applied to existing ODE-based models, such as diffusion models, Rectified\nFlows, and PFGM++. Specifically, Integration Flow achieves one-step generation\non CIFAR10 with FIDs of 2.86 for the Variance Exploding (VE) diffusion model,\n3.36 for rectified flow without reflow, and 2.91 for PFGM++; and on ImageNet\nwith FIDs of 4.09 for VE diffusion model, 4.35 for rectified flow without\nreflow and 4.15 for PFGM++.",

The complexity and multi-faceted\nnature of this type of data require more advanced methods that go beyond the\ncapabilities of current EDA techniques. This study addresses the gap in current\nEDA practices by proposing a novel approach that leverages movement variable\ntaxonomies and outlier detection. We hypothesize that organizing movement\nfeatures into a taxonomy, and applying anomaly detection to combinations of\ntaxonomic nodes, can reveal meaningful patterns and lead to more interpretable\ndescriptions of the data. To test this hypothesis, we introduce TUMD, a new\nmethod that integrates movement taxonomies with outlier detection to enhance\ndata analysis and interpretation. TUMD was evaluated across four diverse\ndatasets of moving objects using fixed parameter values. Its effectiveness was\nassessed through two passes: the first pass categorized the majority of\nmovement patterns as Kinematic, Geometric, or Hybrid for all datasets, while\nthe second pass refined these behaviors into more specific categories such as\nSpeed, Acceleration, or Indentation. TUMD met the effectiveness criteria in\nthree datasets, demonstrating its ability to describe and refine movement\nbehaviors.

The high-energy astrophysical neutrino\nspectrum has been extensively used to probe {\\nu}SI models through these\ndistinctive features. The recent detection of the ultrahigh-energy event\nKM3-230213A offers a new opportunity to explore {\\nu}SI phenomenology at\nextreme energies. In this work, we investigate two implications of this\nobservation under the assumption that the event originates from a diffuse\npower-law spectrum. First, we find that {\\nu}SI induces spectral distortions\nthat can mildly alleviate tensions between the KM3-230213A detection and the\nprevious non-observation of PeV-scale neutrinos in IceCube data. Second, we\nderive new constraints on the {\\nu}SI coupling strength for mediator masses\naround 100 MeV. Our analysis shows that neutrino telescopes can surpass\nexisting collider constraints in this mass range. In the near future,\nIceCube-Gen2 is expected to substantially enhance the sensitivity to {\\nu}SI\nover a broader range of parameter space.",

We present a study based on a sample\nof nearly 30000 dwarf stars from the APOGEE DR17 survey within 2 kpc of the\nSun, for which we measure accurate ages. Various parameter combinations are\ntested to optimize stellar age determination from isochrones. The resulting\nage-chemistry relations for a selected subsample of 12000 stars are interpreted\nwith the aid of a chemical evolution model. The data reveal a well-defined,\ntight thick disk sequence, characterized by high [alpha/Fe], subsolar\nmetallicities, and ages older than 8 Gyr. The thin disk, with lower [alpha/Fe]\nand younger ages, exhibits a wide spread in metallicity at all ages, with\napparent structures. Dividing the sample by guiding radius into inner,\nintermediate, and outer disks shows distinct chemical evolution patterns. The\ninner disk displays a monotonic, homogeneous chemical evolution with little\ndispersion, while the outer disk shows little metallicity increase over the\npast 8 Gyr. The solar neighborhood appears as a mixture, not only due to\nstellar migration but also because the chemical evolution of the ISM in this\nintermediate region results from the mixing of gas from the inner and outer\ndisks. In particular, we demonstrate that the solar vicinity experienced a\ndecrease in the mean ISM metallicity 7-9 Gyr ago. A plausible explanation\ninvolves a radial inflow of lower-metallicity gas from the outer disk at that\ntime, which diluted the gas leftover by the thick disk formation, contributing\nto the observed metallicity gradient in the intermediate region.",

We introduce Meta Policy Optimization (MPO), a\nframework that addresses these challenges by integrating a meta-reward model\nthat dynamically refines the reward model's prompt throughout training. In MPO,\nthe meta-reward model monitors the evolving training context and continuously\nadjusts the reward model's prompt to maintain high alignment, providing an\nadaptive reward signal that resists exploitation by the policy. This\nmeta-learning approach promotes a more stable policy optimization, and greatly\nreduces the need for manual reward prompt design. It yields performance on par\nwith or better than models guided by extensively hand-crafted reward prompts.\nFurthermore, we show that MPO maintains its effectiveness across diverse tasks,\nfrom essay writing to mathematical reasoning, without requiring specialized\nreward designs. Beyond standard RLAIF, MPO's meta-learning formulation is\nreadily extensible to higher-level alignment frameworks. Overall, this method\naddresses theoretical and practical challenges in reward-based RL alignment for\nLLMs, paving the way for more robust and adaptable alignment strategies.

    "abstract": "Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts,\nplaying a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed\nmatter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality\nsymmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are\nmathematically described by $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In\nparticular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a\nnon-anomalous subgroup of $\\mathbb{Z}_N\\times\\mathbb{Z}_N\\times\\mathbb{Z}_N$\nsymmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules\nvia two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a\nrepresentation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the\nsymmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality\nsymmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and\nexplicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.",

This implementation enables simultaneous\nfitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free\nparameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions,\nwhile the subsequent evolution is fully governed by the dynamical equations of\nan evolving accretion flow. We apply the model to fit seven epochs of X-ray\nspectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event\n(TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, spanning from its\ndiscovery in 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived',\nX-ray-bright TDEs - of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can be\nnaturally explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived\nX-ray emission, such as ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their key distinction lies\nin the 'viscous' timescale parameter - tied to the disk's stress and angular\nmomentum transport efficiency - which should be treated as a free parameter\nwhen modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the\nimplications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties\nsuch as mass surface density and accretion rate. We show that existing QPE\nmodels cannot reproduce the observed connection between the presence (e.g.,\n2018) or absence (e.g., 2014) of eruptions and disk properties. In the context\nof orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears\ninsufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The\nabsence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a major challenge for QPE\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM)\nrequires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including\nneutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast\nflavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner\nregions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process\nnucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI\nand CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background\nobtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special\nattention to a case involving a long-lived ($>1\\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star\n(HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can\noccur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple\nmechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number (ELN)\nangular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ\nnotably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We argue that the\nappearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos plays\nimportant roles on generating ELN angular crossings. For CFI, their growth\nrates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of\nthe accretion disk up to $\\sim 1\\,$ s. We also find that neglecting\ncontributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate\nand area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends\nto occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and\nFFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI,\nthough more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor\nconversions are needed to confirm these claims.",

Because of their multi-phase and multi-scale nature, an\nexhaustive description of these winds should exploit multiple tracers. However,\nconnecting various outflow features remains a challenge. The aim of this work\nis to provide a complete characterisation of outflows in a sample of z$\\sim$5\nquasars, by exploiting the combination of different emission and absorption\ntracers. Methods. We analysed the UV/optical and FIR continuum, line emission,\nand absorption in a sample of 39 z$\\sim$5 quasars observed with VLT/X-Shooter\nand ALMA (available for six objects). We identified broad and narrow absorption\nlines associated with the quasar and emission lines to determine black hole\nmasses and bolometric luminosities. Results. Our sample encompasses massive\n(log($M_{\\text{BH,MgII}}/M_\\odot$) = 8.5-10) and luminous\n(log($L_{\\text{bol}}$/(erg/s)) = 46.9-48) quasars at redshift 5-5.7. They\ndisplay powerful ionised outflows detected in both emission and absorption,\nwith velocities exceeding 48,000 km/s in some cases, and lie above the local\nblack hole - host galaxy mass relation, exhibiting a behaviour similar to that\nof z$\\gtrsim$6 quasars. These findings suggest a phase of efficient black hole\nfeedback occurring at redshift z$\\gtrsim$6 and likely persisting down to\nz$\\sim$5, characterised by rapid black hole growth exceeding that of the host\ngalaxy. The fraction of quasars with outflow detections in absorption is higher\nfor larger CIV-MgII velocity shifts, suggesting that while the physical\nmechanisms powering the two outflow phenomena detected in emission and\nabsorption may differ, a correlation exists between them.",

We analyze the time-dependent structure of MW-mass halos from\nzoomed cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations by decomposing their mass\ndistribution into spherical harmonic expansions.

While the dipole reflects transient perturbations\nfrom infalling satellites and damps on dynamical timescales, the quadrupole --\nlinked to the halo's triaxiality -- is a persistent feature. We show that the\nquadrupole's orientation aligns with the largest filaments, imprinting a\nlong-lived memory on the halo's morphology even in its inner regions ($\\sim30$\nkpc). At the virial radius, the quadrupole distortion can reach 1-2 times the\nspherical density, highlighting the importance of environment in shaping\nMW-mass halos. Using multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis, we successfully\ndisentangle the effects of satellite mergers and filamentary accretion on\nquadrupole.

The study of short-range and\nlong-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very\ndifferent, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing\ndistribution. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in\nrandom matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known\napproximation, derived exactly for a 2$\\times$2 matrix, is simple and\nsatisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices.

We test the\npredictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is\nsystematically better at capturing data from random matrices.

We test our approach with Llama 3.2 1B (draft) and Llama 3.1 8B\n(target) models on zero-shot GSM8K reasoning, where it achieves up to 1.5x more\naccepted tokens per verification cycle with under 1% degradation in answer\naccuracy compared to standard speculative decoding and over 2x with small loss\nin accuracy.

Through the lens of the prediction-compression duality, decoding the\nLZ penalty has the interpretation of sampling from the residual distribution\nafter removing the information that is highly compressible.

    "abstract": "Fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are potential progenitors of long\ngamma-ray bursts, but observational verification is challenging. Spectral lines\nfrom their expanding stellar wind obscure accurate rotational velocity\nmeasurements. Intrinsic polarization from wind rotation may help determine\nrotational speeds, requiring precise wind models. Our study aims to investigate\nthe intrinsic polarization due to the rotational distortion of WR winds\nconsidering multiple scattering of photons and compare it to a\nsingle-scattering model, where we use an analytical expression of the\npolarization. We study the polarization signatures resulting from the prolate\nstructure of rotating winds of two WR stars using a 3D Monte Carlo radiative\ntransfer code Hyperion. We estimated the intrinsic polarization resulting from\nmultiple scattering in WR winds for different rotational velocities,\ninclination angles, and mass-loss rates. Our results indicate that at a\nrotation rate of less than 50 % of the critical rate, the intrinsic\npolarization from multiple scattering is close to that of a single scattering\nmodel. However, at higher rotation velocities, the polarization from multiple\nscattering increases with inclination up to 40$^\\circ$, while it decreases for\ninclinations higher than about 60$^\\circ$. This dependence is inconsistent with\nthe single-scattering model. We also discuss the effect of the mass-loss rate\non the polarization and find that the polarization changes linearly with the\nmass-loss rate. However, it is important to note that the relationship between\npolarization and mass-loss rate may vary for different types of stars. The\nresults have implications for future studies of stellar winds and mass loss and\nmay help to improve our understanding of the complex environments of massive\nstars. Our research offers valuable information on the complex polarization\npatterns observed in stellar winds.",

The rotation signatures show evidence for\nvertically stratified disks, in which $^{13}$CO rotates faster than $^{12}$CO\ndue to a distinct thermal gas pressure gradient at their emitting heights.

To bridge this critical gap,\nwe introduce CODrone, a comprehensive oriented object detection dataset for\nUAVs that accurately reflects real-world conditions.

To rigorously\nevaluate CODrone as a new benchmark and gain deeper insights into the novel\nchallenges it presents, we conduct a series of experiments based on 22\nclassical or SOTA methods.Our evaluation not only assesses the effectiveness of\nCODrone in real-world scenarios but also highlights key bottlenecks and\nopportunities to advance OOD in UAV applications.Overall, CODrone fills the\ndata gap in OOD from UAV perspective and provides a benchmark with enhanced\ngeneralization capability, better aligning with practical applications and\nfuture algorithm development.",

However, there is a\ngeneral understanding that such topological superconductivity is limited to a\nnarrow range of the in-plane magnetic field orientations, providing a major\nobstacle towards scalable and noncollinear network architectures. Here, we\nuncover that topological superconductivity in PJJ persists under nearly an\narbitrary in-plane magnetic field orientation. The apparent collapse of the\nglobal gap under misaligned fields originates not from the destruction of\ntopological superconductivity itself, but from the emergent shifted bulk states\nfrom other momenta, which obscure the gap and MZM. With spatial modulations\nalong the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore the\nglobal topological gap and recover MZM. Remarkably, the spatially modulated PJJ\nrenders topological superconductivity robust against the misaligned fields,\nthereby enabling MZM survival and facilitating their braiding in complex\njunction networks. We propose a scalable protocol for MZM braiding and fusion\nwith gate or phase control, opening new routes for scalable topological quantum\ncomputing.",

    "abstract": "Field-level inference has emerged as a promising framework to fully harness\nthe cosmological information encoded in next-generation galaxy surveys. It\ninvolves performing Bayesian inference to jointly estimate the cosmological\nparameters and the initial conditions of the cosmic field, directly from the\nobserved galaxy density field. Yet, the scalability and efficiency of sampling\nalgorithms for field-level inference of large-scale surveys remain unclear. To\naddress this, we introduce a standardized benchmark using a fast and\ndifferentiable simulator for the galaxy density field based on \\texttt{JaxPM}.\nWe evaluate a range of sampling methods, including standard Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo (HMC), No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) without and within a Gibbs scheme, and\nboth adjusted and unadjusted microcanonical samplers (MAMS and MCLMC). These\nmethods are compared based on their efficiency, in particular the number of\nmodel evaluations required per effective posterior sample. Our findings\nemphasize the importance of carefully preconditioning latent variables and\ndemonstrate the significant advantage of (unadjusted) MCLMC for scaling to\n$\\geq 10^6$-dimensional problems. We find that MCLMC outperforms adjusted\nsamplers by over an order-of-magnitude, with a mild scaling with the dimension\nof our inference problem. This benchmark, along with the associated publicly\navailable code, is intended to serve as a basis for the evaluation of future\nfield-level sampling strategies.

We show that passing to the field of functions of\nquadrics of dimension greater than or equal to $2^{n+1}-1$ does not lose any\ninformation about the structure of $\\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives.

There generically exists an epoch at which the\nlinear bias of the 21cm field crosses zero, independent of the precise\nastrophysics of reionization. This epoch implies the 21cm radiation is a\nnatural \"zero-bias tracer\" in the sense of Castorina et al (2018). We identify\nnew noise-like contributions which directly compete with the zero-bias effect,\nbut which should be mitigated through sophisticated analysis techniques such as\nfield-level reconstruction. These noise-like terms act to hinder the\nconstraining power on local PNG of the brightness temperature fluctuations,\nmaking $\\sigma (f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}) \\leq 1$ unachievable even in simplified\nforecasts. We show that analyses which can reach the 'sampling noise' floor for\nthis tracer and harness its full power can potentially unlock a 10-fold\nreduction in error bars, even in the presence of large-scale cuts from\nforegrounds.

In this paper, we introduce a novel learning\nparadigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward\nnew-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three\ninterdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular\nreasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,\nmitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and\ntransparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the\ninternal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic\ncomponents; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable\ninterpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible\nimplementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as\ndisentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and\nneuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the\nintegration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint\noptimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research\ndirections that deserve further exploration.

In this work, we first present an integer constraint\nsatisfaction problem for constructing a magic square of order $n$.

Simultaneous control and trajectory\nestimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified\nsolution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on\nappropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear\ntime-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization\nmethods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory\nEstimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes\nfeasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then,\nit simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy\nobservations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize\ndeviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions.\nThe proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be\napplied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state\nupdate equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states\nin the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features\nprovide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In\naddition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs\nincremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces\na time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be\ndynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of\nthe planned trajectory.

Despite severe associated\nclimate impacts, assessing the AMOC's response under global warming and its\nproximity to possible critical thresholds remains difficult. To understand\nfuture Earth system stability, a global dynamical view is needed beyond the\nlocal stability analysis underlying classical early-warning methods. Using an\nintermediate-complexity climate model, we explore the stability landscape of\nthe AMOC for different atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations. We explicitly compute\nthe edge state (or Melancholia state), a chaotic saddle on the basin boundary\nseparating the strong and weak AMOC attractors found in the model. While being\nunstable, the edge state can govern the transient climate for centuries,\nsupporting centennial AMOC oscillations driven by atmosphere-ice-ocean\ninteractions in the North Atlantic. At increased CO$_2$ levels projected for\nthe near future, we reveal a boundary crisis where the current AMOC attractor\ndisappears by colliding with the edge state. Under crisis overshoot, long\nchaotic transients due to \"ghost states\" lead to diverging ensemble\ntrajectories under time-varying forcing. Rooted in dynamical systems theory,\nour results offer an explanation of large ensemble variance and apparent\n\"stochastic bifurcations\" observed in earth system models under intermediate\nforcing scenarios.",

Several papers from the 1980s look at external memory data\nstructures with small internal memory indexes.

We examine how AI exacerbates cognitive overload through\nvarious mechanisms, including information proliferation, algorithmic\nmanipulation, automation anxieties, deregulation, and the erosion of meaning.\nThe paper reframes the AI safety debate to center on cognitive overload,\nhighlighting its role as a bridge between near-term harms and long-term risks.\nIt concludes by discussing potential institutional adaptations, research\ndirections, and policy considerations that arise from adopting an\noverload-resilient perspective on human-AI alignment, suggesting pathways for\nfuture exploration rather than prescribing definitive solutions.",

This feedback loop ensures a high\ndegree of accuracy in modeling head motion, as evidenced by an impressive R2\nscore of 96.3 for pitch and 98.9 for yaw.

Each vertex $v\\in V$ is endowed with a linear order\non the set $E_v$ of edges incident to $v$, which generates preference relations\namong functions (``contract intensities'') on $E_v$, giving rise to a model of\n\\it{stable allocations} for $G$. This is a special case of Alkan-Gale's\nstability model for a bipartite graph with edge capacities in which, instead of\nlinear orders, the preferences of each ``agent'' $v$ are given via a choice\nfunction that acts on the box $\\{z\\in{\\mathbb R}_+^{E_v}\\colon z(e)\\le b(e),\\,\ne\\in E_v\\}$ or a closed subset in it and obeys the (well motivated) axioms of\nconsistence, substitutability and cardinal monotonicity. By central results in\nAlkan-Gale's theory, the set of stable assignments generated by such choice\nfunctions is nonempty and forms a distributive lattice.\n  In this paper, being in frameworks of Alkan-Gale's model and generalizing the\nstable allocation one, we consider the situation when the preferences of\n``agents'' of one side (``workers'') are given via linear orders, whereas the\nones of the other side (``firms'') via integer-valued choice functions subject\nto the three axioms as above, thus introducing the model of \\it{generalized\nallocations}, or g-allocations for short. Our main aims are to characterize and\nefficiently construct rotations, functions on $E$ associated with immediately\npreceding relations in the lattice $(S,\\prec)$ of stable g-allocations, and to\nestimate the complexity of constructing a poset generated by rotations for\nwhich the lattice of closed functions is isomorphic to $(S,\\prec)$, obtaining a\n``compact'' representation of the latter.",

Standard deep\nlearning models often struggle with these challenges because their\narchitectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing\non general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate\nbiases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize\nlong-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study\nintroduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term\ntrend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed\nin parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow\ndynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically\nBahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic\ndata, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient\nphenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both\nbranches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit\nstatistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model.\nNotably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by\ndirectly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully\nintegrating long-term trends.

For this reason, over time, several\nframeworks for quadrupedal locomotion have been proposed, but with little\nattention to ensuring a predictable timing behavior of the controller.\n  To address this issue, this work presents Feelbert, a modular control\nframework for quadrupedal locomotion suitable for execution on an embedded\nsystem under hard real-time execution constraints. It leverages the feedback\nlinearization control technique to obtain a closed-form control law for the\nbody, valid for all configurations of the robot. The control law was derived\nafter defining an appropriate rigid body model that uses the accelerations of\nthe feet as control variables, instead of the estimated contact forces. This\nwork also provides a novel algorithm to compute footholds and gait temporal\nparameters using the concept of imaginary wheels, and a heuristic algorithm to\nselect the best gait schedule for the current velocity commands.\n  The proposed framework is developed entirely in C++, with no dependencies on\nthird-party libraries and no dynamic memory allocation, to ensure\npredictability and real-time performance. Its implementation allows Feelbert to\nbe both compiled and executed on an embedded system for critical applications,\nas well as integrated into larger systems such as Robot Operating System 2 (ROS\n2).

We\nfocus on the high temperature plasma ($kt\\sim 4.5$keV) that is responsible for\nthe high energy continuum and exciting the Fe K emission. An image analysis\nshows that the Fe K emission is mainly concentrated in the southern part of the\nremnant interior to the region defined by the forward shock. This Fe K\ndistribution would be consistent with an asymmetric distribution of the Fe\nejecta and/or an asymmetric interaction between the reverse shock and the Fe\nejecta. We compare the EPIC-pn and EPIC-MOS spectra in the 3.0 -- 12.0keV\nbandpass with a model based on RGS data plus a higher temperature component, in\ncollisional ionization equilibrium (CIE), or non-equilibrium (NEI) (both\nionizing and recombining).

Assuming the CIE and ionizing spectral models, the Fe\nin this high temperature component is significantly enhanced with respect to\ntypical LMC abundances. We can place only an upper limit on the neutral Fe K\nline. We conclude that the Fe~K emission is due to ejecta heated by the reverse\nshock given the spatial distribution, relatively high temperature, and enhanced\nabundance. We estimate the progenitor mass based on the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe mass\nratios to be $13\\le M_P \\le 15 M_\\odot$.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the\nprobabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in\nthe embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses\nquantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the\nsample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to\nprojection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal\ndecomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus\nconstructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in\ncomputational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties:\n(1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms\nfor the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such\nas boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one\nhyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm\nis very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed\nmethod via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural\ndynamics.",

To\nimprove the multi-messenger astronomy studies of neutron stars, an expression\nfor neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data would be\nadvantageous, as it would allow to compare information from two different\nchannels. In order to do so, a symbolic regression method, pySR, is trained on\nTOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input to discover an approximate\nsymbolic expression for the neutron-star radius as a function of\ngravitational-wave measurements only. The approximation is tested on piecewise\npolytropic EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on selected realistic\n(non-polytropic) dense-matter theory EOSs, achieving consistent agreement\nbetween the ground truth values and the symbolic approximation for a broad\nrange of NS parameters covering current astrophysical observations, with\naverage radii differences of few hundred meters.

    "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) agents become more common in enterprise settings,\nthey introduce security challenges that differ significantly from those posed\nby traditional systems. These agents are not just LLMs; they reason, remember,\nand act, often with minimal human oversight. This paper introduces a\ncomprehensive threat model tailored specifically for GenAI agents, focusing on\nhow their autonomy, persistent memory access, complex reasoning, and tool\nintegration create novel risks. This research work identifies 9 primary threats\nand organizes them across five key domains: cognitive architecture\nvulnerabilities, temporal persistence threats, operational execution\nvulnerabilities, trust boundary violations, and governance circumvention. These\nthreats are not just theoretical they bring practical challenges such as\ndelayed exploitability, cross-system propagation, cross system lateral\nmovement, and subtle goal misalignments that are hard to detect with existing\nframeworks and standard approaches. To help address this, the research work\npresent two complementary frameworks: ATFAA - Advanced Threat Framework for\nAutonomous AI Agents, which organizes agent-specific risks, and SHIELD, a\nframework proposing practical mitigation strategies designed to reduce\nenterprise exposure. While this work builds on existing work in LLM and AI\nsecurity, the focus is squarely on what makes agents different and why those\ndifferences matter. Ultimately, this research argues that GenAI agents require\na new lens for security. If we fail to adapt our threat models and defenses to\naccount for their unique architecture and behavior, we risk turning a powerful\nnew tool into a serious enterprise liability.",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEA) have become more prevalent for\nminimally invasive skull base and sinus surgeries. However, rigid scopes and\ntools significantly decrease the surgeon's ability to operate in tight\nanatomical spaces and avoid critical structures such as the internal carotid\nartery and cranial nerves. This paper proposes a novel tendon-actuated\nconcentric tube endonasal robot (TACTER) design in which two tendon-actuated\nrobots are concentric to each other, resulting in an outer and inner robot that\ncan bend independently. The outer robot is a unidirectionally asymmetric notch\n(UAN) nickel-titanium robot, and the inner robot is a 3D-printed bidirectional\nrobot, with a nickel-titanium bending member. In addition, the inner robot can\ntranslate axially within the outer robot, allowing the tool to traverse through\nstructures while bending, thereby executing follow-the-leader motion. A\nCosserat-rod based mechanical model is proposed that uses tendon tension of\nboth tendon-actuated robots and the relative translation between the robots as\ninputs and predicts the TACTER tip position for varying input parameters. The\nmodel is validated with experiments, and a human cadaver experiment is\npresented to demonstrate maneuverability from the nostril to the sphenoid\nsinus. This work presents the first tendon-actuated concentric tube (TACT)\ndexterous robotic tool capable of performing follow-the-leader motion within\nnatural nasal orifices to cover workspaces typically required for a successful\nEEA.",

In\ncontrast to the well-studied one-dimensional dissipative Swift-Hohenberg\nequation, the complex variant introduces a wide array of largely unexplored\nsolutions. Our study provides a fundamental step in understanding the complex\ncharacteristics of this equation, particularly for typical classes of\nsolutions-uniform, periodic, and localized states-and their relationship with\nthe original dissipative model. Our findings reveal significant differences\nbetween the two models. For instance, uniform solutions in the conservative\nmodel are inherently unstable, and periodic solutions are generally unstable\nexcept within a narrow parameter interval that supports multiple localized\nstates. Furthermore, we establish a generalized Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion to\ndetermine the stability of localized states in the conservative equation and\nrelate it to the stability properties of the dissipative counterpart.",

Given random variables $X_1, X_2,\\ldots$ over finite domains,\nthe basic terms are probabilities of propositional formulas over atomic events\n$X_i = x_i$, such as $P(X_1 = x_1)$ or $P(X_1 = x_1 \\vee X_2 = x_2)$. The basic\nterms can be combined using addition (yielding linear terms) or multiplication\n(polynomial terms). The probabilistic satisfiability problem asks whether a\njoint probability distribution satisfies a Boolean combination of\n(in)equalities over such terms. Fagin et al. (1990) showed that for basic and\nlinear terms, this problem is NP-complete, making it no harder than Boolean\nsatisfiability, while Moss\\'e et al.

First, we fix the graph structure of the underlying\nstructural causal model, motivated by settings like Pearl's do-calculus, and\ngive a nearly complete landscape across different arithmetics and PCH levels.\nSecond, we study small models. While earlier work showed that satisfiable\ninstances admit polynomial-size models, this is no longer guaranteed with\ncompact marginalization.

To improve performance, several extensions to the\nstandard QAOA framework have been proposed in recent years. Two notable\ndirections include: warm-starting techniques, which incorporate classical\napproximate solutions to guide the quantum evolution, and custom mixer\nHamiltonians, such as XY mixers, which constrain the search to feasible\nsubspaces aligned with the structure of the problem. In this work, we propose\nan approach that integrates these two strategies: a warm-start initialization\nwith an XY mixer ansatz, enabling constraint-preserving quantum evolution\nbiased toward high-quality classical solutions. The method begins by\nreformulating the combinatorial problem as a MaxCut instance, solved\napproximately using the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. The resulting binary\nsolution is relaxed and used to construct a biased superposition over valid\none-hot quantum states, maintaining compatibility with the XY mixer's\nconstraints. We evaluate the approach on 5-city instances of the Traveling\nSalesperson Problem, a canonical optimization problem frequently encountered as\na subroutine in real-world Vehicle Routing Problems. Our method is benchmarked\nagainst both the standard XY-mixer QAOA and a warm-start-only variant based on\nMaxCut relaxation.

In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most\nresearch is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the\nchallenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work\nproposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS.\nTo this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph\nstructure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP\nand a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of\nminimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination of these two\nnovelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment\npolicies for real-world scale DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP\ninstances whose parameters are extracted from real-world logs through process\nmining. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed DRL agent matches or\noutperforms the best baseline in all DTAP instances and generalizes on\ndifferent time horizons and across instances.",

Within the framework of finite elasticity, we formulate nonlinear\nincremental equations, enabling linear and weakly nonlinear analyses. These\nanalyses yield exact bifurcation conditions and an amplitude equation for\nsurface wrinkling. In particular, for a simple fiber-reinforced model, we show\nthat the bifurcation can be supercritical or subcritical depending on the ratio\nbetween the substrate and the film moduli. These findings underscore the\npivotal role of fiber-reinforcement in shaping pattern formation in anisotropic\ntissues and provide insights into the morphological evolution of biological\ntissues.",

This study\nproposes an accelerated sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for 3D-3D rigid\nregistration of transthoracic echocardiographic images with significant and\nlimited overlap taken from apical window that is robust to the noise and\nintensity variation in ultrasound images. The algorithm estimates the\ntranslational and rotational components of the rigid transform through an\niterative process and requires an initial approximation of the rotation and\ntranslation limits. We perform registration in two ways: the image-based\nregistration computes the transform to align the end-diastolic frame of the\napical nonstandard image to the apical standard image and applies the same\ntransform to all frames of the cardiac cycle, whereas the mask-based\nregistration approach uses the binary masks of the left ventricle in the same\nway. The SMC and exhaustive search (EX) algorithms were evaluated for 4D\ntemporal sequences recorded from 7 volunteers who participated in a study\nconducted at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute.

Methods: MonteCarlo simulations based on the IRT\nmethod were performed to analyze the dynamics after irradiation, including\nsingle-pulse or multi-pulses irradiation, pulse repetition rate, width and\ndose. The physicochemical experiments were performed to measure the\neaq-lifetimes for validation. The generation and recombination of OH and\neaq-radicals were recorded under 6 MeV electron irradiation with varying beam\ntemporal profiles. The radial distributions of the radicals were statistically\nanalyzed, and the corresponding LETd and LETt were calculated. The inter-track\ninteractions were assessed through a mathematical model. Results: The spatial\ndistribution and temporal evolution of radicals were significantly affected by\nthe beam time profiles. Compared with multi-pulses irradiation, single-pulse\nmode with a width less than 1/10 of the radical lifetime, a repetition interval\nlonger than the radical lifetime, and a dose exceeding 1 Gy/pulse can lead to\nradicals rapid consumption, reducing the residual content. Instantaneous high\ndose rates induced radical tracks overlaps. When the single-pulse dose exceeded\n1 Gy, the overlap probability approached 100%, aligning with the threshold for\nradical instantaneous combination. Conclusion: Under a low-duty cycle and high\ninstantaneous dose-rate time profile, the radicals were rapidly consumed\nthrough track overlap hence reduced damage to normal tissues, inducing FLASH\neffect. The optimized time profile can be used to guide the development of\nequipment and parameter settings in clinical practice to maximize the FLASH\neffect, such as the laser accelerators and superconducting photocathode guns.",

During MoE model training, each input token is dynamically routed to a\nsubset of experts -- sparsely-activated feed-forward networks -- within each\ntransformer layer. The distribution of tokens assigned to each expert varies\nwidely and rapidly over the course of training. To handle the wide load\nimbalance across experts, current systems are forced to either drop tokens\nassigned to popular experts, degrading convergence, or frequently rebalance\nresources allocated to each expert based on popularity, incurring high state\nmigration overheads.\n  To break this performance-accuracy tradeoff, we introduce SwiftMoE, an\nadaptive MoE training system. The key insight of SwiftMoE is to decouple the\nplacement of expert parameters from their large optimizer state. SwiftMoE\nstatically partitions the optimizer of each expert across all training nodes.\nMeanwhile, SwiftMoE dynamically adjusts the placement of expert parameters by\nrepurposing existing weight updates, avoiding migration overheads. In doing so,\nSwiftMoE right-sizes the GPU resources allocated to each expert, on a\nper-iteration basis, with minimal overheads.

Specifically, we provide an upper bound on\nthe total variation distance between the type (i.e., the empirical probability\nmass function) of the transmitted messages and its estimate over a Gaussian\nmultiple access channel.

    "abstract": "Gradient compression is an effective technique for reducing communication\noverhead in federated learning (FL), and error feedback (EF) is widely adopted\nto remedy the compression errors. However, in asynchronous FL settings-which\ninherently face three major challenges: asynchronous delay, data heterogeneity,\nand flexible client participation-the complex interactions among these\nsystem/statistical constraints and compression/EF mechanisms remain poorly\nunderstood theoretically. There is a significant lack of systematic convergence\nanalysis that adequately captures these complex couplings. In this paper, we\nfill this gap by analyzing the convergence behaviors of FL under different\nframeworks. We first consider a basic asynchronous FL framework AsynFL, and\nestablish an improved convergence analysis that relies on fewer assumptions and\nyields a superior convergence rate than prior studies. Then, we consider a\nvariant framework with gradient compression, AsynFLC. We derive sufficient\nconditions for its convergence, indicating the nonlinear interaction between\nasynchronous delay and compression rate. Our analysis further demonstrates how\nasynchronous delay and data heterogeneity jointly amplify compression-induced\nerrors, thereby hindering convergence. Furthermore, we study the convergence of\nAsynFLC-EF, the framework that further integrates EF. We prove that EF can\neffectively reduce the variance of gradient estimation despite asynchronous\ndelays, which enables AsynFLC-EF to match the convergence rate of AsynFL. We\nalso show that the impact of asynchronous delay and flexible participation on\nEF is limited to slowing down the higher-order convergence term.

Our key insight is to interpret single-head attention as an input\ndomain-partition mechanism that assigns distinct values to subregions. This\nallows us to engineer the attention weights such that this assignment imitates\nthe target function. Building on this, we prove that a single self-attention\nlayer, preceded by sum-of-linear transformations, is capable of approximating\nany continuous function on a compact domain under the $L_\\infty$-norm.\nFurthermore, we extend this construction to approximate any Lebesgue integrable\nfunction under $L_p$-norm for $1\\leq p <\\infty$.

    "abstract": "Accurate detection of breast cancer from high-resolution mammograms is\ncrucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Previous studies\nhave shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer\ndetection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more\ncomprehensive insights. Multi-view classification, especially in medical\nimaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with\nlarge-scale, high-resolution data. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-view\nVisual Prompt Tuning Network (MVPT-NET) for analyzing multiple screening\nmammograms. We first pretrain a robust single-view classification model on\nhigh-resolution mammograms and then innovatively adapt multi-view feature\nlearning into a task-specific prompt tuning process. This technique selectively\ntunes a minimal set of trainable parameters (7\\%) while retaining the\nrobustness of the pre-trained single-view model, enabling efficient integration\nof multi-view data without the need for aggressive downsampling. Our approach\noffers an efficient alternative to traditional feature fusion methods,\nproviding a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution for high-resolution\nmammogram analysis. Experimental results on a large multi-institution dataset\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches while\nmaintaining detection efficiency, achieving an AUROC of 0.852 for\ndistinguishing between Benign, DCIS, and Invasive classes. This work highlights\nthe potential of MVPT-NET for medical imaging tasks and provides a scalable\nsolution for integrating multi-view data in breast cancer detection.",

With the rapid scaling of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), particularly through reinforcement learning (RL), there is a growing\nneed for more capable discriminators. Consequently, advances in classification\nare becoming increasingly vital for enhancing the overall capabilities of LLMs.\nTraditional discriminative methods map text to labels but overlook LLMs'\nintrinsic generative strengths. Generative classification addresses this by\nprompting the model to directly output labels. However, existing studies still\nrely on simple SFT alone, seldom probing the interplay between training and\ninference prompts, and no work has systematically leveraged RL for generative\ntext classifiers and unified SFT, RL, and inference-time prompting in one\nframework. We bridge this gap with GenCLS++, a framework that jointly optimizes\nSFT and RL while systematically exploring five high-level strategy\ndimensions-in-context learning variants, category definitions, explicit\nuncertainty labels, semantically irrelevant numeric labels, and\nperplexity-based decoding-during both training and inference. After an SFT\n\"policy warm-up,\" we apply RL with a simple rule-based reward, yielding sizable\nextra gains. Across seven datasets, GenCLS++ achieves an average accuracy\nimprovement of 3.46% relative to the naive SFT baseline; on public datasets,\nthis improvement rises to 4.00%. Notably, unlike reasoning-intensive tasks that\nbenefit from explicit thinking processes, we find that classification tasks\nperform better without such reasoning steps.

The simulation results\nare compared with JWST observations and used to predict XRISM spectra, to\nevaluate the accuracy of the modeled ejecta structure. Our simulations\nreproduce the large-scale Fe-rich ejecta morphology seen by JWST, revealing two\nclumps suggestive of a bipolar explosion. Ni-bubble effects in the first year\nboost Fe-rich ejecta expansion and their interaction with the reverse shock.\nHowever, discrepancies with JWST observations in clump velocities and spatial\ndistribution suggest stronger explosion asymmetries than modeled. Since 2021,\nour models predict that shocked ejecta have contributed increasingly to X-ray\nemission, now rivaling shocked CSM and soon dominating as the latter fades.\nFuture XRISM observations will trace the evolution of these ejecta structures,\nrefining constraints on explosion geometry. Early remnant asymmetries from CSM\ninteraction may persist for at least 100 years. Our results underscore the role\nof asymmetric core-collapse mechanisms in shaping SN 1987A's ejecta and\nconstraining its explosion geometry.

Deep models for mammogram analysis and mass\n(or micro-calcification) detection require training with a large volume of\nlabeled images, which are often expensive and time-consuming to collect. To\nreduce this challenge, we proposed a novel method that leverages\nself-supervised learning (SSL) and a deep hybrid model, named \\textbf{HybMNet},\nwhich combines local self-attention and fine-grained feature extraction to\nenhance breast cancer detection on screening mammograms.\n  Approach: Our method employs a two-stage learning process: (1) SSL\nPretraining: We utilize EsViT, a SSL technique, to pretrain a Swin Transformer\n(Swin-T) using a limited set of mammograms. The pretrained Swin-T then serves\nas the backbone for the downstream task. (2) Downstream Training: The proposed\nHybMNet combines the Swin-T backbone with a CNN-based network and a novel\nfusion strategy. The Swin-T employs local self-attention to identify\ninformative patch regions from the high-resolution mammogram, while the\nCNN-based network extracts fine-grained local features from the selected\npatches. A fusion module then integrates global and local information from both\nnetworks to generate robust predictions. The HybMNet is trained end-to-end,\nwith the loss function combining the outputs of the Swin-T and CNN modules to\noptimize feature extraction and classification performance.\n  Results: The proposed method was evaluated for its ability to detect breast\ncancer by distinguishing between benign (normal) and malignant mammograms.\nLeveraging SSL pretraining and the HybMNet model, it achieved AUC of 0.864 (95%\nCI: 0.852, 0.875) on the CMMD dataset and 0.889 (95% CI: 0.875, 0.903) on the\nINbreast dataset, highlighting its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "According to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), Cross-Site\nScripting (XSS) is a critical security vulnerability. Despite decades of\nresearch, XSS remains among the top 10 security vulnerabilities. Researchers\nhave proposed various techniques to protect systems from XSS attacks, with\nmachine learning (ML) being one of the most widely used methods. An ML model is\ntrained on a dataset to identify potential XSS threats, making its\neffectiveness highly dependent on the size and diversity of the training data.\nA variation of XSS is obfuscated XSS, where attackers apply obfuscation\ntechniques to alter the code's structure, making it challenging for security\nsystems to detect its malicious intent. Our study's random forest model was\ntrained on traditional (non-obfuscated) XSS data achieved 99.8% accuracy.\nHowever, when tested against obfuscated XSS samples, accuracy dropped to 81.9%,\nunderscoring the importance of training ML models with obfuscated data to\nimprove their effectiveness in detecting XSS attacks. A significant challenge\nis to generate highly complex obfuscated code despite the availability of\nseveral public tools. These tools can only produce obfuscation up to certain\nlevels of complexity.\n  In our proposed system, we fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate\ncomplex obfuscated XSS payloads automatically. By transforming original XSS\nsamples into diverse obfuscated variants, we create challenging training data\nfor ML model evaluation. Our approach achieved a 99.5% accuracy rate with the\nobfuscated dataset. We also found that the obfuscated samples generated by the\nLLMs were 28.1% more complex than those created by other tools, significantly\nimproving the model's ability to handle advanced XSS attacks and making it more\neffective for real-world application security.",

    "abstract": "Discovering molecules with desirable molecular properties, including ADMET\nprofiles, is of great importance in drug discovery. Existing approaches\ntypically employ deep learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and\nTransformers, to predict these molecular properties by learning from diverse\nchemical information. However, these models often fail to efficiently capture\nand utilize the hierarchical nature of molecular structures, and often lack\nmechanisms for effective interaction among multi-level features. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Interaction Message Passing\nMechanism, which serves as the foundation of our novel model, the Hierarchical\nInteraction Message Net (HimNet). Our method enables interaction-aware\nrepresentation learning across atomic, motif, and molecular levels via\nhierarchical attention-guided message passing. This design allows HimNet to\neffectively balance global and local information, ensuring rich and\ntask-relevant feature extraction for downstream property prediction tasks, such\nas Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP). We systematically evaluate HimNet\non eleven datasets, including eight widely-used MoleculeNet benchmarks and\nthree challenging, high-value datasets for metabolic stability, malaria\nactivity, and liver microsomal clearance, covering a broad range of\npharmacologically relevant properties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nHimNet achieves the best or near-best performance in most molecular property\nprediction tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits promising hierarchical\ninterpretability, aligning well with chemical intuition on representative\nmolecules. We believe that HimNet offers an accurate and efficient solution for\nmolecular activity and ADMET property prediction, contributing to advanced\ndecision-making in the early stages of drug discovery.",

However, the limited\nperformance of teacher models on out-of-distribution samples and the inherent\nquality gap between augmented and original data hinder their effectiveness and\nthey typically fail to leverage the advantages of incorporating rich contextual\ninformation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Federated\nCausal Augmentation method, termed FedCAug, which employs causality-inspired\ndata augmentation to break the spurious correlation between attributes and\ncategories. Specifically, it designs a causal region localization module to\naccurately identify and decouple the background and objects in the image,\nproviding rich contextual information for causal data augmentation.\nAdditionally, it designs a causality-inspired data augmentation module that\nintegrates causal features and within-client context to generate counterfactual\nsamples. This significantly enhances data diversity, and the entire process\ndoes not require any information sharing between clients, thereby contributing\nto the protection of data privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on three\ndatasets reveal that FedCAug markedly reduces the model's reliance on\nbackground to predict sample labels, achieving superior performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Here, we integrate monthly near-surface\ntemperature projections from various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways of CMIP6\nEarth System Models with region-specific thermal performance parameters to\nsimulate population dynamics in 11 plant pollinator networks across tropical,\ntemperate, and Mediterranean ecosystems. Our results show that tropical\nnetworks, already near their thermal limits, face pronounced (50 percent)\npollinator declines under high-emissions scenarios (SSP5-8.5). Multi-species\nmanagement targeting keystone plants emerges as a critical strategy for\nstabilizing these high risk tropical systems, boosting both pollinator\nabundance and evenness. In contrast, temperate networks remain well below\ncritical temperature thresholds, with minimal (5 percent) pollinator declines\nand negligible gains from any intensive management strategy. These findings\nchallenge single-species models and uniform-parameter frameworks, which\nconsistently underestimate tropical vulnerability while overestimating\ntemperate risk. We demonstrate that explicitly incorporating complex network\ninteractions, region-specific thermal tolerances, and targeted multi species\ninterventions is vital for maintaining pollination services.

Furthermore, with the use of low NA,\nlong working distance optics for signal collection, SRP expands the allowed\nsample space from millimeters to centimeters, which diversifies the sample\nformats to multi-well plates and thick tissues. The sensitivity and imaging\ndepth are further amplified by using urea for both thermal enhancement and\ntissue clearance. Together, fiber laser SRP microscopy provides a robust,\nuser-friendly platform for diverse applications.",

    "abstract": "Vector quantization, a problem rooted in Shannon's source coding theory, aims\nto quantize high-dimensional Euclidean vectors while minimizing distortion in\ntheir geometric structure. We propose TurboQuant to address both mean-squared\nerror (MSE) and inner product distortion, overcoming limitations of existing\nmethods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates. Our data-oblivious\nalgorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion\nrates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions.\nTurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a\nconcentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the\nnear-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply\napply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that\nMSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a\ntwo-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL\n(QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product\nquantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower\nbounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer,\ndemonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a\nsmall constant ($\\approx 2.7$) factor. Experimental results validate our\ntheoretical findings, showing that for KV cache quantization, we achieve\nabsolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and marginal quality\ndegradation with 2.5 bits per channel. Furthermore, in nearest neighbor search\ntasks, our method outperforms existing product quantization techniques in\nrecall while reducing indexing time to virtually zero.",

Additionally, uncertain distributions of high-energy\nstellar evolution and planet age further blur the critical instellations for\natmospheric retention, yielding broad shorelines. Hydrodynamic escape models\nfind atmospheric retention is markedly more favorable for higher-mass planets\norbiting higher-mass stars, with carbon-rich atmospheres remaining plausible\nfor 55 Cancri e despite its extreme instellation.

This source is particularly interesting as the presence\nof massive planets within the dust cavity has been suggested based on previous\nNIR observations. We find that the level of CO emission observed within the\ndust cavity is inconsistent with the presence of planets more massive than\nJupiter orbiting between 10-40 au.

Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high\nrequest rates.\n  In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system\nlies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational\nresource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose\na novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation\nand unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller\nto achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM)\nlevel, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access\nfrom both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism\nbetween the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic\npartitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request\nrates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on\nDeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency\nconstraints on Llama series models.",

Specifically, we propose an adversarial\ntrigger generation method to generate stealthy adversarial triggers from\nordinary dataset, providing visual fidelity while inducing semantic shifts. To\nalleviate the issue of anomaly detection among model outputs, we propose a\npost-transform module to correct the model output by narrowing the distance\nbetween adversarial trigger image embedding and text embedding. Subsequently, a\ntwo-phase watermark verification is proposed to judge whether the current model\ninfringes by comparing the two results with and without the transform module.\nConsequently, we consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods across five\ndatasets in the downstream tasks of multimodal image-text retrieval and image\nclassification.

However, SDS-based methods struggle to maintain\nsemantic fidelity for user prompts, particularly when involving multiple\nobjects with intricate interactions. While existing approaches often address 3D\nconsistency through multiview diffusion model fine-tuning on 3D datasets, this\nstrategy inadvertently exacerbates text-3D alignment degradation. The\nlimitation stems from SDS's inherent accumulation of view-independent biases\nduring optimization, which progressively diverges from the ideal text alignment\ndirection. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel SDS objective,\ndubbed as Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD), which integrates\nalignment feedback from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our TCSD\nleverages cross-modal understanding capabilities of MLLMs to assess and guide\nthe text-3D correspondence during the optimization.

    "abstract": "The development of autonomous robotic systems offers significant potential\nfor performing complex tasks with precision and consistency. Recent advances in\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled more capable intelligent automation\nsystems, addressing increasingly complex challenges. However, this progress\nraises questions about human roles in such systems. Human-Centered AI (HCAI)\naims to balance human control and automation, ensuring performance enhancement\nwhile maintaining creativity, mastery, and responsibility. For real-world\napplications, autonomous robots must balance task performance with reliability,\nsafety, and trustworthiness. Integrating HCAI principles enhances human-robot\ncollaboration and ensures responsible operation.\n  This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of intelligent autonomous robotic\nsystems, utilizing SciMAT and VOSViewer to examine data from the Scopus\ndatabase. The findings highlight academic trends, emerging topics, and AI's\nrole in self-adaptive robotic behaviour, with an emphasis on HCAI architecture.\nThese insights are then projected onto the IBM MAPE-K architecture, with the\ngoal of identifying how these research results map into actual robotic\nautonomous systems development efforts for real-world scenarios.",

Our approach enhances HOI detection by not only predicting the\nstandard triplets but also introducing quadruplets, which extend HOI triplets\nby including segmentation masks for human-object pairs. More specifically,\nSeg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g.,\npromptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies\nthese attributes to HOI task. Despite training only for HOI, without additional\ntraining mechanisms for these properties, the framework demonstrates that such\nfeatures still operate efficiently.

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) provides a formal framework\nfor specifying such objectives, with robustness metrics widely employed for\ncontrol synthesis. Existing optimization-based approaches using neural network\n(NN)-based controllers often rely on a single NN for both learning and control.\nHowever, variations in initial states and obstacle configurations can lead to\ndiscontinuous changes in the optimization solution, thereby degrading\ngeneralization and control performance. To address this issue, this study\nproposes a method to enhance recurrent neural network (RNN)-based control by\nclustering solution trajectories that satisfy STL specifications under diverse\ninitial conditions. The proposed approach utilizes trajectory similarity\nmetrics to generate clustering labels, which are subsequently used to train a\nclassification network. This network assigns new initial states and obstacle\nconfigurations to the appropriate cluster, enabling the selection of a\nspecialized controller.

    "abstract": "We study the finite and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended\nBose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be\nexperimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical\nlattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing,\nthe system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor\ninteraction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor\ninteractions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase\ndiagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly\nchanges the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum\nand thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure\nsystem, they melt into a normal fluid (NF). In contrast, the insulating phases\nthat survive at high temperatures in the presence of disorder are the Bose\nglass and the normal fluid. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower\ntemperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition\ntemperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths,\nrespectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the\ninsulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature.

HOIGaze\naddresses the challenging HOI setting by building on one key insight: The eye,\nhand, and head movements are closely coordinated during HOIs and this\ncoordination can be exploited to identify samples that are most useful for gaze\nestimator training - as such, effectively denoising the training data. This\ndenoising approach is in stark contrast to previous gaze estimation methods\nthat treated all training samples as equal. Specifically, we propose: 1) a\nnovel hierarchical framework that first recognises the hand currently visually\nattended to and then estimates gaze direction based on the attended hand; 2) a\nnew gaze estimator that uses cross-modal Transformers to fuse head and\nhand-object features extracted using a convolutional neural network and a\nspatio-temporal graph convolutional network; and 3) a novel eye-head\ncoordination loss that upgrades training samples belonging to the coordinated\neye-head movements. We evaluate HOIGaze on the HOT3D and Aria digital twin\n(ADT) datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving an average improvement of 15.6% on HOT3D and 6.0% on ADT in\nmean angular error. To demonstrate the potential of our method, we further\nreport significant performance improvements for the sample downstream task of\neye-based activity recognition on ADT.

This study examines the\nquantum routines required for the implementation of oracles used in the\nblock-encoding of the $N \\times N$ stiffness and mass matrices, which typically\nemerge in the finite element analysis of elastic structures. Starting from\nbasic quantum adders, we show how to construct the necessary oracles, which\nrequire the calculation of polynomials, square root and the implementation of\nconditional operations. We propose quantum subroutines based on fixed-point\narithmetic that, given an $r$-qubit register, construct the oracle using\n$\\mathcal{O}((K + L + N_{\\mathrm{geo}} + N_{\\mathrm{D}}) r)$ ancilla qubits and\nhave a $\\mathcal{O}((K + L)r^2 + \\log_2(N_{\\mathrm{geo}} + N_{\\mathrm{D}}))$\nruntime, with $K$ the order at which we truncate the polynomials, $L$ the\nnumber of iterations in the Newton-Raphson subroutine for the square root,\nwhile $N_{\\mathrm{geo}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{D}}$ are the number of hypercuboids\nused to approximate the geometry and the boundary, respectively.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language\ninstructions, yet they often lack an understanding of security vulnerabilities.\nThis limitation makes it difficult for LLMs to avoid security risks in\ngenerated code, particularly in high-security programming tasks such as smart\ncontract development for blockchain. Researchers have attempted to enhance the\nvulnerability awareness of these models by training them to differentiate\nbetween vulnerable and fixed code snippets. However, this approach relies\nheavily on manually labeled vulnerability data, which is only available for\npopular languages like Python and C++. For low-resource languages like\nSolidity, used in smart contracts, large-scale annotated datasets are scarce\nand difficult to obtain. To address this challenge, we introduce CodeBC, a code\ngeneration model specifically designed for generating secure smart contracts in\nblockchain. CodeBC employs a three-stage fine-tuning approach based on\nCodeLlama, distinguishing itself from previous methods by not relying on\npairwise vulnerability location annotations. Instead, it leverages\nvulnerability and security tags to teach the model the differences between\nvulnerable and secure code. During the inference phase, the model leverages\nsecurity tags to generate secure and robust code. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CodeBC outperforms baseline models in terms of BLEU, CodeBLEU,\nand compilation pass rates, while significantly reducing vulnerability rates.\nThese findings validate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our\nthree-stage fine-tuning strategy, making CodeBC a promising solution for\ngenerating secure smart contract code.",

Such states may indicate\nanomalies requiring attention (e.g., manual correction by the ship master) and\nassist testers in scenario-centered testing. The digital twin consists of two\nmachine-learning models predicting future vessel states and whether the\npredicted state will be OOD. We evaluated ODDIT with five vessels across\nwaypoint and zigzag maneuvering under simulated conditions, including sensor\nand actuator noise and environmental disturbances i.e., ocean current.

    "abstract": "Hyper-differential sensitivity analysis with respect to model discrepancy was\nrecently developed to enable uncertainty quantification for optimization\nproblems. The approach consists of two primary steps: (i) Bayesian calibration\nof the discrepancy between high- and low-fidelity models, and (ii) propagating\nthe model discrepancy uncertainty through the optimization problem. When\nhigh-fidelity model evaluations are limited, as is common in practice, the\nprior discrepancy distribution plays a crucial role in the uncertainty\nanalysis. However, specification of this prior is challenging due to its\nmathematical complexity and many hyper-parameters. This article presents a\nnovel approach to specify the prior distribution. Our approach consists of two\nparts: (1) an algorithmic initialization of the prior hyper-parameters that\nuses existing data to initialize a hyper-parameter estimate, and (2) a\nvisualization framework to systematically explore properties of the prior and\nguide tuning of the hyper-parameters to ensure that the prior captures the\nappropriate range of uncertainty. We provide detailed mathematical analysis and\na collection of numerical examples that elucidate properties of the prior that\nare crucial to ensure uncertainty quantification.",

Although prior approaches like scaling laws\naccount for global factors such as parameter size or training tokens, they\noften overlook explicit lineage relationships-i.e., which models are derived or\nmerged from which parents. In this work, we propose a novel Lineage-Regularized\nMatrix Factorization (LRMF) framework that encodes ancestral ties among LLMs\nvia a graph Laplacian regularizer. By leveraging multi-hop parent-child\nconnections, LRMF consistently outperforms conventional matrix factorization\nand collaborative filtering methods in both instance-level and benchmark-level\nperformance prediction. Our large-scale study includes 2,934 publicly available\nHugging Face models and 21,000+ instances across 6 major benchmarks, showing\nthat the introduction of lineage constraints yields up to 0.15-0.30 higher\nPearson correlation coefficients with actual performance compared to baseline\nmethods. Moreover, LRMF effectively addresses the cold-start problem, providing\naccurate estimates for newly derived or merged models even with minimal data.\nThis lineage-guided strategy thus offers a resource-efficient way to inform\nhyperparameter tuning, data selection, and model combination in modern LLM\ndevelopment.",

Building upon our previous analysis of\nindividual parameter transitions in SH0ES data, we investigate the impact of\nsimultaneous transitions in multiple Cepheid and SNIa calibration parameters at\nspecific cosmic distances. We allow various combinations of transitions in\nCepheid absolute magnitude ($M^W_H$), period-luminosity relation slope ($b_W$),\nmetallicity coefficient ($Z_W$), and SNIa absolute magnitude ($M_B$). Our\ncomprehensive analysis reveals a consistent preferred transition distance of\napproximately 23 Mpc across different parameter combinations. The most\nstatistically favored model allows simultaneous transitions in $b_W$, $Z_W$,\nand $M_B$, yielding $\\Delta \\text{AIC} \\simeq -9.2$ and $\\Delta \\text{BIC}\n\\simeq -3.0$ compared to the baseline SH0ES model. This provides strong\nevidence for inhomogeneities in standard candle calibrations. We demonstrate\nthat the post-transition SNIa absolute magnitude aligns more closely with\nCMB-based constraints, resulting in a reduced Hubble constant value that\nalleviates the tension.

    "abstract": "Semantic broadcast communications (Semantic BC) for image transmission have\nachieved significant performance gains for single-task scenarios. Nevertheless,\nextending these methods to multi-task scenarios remains challenging, as\ndifferent tasks typically require distinct objective functions, leading to\npotential conflicts within the shared encoder. In this paper, we propose a\ntri-level reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-task Semantic BC framework,\ntermed SemanticBC-TriRL, which effectively resolves such conflicts and enables\nthe simultaneous support of multiple downstream tasks at the receiver side,\nincluding image classification and content reconstruction tasks. Specifically,\nthe proposed framework employs a bottom-up tri-level alternating learning\nstrategy, formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. At\nthe first level, task-specific decoders are locally optimized using supervised\nlearning. At the second level, the shared encoder is updated via proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO), guided by task-oriented rewards. At the third level,\na multi-gradient aggregation-based task weighting module adaptively adjusts\ntask priorities and steers the encoder optimization. Through this hierarchical\nlearning process, the encoder and decoders are alternately trained, and the\nthree levels are cohesively integrated via constrained learning objective.\nBesides, the convergence of SemanticBC-TriRL is also theoretically established.\nExtensive simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the\nproposed framework across diverse channel conditions, particularly in low SNR\nregimes, and confirm its scalability with increasing numbers of receivers.",

    "abstract": "This work builds upon previous studies of nonlinear dynamics in low-pressure\ncapacitively coupled radio-frequency discharges, focusing on the electron power\nabsorption mechanism in discharges with various geometric asymmetries. We\npresent a comprehensive investigation using a fully kinetic electrostatic 1d3v\nParticle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo collision simulation in spherical geometry. By\nsystematically varying the inner electrode radius and the electrode gap\ndistance, we analyze the influence of geometric asymmetry on key plasma\nproperties, including electron density, power absorption, electron dynamics,\nand current characteristics. A central focus is placed on the cumulative power\ndensity as a diagnostic for energy deposition. In strongly asymmetric\nconfigurations, the cumulative electron power density exhibits distinct\nstepwise increases during sheath expansion, corresponding to the acceleration\nof successive electron beams. These nonlinear signatures are directly linked to\nthe excitation of plasma series resonance and enhanced beam-driven power\nabsorption. In contrast, more symmetric configurations display smoother, more\nsymmetric cumulative power evolution, indicating balanced energy transfer at\nboth sheaths and reduced nonlinearities. Time- and space-resolved diagnostics\nof cumulative power, current waveforms, and densities of energetic electrons\nreveal the critical role of asymmetry in shaping electron confinement and\nbeam-driven power absorption. These findings demonstrate that the discharge\ngeometry is actually an important design parameter which needs to taken into\naccount during the design and construction phase of a reactor as it directly\ninfluences the plasma behavior with respect to energy deposition.",

In this work, we examine the relaxation dynamics for Beta\nMn type Co_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4 across a frequency range of 1 kHz to 10\nkHz, spanning different magnetic phases. While most magnetic systems tend to\nfollow the Debye-like relaxation with non-zero distribution or the Cole-Cole\nformalism, our analysis reveal that these conventional models fail to capture\nfrequency dependence of ac susceptibility across different magnetic phases in\nCo_8Zn_7Mn_5 and Co_8Zn_8Mn_4. Instead, an inertial component is needed to\nsuccessfully describe the dynamics, suggesting the presence of unconventional\nrelaxation behavior. The characteristic relaxation time is found to be of the\norder of 10^-5 s for both the compositions. The field dependent variation of\nrelaxation time exhibits a non-monotonic nature, with the double peak like\nstructure at the skyrmion phase transitions, implying slower relaxation\ndynamics at the phase boundaries. Furthermore, the presence of non-zero\ndifference between isothermal and adiabatic susceptibility in the pure phases\nimplies slower relaxation dynamics, which is consistent with the presence of\nfinite dissipation in pure phases.

Ce-BAS is a rare\nexample of a system where heavy-fermion physics coexists with low-energy\nrattling phonon modes, making it a candidate for enhanced thermoelectric\nperformance. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a\ntemperature-dependent local moment that cannot be explained within a static\ncrystal-field model. A fit to the susceptibility data requires strong mixing\nbetween the j = 5/2 and j = 7/2 crystal-field states, which implies large\ninternal splittings inconsistent with RIXS spectra. In contrast, RIXS data are\nwell described by a model with negligible j = 5/2 - j = 7/2 mixing and an\nenergy separation of 12 meV between the ground and first excited crystal-field\nstates. The inability to reconcile these two datasets within a static framework\npoints to a dynamical modification of the crystal-field potential. We attribute\nthis to coupling between the Ce 4f electrons and low-energy phonons associated\nwith the Ce rattling motion.

Despite\nthe remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear\nwhat representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for\nvarious downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning\nis critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is\nproducing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is\nimperative for further progress.\n  Prior work treated different representation learning methods quite\ndifferently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for\nanalyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is\nlearned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We\nprove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association,\nin which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be\noptimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also\nshow that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is\nneither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture\ntheory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing\nreturns, and further advancements require better contexts.\n  We demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture,\nincluding supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models,\netc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning\nthe contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an\neffortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove\nstatistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss\nthe effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream\ntask.",

    "abstract": "Non-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer enhanced\nwireless signal manipulation over conventional RIS by enabling the incident\nsignal on any of its $M$ elements to be reflected from another element via an\n$M \\times M$ switch array. To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the\nacquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential.\nHowever, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is\nperformed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails\nestimating the CSI for the $M \\times M$ switch array cascaded channels,\nresulting in estimating $M^2$ coefficients, to identify the optimal\nconfiguration of the non-diagonal RIS that maximizes the channel gain. In this\npaper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation protocol that\nsubstantially reduces the estimation overhead from the exhaustive $M^2$\ncoefficients to only $3M$ coefficients for both single-input single-output\n(SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Specifically, a\nthree-stage pilot-based protocol is proposed to estimate scaled versions of the\nuser-RIS and RIS-base-station (BS) channels in the first two stages using the\nleast square (LS) estimator and the commonly used ON/OFF protocol for\nconventional RIS. These scaled estimates enable the optimization of the switch\narray. In the third stage, the cascaded user-RIS-BS channels are estimated to\nenable efficient beamforming optimization. Complexity analysis shows that our\nproposed protocol significantly reduces the BS estimation complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(NM^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(NM)$, where $N$ is the number of BS\nantennas. This complexity is similar to the ON/OFF-based LS estimation for\nconventional diagonal RIS.",

While\nintrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are key drivers of phase separation,\nadditional factors such as folded domains and RNA also influence condensate\nformation and physical properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying\nthis regulation remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we\ninvestigate how the multidomain structure of TDP-43, which consists of its IDR,\nRNA recognition motifs (RRMs), and N-terminal domain (NTD), interacts with RNA\nand affects the characteristics of phase separation. Our analysis reveals that\ninteraction sites within the IDR undergo dynamic rearrangement, driven by key\nresidues that depend on the specific combination of folded domains. Upon RNA\nbinding, several intermolecular interactions of TDP-43 are replaced by\nTDP-43-polyA interactions, altering viscoelastic properties of the condensate.\nSpecifically, RRMs enhance viscosity, whereas the NTD reduces it. The presence\nof polyA increases elasticity, making viscosity and elasticity comparable in\nmagnitude. These findings suggest that the multidomain structure of TDP-43 and\nits RNA interactions orchestrate condensate organization, modulating their\nviscoelastic properties.",

ML models trained on experimental data reveals\nthat increasing Si and B content reduces MS from 1.81T (DFT~2.04 T) to ~1.54 T\n(DFT~1.56T) in Fe-Si-B, which is attributed to decreased magnetic density and\nstructural modifications. Experimental validation of ML predicted magnetic\nsaturation on Fe-1Si-1B (2.09T), Fe-5Si-5B (2.01T) and Fe-10Si-10B (1.54T)\nalloy compositions further support our findings. These trends are consistent\nwith density functional theory (DFT) predictions, which link increased\nelectronic disorder and band broadening to lower MS values. Experimental\nvalidation on selected alloys confirms the predictive accuracy of the ML model,\nwith good agreement across compositions. Beyond predictive accuracy, detailed\nuncertainty quantification and model interpretability including through feature\nimportance and partial dependence analysis reveals that MS is governed by a\nnonlinear interplay between Fe content, early transition metal ratios, and\nannealing temperature, while HC is more sensitive to processing conditions such\nas ribbon thickness and thermal treatment windows.

    "abstract": "Test-negative designs (TNDs), a form of case-cohort study, are widely used to\nevaluate infectious disease interventions, notably for influenza and, more\nrecently, COVID-19 vaccines. TNDs rely on recruiting individuals who are tested\nfor the disease of interest and comparing test-positive and test-negative\nindividuals by exposure status (e.g., vaccination). Traditionally, TND studies\nfocused on symptomatic individuals to minimize confounding from\nhealthcare-seeking behavior. However, during outbreaks such as COVID-19 and\nEbola, testing also occurred for asymptomatic individuals (e.g., through\ncontact tracing), introducing potential bias when combining symptomatic and\nasymptomatic cases. Motivated by a trial evaluating an Ebola virus disease\n(EVD) vaccine, we study a specific version of this ``multiple reasons for\ntesting\" problem. In this setting, symptomatic individuals were tested under\nthe standard TND approach, while asymptomatic close contacts of test-positive\ncases were also tested. We propose a simple method to estimate the common\nvaccine efficacy across these groups and assess whether efficacy differs by\nrecruitment pathway. Although the EVD trial ended early due to the cessation of\nthe outbreak, the proposed methodology remains relevant for future vaccine\ntrials with similar designs.",

This\nfunction is called the Brenier potential. Furthermore, detailed information on\nthe H\\\"older regularity of the Brenier potential is available. In this work we\ndevelop the statistical learning theory of generative adversarial neural\nnetworks that learn the Brenier potential. As by the transformation of\ndensities formula, the density of the generated measure depends on the second\nderivative of the Brenier potential, we develop the universal approximation\ntheory of ReCU networks with cubic activation $\\mathtt{ReCU}(x)=\\max\\{0,x\\}^3$\nthat combines the favorable approximation properties of H\\\"older functions with\na Lipschitz continuous density. In order to assure the convexity of such\ngeneral networks, we introduce an adversarial training procedure for a\npotential function represented by the ReCU networks that combines the classical\ndiscriminator cross entropy loss with a penalty term that enforces (strict)\nconvexity. We give a detailed decomposition of learning errors and show that\nfor a suitable high penalty parameter all networks chosen in the adversarial\nmin-max optimization problem are strictly convex. This is further exploited to\nprove the consistency of the learning procedure for (slowly) expanding network\ncapacity. We also implement the described learning algorithm and apply it to a\nnumber of standard test cases from Gaussian mixture to image data as target\ndistributions. As predicted in theory, we observe that the convexity loss\nbecomes inactive during the training process and the potentials represented by\nthe neural networks have learned convexity.",

However, most existing AI models do\nnot have atmospheric environmental forecasting capabilities, while those with\nrelated functionalities remain constrained by grid-dependent data requirements,\nthus unable to deliver operationally feasible city-scale atmospheric\nenvironment forecasts. Here we introduce 'BiXiao', a novel discontinuous-grid\nAI model for atmospheric environment forecasting. 'BiXiao' couples\nmeteorological and environmental sub-models to generate predictions using\nsite-specific observational data, completing 72-hour forecasts for six major\npollutants across all key cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region within 30\nseconds. In the comparative experiments, the 'BiXiao' model outperforms\nmainstream numerical models in both computational efficiency and forecast\naccuracy. It surpasses CAMS with respect of operational 72-hour forecasting and\nexceeds WRF-Chem's performance in heavy pollution case predictions.

Quantization is one of the most effective ways to reduce memory\nconsumption of LLMs. However, advanced single-precision quantization methods\nexperience significant accuracy degradation when quantizing to ultra-low bits.\nExisting mixed-precision quantization methods are quantized by groups with\ncoarse granularity. Employing high precision for group data leads to\nsubstantial memory overhead, whereas low precision severely impacts model\naccuracy. To address this issue, we propose FineQ, software-hardware co-design\nfor low-bit fine-grained mixed-precision quantization of LLMs. First, FineQ\npartitions the weights into finer-grained clusters and considers the\ndistribution of outliers within these clusters, thus achieving a balance\nbetween model accuracy and memory overhead. Then, we propose an outlier\nprotection mechanism within clusters that uses 3 bits to represent outliers and\nintroduce an encoding scheme for index and data concatenation to enable aligned\nmemory access. Finally, we introduce an accelerator utilizing temporal coding\nthat effectively supports the quantization algorithm while simplifying the\nmultipliers in the systolic array. FineQ achieves higher model accuracy\ncompared to the SOTA mixed-precision quantization algorithm at a close average\nbit-width.

While BD-RIS has demonstrated\nadvantages over D-RIS in various aspects, most existing works rely on the\nassumption of a lossless model, leaving practical considerations unaddressed.\nThis paper thus proposes a lossy BD-RIS model and develops corresponding\noptimization algorithms for various BD-RIS-aided communication systems. First,\nby leveraging admittance parameter analysis, we model each tunable admittance\nbased on a lumped circuit with losses and derive an expression of a circle\ncharacterizing the real and imaginary parts of each tunable admittance. We then\nconsider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) systems with the proposed lossy BD-RIS model. To solve the\noptimization problem, we design an effective algorithm by carefully exploiting\nthe problem structure. Specifically, an alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) framework is custom-designed to deal with the complicated\nconstraints associated with lossy BD-RIS. Furthermore, we extend the proposed\nalgorithmic framework to more general multiuser multiple-input single-output\n(MU-MISO) systems, where the transmit precoder and BD-RIS scattering matrix are\njointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of the system. Finally, simulation\nresults demonstrate that all BD-RIS architectures still outperform D-RIS in the\npresence of losses, but the optimal BD-RIS architectures in the lossless case\nare not necessarily optimal in the lossy case, e.g. group-connected BD-RIS can\noutperform fully- and tree-connected BD-RISs in SISO systems with relatively\nhigh losses, whereas the opposite always holds true in the lossless case.",

Focusing exclusively on electron-phonon interaction,\norientational relaxation is introduced and acts as dephasing of the optical\nexcitation on a scale of tens of fs. In the linear regime, our numerical\nresults agree with the experimental fits to a Drude model and predicts for\nnon-linear excitations a field strength dependency of the orientational\nrelaxation rate. In the THz regime, where the orientational relaxation proceeds\nfaster than the oscillation cycle of the excitation THz field, a new high order\ndissipative Kerr-type non-linearity is predicted. This non-linearity originates\nfrom the Pauli blocking included in the electron-phonon scattering and results\nin a non-linearly increasing transmission of the film, detectable in\nexperiments.",

In clinical practice, disease can only be diagnosed\nat pre-specified follow-up visits, so the exact time of disease onset is often\nunknown, resulting in interval-censored data. This study examines the impact of\nignoring this interval-censored nature of disease data on the discrimination\nperformance of illness-death models, focusing on the time-specific Area Under\nthe receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) in both incident/dynamic and\ncumulative/dynamic definitions. A simulation study with data simulated from\nWeibull transition hazards and disease state censored at regular intervals is\nconducted. Estimates are derived using different methods: the Cox model with a\ntime-dependent binary disease marker, which ignores interval-censoring, and the\nillness-death model for interval-censored data estimated with three\nimplementations - the piecewise-constant model from the msm package, the\nWeibull and M-spline models from the SmoothHazard package. These methods are\nalso applied to a dataset of 2232 patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcoma,\nwhere the interval-censored disease state is the post-operative development of\ndistant metastases. The results suggest that, in the presence of\ninterval-censored disease times, it is important to account for\ninterval-censoring not only when estimating the parameters of the model but\nalso when evaluating the discrimination performance of the disease.",

To address these limitations, we start from an\nnaive assumption that text understanding is only a sufficient condition for\ntext rendering, but not a necessary condition. Based on this, we present\nRepText, which aims to empower pre-trained monolingual text-to-image generation\nmodels with the ability to accurately render, or more precisely, replicate,\nmultilingual visual text in user-specified fonts, without the need to really\nunderstand them. Specifically, we adopt the setting from ControlNet and\nadditionally integrate language agnostic glyph and position of rendered text to\nenable generating harmonized visual text, allowing users to customize text\ncontent, font and position on their needs. To improve accuracy, a text\nperceptual loss is employed along with the diffusion loss. Furthermore, to\nstabilize rendering process, at the inference phase, we directly initialize\nwith noisy glyph latent instead of random initialization, and adopt region\nmasks to restrict the feature injection to only the text region to avoid\ndistortion of the background. We conducted extensive experiments to verify the\neffectiveness of our RepText relative to existing works, our approach\noutperforms existing open-source methods and achieves comparable results to\nnative multi-language closed-source models.

While non-invasive video monitoring has become a common practice\nin finfish aquaculture, existing intelligent monitoring methods predominantly\nfocus on assessing body condition or fish swimming patterns and are often\ndeveloped and evaluated in controlled tank environments, without demonstrating\ntheir applicability to real-world aquaculture settings in open sea farms. This\nunderscores the necessity for methods that can monitor physiological traits\ndirectly within the production environment of sea fish farms. To this end, we\nhave developed a computer vision method for monitoring ventilation rates of\nAtlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which was specifically designed for videos\nrecorded in the production environment of commercial sea fish farms using the\nexisting infrastructure. Our approach uses a fish head detection model, which\nclassifies the mouth state as either open or closed using a convolutional\nneural network. This is followed with multiple object tracking to create\ntemporal sequences of fish swimming across the field of view of the underwater\nvideo camera to estimate ventilation rates. The method demonstrated high\nefficiency, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.82 between ground\ntruth and predicted ventilation rates in a test set of 100 fish collected\nindependently of the training data.

Improving registration quality\nrequires a clean separation of skin and non-skin regions on the scan mesh.\nExisting image-based (2D) or scan-based (3D) segmentation methods however\nperform poorly. Image-based segmentation outputs multi-view inconsistent masks,\nand they cannot account for scan inaccuracies or scan-image misalignment, while\nscan-based methods suffer from lower spatial resolution compared to images.

    "abstract": "Grasping has been a long-standing challenge in facilitating the final\ninterface between a robot and the environment. As environments and tasks become\ncomplicated, the need to embed higher intelligence to infer from the\nsurroundings and act on them has become necessary. Although most methods\nutilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure\nsampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning\nproblem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization\nacross domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the\nlack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic\nnature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application\nin real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach\ntowards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to\nno sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning\nalgorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp\npoints on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector\npose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for\neffective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An\noptimization-based quality metric is then used for the evaluation of grasp\npoints to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is\ncompared with the existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach, Grasp pose\ndetection (GPD), as a baseline over multiple simulated objects. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated\nin a real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned\ngrasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator.",

    "abstract": "Complex mechanical systems such as vehicle powertrains are inherently subject\nto multiple nonlinearities and uncertainties arising from parametric\nvariations. Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making\nthe transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a\ncritical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling\ncertain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical\napproach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints.\nThis study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain\nrandomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic\nnetworks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the\nlatent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled\nsystem subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an\nenvironment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness\nof the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases\ntraining difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control\nsystem; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based\ncontroller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based\ncontrols, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a\nhigh level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network\narchitecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is\nverified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain\nsystem with nonlinearities and parametric variations. Comparative tests\ndemonstrate the high robustness of the proposed approach.",

In Hall thrusters, the\ncore factor influencing operational states is the electron cross field\ntransport, where the azimuthal instability serves as a key mechanism. The\nrotational flow of neutral gas may affect instability by altering initial\nazimuthal velocity of ions, which has not been investigated before. Therefore,\nto study the effects of ion rotational flow of varying magnitudes and\ndirections on azimuthal instability, simulations are conducted in this work\nbased on two benchmark particle-in-cell (PIC) cases: the azimuthal-axial and\nthe azimuthal-radial. The results indicate that the ion rotational flow\nvelocity can potentially complicate the coupling characteristics of the\nelectron cyclotron drifting instability and the modified two stream\ninstability, particularly when a reverse rotational flow velocity is added. In\ngeneral, both co-directional and reverse ion rotational flow have been observed\nto inhibit azimuthal instability, which results in a decrease in axial electron\nmobility. A 1% addition of the ion rotational flow (compared to the electron\ndrift) would result in a 10% change of the electron mobility due to varied\nazimuthal instability, and the decrease in electron mobility of the reverse ion\nrotational flow is greater than that of co-directional.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, tens of satellites carry hyperspectral spectrometers. Such\ninstruments allow decomposing the light that exits the atmosphere from its top\ninto hundreds to thousands of contiguous spectral channels. By analysis of the\nlight spectral distribution, and in particular the depths of selected\nabsorption lines, researchers and meteorological agencies can retrieve the\natmosphere composition and thermodynamic state. To get a global view of the\nEarth, several instruments are generally operated synergistically, therefore, a\nharmonized calibration must be achieved between them.\n  To cross-calibrate two spectrometers, a common practice is to analyze an\nensemble of collocated measurements, meaning acquisitions performed at the same\ntime and under the same geometry. Nonetheless, such analysis always faces the\nissue of setting appropriate temporal and geometric thresholds in defining the\ncollocations, trading off between statistics and quality. Consequently, some\ncollocation mismatches may have a substantial impact on the cross-calibration\nresults. Thus, the following manuscript describes in detail the inclusion of\ncollocation errors into the mathematical description and presents an\napplication which is designed on purpose to be robust to such errors.\n  Then, the knowledge of the spectral sensitivities of each channel to the\nincoming light, called the spectral response functions (SRF), are key to the\nexploitation of the acquisitions. In that context, the authors have studied and\ndesigned a novel methodology to retrieve relative SRF between two or more\nspectrometers, within a single instrument or between instruments embarked on\ndifferent platforms. The objective of the methodology is to characterize\ndiscrepancies of responses between flying spectrometers, track long-term\nevolutions and harmonize their responses with post-processing when necessary.",

To bridge this gap, this paper\nintroduces the ComsAmy, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for\nopen-set anomaly segmentation in complex scenarios. ComsAmy encompasses a wide\nspectrum of adverse weather conditions, dynamic driving environments, and\ndiverse anomaly types to comprehensively evaluate the model performance in\nrealistic open-world scenarios. Our extensive evaluation of several\nstate-of-the-art anomalous segmentation models reveals that existing methods\ndemonstrate significant deficiencies in such challenging scenarios,\nhighlighting their serious safety risks for real-world deployment. To solve\nthat, we propose a novel energy-entropy learning (EEL) strategy that integrates\nthe complementary information from energy and entropy to bolster the robustness\nof anomaly segmentation under complex open-world environments. Additionally, a\ndiffusion-based anomalous training data synthesizer is proposed to generate\ndiverse and high-quality anomalous images to enhance the existing copy-paste\ntraining data synthesizer. Extensive experimental results on both public and\nComsAmy benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed diffusion-based synthesizer\nwith energy and entropy learning (DiffEEL) serves as an effective and\ngeneralizable plug-and-play method to enhance existing models, yielding an\naverage improvement of around 4.96% in $\\rm{AUPRC}$ and 9.87% in\n$\\rm{FPR}_{95}$.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the investment planning problem of a virtual power plant\n(VPP), formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. As the\nnumber of binary variables increases and the investment time horizon extends,\nthe problem can become computationally intractable. To mitigate this issue,\ntime series aggregation (TSA) methods are commonly employed. However, since TSA\ntypically results in a loss of accuracy, it is standard practice to derive\nbounds to control the associated error. Existing methods validate these bounds\nonly in the linear case, and when applied to MILP models, they often yield\nheuristics that may even produce infeasible solutions. To bridge this gap, we\npropose an iterative TSA method for solving the VPP investment planning problem\nformulated as a MILP model, while ensuring a bounded error in the objective\nfunction. Our main theoretical contribution is to formally demonstrate that the\nderived bounds remain valid at each iteration. Notably, the proposed method\nconsistently guarantees feasible solutions throughout the iterative process.\nNumerical results show that the proposed TSA method achieves superior\ncomputational efficiency compared to standard full-scale optimization.",

To demonstrate the\nviability of this approach, we consider the fermiophobic Higgs boson $h_{\\rm\nf}$ in the Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model as a representative scenario. In the\nultralight regime ($m_{h_{\\rm f}} < 1$ GeV), $h_{\\rm f}$ decays exclusively\ninto a photon pair via loop-induced processes, resulting in a suppressed width\nand consequently a long lifetime.

    "abstract": "We present an algebraic method for solving the Bethe ansatz equations for the\nperiodic totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) with an arbitrary number\nof sites and particles. The Bethe ansatz equations are realized as an algebraic\nequation on a certain Riemann surface. While our Riemann surface is essentially\nthe same as the one introduced by Prolhac, we focus on its algebraic\nrealization as a (singular) plane curve. Through a counting argument on the\nRiemann surface, we establish a rigorous proof that the Bethe ansatz equation\nhas the expected number of solutions when counted with multiplicity.\nConsequently, under appropriate generic conditions, the completeness of the\nBethe ansatz follows. The decomposition of the Riemann surface into connected\ncomponents determines how often each value of the product of Bethe roots\nappears. We classify the connected components and their multiplicities using a\nsimilar argument to the spectral degeneracy of the Markov matrix discussed by\nGolinelli-Mallick. As a result, we give an algebro-geometric characterization\nof Golinelli-Mallick-type spectral degeneracy of the Markov matrix. We also\ngive explicit formulas for the number of connected components, the number of\nramification points, and the total genus of the Riemann surface. These formulas\nrecover the table of examples presented by Prolhac. Moreover, we explore\napplications of the special type of Bethe roots that appear in this case to\npartition functions of the five-vertex model. We introduce a version of the\nfree energy and evaluate the thermodynamic limit to find the explicit form in\nterms of the Riemann zeta function.",

For simultaneous LDCT reconstruction and metal artifact\nreduction (LDMAR), existing deep learning-based efforts face two main\nlimitations: i) the network design neglects multi-scale and within-scale\ninformation; ii) training a distinct model for each dose necessitates\nsignificant storage space for multiple doses. To fill these gaps, we propose a\nprompt guiding multi-scale adaptive sparse representation-driven network,\nabbreviated as PMSRNet, for LDMAR task. Specifically, we construct PMSRNet\ninspired from multi-scale sparsifying frames, and it can simultaneously employ\nwithin-scale characteristics and cross-scale complementarity owing to an\nelaborated prompt guiding scale-adaptive threshold generator (PSATG) and a\nbuilt multi-scale coefficient fusion module (MSFuM). The PSATG can adaptively\ncapture multiple contextual information to generate more faithful thresholds,\nachieved by fusing features from local, regional, and global levels.\nFurthermore, we elaborate a model interpretable dual domain LDMAR framework\ncalled PDuMSRNet, and train single model with a prompt guiding strategy for\nmultiple dose levels. We build a prompt guiding module, whose input contains\ndose level, metal mask and input instance, to provide various guiding\ninformation, allowing a single model to accommodate various CT dose settings.\nExtensive experiments at various dose levels demonstrate that the proposed\nmethods outperform the state-of-the-art LDMAR methods.",

In feats like leaping and sprinting, animals\ndemonstrate a sophisticated interplay of opposing muscle pairs that actively\nmodulate joint stiffness, while tendons and ligaments act as biological springs\nstoring and releasing energy. Although legged robots have achieved notable\nprogress in robust locomotion, they still lack the refined adaptability\ninherent in animal motor control. Integrating mechanisms that allow active\ncontrol of leg stiffness presents a pathway towards more resilient robotic\nsystems. This paper proposes a novel mechanical design to integrate compliancy\ninto robot legs based on tensegrity - a structural principle that combines\nflexible cables and rigid elements to balance tension and compression.\nTensegrity structures naturally allow for passive compliance, making them\nwell-suited for absorbing impacts and adapting to diverse terrains. Our design\nfeatures a robot leg with tensegrity joints and a mechanism to control the\njoint's rotational stiffness by modulating the tension of the cable actuation\nsystem. We demonstrate that the robot leg can reduce the impact forces of\nsudden shocks by at least 34.7 % and achieve a similar leg flexion under a load\ndifference of 10.26 N by adjusting its stiffness configuration. The results\nindicate that tensegrity-based leg designs harbors potential towards more\nresilient and adaptable legged robots.",

    "abstract": "Most existing robot manipulation methods prioritize task learning by\nenhancing perception through complex deep network architectures. However, they\nface challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention\nMamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating\nMamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and\ntask-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning\nwith linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has\nthe potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and\nmanipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a\ngrasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly\ninherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp\nfeatures are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM\nthrough attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution\ngrasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize,\nwe propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM),\ndividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for\ngrasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three\nrobot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real\nworld.

Another major gap is the lack of\nfocus on the dynamic and conversational nature of LLM systems. Such potential\noversights can lead to harms that go unnoticed in standard safety benchmarks.\nThis paper identifies the above as key requirements for robust LLM safety\nevaluation and recognizing that current evaluation methodologies do not satisfy\nthese, we introduce the $\\texttt{SAGE}$ (Safety AI Generic Evaluation)\nframework. $\\texttt{SAGE}$ is an automated modular framework designed for\ncustomized and dynamic harm evaluations.

We demonstrate $\\texttt{SAGE}$'s effectiveness by\nevaluating seven state-of-the-art LLMs across three applications and harm\npolicies. Our experiments with multi-turn conversational evaluations revealed a\nconcerning finding that harm steadily increases with conversation length.\nFurthermore, we observe significant disparities in model behavior when exposed\nto different user personalities and scenarios.

We employ\nspectra from the RAVE survey in a search for particularly low-activity stars\nwith the goal of identifying candidates for so-called Maunder-minimum stars.\nSpectra were used to measure the relative flux in the cores of the Ca II\ninfrared-triplet (IRT) lines. Those were converted to absolute emission-line\nfluxes and were corrected with target fluxes from high-resolution STELLA and\nultra-high-resolution PEPSI spectra. Absolute Ca II IRT fluxes for a total of\n78111 RAVE dwarf stars are presented and compared with fluxes of the 123 stars\nfrom our high-resolution STELLA+PEPSI sample. RAVE fluxes appear higher than\nthe STELLA and PEPSI fluxes by on average 19% for IRT-1, 21% for IRT-2, and 25%\nfor IRT-3 due to their lower spectral resolution. Our sample also spans a\nmetallicity [Fe/H] range relative to the Sun of -1.5 to +0.5 dex. We confirm\nthe strong dependency of IRT fluxes on metallicity and quantify it to be at\nmost $\\pm$14% in the B-V range 0.53-0.73. Without a metallicity correction,\npractically all very-low-activity RAVE dwarfs show a super-solar metallicity.\nAfter correcting for spectral resolution and for metallicity, we find 13 RAVE\nstars out of 13326 (0.1%) that fall well below our empirical lower flux bound\nfrom high-resolution versus B-V. For solar B-V, this relates to a photospheric\nuncorrected radiative loss in the IRT lines of log R_IRT=-4.13 (~20% below the\nsolar-minimum value in late 2016). However, 11 targets turned out to be evolved\nstars based on their Gaia DR3 parallaxes. Two stars, TIC 352227373 (G2V) and\nTYC 7560-477-1 (G7V), are our only Maunder-minimum candidates from the present\nsearch.

While the idea of\naccelerating structured and unstructured pruning is not new, our novel design\noffers various advantages over other designs.

The proposed custom\nfunctional unit utilizes this information to skip computations. To exploit\nunstructured sparsity, we propose a variable cycle sequential\nmultiply-and-accumulate unit that performs only as many multiplications as the\nnon-zero weights. Our implementation of unstructured and semi-structured\npruning accelerators can provide speedups of up to a factor of 3 and 4,\nrespectively.

Link quality is known to depend on explicit factors such as the\ntraced artifacts and the expertise of the practitioner who judges each\nconnection. Other factors, however, remain largely unexplored. We contend that\none of these factors is the set of auxiliary artifacts -- artifacts that are\nproduced and/or used during the tracing process yet are neither the source nor\ntarget artifacts. Because such auxiliary artifacts can subtly steer how links\nare created and validated, they merit a literature survey to identify these\nartifacts and further investigate them. Objective: We identify and map\nauxiliary artifacts used in requirements tracing, which could be additional\nfactors that affect the quality of the trace links. Method: We conducted a\nsystematic mapping study on auxiliary artifacts in requirements traceability.\nResults: We found 110 studies in which auxiliary artifacts are used in\nrequirements tracing, and identified 49 auxiliary artifacts, and 13 usage\nscenarios. Conclusion: This study provides a systematic mapping of auxiliary\nartifacts in requirement tracing, including their usage, origin, type and tool\nsupport.

To elucidate this observation,\nwe develop a theoretical framework for analytically deriving memory capacity\nthat incorporates the effect of neuronal correlations, which have been ignored\nin prior theoretical work for analytical simplicity. Our theory successfully\nrelates the sublinear scaling of memory capacity to the strength of neuronal\ncorrelations. Furthermore, we show this principle holds across diverse types of\nRNNs, even those beyond the direct applicability of our theory. Next, we\nnumerically investigate the scaling behavior of nonlinear computational\nability, which, alongside memory capacity, is crucial for overall computational\nperformance. Our numerical simulations reveal that as memory capacity growth\nbecomes sublinear, increasing the number of readout neurons successively\nenables nonlinear processing at progressively higher polynomial orders. Our\ntheoretical framework suggests that neuronal correlations govern not only\nmemory capacity but also the sequential growth of nonlinear computational\ncapabilities.

Recently, large-scale\ntime-domain surveys have significantly increased the number of identified delta\nScuti stars. Notably, the Tsinghua University-Ma Huateng Telescopes for Survey\n(TMTS), with its high-cadence observations at 1-minute intervals, has\nidentified thousands of delta Scuti stars, greatly expanding the sample of\nthese short-period pulsating variables. Using the delta Scuti stars from the\nTMTS catalogs of Periodic Variable Stars, we cross-matched the dataset with\nPan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE to obtain photometric measurements across optical\nand infrared bands. Parallax data, used as Bayesian priors, were retrieved from\nGaia DR3, and line-of-sight dust extinction priors were estimated from a\nthree-dimensional dust map. Using PyMC, we performed a simultaneous\ndetermination of the 11-band P-L relations of delta Scuti stars, which not only\nyields precise measurements of these relations, but also greatly improves\nconstraints on the distance moduli and color excesses, as evidenced by the\nreduced uncertainties in the posterior distributions. Furthermore, our\nmethodology enables an independent estimation of the color excess through the\nP-L relations, offering a potential complement to existing 3-D dust maps.\nMoreover, by cross-matching with LAMOST DR7, we investigated the influence of\nmetallicity on the P-L relations. Our analysis reveals that incorporating\nmetallicity might reduce the intrinsic scatter at longer wavelengths.

As a predictive model,\nCoGNNs directly leverages intermediate representations generated from source\ncode after compiler front-end processing, enabling prediction of quality of\nresults (QoR) without invoking HLS tools. Due to its strong adaptability to\ntasks, CoGNNs can be tuned to predict post-HLS and post-implementation\noutcomes, effectively bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and\nphysical implementation characteristics. CoGNNs achieves state-of-the-art\nprediction accuracy in post-HLS QoR prediction, reducing mean prediction errors\nby 2.8$\\times$ for latency and 3.4$\\times$ for resource utilization compared to\nbaseline models.",

The article also collected most of the POS tags from\ndifferent studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized\npart-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large\nCKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks.

While sophisticated mechanisms such as label\nselection or noise correction might address the issue mentioned above, they\ntend to increase training time and add implementation complexity. In this\npaper, we propose NSegment-a simple yet effective data augmentation solution to\nmitigate this issue. Unlike traditional methods, it applies elastic\ntransformations only to segmentation labels, varying deformation intensity per\nsample in each training epoch to address annotation inconsistencies.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of\nRS image segmentation over various state-of-the-art models.",

With the rapid growth in online\ntransactions, automating credit card fraud detection and loan eligibility\nprediction has become increasingly challenging. Classical machine learning (ML)\nmodels have been used to solve these challenges; however, these approaches\noften encounter scalability, overfitting, and high computational costs due to\ncomplexity and high-dimensional financial data. Quantum computing (QC) and\nquantum machine learning (QML) provide a promising solution to efficiently\nprocessing high-dimensional datasets and enabling real-time identification of\nsubtle fraud patterns. However, existing quantum algorithms lack robustness in\nnoisy environments and fail to optimize performance with reduced feature sets.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a quantum feature deep neural network\n(QFDNN), a novel, resource efficient, and noise-resilient quantum model that\noptimizes feature representation while requiring fewer qubits and simpler\nvariational circuits. The model is evaluated using credit card fraud detection\nand loan eligibility prediction datasets, achieving competitive accuracies of\n82.2% and 74.4%, respectively, with reduced computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we test QFDNN against six noise models, demonstrating its\nrobustness across various error conditions.

Investigating iCOMs in\nextragalactic SF regions may thus provide crucial information about these\nregions. As an active extragalactic SF region, the central molecular zone (CMZ)\nof the nearby galaxy NGC 253 provides an ideal template for studying iCOMs\nunder more extreme conditions. We aim to investigate the emission of a few\nselected iCOMs and understand if a difference between the iCOMs could reflect\non the source's chemical or physical structure.

We estimated the iCOMs gas temperatures\nand column densities using a rotational diagram analysis, and by performing a\nnon-LTE analysis for CH$_2$NH.The iCOM emission concentrates mostly towards the\ninner part of the CMZ of NGC 253 and can be reproduced with two gas components.\nDifferent emission processes can explain iCOM emission towards the CMZ of NGC\n253: at Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) scales ($\\sim 27$ pc), the iCOMs could\ntrace large-scale shocks whilst at smaller scales (few pc), both shock and\nheating processes linked with ongoing star formation may be involved. Using\ncolumn density correlation trends and known formation pathways, we find that\nmore than one formation path could be involved to explain the iCOM emission.\nFinally, we found chemical differences between the GMCs, such as a decrease of\nabundance for the N-bearing species towards one of the GMCs or different\nexcitation conditions for NH$_2$CHO and CH$_3$CHO towards two of the GMCs.",

The emergence of big data, such as street view images (SVIs) combined\nwith multimodal large language models (MLLMs), is transforming how researchers\nand practitioners investigate, measure, and evaluate semantic and visual\nelements of urban environments. Considering the low threshold for creating\nautomated evaluative workflows using MLLMs, it is crucial to explore both the\nrisks and opportunities associated with these probabilistic models. In\nparticular, the extent to which the integration of expert knowledge can\ninfluence the performance of MLLMs in evaluating the quality of urban design\nhas not been fully explored. This study sets out an initial exploration of how\nintegrating more formal and structured representations of expert urban design\nknowledge into the input prompts of an MLLM (ChatGPT-4) can enhance the model's\ncapability and reliability in evaluating the walkability of built environments\nusing SVIs. We collect walkability metrics from the existing literature and\ncategorize them using relevant ontologies. We then select a subset of these\nmetrics, focusing on the subthemes of pedestrian safety and attractiveness, and\ndevelop prompts for the MLLM accordingly. We analyze the MLLM's ability to\nevaluate SVI walkability subthemes through prompts with varying levels of\nclarity and specificity regarding evaluation criteria. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that MLLMs are capable of providing assessments and interpretations\nbased on general knowledge and can support the automation of multimodal\nimage-text evaluations. However, they generally provide more optimistic scores\nand can make mistakes when interpreting the provided metrics, resulting in\nincorrect evaluations.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) systems for medical imaging have demonstrated\nremarkable diagnostic capabilities, but their susceptibility to biases poses\nsignificant risks, since biases may negatively impact generalization\nperformance. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework to\nevaluate the dependency of medical imaging ML models on sensitive attributes,\nsuch as demographics. Our method leverages the concept of counterfactual\ninvariance, measuring the extent to which a model's predictions remain\nunchanged under hypothetical changes to sensitive attributes. We present a\npractical algorithm that combines conditional latent diffusion models with\nstatistical hypothesis testing to identify and quantify such biases without\nrequiring direct access to counterfactual data. Through experiments on\nsynthetic datasets and large-scale real-world medical imaging datasets,\nincluding \\textsc{cheXpert} and MIMIC-CXR, we demonstrate that our approach\naligns closely with counterfactual fairness principles and outperforms standard\nbaselines. This work provides a robust tool to ensure that ML diagnostic\nsystems generalize well, e.g., across demographic groups, offering a critical\nstep towards AI safety in healthcare.

Our goal is to characterize the chemistry and physical conditions of\nthe circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) binary\ncandidate stars with UV-excess and X-ray emission, in particular, to identify\nthe effects of the internal X-ray emission in the abundance of certain key\nmolecules. Methods. We observed the 86.0-94.0 and 260.0-272.5 GHz spectral\nranges searching for rotational transitions of the X-ray sensitive molecule\n$HCO^{+}$ in four AGB stars, two of them detected in both UV and X-ray emission\nand the other two detected only in UV. We derived the CSEs's physical\nparameters from previous CO observations and determined the molecular\nabundances of the detected species using radiative transfer models. We\ndeveloped chemical kinetics models that account for the effects of internal\nX-ray emission (as well as UV radiation) and compared our predictions with\nobservations. Results. We report the detection of $HCO^{+}$ in the X-ray\nemitting C-rich AGB T\\,Dra, while it remains undetected in the spectra of the\nother three sources. In T\\,Dra we also detect SiO, HCN, HNC, $HC_{3}N$,\n$SiC_{2}$, $C_{2}H$ and SiS. For the other targets only HCN and SiO are\ndetected. The high fractional abundance of $HCO^{+}$ derived for T\\,Dra\n($[1.5-3.0]\\times 10^{-8}$) is in good agreement with the predictions from our\nchemical kinetics models including the effects of internal X-ray emission, and\none order of magnitude higher than the values expected for C-rich AGB stars.\nAdditionally, we identify abundance enhancements for HNC, and $HC_{3}N$\nalongside a depletion of CO in the innermost regions of T\\,Dra's envelope.\nConclusions. An internal X-ray source can significantly alter molecular\nabundances in AGB CSEs, enhancing $HCO^{+}$, $N_{2}H^{+}$, HNC, and $HC_{3}N$\nwhile depleting parent species like CO.

The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate\nis a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in\nthe system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is\nsurprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of\nthe plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast\ntransition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states\nthat do not have an SPP contribution.

    "abstract": "Muddy terrains present significant challenges for terrestrial robots, as\nsubtle changes in composition and water content can lead to large variations in\nsubstrate strength and force responses, causing the robot to slip or get stuck.\nThis paper presents a method to estimate mud properties using proprioceptive\nsensing, enabling a flipper-driven robot to adapt its locomotion through muddy\nsubstrates of varying strength. First, we characterize mud reaction forces\nthrough actuator current and position signals from a statically mounted robotic\nflipper. We use the measured force to determine key coefficients that\ncharacterize intrinsic mud properties. The proprioceptively estimated\ncoefficients match closely with measurements from a lab-grade load cell,\nvalidating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Next, we extend the method\nto a locomoting robot to estimate mud properties online as it crawls across\ndifferent mud mixtures. Experimental data reveal that mud reaction forces\ndepend sensitively on robot motion, requiring joint analysis of robot movement\nwith proprioceptive force to determine mud properties correctly. Lastly, we\ndeploy this method in a flipper-driven robot moving across muddy substrates of\nvarying strengths, and demonstrate that the proposed method allows the robot to\nuse the estimated mud properties to adapt its locomotion strategy, and\nsuccessfully avoid locomotion failures. Our findings highlight the potential of\nproprioception-based terrain sensing to enhance robot mobility in complex,\ndeformable natural environments, paving the way for more robust field\nexploration capabilities.",

However, existing methods usually train a\ndataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant\ndifferences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the\ntrained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on\nother datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter\nnetwork (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains\ndataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the\ndiscriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter\nmodel, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data\ndistribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the\ndeep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this\npaper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which\ncan adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of\nlabeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch\nnormalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution\ndifferences. Compared with existing deep learning methods, CANet can achieve\nsatisfactory CD performances on various datasets simultaneously. Experimental\nresults on several public datasets have verified the effectiveness and\nadvantages of the proposed CANet on CD.

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts more than 300 million people\nworldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven\ndistribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have\nresulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and\nregions. This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named\nMDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models\n(LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis.\nTherefore, we select 274,348 individual information from the UK Biobank cohort\nto train and evaluate the proposed method. Specifically, we select 274,348\nindividual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design a tabular data\ntransformation method to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the\nproposed approach. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform\ncomprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against\nexisting model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental\nresults show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of\n0.8919 (95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine\nlearning and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis.

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology, namely\nMagnifier, to improve segmentation performance with limited data availability.\nThe Magnifier methodology is applicable to any existing encoder-decoder\narchitecture, as it extends a model by merging information at different\ncontextual levels through a dual-encoder approach: a local and global encoder.\nMagnifier analyzes the input data twice using the dual-encoder approach. In\nparticular, the local and global encoders extract information from the same\ninput at different granularities. This allows Magnifier to extract more\ninformation than the other approaches given the same set of input images.\nMagnifier improves the quality of the results of +2.65% on average IoU while\nleading to a restrained increase in terms of the number of trainable parameters\ncompared to the original model.

We identify the mechanism: ferroelectricity arises\nfrom asymmetric displacements (P along $z$ in CrPS$_3$, V along the\n$xy$-direction in V$_2$I$_2$O$_2$BrCl), which inherently couples electric\npolarization to both electronic and magnonic degrees of freedom by retaining\n[C$_2$$||$M] symmetry. Our calculations explicitly demonstrate that reversing\nthe ferroelectric polarization concurrently switches the sign of the electronic\nspin splitting and chirality of magnonic modes.

To address these issues, we present\nShowMak3r, a comprehensive reconstruction pipeline that allows the editing of\nscenes like how video clips are made in a production control room. In\nShowMak3r, a 3DLocator module locates recovered actors on the stage using depth\nprior and estimates unseen human poses via interpolation.

The goal is to\nimprove both fine-tuning efficiency and structural awareness during training.\nIn the proposed method, the parameters of a pre-trained language model are\ntreated as nodes in a graph. A weighted graph is constructed, and Laplacian\nspectral decomposition is applied to enable frequency-domain modeling and\nstructural representation of the parameter space. Based on this structure, a\njoint loss function is designed. It combines the task loss with a spectral\nregularization term to facilitate collaborative updates among parameters.

This mechanism adjusts gradients in a structure-aware manner, enhancing\nthe model's training stability and convergence behavior.

    "abstract": "Large Atomistic Models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently,\nemerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy\nsurface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomistic systems.\nHowever, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true\nuniversality, as well as their comparative performance across different models,\nremains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive\nbenchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to\nthe universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a\nbenchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their\ngeneralizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial\nfor deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific\ndiscovery contexts. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to\nAugust 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between\nthe current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also\nhighlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting\nmulti-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and\ndifferentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended\nto continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and\ngeneralizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research. The\nLAMBench code is open-sourced at https://github.com/deepmodeling/lambench, and\nan interactive leaderboard is available at\nhttps://www.aissquare.com/openlam?tab=Benchmark.",

Probabilistic program termination therefore requires qualitative\nanalysis via almost-sure termination (AST), while also providing quantitative\nanswers via positive almost-sure termination (PAST) on the expected number of\nsteps until termination. While every program which is PAST is AST, the converse\nis not true. The symmetric random walk with constant step size is a prominent\nexample of a program that is AST but not PAST.\n  In this paper we show that a more general class of polynomial random walks is\nPAST. Our random walks implement a step size that is polynomially increasing in\nthe number of loop iterations and have a constant probability $p$ of choosing\neither branch. We decide that such programs are PAST when the degree of the\npolynomial is higher than both the degree of the drift and a threshold\n$d_\\text{min}(p)$. Our approach does not use proof rules, nor auxiliary\narithmetic expressions, such as martingales or invariants.

    "abstract": "A bound state in the continuum (BIC) is an eigenmode with the corresponding\neigenvalue embedded in the continuous spectrum. There is currently a\nsignificant research interest on BICs in the photonics community, because they\ncan be used to induce strong resonances that are useful for lasing, sensing,\nharmonic generation, etc. The existence of BICs in classical or quantum wave\nsystems has only been established for some relatively simple cases such as BICs\nprotected by symmetry. In 1985, Friedrich and Wintgen (Physical Review A, Vol.\n32, pp. 3232-3242, 1985) suggested that BICs may appear from the destructive\ninterference of two resonances coupled to a single radiation channel. They used\na system of three one-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations to illustrate this\nprocess. Many BICs in classical wave systems seem to follow this mechanism and\nare now called Friedrich-Wintgen BICs. However, Friedrich and Wintgen did not\nshow the existence of BICs in their system of three Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations.\nInstead, they approximated the original system by a model with one\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation and two algebraic equations, and only analyzed BICs in\nthe approximate model. In this paper, we give a rigorous justification for the\nexistence of BICs in the original system of three 1D Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations.",

However, most\nof these systems face an undesirable usability constraint: they require a\nmetadata-private \"dialing\" phase to establish mutual agreement and timing or\nround coordination before initiating any regular chats among users. This phase\nis not only resource-intensive but also inflexible, limiting users' ability to\nmanage multiple concurrent conversations seamlessly.

Under the\nsame traffic uniformity requirement, PingPong replaces the rigid\n\"dial-before-converse\" paradigm with a more flexible \"notify-before-retrieval\"\nworkflow. This workflow incorporates a metadata-private notification subsystem,\nPing, and a metadata-private message store, Pong. Both Ping and Pong leverage\nhardware-assisted secure enclaves for performance and operates through a series\nof customized oblivious algorithms, while meeting the uniformity requirements\nfor metadata protection. By allowing users to switch between conversations on\ndemand, PingPong achieves a level of usability akin to modern instant messaging\nsystems, while also offering improved performance and bandwidth utilization for\ngoodput.

    "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) techniques have been proposed for the autonomous operation\nand lifecycle management of next-generation optical networks. To fully utilize\npotential capacity and accommodate dynamic services, the DT must dynamically\nupdate in sync with deployed optical networks throughout their lifecycle,\nensuring low-margin operation. This paper proposes a dynamic-updating DT for\nthe lifecycle management of optical networks, employing a hybrid approach that\nintegrates data-driven and physics-informed techniques for fiber channel\nmodeling. This integration ensures both rapid calculation speed and high\nphysics consistency in optical performance prediction while enabling the\ndynamic updating of critical physical parameters for DT. The lifecycle\nmanagement of optical networks, covering accurate performance prediction at the\nnetwork deployment and dynamic updating during network operation, is\ndemonstrated through simulation in a large-scale network. Up to 100 times\nspeedup in prediction is observed compared to classical numerical methods. In\naddition, the fiber Raman gain strength, amplifier frequency-dependent gain\nprofile, and connector loss between fiber and amplifier on C and L bands can be\nsimultaneously updated. Moreover, the dynamic-updating DT is verified on a\nfield-trial C+L-band transmission link, achieving a maximum accuracy\nimprovement of 1.4 dB for performance estimation post-device replacement.\nOverall, the dynamic-updating DT holds promise for driving the next-generation\noptical networks towards lifecycle autonomous management.",

Line-symmetric orthosets turn out to be in correspondence with transitive\nHermitian spaces. Furthermore, quadratic orthosets are defined similarly, but\nare required to possess, for each line $\\ell$, a group of automorphisms acting\non $\\ell$ transitively and commutatively.

Our refractive analysis sets the most\nconservative bounds on parsec-scale CGM clumpiness as it does not make\nassumptions about the turbulent density cascade. We find that the bulk of\nlow-redshift cool CGM gas, constrained to have densities of $n_{\\rm e} \\lesssim\n10^{-2}\\,{\\rm cm^{-3}}$, likely cannot produce two refractive images and,\nhence, scattering. It is only for extremely small cloud sizes $\\lesssim 0.1$ pc\n(about a hundred times smaller than the so-called shattering scale) that such\ndensities could result in detectable scattering. Dense $n_{\\rm e} \\gtrsim\n0.1\\,{\\rm cm^{-3}}$ gas with shattering-scale cloud sizes is more likely to\ninhabit the inner several kiloparsecs of the low-redshift CGM: such clouds\nwould result in multiple refractive images and large scattering times $\\gtrsim\n1 - 10$ ms, but a small fraction FRB sightlines are likely to be affected.

To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new\napproach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving\nscenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two\nmodalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds\n(LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance\nand geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed\nfrom the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging\nthis connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and\nenhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from\nthe large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with\nthe points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these\ndescriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and\npoint rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer\nnetwork with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them\nand use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views.

Different from existing works that mostly considered physical\nlayer security (PLS) in either the far-field or near-field, we consider in this\npaper a new and practical scenario, where legitimate users (Bobs) are located\nin the far-field of a base station (BS) while eavesdroppers (Eves) are located\nin the near-field for intercepting confidential information at short distance,\nreferred to as the mixed near-field and far-field PLS. Specifically, we\nformulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-secrecy-rate of all Bobs\nby optimizing the power allocation of the BS, subject to the constraint on the\ntotal BS transmit power. To shed useful insights, we first consider a\none-Bob-one-Eve system and characterize the insecure-transmission region of the\nBob in closed form. Interestingly, we show that the insecure-transmission\nregion is significantly \\emph{expanded} as compared to that in conventional\nfar-field PLS systems, due to the energy-spread effect in the mixed-field\nscenario. Then, we further extend the analysis to a two-Bob-one-Eve system. It\nis revealed that as compared to the one-Bob system, the interferences from the\nother Bob can be effectively used to weaken the capability of Eve for\nintercepting signals of target Bobs, thus leading to enhanced secrecy rates.\nFurthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality\nsolution to the formulated non-convex problem by leveraging the successive\nconvex approximation (SCA) technique. Finally, numerical results demonstrate\nthat our proposed algorithm achieves a higher sum-secrecy-rate than the\nbenchmark scheme where the power allocation is designed based on the\n(simplified) far-field channel model.",

However, unregulated use of TPL\nwill introduce legal and security issues in software development. Consequently,\nsome studies have attempted to detect the reuse of TPLs in target programs by\nconstructing a feature repository. Most of the works require access to the\nsource code of TPLs, while the others suffer from redundancy in the repository,\nlow detection efficiency, and difficulties in detecting partially referenced\nthird-party libraries. Therefore, we introduce BinCoFer, a tool designed for\ndetecting TPLs reused in binary programs. We leverage the work of binary code\nsimilarity detection(BCSD) to extract binary-format TPL features, making it\nsuitable for scenarios where the source code of TPLs is inaccessible. BinCoFer\nemploys a novel three-stage purification strategy to mitigate feature\nrepository redundancy by highlighting core functions and extracting\nfunction-level features, making it applicable to scenarios of partial reuse of\nTPLs. We have observed that directly using similarity threshold to determine\nthe reuse between two binary functions is inaccurate, a problem that previous\nwork has not addressed. Thus we design a method that uses weight to aggregate\nthe similarity between functions in the target binary and core functions to\nultimately judge the reuse situation with high frequency. To examine the\nability of BinCoFer, we compiled a dataset on ArchLinux and conduct comparative\nexperiments on it with other four most related works (i.e., ModX, B2SFinder,\nLibAM and BinaryAI)...",

To draw some\nvaluable insights, we first consider the single-user case, where an alternating\noptimization (AO) based algorithm is devised to maximize the received\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the user. To address the high computational\ncomplexity issue incurred by the AO based algorithm, three approximate received\nSNR expressions are obtained to yield useful insights, corresponding to the\nupper bound, approximate expression, and closed-form. It is demonstrated that\nthe XL-IRS ought to be positioned near the user (rather than the BS) to obtain\na higher beamforming gain. Then, for the multi-user scenario, an efficient\nalgorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality XL-IRS placement solution by\nusing the AO and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Furthermore,\nthe effective degree of freedom (DoF) of the BS-IRS channel is provided, which\nindicates that the additional effective DoF can be leveraged to improve\nmulti-user spatial multiplexing.

Most existing\napproaches rely heavily on identity-sensitive information, such as facial\nexpressions and speech, which raises concerns about personal privacy. To\naddress this, we introduce the De-identity Multimodal Emotion Recognition and\nReasoning (DEEMO), a novel task designed to enable emotion understanding using\nde-identified video and audio inputs.

This design supports\nemotion understanding without compromising identity privacy. In addition, we\npropose DEEMO-LLaMA, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that integrates\nde-identified audio, video, and textual information to enhance both emotion\nrecognition and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that DEEMO-LLaMA achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both tasks, outperforming existing MLLMs by a\nsignificant margin, achieving 74.49% accuracy and 74.45% F1-score in\nde-identity emotion recognition, and 6.20 clue overlap and 7.66 label overlap\nin de-identity emotion reasoning.

The development of\nvery-fine-resolution (VFR) satellite sensor imagery (e.g., ~0.3 m spatial\nresolution) provides unprecedented opportunities for large-scale crowd activity\nanalysis, but it has never been considered for this task. To address this gap,\nwe proposed CrowdSat-Net, a novel point-based convolutional neural network,\nwhich features two innovative components: Dual-Context Progressive Attention\nNetwork (DCPAN) to improve feature representation of individuals by aggregating\nscene context and local individual characteristics, and High-Frequency Guided\nDeformable Upsampler (HFGDU) that recovers high-frequency information during\nupsampling through frequency-domain guided deformable convolutions.

This is achieved by treating the texts\nas discourses that provide motivation and proofs by their very discursive\nstructure, in addition to what meets the eye at first reading. Bunyakovsky\npaper is an outgrowth of the mathematical theory of mean-values in Cauchy's\nwork (1821), but viewed from the point of view of Probability and Statistics.\nLiouville (1836) gave a result that implies Bunyakovsky's inequality, but did\nnot identify it as significant because his interests lay elsewhere.

Finally, by relating the result to quadratic binary\nforms, Schwarz (1885) opened the way to a geometric interpretation of the\ninequality that became important in the theory of integral equations.

The\nBWT has been generalized to finite automata, the so-called Wheeler automata, by\nGagie et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci. 2017]. Wheeler languages have subsequently\nbeen defined as the class of regular languages for which there exists a Wheeler\nautomaton accepting them. Besides their advantages in data indexing, these\nWheelerlanguages also satisfy many interesting properties from a language\ntheoretic point of view [Alanko et al., Inf. Comput. 2021]. A characteristic\nyet unsatisfying feature of Wheeler languages however is that their definition\ndepends on a fixed order of the alphabet. In this paper we introduce the\nUniversally Wheeler languages UW, i.e., the regular languages that are Wheeler\nwith respect to all orders of a given alphabet. Our first main contribution is\nto relate UW to some very well known regular language classes. We first show\nthat the Striclty Locally Testable languages are strictly included in UW. After\nnoticing that UW is not closed under taking the complement, we prove that the\nclass of languages for which both the language and its complement are in UW\nexactly coincides with those languages that are Definite or Reverse Definite.\nSecondly, we prove that deciding if a regular language given by a DFA is in UW\ncan be done in quadratic time.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models face security threats from jailbreak attacks. Existing\nresearch has predominantly focused on prompt-level attacks while largely\nignoring the underexplored attack surface of user-controlled response\nprefilling. This functionality allows an attacker to dictate the beginning of a\nmodel's output, thereby shifting the attack paradigm from persuasion to direct\nstate manipulation.In this paper, we present a systematic black-box security\nanalysis of prefill-level jailbreak attacks. We categorize these new attacks\nand evaluate their effectiveness across fourteen language models. Our\nexperiments show that prefill-level attacks achieve high success rates, with\nadaptive methods exceeding 99% on several models. Token-level probability\nanalysis reveals that these attacks work through initial-state manipulation by\nchanging the first-token probability from refusal to compliance.Furthermore, we\nshow that prefill-level jailbreak can act as effective enhancers, increasing\nthe success of existing prompt-level attacks by 10 to 15 percentage points. Our\nevaluation of several defense strategies indicates that conventional content\nfilters offer limited protection. We find that a detection method focusing on\nthe manipulative relationship between the prompt and the prefill is more\neffective. Our findings reveal a gap in current LLM safety alignment and\nhighlight the need to address the prefill attack surface in future safety\ntraining.",

Further comparison with the\nthermodynamic Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) model\nindicates that uncertainties in the magnetic field data can lead to even larger\nvariations in solar wind forecasts compared to those within a single model.\nHowever, predicting a range of solar wind velocities based on a cloud of points\naround Earth can help mitigate uncertainties by up to 20-77%.",

As a result, they are usually weak against unknown\ndistortions that are not used in their training pipeline. In this paper, we\npropose a novel watermarking framework to resist unknown distortions, namely\nAdversarial Shallow Watermarking (ASW). ASW utilizes only a shallow decoder\nthat is randomly parameterized and designed to be insensitive to distortions\nfor watermarking extraction. During the watermark embedding, ASW freezes the\nshallow decoder and adversarially optimizes a host image until its updated\nversion (i.e., the watermarked image) stably triggers the shallow decoder to\noutput the watermark message. During the watermark extraction, it accurately\nrecovers the message from the watermarked image by leveraging the insensitive\nnature of the shallow decoder against arbitrary distortions. Our ASW is\ntraining-free, encoder-free, and noise layer-free. Experiments indicate that\nthe watermarked images created by ASW have strong robustness against various\nunknown distortions.

We find that spin depairing\nstabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is\ncharacterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence\nof exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly\ncontrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are\nabsent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the\nsuperfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this\n``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs\nand the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion.\nFurthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down\ninduced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust\non the square lattice.",

We identify that an efficient and\nadaptable overlapping design should satisfy (1) tile-wise overlapping to\nmaximize the overlapping opportunity, (2) interference-free computation to\nmaintain the original computational performance, and (3) communication\nagnosticism to reduce the development burden against varying communication\nprimitives.

This\napproach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the\nLLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA\nfirst crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a\nsolution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan\nthrough self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in\nyielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to\npredict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions.

Next, the main objective of this paper is to study the\nfollowing non-homogenous system of equations \\begin{equation*}\n\\left\\{\\begin{aligned} &(-\\Delta_p)^s u = \\eta |u|^{r-2}u + \\gamma\n\\frac{\\alpha}{p_{s}^{*}(m)} \\frac{|u|^{\\alpha-2}u|v|^{\\beta}}{|x|^m}\n\\;\\;\\text{in}\\;\\Omega,\\\\ &(-\\Delta_p)^s v = \\eta |v|^{r-2}v + \\gamma\n\\frac{\\beta}{p^{*}_{s}(m)}\n\\frac{|v|^{\\beta-2}v|u|^{\\alpha}}{|x|^m}\\;\\;\\text{in}\\;\\Omega,\\\\ &u=v=0\\,\n\\mbox{ in }\\mathbb{R}^d\\setminus \\Omega, \\end{aligned} \\right. \\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\eta, \\gamma > 0$ are parameters and $p \\leq r < p_{s}^{*}(0)$.\nDepending on the values of $\\eta, \\gamma$, we obtain the existence of a non\nsemi-trivial solution with the least energy. Further, for $m=0$, we establish\nthat the above problem admits at least $\\text{cat}_{\\Omega}({\\Omega})$\nnontrivial solutions.",

However, an\nintrinsic and direct understanding of anyon condensation in lattice models,\ngrounded in the framework of Lagrangian algebras, remains undeveloped. In this\npaper, we propose a systematic framework for constructing all gapped boundaries\nof Kitaev's quantum double models directly from the data of Lagrangian\nalgebras. Central to our approach is the observation that bulk interactions in\nthe quantum double models admit two complementary interpretations: the\nanyon-creating picture and anyon-probing picture. Generalizing this insight to\nthe boundary, we derive the consistency condition for boundary ribbon operators\nthat respect the mathematical axiomatic structure of Lagrangian algebras.\nSolving these conditions yields explicit expressions for the local boundary\ninteractions required to realize gapped boundaries. Our construction provides a\nmicroscopic characterization of the bulk-to-boundary anyon condensation\ndynamics via the action of ribbon operators. Moreover, all these boundary terms\nare supported within a common effective Hilbert space, making further studies\non pure boundary phase transitions natural and convenient. Given the broad\napplicability of anyon condensation theory, we believe that our approach can be\ngeneralized to extended string-net models or higher-dimensional topologically\nordered systems.",

Yet, freshness alone does\nnot equate to informativeness. In decision-critical settings, some stale data\nmay prove more valuable than fresh updates. To explore this nuance, we move\nbeyond AoI-centric policies and investigate how data staleness impacts\ndecision-making under data-staleness-induced uncertainty. We pose a central\nquestion: What is the value of information, when freshness fades, and only its\npower to shape remote decisions remains? To capture this endured value, we\npropose AR-MDP, an Age-aware Remote Markov Decision Process framework, which\nco-designs optimal sampling and remote decision-making under a sampling\nfrequency constraint and random delay. To efficiently solve this problem, we\ndesign a new two-stage hierarchical algorithm namely Quick\nBellman-Linear-Program (QuickBLP), where the first stage involves solving the\nDinkelbach root of a Bellman variant and the second stage involves solving a\nstreamlined linear program (LP). For the tricky first stage, we propose a new\nOne-layer Primal-Dinkelbach Synchronous Iteration (OnePDSI) method, which\novercomes the re-convergence and non-expansive divergence present in existing\nper-sample multi-layer algorithms. Through rigorous convergence analysis of our\nproposed algorithms, we establish that the worst-case optimality gap in OnePDSI\nexhibits exponential decay with respect to iteration $K$ at a rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{R^K})$.

This pipeline generates a\nhigh-quality paired amodal dataset with extensive category and scale diversity,\ncomprising approximately 16K pairs.

    "abstract": "Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide\nunparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications,\nnecessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data\nrates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention\nof cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient\nradio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User\nEquipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach\nis developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best\nEffort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS\nand resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement\nLearning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process,\nwith states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both\nstate representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained\nusing an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based\narchitecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of\nnodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of\naccounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the\nGRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show\nsubstantial performance gains, including a $53\\%$ reduction in QoS violations\nand a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become an essential strategy for\nadapting them to specialized tasks; however, this process introduces\nsignificant privacy challenges, as sensitive training data may be inadvertently\nmemorized and exposed. Although differential privacy (DP) offers strong\ntheoretical guarantees against such leakage, its empirical privacy\neffectiveness on LLMs remains unclear, especially under different fine-tuning\nmethods. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of DP across\nfine-tuning methods and privacy budgets, using both data extraction and\nmembership inference attacks to assess empirical privacy risks. Our main\nfindings are as follows: (1) Differential privacy reduces model utility, but\nits impact varies significantly across different fine-tuning methods. (2)\nWithout DP, the privacy risks of models fine-tuned with different approaches\ndiffer considerably. (3) When DP is applied, even a relatively high privacy\nbudget can substantially lower privacy risk. (4) The privacy-utility trade-off\nunder DP training differs greatly among fine-tuning methods, with some methods\nbeing unsuitable for DP due to severe utility degradation.

Traditional methods typically require extensive\nstress-strain or full-field measurements, which are often difficult to obtain\nin practical settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN)-based framework that enables the\ndiscovery of constitutive models using only sparse measurement data - such as\ndisplacement and reaction force - that can be acquired from a single material\ntest. By integrating PINNs with finite element discretization, the framework\nreconstructs full-field displacement and identifies the underlying strain\nenergy density from predefined candidates, while ensuring consistency with\nphysical laws. A two-stage training process is employed: the Adam optimizer\njointly updates neural network parameters and model coefficients to obtain an\ninitial solution, followed by L-BFGS refinement and sparse regression with l_p\nregularization to extract a parsimonious constitutive model. Validation on\nbenchmark hyperelastic models demonstrates that the proposed method can\naccurately recover constitutive laws and displacement fields, even when the\ninput data are limited and noisy.

To substantiate this assertion, we develop a general framework\nfor the characterisation of tripartite correlations by extending the notion of\nSettings Independence and Outcome Independence beyond their bipartite\nformulation. This framework highlights the pivotal role of Hardy-type reasoning\nin the detection and certification of genuine multipartite nonlocality.\nFurthermore, we show that the tripartite Hardy-nonlocality enables the\nself-testing of a broad class of pure nonmaximally genuine entangled tripartite\nstates. A key advantage of Hardy-based self-testing over methods based on\ntripartite Bell inequalities is its ability to certify quantum correlations\neven in the presence of nonmaximal violations. This, in turn, facilitates the\ndevice-independent certification of randomness from Hardy-type correlations.\nUnlike Bell functionals, which typically enable self-testing of only a single\nextremal point per inequality, Hardy relation self-tests a set of extremal\nquantum correlations for any nonzero Hardy probability.

Despite the significance of security\nprotections, the absence of standardized security guidelines results in various\nlevels of security risk across RTOS implementations. Our initial analysis\nreveals that popular RTOSs such as FreeRTOS lack essential security\nprotections. While Zephyr OS and ThreadX are designed and implemented with\nessential security protections, our closer examination uncovers significant\ndifferences in their implementations of system call parameter sanitization. We\nidentify a performance optimization practice in ThreadX that introduces\nsecurity vulnerabilities, allowing for the circumvention of parameter\nsanitization processes. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a novel attack\nnamed the Kernel Object Masquerading (KOM) Attack (as the attacker needs to\nmanipulate one or multiple kernel objects through carefully selected system\ncalls to launch the attack), demonstrating how attackers can exploit these\nvulnerabilities to access sensitive fields within kernel objects, potentially\nleading to unauthorized data manipulation, privilege escalation, or system\ncompromise. We introduce an automated approach involving under-constrained\nsymbolic execution to identify the KOM attacks and to understand the\nimplications.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in\nincreasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason.\nWhether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is,\nhowever, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering\napproach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM\nwhen processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control\nvector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention,\nmodulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on\nthe specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and\nanalyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on\nreasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit\ndistribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply\ncontrol vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an\ninductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM\ncan, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning\nability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the\nability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a\ntask. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the\nsame manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and\ndemonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via\na simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training.",

However, due to the variability of\ncoordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the\ntime-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well\nperformance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon\ncoordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define\nthe Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based\ncooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward\nfunction generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model\n(LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which\nsystematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven\ninitialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first\ninitializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements\nwith an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively\noptimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR\nmodule guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a\nchain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code\ngeneration. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward\nfunction, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence\nstability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging\ncoordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River\nDelta transportation network simulation. Comparative experimental results\ndemonstrate that RL agents utilizing PCRD-generated reward functions\nconsistently outperform human-engineered reward functions, achieving an average\nof 10\\% higher performance metrics in all scenarios.",

It is generally assumed that\nproof techniques that do not relativize with respect to quantum oracles will\nalso not relativize with respect to classical oracles. In this note, we show\nthat this is not the case: specifically, we show that there is a quantum oracle\nproblem that is contained in the class QMA, but not in a class we call\npolyQCPH. The class polyQCPH is equal to PSPACE with respect to classical\noracles, and it is a well-known result that QMA is contained in PSPACE (also\nwith respect to classical oracles).\n  We also show that the same separation holds relative to a distributional\noracle, which is a model introduced by Natarajan and Nirkhe (2024). We believe\nour findings show the need for some caution when using these non-standard\noracle models, particularly when showing separations between quantum and\nclassical resources.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a type of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\\chi$SB) for\nvarious current quark masses using the interacting instanton liquid model. The\ntype of D$\\chi$SB is classified based on the sign of the second derivative of\nthe free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. We\nperform numerical simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model with\nthe flavor SU(2) symmetric and (2+1)-flavor quarks. We find that the curvature\nis negative in the SU(2) case. This means the ordinary type of D$\\chi$SB. In\ncontrast, in the (2+1)-flavor case, a positive curvature is observed when the\nstrange quark mass is as small as those of the up and down quarks. This\nsuggests that the anomaly-driven type of D$\\chi$SB can occur under the\napproximate flavor SU(3) symmetry. As the strange quark mass increases, the\ncurvature gradually decreases and becomes negative when the strange quark mass\nis approximately three times larger than those of the light quarks. This\ndifference can be understood in terms of the 't Hooft vertex which induces a\nsix-quark interaction in the $N_f=3$ case and does a four-quark interaction in\nthe $N_f=2$ case. Our results might indicate that the ratio between the strange\nand light quark masses plays a crucial role in understanding the microscopic\nrelationship between D$\\chi$SB and the anomaly effect.",

    "abstract": "The technique of hiding secret messages within seemingly harmless covertext\nto evade examination by censors with rigorous security proofs is known as\nprovably secure steganography (PSS). PSS evolves from symmetric key\nsteganography to public-key steganography, functioning without the requirement\nof a pre-shared key and enabling the extension to multi-party covert\ncommunication and identity verification mechanisms. Recently, a public-key\nsteganography method based on elliptic curves was proposed, which uses point\ncompression to eliminate the algebraic structure of curve points. However, this\nmethod has strict requirements on the curve parameters and is only available on\nhalf of the points. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a more\ngeneral elliptic curve public key steganography method based on admissible\nencoding. By applying the tensor square function to the known well-distributed\nencoding, we construct admissible encoding, which can create the pseudo-random\npublic-key encryption function. The theoretical analysis and experimental\nresults show that the proposed provable secure public-key steganography method\ncan be deployed on all types of curves and utilize all points on the curve.",

However, current approaches face\nlimitations with non-ReLU activation function, which are foundational to most\nadvanced LLMs, or require heavy continual training. Additionally, the\ndifficulty in predicting active channels and limited achievable sparsity ratios\nconstrain the effectiveness of activation sparsity-based methods. In this\npaper, we introduce R-Sparse, a training-free activation sparsity approach\ncapable of achieving high sparsity levels in advanced LLMs. We conducted two\npreliminary investigations into how different components contribute to the\noutput within a single linear layer and found two key observations: (i) the\nnon-sparse components of the input function can be regarded as a few bias\nterms, and (ii) The full computation can be effectively approximated by an\nappropriate combination of input channels and weight singular values. Building\non this, we replace the linear layers in LLMs with a rank-aware sparse\ninference method that leverages the sparsity of input channels and singular\nvalue components, eliminating the need for active channel prediction like the\noutput sparsity based approaches. Experiments on Llama-2/3 and Mistral models\nacross ten diverse tasks demonstrate that R-Sparse achieves comparable\nperformance at 50% model-level sparsity, resulting in a significant 43%\nend-to-end efficient improvements with customized kernels.",

Unlike existing studies which {adopted} the\nidealized generate-at-will (GAW) model, {i.e., a status} update data can be\ngenerated and transmitted at any time, this paper utilizes a more practical\nmodel {to characterize} the inherent randomness of the generation of the status\nupdating data packets. A rigorous analytical framework is established to\nprecisely evaluate the average AoI achieved by the NOMA-assisted grant-free\nschemes for both {the} cases with and without retransmission. The impact of the\nchoice of the probability {of transmission} on the average AoI is investigated.\nExtensive simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy of the\ndeveloped analysis. It is shown that NOMA-assisted schemes are more superior in\nreducing AoI{, compared} to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based schemes. In\naddition, compared to schemes without retransmission, the AoI performance {of}\nthe schemes with retransmission can {be improved} significantly when the status\nupdate generation rate is low or the user density is relatively high.",

    "abstract": "Safety and security remain critical concerns in AI deployment. Despite safety\ntraining through reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) [ 32],\nlanguage models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety\nguardrails. Universal jailbreaks - prefixes that can circumvent alignment for\nany payload - are particularly concerning. We show empirically that jailbreak\ndetection systems face distribution shift, with detectors trained at one point\nin time performing poorly against newer exploits. To study this problem, we\nrelease JailbreaksOverTime, a comprehensive dataset of timestamped real user\ninteractions containing both benign requests and jailbreak attempts collected\nover 10 months. We propose a two-pronged method for defenders to detect new\njailbreaks and continuously update their detectors. First, we show how to use\ncontinuous learning to detect jailbreaks and adapt rapidly to new emerging\njailbreaks. While detectors trained at a single point in time eventually fail\ndue to drift, we find that universal jailbreaks evolve slowly enough for\nself-training to be effective. Retraining our detection model weekly using its\nown labels - with no new human labels - reduces the false negative rate from 4%\nto 0.3% at a false positive rate of 0.1%. Second, we introduce an unsupervised\nactive monitoring approach to identify novel jailbreaks. Rather than\nclassifying inputs directly, we recognize jailbreaks by their behavior,\nspecifically, their ability to trigger models to respond to known-harmful\nprompts. This approach has a higher false negative rate (4.1%) than supervised\nmethods, but it successfully identified some out-of-distribution attacks that\nwere missed by the continuous learning approach.",

While nonradiative Auger recombination is a key\nperformance-limiting factor in light-emitting applications, Auger effects also\npresent exciting opportunities for hot-carrier manipulation in emerging\noptoelectronic and photochemical technologies. Recent studies have shown that\nincorporating magnetic manganese (Mn) dopants into QDs enables an ultrafast\nspin-exchange (SE) mechanism that significantly accelerates Auger recombination\nand related processes. However, the fundamental dynamics of SE-Auger\nrecombination, including its dependence on QD size, exciton multiplicity, and\nMn-ion content, remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate SE-Auger\nrecombination in Mn-doped QDs across three regimes defined by the energetic\nalignment between the QD band-edge exciton and the internal Mn spin-flip\ntransition: resonant, downhill, and uphill, corresponding to the exciton energy\nbeing approximately equal to, greater than, or smaller than the Mn spin-flip\ntransition energy, respectively. We find that SE-Auger recombination dominates\nmultiexciton dynamics in both resonant and downhill regimes, proceeding on\nultrafast, sub-picosecond timescales, that is, significantly faster than\nconventional Auger decay. Notably, SE-Auger lifetimes are primarily governed by\nthe occupancy of intrinsic excitonic states, with minimal dependence on QD size\nor the number of excited Mn ions. In the uphill regime, SE-Auger recombination\ncoexists with conventional Auger processes, enabling direct comparison of their\ntimescales alongside co-occurring hot-carrier cooling. These findings establish\nthat SE-Auger recombination outpaces phonon-assisted cooling, making it\nuniquely suited for the generation and manipulation of hot carriers, and\nopening new avenues in advanced photoconversion and photochemistry.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesize strong (transonic) twin toroidal recirculation zones above and\nbelow the accretion disk midplane, rather close-in to the protosun, to be the\nsource of chondrules and calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs). The recirculation\nzones act as centrifugal separators. In the case of chondrules, we suggest this\nhappens during Class II (T~Tauri) stage of protostellar accretion, and in the\ncase of CAIs, during an earlier higher-$\\dot M$ phase of accretion. The\nrecirculation zones advect and raise dust and solid aggregates above the\nmidplane, making a ``mushroom-cap,'' and they also generate weak standing\noblique shocks that heat and fuse protochondrules. We do not model the emission\nof these shocks, but point out that they will produce Doppler-broadened,\npossibly twin-peaked line emission with width of the order of $\\simeq 200\\ {\\rm\nkm\\ s^{-1}}$. For concreteness, we focus on chondrules in the paper. Small\n($\\lessapprox 10 {\\rm\\ \\mu m}$) diameter protochondrules are evaporated by the\nstanding shocks, whereas large ($\\gtrapprox 1\\ {\\rm cm}$) protochondrules are\ntoo heavy to be entrained and accelerated by the outer recirculation zone and\noutflow. Intermediate-size protochondrules, however, are centrifugally ejected\nand carried by high-speed diffuse gas outflow to the outer regions of the disk,\nwhere they rain down. The recirculation-induced dust mushroom caps will create\nsignificant IR continuum emission. We suggest they coincide with observed inner\n``puffed-up'' dust rims. We also suggest that the recent interferometric\ninferences of arcs or ellipses in the sub-AU continuum IR of low-mass Class II\nprotostars may be observations of corresponding chondrule-producing\nrecirculation zones in those systems.",

In this study, we report the\nspatially-resolved detection of pressure-broadened line wings in the CO $J=3-2$\nline in the RX J1604.3-2130 A transition disk as part of the exoALMA large\nprogram. Since pressure-broadened line wings are sensitive to the total gas\nvolume density, we robustly constrain the radial dependence of the gas surface\ndensity and midplane pressure in the region located $50-110$ au from the\ncentral star, which encompasses the dust ring of the system. The peak radius of\nthe midplane pressure profile matches the dust ring radial location, directly\nproving radial dust trapping at a gas pressure maximum. The peak gas surface\ndensity is $18-44\\ {\\rm g\\ cm^{-2}}$} and decreases at radii interior to and\nexterior of the dust ring. A comparison of the gas and dust surface densities\nsuggests that the disk turbulence is as low as $\\alpha_{\\rm turb} \\sim\n2\\times10^{-4}$. Despite dust trapping, the gas-to-dust surface density ratio\nat the ring peak is { $70-400$}, which implies already-formed protoplanets\nand/or less efficient dust trapping. The gas surface density drop at radii\ninterior to the ring is consistent with a gas gap induced by a Jupiter-mass\nplanet.

Secondly, encoding and\nselecting candidate words changes the sampling probabilities, resulting in poor\nimperceptibility of the stego text. Thirdly, existing methods have low\nrobustness and cannot resist replacement attacks.

The prompt mapping maps secret information into a\nconditional prompt to guide the pre-trained diffusion model generating batches\nof candidate sentences. The batch mapping selects stego text based on secret\ninformation from batches of candidate sentences. Extensive experiments show\nthat the GTSD outperforms the SOTA method in terms of generative speed,\nrobustness, and imperceptibility while maintaining comparable anti-steganalysis\nperformance.

Through an\nappropriate bilinear form, we derive exact one-soliton and multi-soliton\nsolutions. These solutions showcase two prominent phenomena: the second-order\nrogue matter wave with spatio-temporal localization, and the line soliton with\ndouble spatial localization. We demonstrate the feasibility of controlling the\nsoliton amplitude and the effects of gain/loss resulting in areas of collapse\nby suitably tuning the coefficient of higher-order interactions in the\nBose-Einstein condensate. Additionally, by exploring the interaction dynamics\nof the multi-soliton solutions, we identify elastic-type interactions, claiming\nthe intrinsic properties of solitons. The influence of higher-order\ninteractions and gain/loss terms on the interaction dynamics is also thoroughly\nanalyzed. These analyses demonstrate that, within the framework of\nBose-Einstein condensates described by the two-dimensional modified\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, higher-order interactions provide a means to control\nthe properties of the generated rogue matter waves. Extensive numerical\nsimulations have been carried out, and their convergence with the theoretically\npredicted results highlights the emergent features of the obtained solutions.\nThe exact analytical solutions derived in this study rigorously satisfy the\noriginal governing equation, thereby ensuring their consistency with the\nnumerical findings and confirming their accuracy.

These days the most popular of such sophisticated optimization schemes\nis presumably the Adam optimizer that has been proposed in 2014 by Kingma and\nBa. A highly relevant topic of research is to investigate the speed of\nconvergence of such optimization methods.

The assumptions for Euler's Theorem are\nconstant returns (positive homogeneity) and differentiability of the production\nfunction. Representing characteristic functions in a vector space setting,\nmarginal products of commodity inputs are translated as marginal products of\nindividuals. Marginal products for discrete (resp. infinitesimal) individuals\nare defined by discrete (resp. infinitesimal) directional derivates. Additivity\nof directional derivatives underlies the definition of differentiability in\nboth discrete and infinitesimal settings. A key distinction is between\ncharacteristic functions defined by von Neumann and Morgenstern (vNM) which do\nnot necessarily exhibit concavity and characteristic function that do. A\nmodification of the definition, interpreted as introducing ``property rights,''\nimplies concavity. The Shapley value is a redefinition of an individual's\nmarginal product for a (vNM) characteristic function. Concave characteristic\nfunctions do not require such redefinition. Concave characteristic functions\nimply the existence of positively homogeneous saddle-function functions whose\nsaddle-points represent equilbria of the game. The saddle-point property\napplies to games with populations consisting of any number of individuals each\ntype.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in\ngenerating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows\npose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged\nmulti-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric\narchitecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting,\nconsolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.\nBuilding on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that\nleverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational\nstructures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on\nLOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline\ncategories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context\napproach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source\nmemory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory\nmanagement platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently\noutperform all existing memory systems across four question categories:\nsingle-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26%\nrelative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with\ngraph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base\nconfiguration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational\noverhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91%\nlower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling\nbalance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment\nconstraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent\nmemory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for\nmore reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary algorithms often struggle to find well converged (e.g small\ninverted generational distance on test problems) solutions to multi-objective\noptimization problems on a limited budget of function evaluations (here, a few\nhundred). The family of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs)\noffers a potential solution to this shortcoming through the use of data driven\nmodels which augment evaluations of the objective functions. A surrogate model\nwhich has shown promise in single-objective optimization is to predict the\n\"comparison relationship\" between pairs of solutions (i.e. who's objective\nfunction is smaller). In this paper, we investigate the performance of this\nmodel on multi-objective optimization problems. First, we propose a new\nalgorithm \"CRSEA\" which uses the comparison-relationship model. Numerical\nexperiments are then performed with the DTLZ and WFG test suites plus a\nreal-world problem from the field of accelerator physics. We find that CRSEA\nfinds better converged solutions than the tested SAEAs on many of the\nmedium-scale, biobjective problems chosen from the WFG suite suggesting the\ncomparison-relationship surrogate as a promising tool for improving the\nefficiency of multi-objective optimization algorithms.",

The convolution is\nsplit into a regular and singular integral, and they are well resolved by\ntrapezoidal rule and Fourier spectral method respectively. The scheme is\nsimplified to a discrete convolution and is implemented efficiently with Fast\nFourier Transform (FFT). Importantly, the tensor generation procedure is quite\nsimple, highly efficient and independent of the anisotropy strength. It is easy\nto implement and achieves spectral accuracy with nearly optimal efficiency and\nminimum memory requirement.

A significant advantage of\nmachine learning is that inference is computationally cheap given an\nalready-trained model, allowing forecasts that are nearly instantaneous and in\nthe native high resolution of the input data. In this work we developed a novel\nmethod that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast\nprecipitation.

To bridge this gap, we collect a dataset of educational\nquestions based on lectures from real-world classrooms.

    "abstract": "Robust and flexible leader-following is a critical capability for robots to\nintegrate into human society. While existing methods struggle to generalize to\nleaders of arbitrary form and often fail when the leader temporarily leaves the\nrobot's field of view, this work introduces a unified framework addressing both\nchallenges. First, traditional detection models are replaced with a\nsegmentation model, allowing the leader to be anything. To enhance recognition\nrobustness, a distance frame buffer is implemented that stores leader\nembeddings at multiple distances, accounting for the unique characteristics of\nleader-following tasks. Second, a goal-aware adaptation mechanism is designed\nto govern robot planning states based on the leader's visibility and motion,\ncomplemented by a graph-based planner that generates candidate trajectories for\neach state, ensuring efficient following with obstacle avoidance. Simulations\nand real-world experiments with a legged robot follower and various leaders\n(human, ground robot, UAV, legged robot, stop sign) in both indoor and outdoor\nenvironments show competitive improvements in follow success rate, reduced\nvisual loss duration, lower collision rate, and decreased leader-follower\ndistance.",

    "abstract": "Exponential growth in scientific literature has heightened the demand for\nefficient evidence-based synthesis, driving the rise of the field of Automated\nMeta-analysis (AMA) powered by natural language processing and machine\nlearning. This PRISMA systematic review introduces a structured framework for\nassessing the current state of AMA, based on screening 978 papers from 2006 to\n2024, and analyzing 54 studies across diverse domains. Findings reveal a\npredominant focus on automating data processing (57%), such as extraction and\nstatistical modeling, while only 17% address advanced synthesis stages. Just\none study (2%) explored preliminary full-process automation, highlighting a\ncritical gap that limits AMA's capacity for comprehensive synthesis. Despite\nrecent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) and advanced AI, their\nintegration into statistical modeling and higher-order synthesis, such as\nheterogeneity assessment and bias evaluation, remains underdeveloped. This has\nconstrained AMA's potential for fully autonomous meta-analysis. From our\ndataset spanning medical (67%) and non-medical (33%) applications, we found\nthat AMA has exhibited distinct implementation patterns and varying degrees of\neffectiveness in actually improving efficiency, scalability, and\nreproducibility. While automation has enhanced specific meta-analytic tasks,\nachieving seamless, end-to-end automation remains an open challenge. As AI\nsystems advance in reasoning and contextual understanding, addressing these\ngaps is now imperative. Future efforts must focus on bridging automation across\nall meta-analysis stages, refining interpretability, and ensuring\nmethodological robustness to fully realize AMA's potential for scalable,\ndomain-agnostic synthesis.",

The system extends our previously proposed markerless\nnavigation method from static image matching to dynamic video sequence\ntracking. By integrating the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model's three-level\narchitecture (sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory), our system\nmaintains continuous tracking of the femoral condyle throughout the surgical\nprocedure, providing stable navigation support even in complex situations\ninvolving viewpoint changes, instrument occlusion, and tissue deformation.\nUnlike existing methods, our system operates in real-time on standard\narthroscopic equipment without requiring additional tracking hardware,\nachieving 25.3 FPS with a latency of only 39.5 ms, representing a 3.5-fold\nimprovement over our previous static system. For extended sequences (1000\nframes), the dynamic system maintained an error of 5.3 plus-minus 1.5 pixels,\ncompared to the static system's 12.6 plus-minus 3.7 pixels - an improvement of\napproximately 45 percent. For medium-length sequences (500 frames) and short\nsequences (100 frames), the system achieved approximately 35 percent and 19\npercent accuracy improvements, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe system overcomes limitations of traditional static matching methods,\nproviding new technical support for improving surgical precision in ACL\nreconstruction.",

Using a common information approach, we derive a\ndynamic programming solution that computes optimal symmetric dispatch\nstrategies by transforming the multi-agent problem into a tractable dynamic\nprogram on the agents common information state. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat our method significantly reduces coordination cost compared to baseline\nheuristics, including belief-based strategies and an always-dispatch policy.\nThese findings highlight the benefits of combining symmetric strategy design\nwith a common information-based dynamic programming framework for improving\nmulti-agent coordination performance.",

    "abstract": "Recent works have suggested that In-Context Learning (ICL) operates in dual\nmodes, i.e. task retrieval (remember learned patterns from pre-training) and\ntask learning (inference-time ''learning'' from demonstrations). However,\ndisentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL\nCIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed\nfrom classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the\nin-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering\nEnglish sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there\nis a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This\nbijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task\nin some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question\nif LLMs can solve tasks reformulated by ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping,\nwhich requires ''deciphering'' the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better\nat solving tasks reformulated by ICL CIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the\nNON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline, providing a novel approach to quantify\n''learning'' in ICL. While this gap is small, it is consistent across the board\non four datasets and six models. Finally, we examine LLMs' internal\nrepresentations and identify evidence in their ability to decode the ciphered\ninputs.",
