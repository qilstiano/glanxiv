    "abstract": "We study the amplification of isotropic, incompressible turbulence through\nmultiple planar, collisional shocks, using analytical linear theory. There are\ntwo limiting cases we explore. The first assumes shocks occur rapidly in time\nsuch that the turbulence does not evolve between shocks. Whereas the second\ncase allows enough time for turbulence to isotropize between each shock. For\nthe latter case, through a quasi-equation-of-state, we show that the weak\nmulti-shock limit is agnostic to the distinction between thermal and vortical\nturbulent pressures, like an isotropic volumetric compression. When turbulence\ndoes not return to isotropy between shocks, the generated anisotropy -- itself\na function of shock strength -- can feedback on amplification by further\nshocks, altering choices for maximal or minimal amplification. In addition for\nthis case, we find that amplification is sensitive to the shock ordering. We\nmap how choices of shock strength can impact these amplification differences\ndue to ordering, finding, for example, shock pairs which lead to identical mean\npost-shock fields (density, temperature, pressure) but maximally distinct\nturbulent amplification.",

The framework allows each client\nto have an individual privacy guarantee, e.g., by adding different amounts of\nnoise to each client's model updates. One underlying assumption is that all\nclients spend their privacy budgets uniformly over time (learning rounds).\nHowever, it has been shown in the literature that learning in early rounds\ntypically focuses on more coarse-grained features that can be learned at lower\nsignal-to-noise ratios while later rounds learn fine-grained features that\nbenefit from higher signal-to-noise ratios. Building on this intuition, we\npropose a time-adaptive DP-FL framework that expends the privacy budget\nnon-uniformly across both time and clients. Our framework enables each client\nto save privacy budget in early rounds so as to be able to spend more in later\nrounds when additional accuracy is beneficial in learning more fine-grained\nfeatures. We theoretically prove utility improvements in the case that clients\nwith stricter privacy budgets spend budgets unevenly across rounds, compared to\nclients with more relaxed budgets, who have sufficient budgets to distribute\ntheir spend more evenly. Our practical experiments on standard benchmark\ndatasets support our theoretical results and show that, in practice, our\nalgorithms improve the privacy-utility trade-offs compared to baseline schemes.",

To\nexplicitly capture correlations between contexts surrounding entities, CMAS\nreformulates NER into two subtasks: recognizing named entities and identifying\nentity type-related features within the target sentence.

Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret\nSharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only\nsecret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all\ntransmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN\nintegrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation\nManagement (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and\ntemporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM\noptimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while\nCRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced\nparticipation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle\nmobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with\nincreasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart\ncity infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation,\nand grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility\necosystems.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of autonomous navigation systems on ships necessitates\naccurate motion prediction models tailored to individual vessels. Traditional\nphysics-based models, while grounded in hydrodynamic principles, often fail to\naccount for ship-specific behaviors under real-world conditions. Conversely,\npurely data-driven models offer specificity but lack interpretability and\nrobustness in edge cases. This study proposes a data-driven physics-based model\nthat integrates physics-based equations with data-driven parameter\noptimization, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to ensure\ninterpretability and adaptability. The model incorporates physics-based\ncomponents such as 3-DoF dynamics, rudder, and propeller forces, while\nparameters such as resistance curve and rudder coefficients are optimized using\nsynthetic data. By embedding domain knowledge into the parameter optimization\nprocess, the fitted model maintains physical consistency. Validation of the\napproach is realized with two container ships by comparing, both qualitatively\nand quantitatively, predictions against ground-truth trajectories. The results\ndemonstrate significant improvements, in predictive accuracy and reliability,\nof the data-driven physics-based models over baseline physics-based models\ntuned with traditional marine engineering practices. The fitted models capture\nship-specific behaviors in diverse conditions with their predictions being,\n51.6% (ship A) and 57.8% (ship B) more accurate, 72.36% (ship A) and 89.67%\n(ship B) more consistent.",

    "abstract": "Content moderation plays a critical role in shaping safe and inclusive online\nenvironments, balancing platform standards, user expectations, and regulatory\nframeworks. Traditionally, this process involves operationalising policies into\nguidelines, which are then used by downstream human moderators for enforcement,\nor to further annotate datasets for training machine learning moderation\nmodels. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) are\ntransforming this landscape. These models can now interpret policies directly\nas textual inputs, eliminating the need for extensive data curation. This\napproach offers unprecedented flexibility, as moderation can be dynamically\nadjusted through natural language interactions. This paradigm shift raises\nimportant questions about how policies are operationalised and the implications\nfor content moderation practices. In this paper, we formalise the emerging\npolicy-as-prompt framework and identify five key challenges across four\ndomains: Technical Implementation (1. translating policy to prompts, 2.\nsensitivity to prompt structure and formatting), Sociotechnical (3. the risk of\ntechnological determinism in policy formation), Organisational (4. evolving\nroles between policy and machine learning teams), and Governance (5. model\ngovernance and accountability). Through analysing these challenges across\ntechnical, sociotechnical, organisational, and governance dimensions, we\ndiscuss potential mitigation approaches. This research provides actionable\ninsights for practitioners and lays the groundwork for future exploration of\nscalable and adaptive content moderation systems in digital ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) serve as the workhorse of deep learning,\nfinding applications in various fields that rely on images. Given sufficient\ndata, they exhibit the capacity to learn a wide range of concepts across\ndiverse settings. However, a notable limitation of CNNs is their susceptibility\nto overfitting when trained on small datasets. The augmentation of such\ndatasets can significantly enhance CNN performance by introducing additional\ndata points for learning. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of 11\ndifferent sets of data augmentation techniques, which include three novel sets\nproposed in this work. The first set of data augmentation employs pairwise\nchannel transfer, transferring Red, Green, Blue, Hue, and Saturation values\nfrom randomly selected images in the database to all images in the dataset. The\nsecond set introduces a novel occlusion approach, where objects in the images\nare occluded by randomly selected objects from the dataset. The third set\ninvolves a novel masking approach, using vertical, horizontal, circular, and\ncheckered masks to occlude portions of the images. In addition to these novel\ntechniques, we investigate other existing augmentation methods, including\nrotation, horizontal and vertical flips, resizing, translation, blur, color\njitter, and random erasing, and their effects on accuracy and overfitting. We\nfine-tune a base EfficientNet-B0 model for each augmentation method and conduct\na comparative analysis to showcase their efficacy. For the evaluation and\ncomparison of these augmentation techniques, we utilize the Caltech-101\ndataset. The ensemble of image augmentation techniques proposed emerges as the\nmost effective on the Caltech-101 dataset. The results demonstrate that diverse\ndata augmentation techniques present a viable means of enhancing datasets for\nimproved image classification.",

For an\nagent to accurately interpret the player's emotional state and contextual\nnuances, a foundational level of understanding is required, which can be\nachieved using a Large Language Model (LLM). Maintaining the LLM's focus across\nmultiple context changes, however, necessitates a more robust approach, such as\nintegrating the LLM with a dedicated task allocation model to guide its\nperformance throughout gameplay. In response to this need, we introduce\nVoting-Based Task Assignment (VBTA), a framework inspired by human reasoning in\ntask allocation and completion. VBTA assigns capability profiles to agents and\ntask descriptions to tasks, then generates a suitability matrix that quantifies\nthe alignment between an agent's abilities and a task's requirements.\nLeveraging six distinct voting methods, a pre-trained LLM, and integrating\nconflict-based search (CBS) for path planning, VBTA efficiently identifies and\nassigns the most suitable agent to each task.

To address its limitations, the\nexisting common strategy is to follow SFT with a separate phase of preference\noptimization (PO), which relies on either human-labeled preference data or a\nstrong reward model to guide the learning process. In this paper, we address\nthe limitations of SFT by exploring one of the most successful techniques in\nconventional supervised learning: discriminative learning. We introduce\nDiscriminative Fine-Tuning (DFT), an improved variant of SFT, which mitigates\nthe burden of collecting human-labeled preference data or training strong\nreward models. Unlike SFT that employs a generative approach and overlooks\nnegative data, DFT adopts a discriminative paradigm that increases the\nprobability of positive answers while suppressing potentially negative ones,\naiming for data prediction instead of token prediction. Our contributions\ninclude: (i) a discriminative probabilistic framework for fine-tuning LLMs by\nexplicitly modeling the discriminative likelihood of an answer among all\npossible outputs given an input; (ii) efficient algorithms to optimize this\ndiscriminative likelihood; and (iii) extensive experiments demonstrating DFT's\neffectiveness, achieving performance better than SFT and comparable to if not\nbetter than SFT$\\rightarrow$PO.

In the context of the ALMA Large Programme FAUST, we observed\nformaldehyde, H$_2$CO, and its singly and doubly deuterated forms, HDCO and\nD$_2$CO, towards the protostellar cluster VLA1623-2417, on scales of ~ 2000 -\n50 au. Formaldehyde probes the inner envelopes of the protostars VLA1623A, B,\nand W, the rotating cavities opened by the VLA1623A outflow, and several\nstreamers. The HDCO and D$_2$CO emissions are observed towards VLA1623A, in its\noutflow cavities, and in one of the streamers. We estimate the gas temperature\nfrom the HDCO lines: T~ 125 K towards VLA1623A, indicating hot-corino emission,\nlower temperatures in the outflow cavities (20 - 40 K), and in the streamers\n($\\le15$ K). The D$_2$CO lines also trace the flattened envelope of VLA1623A,\nwhere H$_2$CO and HDCO are fainter. This may be due to D$_2$CO formation on\ndust grains in the cold prestellar phase, and subsequent photodesorption caused\nby the enhanced UV flux from two nearby B stars. We inferred the molecular\ndeuteration: [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.16, ~ 0.07 - 0.13, and ~ 0.3;\n[D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.003, ~ 0.05 - 0.13, and ~ 0.03 in the hot corino, in\nthe outflow cavities, and in the streamer, respectively. The spatial\ndistribution of D$_2$CO, which points to formation on dust grains, and the\nsimilar values of [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] and [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] in the components of\nthe system, suggest that deuterium fractionation occurs at the prestellar stage\nand is then inherited, mostly unaltered, in the protostellar phase.",

In photonics, precise control over light's degrees of\nfreedom, including discrete variables (polarization, photon number, orbital\nangular momentum) and continuous variables (phase, amplitude quadratures,\nfrequency), is fundamental. Our model manipulates photonic systems to encode\nand process quantum information via the photon's spatial degree of freedom,\nemploying polarization as an auxiliary qubit. We propose a programmable\nphotonic circuit that simulates quantum channels, including phase-damping,\namplitude-damping, and bit-flip channels, through adjustable interferometric\nparameters. Furthermore, the interferometer extends to complex channels, such\nas the squeezed generalized amplitude damping. This work contributes to\nadvancing quantum simulation techniques and serves as a foundation for\nexploring quantum computing applications, while highlighting pathways for their\npractical implementation.",

The dominant backgrounds for these\ntrilepton signatures arise from $t\\bar{t}$ production, single top quark\nproduction in association with $V$, and $VV$ production (where $V = W, Z$).\nThese backgrounds are significantly reduced using machine learning-based\nclassification models, which optimize event selection and improve signal\nsensitivity.

    "abstract": "We applaud Fiksel (2024) for their valuable contributions to\nrandomization-based inference, particularly their work on inverting the Fisher\nrandomization test (FRT) to construct confidence intervals using the\ncovariate-adjusted test statistic. FRT is advocated by many scholars because it\nproduces finite-sample exact p-values for any test statistic and can be easily\nadopted for any experimental design (Rosenberger et al., 2019; Proschan and\nDodd, 2019; Young, 2019; Bind and Rubin, 2020). By inverting FRTs, we can\nconstruct the randomization-based confidence interval (RBCI). To the best of\nour knowledge, Zhu and Liu (2023) are the first to analytically invert the FRT\nfor the difference-in-means statistic. Fiksel (2024) extended this analytical\napproach to the covariate-adjusted statistic, producing a monotonic p-value\nfunction under certain conditions. In this rejoinder, we propose an analytical\napproach to invert the FRT for test statistics that yield a non-monotonic\np-value function, with the studentized t-statistic as an important special\ncase. Exploiting our analytical approach, we can recover the non-monotonic\np-value function and construct RBCI based on the studentized t-statistic. The\nRBCI generated by the proposed analytical approach is guaranteed to achieve the\ndesired coverage probability and resolve the contradiction between Luo et al.\n(2021) and Wu and Ding (2021).

The\nrelated parameters are (p_0, k, x), the respective proportions of initial\nagents supporting opinion A, unavowed tie prejudices breaking in favor of\nopinion A, and contrarians. Combining k and x yields unexpected and\ncounterintuitive results. In most part of the landscape the final outcome is\npredetermined with a single attractor dynamics independently of the initial\nsupports for the competing opinions. Large domains of (k, x) values are found\nto lead an initial minority to turn majority democratically without any\nexternal influence. A new alternating regime is also unveiled in narrow ranges\nof extreme proportions of contrarians. The findings indicate that the expected\ndemocratic character of free opinion dynamics is indeed rarely satisfied. The\nactual values of (k, x) are found to be instrumental to predetermine the final\nwinning opinion.

Traditional techniques primarily\ncorrelate statement execution with failures, yet program behavior is influenced\nby diverse execution features-such as variable values, branch conditions, and\ndefinition-use pairs-that can provide richer diagnostic insights.\n  In an empirical study of 310 bugs across 20 projects, we analyzed 17\nexecution features and assessed their correlation with failure outcomes. Our\nfindings suggest that fault localization benefits from a broader range of\nexecution features: (1) Scalar pairs exhibit the strongest correlation with\nfailures; (2) Beyond line executions, def-use pairs and functions executed are\nkey indicators for fault localization; and (3) Combining multiple features\nenhances effectiveness compared to relying solely on individual features.\n  Building on these insights, we introduce a debugging approach to diagnose\nfailure circumstances. The approach extracts fine-grained execution features\nand trains a decision tree to differentiate passing and failing runs. From this\nmodel, we derive a diagnosis that pinpoints faulty locations and explains the\nunderlying causes of the failure.\n  Our evaluation demonstrates that the generated diagnoses achieve high\npredictive accuracy, reinforcing their reliability.

Our paper revisits this historical dataset but from\na lens of modern language models, both small and large. We review some of the\nmore popular Large Language Model (LLM) tools and examine them from a\nstatistical point of view in the context of text classification. We investigate\nwhether, without any attempt to fine-tune, the general embedding constructs can\nbe useful for stylometry and attribution. We explain differences between\nvarious word/phrase embeddings and discuss how to aggregate them in a document.\nContrary to our expectations, we exemplify that dimension expansion with word\nembeddings may not always be beneficial for attribution relative to dimension\nreduction with topic embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that default LLM\nembeddings (even after manual fine-tuning) may not consistently improve\nauthorship attribution accuracy. Instead, Bayesian analysis with topic\nembeddings trained on ``function words\" yields superior out-of-sample\nclassification performance. This suggests that traditional (small) statistical\nlanguage models, with their interpretability and solid theoretical foundation,\ncan offer significant advantages in authorship attribution tasks.

With its rapid growth and widespread popularity, TikTok presents a\ncompelling platform for study, yet given its video-first nature the network\nstructure of the conversations that it hosts remains largely unexplored.\nLeveraging its recently released APIs, in combination with web scraping, we\nconstruct graphs detailing stitch relations from both a video- and user-centric\nperspective. Specifically, we focus on user multi-digraphs, with vertices\nrepresenting users and edges representing directed stitch relations. From the\nuser graphs, we characterize common communication patterns of the stitch using\nfrequent subgraph mining, finding a preference for stars and star-like\nstructures, an aversion towards cyclic structures, and directional disposition\nfavoring in- and out-stars over mixed-direction structures. These structures\nare augmented with sentiment labels in the form of edge attributes. We then use\nthese subgraphs for graph-level embeddings together with Graph2Vec, we show no\nclear distinction between topologies for different hashtag topic categories.\nLastly, we compare our StitchGraphs to Twitter reply networks and show that a\nremakable similarity between the conversation networks on the two platforms.",

    "abstract": "Recent observations of the solar atmosphere in cool extreme ultraviolet (EUV)\nlines have reported the prevalence of coronal rain falling from coronal cloud\nfilaments that are associated with the magnetic dips of coronal X-point\nstructures. These filaments mysteriously appear as clouds of mass in the corona\nthat subsequently shrink and disappear due to mass losses that drain as coronal\nrain along arced field lines. Using a two and a half dimensional,\nmagnetohydrodynamic model, we investigated evaporation-condensation as the\nformation mechanism of the subset of coronal cloud filaments that form above\ncoronal X-points. Our simulation included the effects of field-aligned thermal\nconduction and optically thin radiation and used the state-of-the-art\nTransition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to model the formation,\nmaintenance, and mass loss of a filament above a coronal X-point. This paper\npresents a physical model that demonstrates magnetic reconnection as a filament\nloss mechanism, producing hybrid filament/coronal rain via mass losses through\nthe X-point. A detailed analysis of how the mass of the filament forces the\nfield to reconnect is also presented, revealing three phases that characterize\nthe evolution of the reconnecting current sheet and associated mass losses. We\nconclude that the formation of certain coronal cloud filaments and subsequent\nmass losses via coronal rain can be explained by the evaporation-condensation\nmodel combined with filament mass losses forced by magnetic reconnection. We\nalso report that rebound shocks generated by the impact of coronal rain\ncondensations on the chromosphere together with retractive upflows can cause\nupward propagating condensations to form through a dynamic thermal runaway\nprocess.",

This issue is especially relevant in domains\nlike autonomous vehicles and robotics, where constraints such as collision\navoidance often take a non-convex form. In this paper, we establish a regret\nbound of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\bigl(\\bigl(1 + \\tfrac{1}{\\tau}\\bigr)\n\\sqrt{\\log(\\tfrac{1}{\\tau}) d^3 H^4 K} \\bigr)$, applicable to both star-convex\nand non-star-convex cases, where $d$ is the feature dimension, $H$ the episode\nlength, $K$ the number of episodes, and $\\tau$ the safety threshold. Moreover,\nthe violation of safety constraints is zero with high probability throughout\nthe learning process. A key technical challenge in these settings is bounding\nthe covering number of the value-function class, which is essential for\nachieving value-aware uniform concentration in model-free function\napproximation. For the star-convex setting, we develop a novel technique called\nObjective Constraint-Decomposition (OCD) to properly bound the covering number.\nThis result also resolves an error in a previous work on constrained RL. In\nnon-star-convex scenarios, where the covering number can become infinitely\nlarge, we propose a two-phase algorithm, Non-Convex Safe Least Squares Value\nIteration (NCS-LSVI), which first reduces uncertainty about the safe set by\nplaying a known safe policy. After that, it carefully balances exploration and\nexploitation to achieve the regret bound. Finally, numerical simulations on an\nautonomous driving scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of NCS-LSVI.",

The sources considered include\nLy$\\alpha$ directly from galaxies, cooling at the edges of ionized bubbles,\nrecombinations within these bubbles, and reprocessing of galaxy continuum\nemission in the IGM. We also vary astrophysical parameters including the\naverage neutral fraction of the IGM, the dust absorption of Ly$\\alpha$ in\ngalaxies, and the ionizing escape fraction. Previous work has suggested that\nLy$\\alpha$ intensity mapping can be used to constrain the neutral fraction of\nthe IGM when accounting for radiative transfer in the IGM. When radiative\ntransfer is ignored, direct Ly$\\alpha$ emission from galaxies has the highest\namplitude of power on all scales. When we include radiative transfer in our\nsimulations, we find continuum emission reprocessed as Ly$\\alpha$ is comparable\nto the Ly$\\alpha$ emission directly from galaxies on large scales. For high\nneutral fraction in the IGM, emission from recombinations is comparable to\ngalaxies on large scales. We find that the slope of the power spectrum is\nsensitive to the neutral fraction of the IGM when radiative transfer is\nincluded, suggesting that this may be useful for placing constraints on cosmic\nreionization. In addition, we find the power of galaxies is decreased across\nall scales due to dust absorption. We also find the escape fraction must be\nlarge for recombinations and bubble edges to contribute significantly to the\npower. We find the cross power is observable between SPHEREx Ly$\\alpha$\nintensity maps and a hypothetical galaxy survey is observable with a total\nsignal-to-noise of 4 from $k = 0.035$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to $k = 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$.",

Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a 980 day\nperiodic variability with strange characteristics: 'triangle-shaped'\nbrightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in\nthe $g$-band. We speculate this to be a wide but eccentric binary with the same\norbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two\nother systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of 700 days and 230 days,\nrespectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also\nshows a short period at 1.18 hours which can either be from a close inner\nbinary or pulsational origin. We present CTSS 2 and PN K 3-5 which show\nbrightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar\nmodel fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the\nyoungest post-AGB CSPN known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. These\nappear to be late thermal pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB\nphase, though alternative explanations are possible. We then present recent\nHST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1\nshowing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white\ndwarf in UCAC2 46706450.

    "abstract": "Urban overheating, exacerbated by climate change, threatens public health and\nurban sustainability. Traditional approaches, such as numerical simulations and\nfield measurements, face challenges due to uncertainties in input data. This\nstudy integrates field measurements with machine learning models to predict the\nduration and severity of future urban overheating events, focusing on the role\nof urban greening under different global warming (GW) scenarios. Field\nmeasurements were conducted in summer 2024 at an office campus in Ottawa, a\ncold-climate city. Microclimate data were collected from four locations with\nvarying levels of greenery: a large lawn without trees (Lawn), a parking lot\nwithout greenery (Parking), an area with sparsely distributed trees (Tree), and\na fully covered forested area (Forest). Machine learning models, including\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, were trained on local microclimate data,\nwith LSTM achieving the best predictions. Four GW scenarios were analyzed,\ncorresponding to different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) for 2050 and\n2090. Results show that the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at the\n\"Parking\" location rises from about 27,\\textdegree C under GW1.0 to\n31,\\textdegree C under GW3.5. Moreover, low health risk conditions (UTCI >\n26,\\textdegree C) increase across all locations due to climate change,\nregardless of greenery levels. However, tree-covered areas such as \"Tree\" and\n\"Forest\" effectively prevent extreme heat conditions (UTCI > 38.9,\\textdegree\nC). These findings highlight the crucial role of urban greening in mitigating\nsevere thermal stress and enhancing thermal comfort under future climate\nscenarios.",

Advances in computational methods now enable\nthree dimensional (3D) reconstruction of organs from histology images,\nenhancing the analysis of structural and functional features. Here, we present\na novel multimodal computational method to reconstruct rodent muscles in 3D\nusing classical image processing and data analysis techniques, analyze their\nstructural features and correlate them to previously recorded\nelectrophysiological data. The algorithm analyzes spatial distribution patterns\nof features identified through histological staining, normalizing them across\nmultiple samples. Further, the algorithm successfully correlates spatial\npatterns with high density epimysial ElectroMyoGraphy (hdEMG) recordings,\nproviding a multimodal perspective on neuromuscular dynamics, linking spatial\nand electrophysiological information. The code was validated by looking at the\ndistribution of NeuroMuscular Junctions (NMJs) in naive soleus muscles and\ncompared the distributions and patterns observed with ones observed in previous\nliterature. Our results showed consistency with the expected results,\nvalidating our method for features and pattern recognition. The multimodal\naspect was shown in a naive soleus muscle, where a strong correlation was found\nbetween motor unit locations derived via hdEMG, and NMJ locations obtained from\nhistology, highlighting their spatial relationship.

In this work, we study the cubic nonlinear wave equation as a proxy\nfor Einstein's equations, using a four-dimensional model geometry that allows\nstable trapping.

However, integrating quantum technologies into precision\nmedicine also presents challenges, including errors in algorithms and high\ncosts.

By providing a rigorous mathematical framework, formal\nmethods help to specify, develop, and verify systems with high precision. In\ngenomic data analysis, formal specification languages can precisely (1) define\nthe behavior and properties of quantum algorithms designed to identify genetic\nmarkers associated with diseases. Model checking tools can systematically\nexplore all possible states of the algorithm to (2) ensure it behaves correctly\nunder all conditions, while theorem proving techniques provide mathematical (3)\nproof that the algorithm meets its specified properties, ensuring accuracy and\nreliability.

    "abstract": "Knowledge components (KCs) mapped to problems help model student learning,\ntracking their mastery levels on fine-grained skills thereby facilitating\npersonalized learning and feedback in online learning platforms. However,\ncrafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain\nexperts, is highly labor-intensive. We present a fully automated, LLM-based\npipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We\nalso develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these\nLLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations on a real-world student code\nsubmission dataset. We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and\nhuman-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the\nlearning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a\nbetter fit than human-written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a\nhuman evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates\nreasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic trace estimation is a well-established tool for approximating the\ntrace of a large symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{B}$. Several applications involve a\nmatrix that depends continuously on a parameter $t \\in [a,b]$, and require\ntrace estimates of $\\mathbf{B}(t)$ for many values of $t$. This is, for\nexample, the case when approximating the spectral density of a matrix.\nApproximating the trace separately for each matrix $\\mathbf{B}(t_1), \\dots,\n\\mathbf{B}(t_m)$ clearly incurs redundancies and a cost that scales linearly\nwith $m$. To address this issue, we propose and analyze modifications for three\nstochastic trace estimators, the Girard-Hutchinson, Nystr\\\"om, and Nystr\\\"om++\nestimators. Our modification uses \\emph{constant} randomization across\ndifferent values of $t$, that is, every matrix $\\mathbf{B}(t_1), \\dots,\n\\mathbf{B}(t_m)$ is multiplied with the \\emph{same} set of random vectors. When\ncombined with Chebyshev approximation in $t$, the use of such constant random\nmatrices allows one to reuse matrix-vector products across different values of\n$t$, leading to significant cost reduction. Our analysis shows that the loss of\nstochastic independence across different $t$ does not lead to deterioration. In\nparticular, we show that $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ random matrix-vector\nproducts suffice to ensure an error of $\\varepsilon > 0$ for Nystr\\\"om++,\nindependent of low-rank properties of $\\mathbf{B}(t)$. We discuss in detail how\nthe combination of Nystr\\\"om++ with Chebyshev approximation applies to spectral\ndensity estimation and provide an analysis of the resulting method. This\nimproves various aspects of an existing stochastic estimator for spectral\ndensity estimation. Several numerical experiments from electronic structure\ninteraction, statistical thermodynamics, and neural network optimization\nvalidate our findings.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning models increasingly process sensitive data, understanding\ntheir vulnerability to privacy attacks is vital. Membership inference attacks\n(MIAs) exploit model responses to infer whether specific data points were used\nduring training, posing a significant privacy risk. Prior research suggests\nthat spiking neural networks (SNNs), which rely on event-driven computation and\ndiscrete spike-based encoding, exhibit greater resilience to MIAs than\nartificial neural networks (ANNs). This resilience stems from their\nnon-differentiable activations and inherent stochasticity, which obscure the\ncorrelation between model responses and individual training samples. To enhance\nprivacy in SNNs, we explore two techniques: quantization and surrogate\ngradients. Quantization, which reduces precision to limit information leakage,\nhas improved privacy in ANNs. Given SNNs' sparse and irregular activations,\nquantization may further disrupt the activation patterns exploited by MIAs. We\nassess the vulnerability of SNNs and ANNs under weight and activation\nquantization across multiple datasets, using the attack model's receiver\noperating characteristic (ROC) curve area under the curve (AUC) metric, where\nlower values indicate stronger privacy, and evaluate the privacy-accuracy\ntrade-off. Our findings show that quantization enhances privacy in both\narchitectures with minimal performance loss, though full-precision SNNs remain\nmore resilient than quantized ANNs. Additionally, we examine the impact of\nsurrogate gradients on privacy in SNNs. Among five evaluated gradients, spike\nrate escape provides the best privacy-accuracy trade-off, while arctangent\nincreases vulnerability to MIAs. These results reinforce SNNs' inherent privacy\nadvantages and demonstrate that quantization and surrogate gradient selection\nsignificantly influence privacy-accuracy trade-offs in SNNs.",

    "abstract": "MgGeN2 films were synthesized using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition\non GaN/c-sapphire templates and c-plane sapphire substrates. Energy-dispersive\nX-ray spectroscopy was used to estimate the cation composition ratios. To\nmitigate magnesium evaporation, the films were grown at pyrometer temperature\n745 {\\deg}C with a wafer rotation speed of 1000 rpm. Growth rates were\ndetermined by fitting energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy spectra to film\nthicknesses using NIST DTSA-II software. The thickness estimates determined by\nthis method were consistent with scanning transmission electron microscopy\nmeasurements done for selected samples. Scanning electron microscopy images\nrevealed faceted surfaces indicative of a tendency toward three-dimensional\ngrowth. X-ray diffraction spectra confirmed that the films were highly\ncrystalline and exhibited preferential orientation in alignment with the\nsubstrate. Atomic force microscopy measurements show that film thicknesses are\nconsistent across samples grown on both GaN templates and sapphire substrates,\nwith typical roughnesses around 10 nm. Transmittance spectra of films grown on\ndouble-side-polished sapphire substrates yielded band gaps of 4.28 +- 0.06 eV\nfor samples exhibiting close-to-ideal stoichiometry. Comparison of the measured\nspectra with ab initio calculations are in good agreement both near the band\ngap and at higher energies where excitation is into higher-lying bands. These\nfindings provide insight into the growth and characterization of MgGeN2,\ncontributing to the development of this material for potential applications in\noptoelectronics and power electronics.",

    "abstract": "In industrial practice, requirements are an indispensable element of any\nserious software project. In the academic study of software engineering,\nrequirements are one of the heavily researched subjects. And yet requirements\nengineering, as practiced in industry, makes shockingly sparse use of the\nconcepts propounded in the requirements literature. The present paper starts\nfrom an assumption about the causes for this situation and proposes a remedy to\nredress it. The posited explanation is that change is the major factor\naffecting the practical application of even the best-intentioned requirements\ntechniques. No sooner has the ink dried on the specifications than the system\nenvironment and stakeholders' views of the system begin to evolve.\n  The proposed solution is a requirements engineering method, called UOOR,\nwhich unifies many known requirements concepts and a few new ones in a\nframework entirely devised to accommodate and support seamless change\nthroughout the project lifecycle.\n  The method encompasses the commonly used requirements techniques, namely,\nscenarios, and integrates them into the seamless software development process.\nThe work presented here introduces the notion of seamless requirements\ntraceability, which relies on the propagation of traceability links, themselves\nbased on formal properties of relations between project artifacts. As a proof\nof concept, the paper presents a traceability tool to be integrated into a\ngeneral-purpose IDE that provides the ability to link requirements to other\nsoftware project artifacts, display notifications of changes in requirements,\nand trace those changes to the related project elements.\n  The UOOR approach is not just a theoretical proposal but has been designed\nfor practical use and has been applied to a significant real-world case study:\nRoborace, a competition of autonomous racing cars.",

The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where\nthe bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively\nacts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species\nrepulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body\nwavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species\ninteractions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time\ntranslation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time\ncrystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the\nbottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this\nleads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Most of these methods require large amounts of labeled\nor unlabeled training data to learn effective models. However, in many\npractical applications, such as medical image reconstruction, extensive\ntraining datasets are often unavailable or limited. A significant milestone in\naddressing this challenge came in 2018 with the work of Ulyanov et al., which\nintroduced the Deep Image Prior (DIP)--the first training-data-free neural\nnetwork method for IIPs. Unlike conventional deep learning approaches, DIP\nrequires only a convolutional neural network, the noisy measurements, and a\nforward operator. By leveraging the implicit regularization of deep networks\ninitialized with random noise, DIP can learn and restore image structures\nwithout relying on external datasets. However, a well-known limitation of DIP\nis its susceptibility to overfitting, primarily due to the\nover-parameterization of the network. In this tutorial paper, we provide a\ncomprehensive review of DIP, including a theoretical analysis of its training\ndynamics. We also categorize and discuss recent advancements in DIP-based\nmethods aimed at mitigating overfitting, including techniques such as\nregularization, network re-parameterization, and early stopping.

Unlike conventional RNGs that use raw timing\nvariations, our design uses system jitter solely to generate ephemeral QPP pads\nand derives 8-bit outputs directly from permutation counts, eliminating the\nneed for post-processing. This approach leverages the factorial complexity of\npermutation sorting to systematically accumulate entropy from dynamic hardware\ninteractions, ensuring non-deterministic outputs even from fixed seeds.\nNotably, IID-based QPP-RNG achieves a min-entropy of 7.85-7.95 bits per byte\nfrom IID min-entropy estimate, surpassing ID Quantique's QRNG (7.157042 bits\nper byte), which marks a breakthrough in randomness quality. Our implementation\nemploys a dynamic seed evolution protocol that continuously refreshes the\ninternal state with unpredictable system jitter, effectively decoupling the QPP\nsequence from the initial seed. Cross-platform validation on macOS (x86 and\nARM) and Windows (x86) confirms uniformly distributed outputs, while\nevaluations compliant with NIST SP 800-90B show a Shannon entropy of 7.9999\nbits per byte.

On\nH100 GPUs and model width 4096, individual operators in the proposed\nmulti-hybrid StripedHyena 2 architecture achieve two-fold throughput\nimprovement over linear attention and state-space models. Multi-hybrids excel\nat sequence modeling over byte-tokenized data, as demonstrated by the Evo 2\nline of models. We discuss the foundations that enable these results, including\narchitecture design, overlap-add blocked kernels for tensor cores, and\ndedicated all-to-all and point-to-point context parallelism strategies.",

So far, the majority of measurements have been performed on\nthin-films, or have involved surface measurements. However, the question of\naltermagnetic order in the bulk system - in the absence of substrate or surface\neffects - remains. Here we show evidence for bulk altermagnetism in single\ncrystal MnTe, through spectroscopic X-ray microscopy. By performing nanoscale\nX-ray magnetic circular dichroic (XMCD) imaging in transmission on a 200 nm\nthick lamella, we observe domains and magnetic textures with a spectroscopic\nsignature characteristic of altermagnetic order, thereby confirming the\nintrinsic nature of altermagnetism in MnTe. Quantitative analysis of the XMCD\nsignal reveals an excellent agreement with predicted signals, establishing that\nthe altermagnetic order exists throughout the thickness of the lamella and\nconfirming the intrinsic, bulk nature of the state. With these results, we\ndemonstrate that transmission XMCD spectroscopic imaging is a robust,\nquantitative technique to probe altermagnetic order, providing a means to probe\nindividual altermagnetic domains within complex configurations. This ability to\ninvestigate, and characterise altermagnetic order in bulk crystals represents\nan important tool for the exploration of altermagnetism across a wide range of\ncandidate materials, of key importance for the development of future\ntechnologies.",

Despite much effort,\nhowever, this has remained elusive. Here, we report the first observation of\nintrinsic mesoscopic vibrational dressed states. The requisite nonlinearity\nresults from strong resonant coupling between an eigenmode of our NEMS\nresonator and a single, two-level system (TLS) that is intrinsic to the device\nmaterial. We control the TLS in situ by varying mechanical strain, tuning it in\nand out of resonance with the NEMS mode.

While\nhigh Eddington sources show extreme absorption features, overall distributions\nare statistically similar except for maximum outflow velocity.

To address this issue, we propose the\n``Frog-eyes\" system, which employs a pair of narrow-band filters: one\npositioned near a strong absorption line to capture signals from Doppler\nshifts, and the other placed on the adjacent continuum to monitor intrinsic\nvariations. The combination of observations from the two filters enables the\nextraction of radial velocity (RV) curves from a large sample of binary stars,\nand is particularly efficient for single-lined binaries (SB1), using\nphotometric techniques. Comprehensive mock simulations on SB1 demonstrate that\nthe binary orbital parameters can be precisely measured from the extracted RV\ncurves for binary systems where the primary star has an effective temperature\ngreater than 6000 K. With a typical ground-based photometric precision of\napproximately 0.3%, the uncertainties in the derived semi-amplitude K and\neccentricity e are less than 10% and 0.1, respectively, for binary systems with\nK $\\ge$ 30 km/s. These encouraging results are further validated by real\nobservations of the hot subdwarf-white dwarf binary system HD 265435, using a\nnon-specialized ``Frog-eyes\" system installed on the Chinese 2.16m telescope.\nOnce this system is properly installed on large-field-of-view survey\ntelescopes, the rate of acquiring RV curves for binaries will approach their\ndetection rate in leading time-domain photometric surveys.",

At the radio wavelength, such\ninvestigations are so far limited to the integrated quantities (e.g. total\npower and mass). We aimed to investigate the scaling relations between the mass\nof a galaxy cluster and its radio emission at low frequencies, treating both\nthe integrated and the spatially resolved quantities for a sample of\nwell-selected targets. We crossmatched LoTSS DR2 and CHEX-MATE datasets in\norder to get the deepest and most homogeneous radio data of a representative\nsample of objects.

We obtained that properly accounting for\nthe mass and redshift dependence in the radio profile can reduce the overall\nscatter by a factor of $\\sim 4$, with an evident residual dependence on the\ncluster dynamical status. We showed that assuming no relation between the halo\nsize ($R_{H}$) and the cluster mass ($M$) allowed us to reconcile the observed\nradio profile mass scaling and the one predicted starting from the $P_{\\nu}-M$\nrelation. We discuss the implications of a lack of $R_H-M$ relation, assessing\npossible systematics and biases in the analyses, and interpreting it as a\nnatural consequence of the structure formation process.

Distinct from the spiral arms, filaments\nconstitute a major portion of dense gas concentration. They are expected to\nplay an important role in star formation and are known to harbour star-forming\nregions and H II regions.\n  Aims. We explore the origin of filaments/feathers in disc galaxies via global\ngravitational instability.\n  Methods. We conduct a parameter study using three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of isolated disc galaxies that are isothermal, self-gravitating and\ninitialised in equilibrium. Our galaxies are uniquely characterised by two\ndimensionless parameters, the Toomre $Q$ and the rotational Mach number,\n$\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm c} = v_{\\rm c}/c_{\\rm s}$ (ratio of circular velocity to\nsound speed). We carry out simulations covering a wide range in both.\n  Results. We find that galaxies with $Q = 1$ form filaments within a single\nrotation, while galaxies with $Q \\geq 2$ do not. These filaments are kpc long\nand are semi-regularly spaced along the azimuth. Their morphology, density\ncontrast and formation timescale vary with $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm c}$, with filament\nspacing and instability onset time both inversely proportional to\n$\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm c}$ and the density contrast increasing with\n$\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm c}$.

We compare the\nfilament spacing in our simulations with the ones from JWST/MIRI and HST\nobservations of nearby galaxies and find them in agreement.\n  Conclusions. Our study suggests that self-gravity and rotation are sufficient\nto form filaments, even in the absence of spiral arms or magnetic fields. Their\nmorphologies are primarily determined by $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm c}$, which\nparametrises the importance of thermal versus rotational support.",

In such environments,\nmotivated by models of wind-driven accretion disks, even Earth-mass planets\nlocated interior to 1 au can significantly perturb the disk, carving gaps and\nexciting vortices on their edges. Both processes are influenced by radiative\ntransfer, which can both drive baroclinic forcing and influence gap opening. We\nperform a set of high-resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations of\nplanet-disk interaction in the feedback and gap-opening regimes, aiming to\nunderstand the role of radiation transport in the migration of super-Earth-mass\nplanets representative of the observed exoplanet population. We find that\nradiative cooling drives baroclinic forcing during multiple stages of the\nplanet's migration in the feedback regime (~1.5 M_earth), significantly\ndelaying the onset of vortex formation at the gap edge but ultimately resulting\nin type-III runaway migration episodes. For super-thermal-mass planets (~6.7\nM_earth), radiative cooling is fundamentally linked to the gap opening process,\nwith the planet stalling instead of undergoing vortex-assisted migration as\nexpected from isothermal or adiabatic models.

    "abstract": "The quantum nature of gravity remains an open question in fundamental\nphysics, lacking experimental verification. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a\npotential avenue for detecting gravitons, the hypothetical quantum carriers of\ngravity. However, by analogy with quantum optics, distinguishing gravitons from\nclassical GWs requires the preservation of quantum coherence, which may be lost\ndue to interactions with the cosmic environment causing decoherence. We\ninvestigate whether GWs retain their quantum state by deriving the reduced\ndensity matrix and evaluating decoherence, using an environmental model where a\nscalar field is conformally coupled to gravity. Our results show that quantum\ndecoherence of GWs is stronger at lower frequencies and higher reheating\ntemperatures. We identify a model-independent amplitude threshold below which\ndecoherence is negligible, providing a fundamental limit for directly probing\nthe quantum nature of gravity. In the standard cosmological scenario, the low\nenergy density of the universe at the end of inflation leads to complete\ndecoherence at the classical amplitude level of inflationary GWs. However, for\nhigher energy densities, decoherence is negligible within a frequency window in\nthe range $100\\ {\\rm Hz} \\text{-} 10^8\\ {\\rm Hz}$, which depends on the\nreheating temperature. In a kinetic-dominated scenario, the dependence on\nreheating temperature weakens, allowing GWs to maintain quantum coherence above\n$10^7\\ {\\rm Hz}$.",

Inferring galaxy properties from the observed spectrum via\nspectral synthesis modeling is thus challenging. In particular, a simple yet\nflexible model for the SFH is required to obtain unbiased inferences. In this\npaper, we use SFHs from the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations to test SFH\nmodels in terms of their capability of describing the simulated SFHs and the\nspectra generated from them. In addition to some commonly used SFH models\n($\\Gamma$, $\\tau$, and nonparametric), we also examine a model developed from\nprincipal component analysis (PCA), trained by a set of SFHs from IllustrisTNG.\nWe find that when using the first five principal components (eigenhistories),\nthe PCA-based models can achieve a good balance between simplicity and\naccuracy. Among the models tested, the PCA-based model provides high\nflexibility, by capturing diverse and complex simulated SFHs. To accurately\nreproduce spectra generated from the simulated SFHs, it is necessary to have a\ndegree of freedom to describe the most recent SFH (e.g., a step function\ncovering the age of 0 - 0.3 Gyr).

We have performed extensive atmospheric retrieval analyses\nof 2MASS 1207 b's JWST/NIRSpec spectrum using petitRADTRANS and a new\natmospheric inhomogeneity framework, which characterizes homogeneous\natmospheres, patchy clouds, cloud-free hot spots, or the combination of patchy\nclouds and spots. Among 24 retrieval runs with various assumptions, the most\nstatistically preferred model corresponds to the patchy cloud scheme, with\nTeff$=1174^{+4}_{-3}$ K, log(g)=$3.62^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ dex, and\nR$=1.399^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ R$_{\\rm Jup}$, along with near-solar atmospheric\ncompositions of [M/H]$=-0.05\\pm0.03$ dex and C/O$=0.440\\pm0.012$. This model\nsuggests ~9% of 2MASS 1207 b's atmosphere is covered by thin iron clouds,\nproducing L-dwarf-like spectra, while the remaining 91% consists of thick\nsilicate and iron clouds, emitting blackbody-like spectra. These thin-cloud and\nthick-cloud regions resemble Jupiter's belts and zones, respectively; this\nscenario is consistently supported by other retrieval runs incorporating\ninhomogeneous atmospheres. We demonstrate that 2MASS 1207 b's weak CO\nabsorption can be explained by the veiling effects of patchy thick clouds; the\nabsence of 3.3um CH4 absorption is attributed to its hot thermal structure,\nwhich naturally leads to a CO-dominant, CH4-deficient atmosphere. The retrieved\natmospheric models also match the observed variability amplitudes of 2MASS 1207\nb.

We accomplish this by working in the\nsetting of (V-)graded categories, which generalize both V-enriched categories\nand V-actegories and were introduced by Wood under the name \"large\nV-categories\". We develop a general framework for graded functor categories and\ngraded bifunctors taking values in bigraded categories, noting that V itself is\ncanonically bigraded. We show that V-graded modules (or profunctors) are\nexamples of graded bifunctors and that V-graded presheaf categories are\nexamples of V-graded functor categories. In the special case where V is normal\nduoidal, we compare the above graded concepts with the enriched bifunctors and\nfunctor categories of Garner and L\\'opez Franco.

The\nbackground is characterized by two parameters, $A$ and $B$, which reduce to\n$A=\\Omega_{m0}$ and $B=2/3$ in the $\\Lambda$CDM limit, while deviations in the\ngrowth of structures are captured through a fitting function for $f\\sigma_8$\ninvolving the growth index $\\gamma$. Using recent observational datasets\ninvolving background expansion and growth of structures (related to\nobservations involving redshift space distortions), we find significant\nevidence for departures from $\\Lambda$CDM in the background expansion whereas\nthere is no finite evidence for deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM behaviour in the\ngrowth of structures. This suggests that with the current precision in\nobservational data involving background and perturbed Universe, a deviation\nfrom $\\Lambda$CDM behaviour is confirmed (as shown in the recent DESI-DR2\nresults). But whether this deviation is due to an evolving Dark Energy or due\nto the modification of gravity at cosmological scales is still an open\nquestion, largely due to less precise data from perturbed Universe. We further\ndemonstrate how the future high-precision growth data (from Euclid, for\nexample) can answer such question using a forecast study.",

    "abstract": "Popular IDEs frequently contain bugs in their refactoring implementations.\nEnsuring that a transformation preserves a program's behavior is a complex\ntask. Traditional detection methods rely on predefined preconditions for each\nrefactoring type, limiting their scalability and adaptability to new\ntransformations. These methods often require extensive static and dynamic\nanalyses, which are computationally expensive, time-consuming, and may still\nfail to detect certain refactoring bugs. This study evaluates the effectiveness\nof Small Language Models (SLMs) in detecting two types of refactoring bugs in\nJava and Python: (i) transformations that introduce errors or behavioral\nchanges (Type I) and (ii) transformations unnecessarily blocked by IDEs despite\nbeing valid (Type II). We assess whether Llama 3.2 3B, Mistral 7B, Gemma 2 9B,\nGemma 3 12B, DeepSeek-R1 14B, Phi-4 14B, o1-mini, and o3-mini-high can\naccurately detect 100 refactoring bugs reported in widely used Java and Python\nIDEs, such as Eclipse and NetBeans. The study covers 16 refactoring types and\nemploys zero-shot prompting on consumer-grade hardware to evaluate the models'\nability to reason about refactoring correctness without explicit prior\ntraining. The proprietary o3-mini-high model achieved the highest detection\nrate, identifying 84.3% of Type I bugs. The open-source Phi-4 14B performed\ncomparably well, demonstrating strong effectiveness across both bug types.\nHowever, o3-mini-high struggled with Type II bugs, correctly identifying and\napplying valid but blocked transformations in only 40% of cases. The findings\nhighlight the potential of SLMs for efficiently detecting refactoring bugs,\nparticularly in verifying behavioral changes. Additionally, SLMs offer a more\nadaptable solution capable of generalizing across different refactoring types\nand programming languages, addressing key limitations of traditional\napproaches.",

A multi-method qualitative approach, including\ncomparative policy analysis, thematic analysis, and case studies, investigates\nhow these regions classify AI risks, implement compliance measures, structure\noversight, prioritize transparency, and respond to emerging innovations.\nExamples from high-risk contexts like healthcare diagnostics, autonomous\nvehicles, fintech, and facial recognition demonstrate the advantages and\nlimitations of different regulatory models.

The\nflexible, sector-specific strategy of the UK facilitates agile responses but\nmay lead to inconsistent coverage across domains.

At each point on the detector, the diffuse scattering\nintensity exhibits oscillations at well-defined frequencies that correspond to\nsurface phonons propagating with wave vectors determined by the scattering\ngeometry. This indicates that the optical excitation generates coherent surface\nphonon wave packets across a broad wave vectors range, spanning from 300 to 60\nnm. This phenomenon is observed in a variety of samples, including single-layer\nand multilayer metal films, as well as bulk semiconductors. The measured\nsurface phonon dispersions show good agreement with theoretical calculations.\nBy comparing signal amplitudes from samples with different surface\nmorphologies, we find that the excitation mechanism is linked to the natural\nsurface roughness of the samples, and the signal is still detectable also on\nextremely smooth surfaces with sub-nanometer roughness. These findings\ndemonstrate a simple and effective method for optically exciting coherent\nsurface phonons with nanoscale wavelengths across a wide range of solid\nsurfaces. They also establish a foundation for surface phonon spectroscopy in a\nwave vectors regime that is well beyond the limit of conventional surface\nBrillouin scattering techniques.",

However, most\nprevious studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their\ninnate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs' performance as\nshown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL\n(Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement\nLearning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash\nthe power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first\ngenerate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn\ndiscussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL\nverifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score\nthat verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to\nencourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the\nco-training reward, and is then maximized through multi-agent RL. Unlike\nexisting LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of\nmultiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by\nanalytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs\nalone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast,\nmulti-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across\nbenchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.",

    "abstract": "I consider higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) created in chi(2)\nnonlinear medium and based on two-dimensional generalization of the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide array, where transition between trivial and\ntopological phases is achieved by shift of the four waveguides in the unit cell\ntowards its center or towards its periphery. Such HOTI can support linear\ntopological corner states that give rise to rich families of quadratic\ntopological solitons bifurcating from linear corner states. The presence of\nphase mismatch between parametrically interacting fundamental-frequency (FF)\nand second-harmonic (SH) waves drastically affects the bifurcation scenarios\nand domains of soliton existence, making the families of corner solitons much\nricher in comparison with those in HOTIs with cubic nonlinearity. For instance,\nthe internal soliton structure strongly depends on the location of propagation\nconstant in forbidden gaps in spectra of both FF and SH waves. Two different\ntypes of corner solitons are obtained, where either FF or SH wave dominates in\nthe bifurcation point from linear corner state. Because the waveguides are\ntwo-mode for SH wave, its spectrum features two groups of forbidden gaps with\ncorner states of different symmetry appearing in each of them. Such corner\nstates give rise to different families of corner solitons. Stability analysis\nshows that corner solitons in quadratic HOTI may feature wide stability domains\nand therefore are observable experimentally. These results illustrate how\nparametric nonlinear interactions enrich the behavior of topological\nexcitations and allow to control their shapes.",

First, we\nobtain certificates for the above inequalities via sums of coefficients\n$c_{I,J}$ over 321-avoiding permutations and involutions; we believe this\nrefined results of Rhoades-Skandera for TNN-matrix inequalities via their\nTemperley-Lieb immanant idea.\n  Second, we provide a novel proof via Chevalley operations of Lam's\nlog-supermodularity of Plucker coordinates. This has several consequences: (a)\nEach positroid, corresponding to the positroid cells in Postnikov's\ndecomposition of the TNN Grassmannian, is a distributive lattice. (b) It also\nyields numerical positivity in the main result of Lam-Postnikov-Pylyavskyy. (c)\nWe show the coordinatewise monotonicity of ratios of Schur polynomials, first\nproved by Khare-Tao and which is the key result they use to obtain quantitative\nestimates for positivity preservers.\n  Third, we employ Chevalley operations to show that the majorization order\nover partitions implicates a partial order for induced character immanants over\nTNN matrices, proved originally by Skandera-Soskin.",

    "abstract": "Masked language modelling (MLM) as a pretraining objective has been widely\nadopted in genomic sequence modelling. While pretrained models can successfully\nserve as encoders for various downstream tasks, the distribution shift between\npretraining and inference detrimentally impacts performance, as the pretraining\ntask is to map [MASK] tokens to predictions, yet the [MASK] is absent during\ndownstream applications. This means the encoder does not prioritize its\nencodings of non-[MASK] tokens, and expends parameters and compute on work only\nrelevant to the MLM task, despite this being irrelevant at deployment time. In\nthis work, we propose a modified encoder-decoder architecture based on the\nmasked autoencoder framework, designed to address this inefficiency within a\nBERT-based transformer. We empirically show that the resulting mismatch is\nparticularly detrimental in genomic pipelines where models are often used for\nfeature extraction without fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach on the\nBIOSCAN-5M dataset, comprising over 2 million unique DNA barcodes. We achieve\nsubstantial performance gains in both closed-world and open-world\nclassification tasks when compared against causal models and bidirectional\narchitectures pretrained with MLM tasks.",

    "abstract": "A small fraction of low-mass stars have been found to have anomalously high\nLi abundances. Although it has been suggested that mixing during the red giant\nbranch phase can lead to Li production, this method of intrinsic Li production\ncannot explain Li-rich stars that have not yet undergone the first dredge-up.\nTo obtain clues about the origin of such stars, we present a detailed chemical\nabundance analysis of four unevolved Li-rich stars with $-2.1 < [\\mathrm{Fe/H}]\n< -1.3$ and $2.9<A({\\rm Li})<3.6$, $0.7-1.4$ dex higher Li abundance than\ntypical unevolved metal-poor stars. One of the stars, Gaia DR3\n6334970766103389824 (D25_6334), was serendipitously found in the stellar stream\nED-3, and the other three stars have been reported to have massive ($M\\gtrsim\n1.3\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) non-luminous companions. We show that three of the four\nstars exhibit abundance patterns similar to those of known unevolved Li-rich\nstars, namely normal abundances in most elements except for Li and Na. These\nabundance similarities suggest a common origin for the unevolved Li-rich stars\nand low-mass metal-poor stars with massive compact companions. We also made the\nfirst detection of N abundance to unevolved Li-rich stars in D25_6334, and\nfound that it is significantly enhanced ($[\\mathrm{N/Fe}]=1.3$). The observed\nabundance pattern of D25_6334, spanning from C to Si, indicates that its\nsurface has been polluted by an intermediate-mass former companion star or a\nnova system that involves a massive ONe white dwarf. Using a population\nsynthesis model, we show that the nova scenario can lead to the observed level\nof Li enhancement and also provide an explanation for Li-rich stars without\ncompanions and those with massive compact companions.",

GPUs are still the\ndominant platform for DL applications, relying on a bulk-synchronous execution\nmodel which has many drawbacks and is ill-suited for the graph structure of DL\napplications. Many industry and academic works attempt to overcome these by\nemploying vertical fusion but this approach still fails to realize three\nuntapped opportunities: (1) the fact that many resources on the GPU are idle\nwhile only one operator executes due to temporal multiplexing of the SM; (2)\nlower energy from more intelligent on-chip data-movement which lends to higher\nperformance in a power-provisioned environment. (3) inability to exploit hidden\nor reduction dimensions as a source of parallelism to ease pressure on batch\nsize.

Within the broad family of GLMs, those with binary\noutcomes, which include logistic and probit regressions, are motivated by\ncommon tasks such as binary classification with (possibly) non-separable data.\nIn addition, in modern machine learning and statistics, data is often\nhigh-dimensional yet has a low intrinsic dimension, making sparsity constraints\nin models another reasonable consideration. In this work, we propose to use and\nanalyze an iterative hard thresholding (projected gradient descent on the ReLU\nloss) algorithm, called binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT), for\nparameter estimation in sparse GLMs with binary outcomes. We establish that\nBIHT is statistically efficient and converges to the correct solution for\nparameter estimation in a general class of sparse binary GLMs. Unlike many\nother methods for learning GLMs, including maximum likelihood estimation,\ngeneralized approximate message passing, and GLM-tron (Kakade et al. 2011;\nBahmani et al. 2016), BIHT does not require knowledge of the GLM's link\nfunction, offering flexibility and generality in allowing the algorithm to\nlearn arbitrary binary GLMs. As two applications, logistic and probit\nregression are additionally studied. In this regard, it is shown that in\nlogistic regression, the algorithm is in fact statistically optimal in the\nsense that the order-wise sample complexity matches (up to logarithmic factors)\nthe lower bound obtained previously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work achieving statistical optimality for logistic regression in all\nnoise regimes with a computationally efficient algorithm.

The\ngenerated network forms the soft matrix phase of the composites, while the\nareas enclosed by the network form the stiff reinforcing particles. At low\ncoordination, composites feature highly polydisperse particles with irregular\ngeometries, which are arranged non-periodically. In response to loading, these\nparticles interlock with each other and primarily rotate and deform to\naccommodate non-uniform kinematic constraints from adjacent particles.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been interest in representing single graphs by multiple\ndrawings; for example, using graph stories, storyplans, or uncrossed\ncollections. In this paper, we apply this idea to orthogonal graph drawing. Due\nto the orthogonal drawing style, we focus on 4-graphs, that is, graphs of\nmaximum degree 4. We restrict ourselves to plane graphs, that is, planar graphs\nwhose embedding is fixed. Our goal is to represent any plane 4-graph $G$ by an\nunbent collection, that is, a collection of orthogonal drawings of $G$ that\nadhere to the embedding of $G$ and ensure that each edge of $G$ is drawn\nwithout bends in at least one of the drawings. We investigate two objectives.\nFirst, we consider minimizing the number of drawings in an unbent collection.\nWe prove that every plane 4-graph can be represented by a collection with at\nmost three drawings, which is tight. We also give necessary and sufficient\nconditions for a graph to admit an unbent collection of size $2$. Second, we\nconsider minimizing the total number of bends over all drawings in an unbent\ncollection. We show that this problem is NP-hard and give a 3-approximation\nalgorithm. For the special case of plane triconnected cubic graphs, we show how\nto compute minimum-bend collections in linear time.",

Current UQ methods\ntypically rely on querying the model multiple times using non-zero temperature\nsampling to generate diverse outputs for uncertainty estimation. However, the\nimpact of selecting a given temperature parameter is understudied, and our\nanalysis reveals that temperature plays a fundamental role in the quality of\nuncertainty estimates. The conventional approach of identifying optimal\ntemperature values requires expensive hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that\nmust be repeated for each new model-dataset combination. We propose Monte Carlo\nTemperature (MCT), a robust sampling strategy that eliminates the need for\ntemperature calibration. Our analysis reveals that: 1) MCT provides more robust\nuncertainty estimates across a wide range of temperatures, 2) MCT improves the\nperformance of UQ methods by replacing fixed-temperature strategies that do not\nrely on HPO, and 3) MCT achieves statistical parity with oracle temperatures,\nwhich represent the ideal outcome of a well-tuned but computationally expensive\nHPO process.

In this article, we\ntheoretically investigate the nature of the state at $\\nu{=}1/6$ as a function\nof the quantum well width and the density by considering composite-fermion (CF)\ncrystals, CF Fermi sea, and various kinds of paired CF states. The $f$-wave\npaired state has the lowest energy among the paired CF states. However, for\nparameters of interest, the energies of the CF crystal, the CF Fermi liquid,\nand the $f$-wave paired CF state are too close to call. We, therefore, predict\nthat {\\it if} the FQHE at $\\nu{=}1/6$ is experimentally confirmed, this state\nwould be an $f$-wave paired state of CFs, which can be verified by measurement\nof its thermal Hall conductance. Exact diagonalization studies for systems with\nup to 8 electrons show that the ground states at $\\nu{=}n/(6n{\\pm} 1)$ are\nincompressible for all widths and densities we have considered and well\ndescribed by the corresponding Laughlin and Jain states. We propose a phase\ndiagram for large quantum well widths and densities in which at zero disorder,\nincompressible FQHE states are stabilized at $\\nu{=}n/(6n{\\pm} 1)$ and\n$\\nu{=}1/6$, but in between these fillings the CF crystal is stabilized. With\ndisorder, which creates a spatial variation in the filling factor, two regimes\nare identified: (i) for small disorder, when the incompressible states\npercolate at the special fillings, FQHE with quantized Hall plateaus and\nvanishing longitudinal resistance should occur; and (ii) for larger disorder,\nwhen the CF crystal percolates, the longitudinal resistance rises with\ndecreasing temperature but the domains of FQHE liquid produce minima at the\nspecial filling factors.

To bridge\nthese perspectives, we heed the physical origin of slip phenomenon by employing\nenergy minimization principles to establish a force balance between solid-fluid\nfriction, thermodynamic force, and viscous stress at the fluid-solid contact\nregion. Our analysis reveals that slip is an intrinsic property, just like\nmolecular surface diffusion, is also governedfluid-solid intermolecular\ninteractions.

    "abstract": "The crystal structure determines many of the physical properties of oxide\nperovskites (ABO$_3$) and only a tiny modification of the lattice structure\ncauses major changes in the functional properties through the interplay among\nspin, orbital and charge orders. The determination of characteristic\ndistortions and symmetries is a valuable asset for understanding the\nstructure-properties relationship and guiding the design of epitaxial oxide\nheterostructures, where electron degrees of freedom and correlated electronic\nstates can be tailored. Even until new phases, otherwise absent in bulk\nmaterials, may appear. Here, we report on the in-depth structural\ncharacterization of 50~nm-LaVO$_3$ thin film grown onto (110)-oriented\nDyScO$_3$ by molecular beam epitaxy. We have investigated the heterostructure\nby means of x-ray diffraction, high-resolution and scanning transmission\nelectron microscopies, scanning precession electron diffraction tomography and\nfirst-principle calculations. LaVO$_3$ crystallizes in the orthorhombic $Pbnm$\nspace group and is constrained by the substrate, which imposes a growth along\nthe $[110]$ orthorhombic direction, over the 140 deposited unit cells. The\nmapping of the reciprocal space allows determining the orientation of the film\nand refining the lattice parameters. Using scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy, we analyzed the structure of LaVO$_3$, focusing on the\ndetermination of the antipolar displacement of the rare earth.

However, their stringent symmetry requirements hinder practical\nintegration, especially in acoustic and electromechanical systems where\nefficient mode excitation is challenging. Here, we demonstrate deployable\nnanoelectromechanical quasi-BICs on suspended lithium niobate (LiNbO3) thin\nfilms, enabled by nanoscale Lamb wave phononic crystals (PnCs) operating at\ngigahertz frequencies. By exploiting the decoupling of symmetric (S) and\nantisymmetric (A) Lamb wave modes, we create a robust framework for BICs.\nControlled mirror symmetry breaking induces targeted coupling between the S and\nA modes, resulting in quasi-BICs that preserve high-Q characteristics and can\nbe excited by traveling waves, eliminating the need for specialized excitation\nschemes. Our approach enables the multiplexing of quasi-BIC resonators along a\nsingle transmission line, each corresponding to a unique frequency and spatial\nposition. This work presents a scalable route for the on-chip integration of\nBICs, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical\nnanoelectromechanical devices, and opening new avenues in advanced signal\nprocessing, high-precision sensing, and quantum acoustics.",

This will bring fresh perspectives to\nestablished tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion\ntracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition -- particularly for the\nlower body, which is typically occluded.\n  In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras\nthat generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives\nacross a wearer's body. A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion\ncapture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with\narm- or leg-worn cameras. In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of\negocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D\nposes during several activities: 119 hours of data are derived from AMASS\nmotion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment\nwith 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro\ncameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit.\n  We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D\npose estimation network.

A\nlayer-wise fabrication process, facilitated by stackable trays, allows for the\ndeposition of multiple liquid conductive ink layers within a silicone matrix.\nTo demonstrate the method's capacity for high design flexibility, we fabricate\nand evaluate both capacitive and resistive strain sensor morphologies.\nExperimental characterization showed that the capacitive strain sensor\npossesses high linearity (R^2 = 0.99), high sensitivity near the 1.0\ntheoretical limit (GF = 0.95), minimal hysteresis (DH = 1.36%), and large\nstretchability (550%), comparable to state-of-the-art stretchable strain\nsensors reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "General relativity (GR) is a highly successful theory that describes gravity\nas a geometric phenomenon. The gravitational redshift, a classic test of GR,\ncan potentially be violated in alternative gravity theories, and experimental\ntests on this effect are crucial for our understanding of gravity. In this\npaper, considering the space-ground clock comparisons with free-space links, we\ndiscuss a high-precision Doppler cancellation-based measurement model for\ntesting gravitational redshift. This model can effectively reduce various\nsources of error and noise, reducing the influences of the first-order Doppler\neffect, atmospheric delay, Shapiro delay, etc. China's Lunar Exploration\nProject (CLEP) is proposed to equip the deep-space H maser with a daily\nstability of $2\\times10^{-15}$, which provides an approach for testing\ngravitational redshift. Based on the simulation, we analyze the space-ground\nclock comparison experiments of the CLEP experiment, and simulation analysis\ndemonstrates that under ideal condition of high-precision measurement of the\nonboard H-maser frequency offset and drift, the CLEP experiment may reach the\nuncertainty of $3.7\\times10^{-6}$ after a measurement session of 60 days. Our\nresults demonstrate that if the issue of frequency offset and drift is solved,\nCLEP missions have a potential of testing the gravitational redshift with high\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "The estimation of properties of quantum states -- such as entanglement -- is\na core need for the development of quantum technologies, yet remaining a\ndemanding challenge. Standard approaches to property estimation rely on the\nmodeling of the measurement apparatus and, often, a priori assumptions on their\nworking principles. Even small deviations can greatly affect reconstruction\naccuracy and prediction reliability. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been\nproven promising to overcome these difficulties. However, interpretability\nissues related to overfitting limit the usefulness of existing ML methods when\nhigh precision is requested. Here, we demonstrate that quantum extreme learning\nmachines (QELMs) embody a powerful alternative for witnessing quantum\nentanglement and, more generally, for estimating features of experimental\nquantum states. We implement a photonic QELM that leverages the orbital angular\nmomentum of photon pairs as an ancillary degree of freedom to enable\ninformationally complete single-setting measurements of the entanglement shared\nby their polarization degrees of freedom. Unlike conventional methods, our\napproach does not require fine-tuning, precise calibration, or refined\nknowledge of the apparatus. In contrast, it automatically adapts to noise and\nimprecisions while avoiding overfitting, thus ensuring the robust\nreconstruction of entanglement witnesses and paving the way to the assessment\nof quantum features of experimental multi-party states.",

An alternative Eulerian fluid formulation of electron energization\nwas recently used to study electron energization during magnetic reconnection\nin the absence of magnetic islands. Here, we use particle-in-cell simulations\nto compare the Eulerian and Lagrangian models of electron energization in a\nsetup where reconnection leads to magnetic island formation. We find the\nlargest energization at the edges of magnetic islands. There, energization\nrelated to the diamagnetic drift dominates in the Eulerian model, while the\nFermi related term dominates in the Lagrangian model. The models predict\nsignificantly different energization rates locally. A better agreement is found\nafter integrating over the simulation domain. We show that strong magnetic\ncurvature can break the magnetic moment conservation assumed by the Lagrangian\nmodel, leading to erroneous results. The Eulerian fluid model is a complete\nfluid description and accurately models bulk energization. However, local\nmeasurements of its constituent energization terms need not reflect locations\nwhere plasma is heated or accelerated. The Lagrangian guiding center model can\naccurately describe the energization of particles, but it cannot describe the\nevolution of the fluid energy.

Graph reconstruction, verification, and property testing are all types\nof graph inference.\n  In this work, we study graph inference using an oracle that returns the\neffective resistance (ER) between a pair of vertices. Effective resistance is a\ndistance originating from the study of electrical circuits with many\napplications. However, ER has received little attention from a graph inference\nperspective. Indeed, although it is known that an $n$-vertex graph can be\nuniquely reconstructed from all $\\binom{n}{2}$ possible ER queries, little else\nis known. We address this gap with several new results, including:\n  1. $O(n)$-query algorithms for testing whether a graph is a tree; deciding\nwhether two graphs are equal assuming one is a subgraph of the other; and\ntesting whether a given vertex (or edge) is a cut vertex (or cut edge).\n  2. Property testing algorithms, including for testing whether a graph is\nvertex- or edge-biconnected.

We\nfocus on distinguishing an RGG from an Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi (ER) graph if both\nmodels have edge probability $p$. So far, most results considered either\nspherical RGGs with $L_2$-distance or toroidal RGGs under $L_\\infty$-distance.\nHowever, for general $L_q$-distances, many questions remain open, especially if\n$p$ is allowed to depend on $n$. The main reason for this is that RGGs under\n$L_q$-distances can not easily be represented as the logical AND of their\n1-dimensional counterparts, as for $L_\\infty$ geometries. To overcome this, we\ndevise a novel technique for quantifying the dependence between edges based on\nmodified Edgeworth expansions.\n  Our technique yields the first tight algorithmic upper bounds for\ndistinguishing toroidal RGGs under general $L_q$ norms from ER-graphs for fixed\n$p$ and $q$. We achieve this by showing that signed triangles can distinguish\nthe two models when $d\\ll n^3p^3$ for the whole regime of $c/n<p<1$.\nAdditionally, our technique yields an improved information-theoretic lower\nbound for this task, showing that the two distributions converge whenever\n$d=\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^3p^2)$, which is just as strong as the currently best known\nlower bound for spherical RGGs in case of general $p$ from Liu et al.\n[STOC'22]. Finally, our expansions allow us to tightly characterize the\nspectral properties of toroidal RGGs both under $L_q$-distances for fixed $1\\le\nq<\\infty$, and $L_\\infty$-distance. Our results partially resolve a conjecture\nof Bangachev and Bresler [COLT'24] and prove that the distance metric, rather\nthan the underlying space, is responsible for the observed differences in the\nbehavior of spherical and toroidal RGGs.",

One example is quantum key\ndistribution (QKD), an application that has matured to commercial use in recent\nyears. However, difficulties remain, especially with noise resilience and\nchannel capacity in long-distance communication. One way to overcome these\nproblems is to use high-dimensional entanglement, which has been shown to be\nmore robust to noise and enables higher secret-key rates. It is therefore\nimportant to have access to certifiable high-dimensional entanglement sources\nto confidently implement these advanced QKD protocols. Here, we develop a\nmethod for certifying high-dimensional time-bin entanglement in fiber-loop\nsystems. In these systems, entanglement creation and detection can utilize the\nsame physical components, and the number of time bins, and thus the\nentanglement dimension, can be adapted without making physical changes to the\nsetup. Our certification method builds on previous proposals for the\ncertification of angular-momentum entanglement in photon pairs. In particular,\nmeasurements in only two experimentally accessible bases are sufficient to\nobtain a lower bound on the entanglement dimension for both two- and\nmultiphoton quantum states. Numerical simulations show that the method is\nrobust against typical experimental noise effects and works well even with\nlimited measurement statistics, thus establishing time-bin encoded photons as a\npromising platform for high-dimensional quantum-communication protocols.",

We analyze the associated Nash system, which consists of a system\nof coupled nonlinear partial differential equations, and establish the\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions to this system, thereby proving the\nexistence of a unique Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we examine the mean field\ngame problem under the same regime-switching framework.

This variability is notably related to Global Dust\nStorms (GDS) which occur only certain years with different onset, duration and\nintensity. The interannual variabilities of the dust cycle may notably explain\nsome characteristics of Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL), slope flows once thought\nto be caused by liquid water. Long-term monitoring of dust dynamics is thus\nrequired to better understand surface-atmosphere dust exchanges on Mars. Here\nwe present a new method to detect atmospheric dust as a function of space and\ntime in the OMEGA Near-InfraRed (NIR) dataset. This dataset covers more than\nthree Martian years; it includes the 2007 GDS which seasonality differs from\nthe preceding (2001) and later (2018) GDS. The method is based on the decrease\nof the atmospheric optical path caused by dust, that can be measured by OMEGA\nwith the 2 $\\mu$m CO$_2$ absorption band. This measure is converted to a 0.9\n$\\mu$m NIR dust optical depth using notably comparisons with Mars Exploration\nRovers measurements. We derive dust optical depth maps and comment on the\nvariability of the dust seasonal cycle before, during and after the 2007 GDS.\nWe also compare OMEGA NIR optical depths to Thermal InfraRed (TIR) ones derived\nby other studies. We found a NIR/TIR dust extinction optical depth ratio of 1.8\non average, with some variations notably related to dust particle size.\nFinally, we show in the northern hemisphere that atmospheric dust and RSL\nactivity is correlated.

When using chain-of-thought on 3 MMLU\ndatasets, the performance drop for the WiCkeD variant is similar to the one\nobserved when using the LLMs directly, showing that WiCkeD is also challenging\nfor models with enhanced reasoning abilities. WiCkeD also uncovers that some\nmodels are more sensitive to the extra reasoning required, providing additional\ninformation with respect to the original benchmarks.

To tackle this\nchallenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual\nreinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model.

The proposed approach is\nvalidated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating\nsuperior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure\nforce-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned\npolicy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability\nprofiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability.

    "abstract": "In this note, we examine the aggregation of preferences achieved by the Group\nPolicy Optimisation (GRPO) algorithm, a reinforcement learning method used to\ntrain advanced artificial intelligence models such as DeepSeek-R1-Zero and\nDeepSeekMath. The GRPO algorithm trains a policy using a reward preference\nmodel, which is computed by sampling a set of outputs for a given context,\nobserving the corresponding rewards, and applying shift-and-scale normalisation\nto these reward values. Additionally, it incorporates a penalty function to\ndiscourage deviations from a reference policy.\n  We present a framework that enables us to characterise the stationary\npolicies of the GRPO algorithm. This analysis reveals that the aggregation of\npreferences differs fundamentally from standard logarithmic pooling, which is\nimplemented by other approaches such as RLHF. The precise form of preference\naggregation arises from the way the reward preference model is defined and from\nthe penalty function, which we show to essentially correspond to the reverse\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the aggregation policy and the\nreference policy.\n  Interestingly, we demonstrate that for groups of size two, the reward\npreference model corresponds to pairwise comparison preferences, similar to\nthose in other alignment methods based on pairwise comparison feedback. We\nprovide explicit characterisations of the aggregate preference for binary\nquestions, for groups of size two, and in the limit of large group size. This\nprovides insights into the dependence of the aggregate preference on parameters\nsuch as the regularisation constant and the confidence margin of question\nanswers.\n  Finally, we discuss the aggregation of preferences obtained by modifying the\nGRPO algorithm to use direct KL divergence as the penalty or to use rewards\nwithout scale normalisation.",

As artificial\nintelligence continues to evolve, its ability to synthesise realistic content\nemerges as a threat in the hands of cybercriminals who seek to manipulate and\nmisrepresent the truth. Such synthetic content introduces a non-trivial risk of\noverwriting the subtle changes made for the purpose of steganography. When the\nsignals in both the spatial and temporal domains are vulnerable to unforeseen\noverwriting, it calls for reflection on what, if any, remains invariant. This\nstudy proposes a paradigm in steganography for audiovisual media, where\nmessages are concealed beyond both spatial and temporal domains. A chain of\nmultimodal artificial intelligence is developed to deconstruct audiovisual\ncontent into a cover text, embed a message within the linguistic domain, and\nthen reconstruct the audiovisual content through synchronising both auditory\nand visual modalities with the resultant stego text. The message is encoded by\nbiasing the word sampling process of a language generation model and decoded by\nanalysing the probability distribution of word choices. The accuracy of message\ntransmission is evaluated under both zero-bit and multi-bit capacity settings.\nFidelity is assessed through both biometric and semantic similarities,\ncapturing the identities of the recorded face and voice, as well as the core\nideas conveyed through the media. Secrecy is examined through statistical\ncomparisons between cover and stego texts.

A mass spectrometry-based approach was used to analyze the\nplasma proteins in the enrolled subjects. Subsequently, using recursive feature\nelimination (RFE) classification and cross-validation with a vector classifier,\nan association of these proteins in patients with sepsis compared to patients\nwith NISIRS. The protein-protein interaction network was analyzed with String\nsoftware.\n  Results: A total of 277 patients (141 with sepsis and 136 with NISIRS) were\nincluded. After performing RFE, 25 proteins in the study patient cohort showed\nstatistical significance, with an accuracy of 0.960, specificity of 0.920,\nsensitivity of 0.973, and an AUC of 0.985. Of these, 14 proteins (vWF, PPBP,\nC5, C1RL, FCN3, SAA2, ORM1, ITIH3, GSN, C1QA, CA1, CFB, C3, LBP) have a greater\nrelationship with sepsis while 11 proteins (FN1, IGFALS, SERPINA4, APOE, APOH,\nC6, SERPINA3, AHSG, LUM, ITIH2, SAA1) are more expressed in NISIRS.",

Due to the high cost of training such\nencoders, pre-trained encoders are widely shared and deployed into many LVLMs,\nwhich are security-critical or bear societal significance. Under this practical\nscenario, we reveal a new backdoor threat that significant visual\nhallucinations can be induced into these LVLMs by merely compromising vision\nencoders. Because of the sharing and reuse of these encoders, many downstream\nLVLMs may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders, leading to widespread\nbackdoors. In this work, we propose BadVision, the first method to exploit this\nvulnerability in SSL vision encoders for LVLMs with novel trigger optimization\nand backdoor learning techniques. We evaluate BadVision on two types of SSL\nencoders and LVLMs across eight benchmarks. We show that BadVision effectively\ndrives the LVLMs to attacker-chosen hallucination with over 99% attack success\nrate, causing a 77.6% relative visual understanding error while maintaining the\nstealthiness.

    "abstract": "Graph similarity learning, crucial for tasks such as graph classification and\nsimilarity search, focuses on measuring the similarity between two\ngraph-structured entities. The core challenge in this field is effectively\nmanaging the interactions between graphs. Traditional methods often entail\nseparate, redundant computations for each graph pair, leading to unnecessary\ncomplexity. This paper revolutionizes the approach by introducing a parallel\ngraph interaction method called graph fusion. By merging the node sequences of\ngraph pairs into a single large graph, our method leverages a global attention\nmechanism to facilitate interaction computations and to harvest cross-graph\ninsights. We further assess the similarity between graph pairs at two distinct\nlevels-graph-level and node-level-introducing two innovative, yet\nstraightforward, similarity computation algorithms. Extensive testing across\nfive public datasets shows that our model not only outperforms leading baseline\nmodels in graph-to-graph classification and regression tasks but also sets a\nnew benchmark for performance and efficiency.

In this paper, we propose Yoimiya, a scalable\nframework with pipeline, to optimize the efficiency in ZK-SNARK systems. First,\nYoimiya introduces an automatic circuit partitioning algorithm that divides\nlarge circuits of ZK-SNARK into smaller subcircuits, the minimal computing\nunits with smaller memory requirement, allowing parallel processing on multiple\nunits. Second, Yoimiya decouples witness generation from proof computation, and\nachieves simultaneous executions over units from multiple circuits. Moreover,\nYoimiya enables each phase scalable separately by configuring the resource\ndistribution to make the time costs of the two phases aligned, maximizing the\nresource utilization. Experimental results confirmed that our framework\neffectively improves the resource utilization and proof generation speed.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), particularly those with reasoning capabilities,\nhave rapidly advanced in recent years, demonstrating significant potential\nacross a wide range of applications. However, their deployment in healthcare,\nespecially in disease reasoning tasks, is hindered by the challenge of\nacquiring expert-level cognitive data. In this paper, we introduce Citrus, a\nmedical language model that bridges the gap between clinical expertise and AI\nreasoning by emulating the cognitive processes of medical experts. The model is\ntrained on a large corpus of simulated expert disease reasoning data,\nsynthesized using a novel approach that accurately captures the decision-making\npathways of clinicians. This approach enables Citrus to better simulate the\ncomplex reasoning processes involved in diagnosing and treating medical\nconditions. To further address the lack of publicly available datasets for\nmedical reasoning tasks, we release the last-stage training data, including a\ncustom-built medical diagnostic dialogue dataset. This open-source contribution\naims to support further research and development in the field. Evaluations\nusing authoritative benchmarks such as MedQA, covering tasks in medical\nreasoning and language understanding, show that Citrus achieves superior\nperformance compared to other models of similar size. These results highlight\nCitrus potential to significantly enhance medical decision support systems,\nproviding a more accurate and efficient tool for clinical decision-making.",

This work investigates\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning as a means to enhance OOD generalization.\nThrough controlled experiments across several compound tasks, we reveal three\nkey insights: (1) While QA-trained models achieve near-perfect in-distribution\naccuracy, their OOD performance degrades catastrophically, even with 10000k+\ntraining examples; (2) the granularity of CoT data strongly correlates with\ngeneralization performance; finer-grained CoT data leads to better\ngeneralization; (3) CoT exhibits remarkable sample efficiency, matching QA\nperformance with much less (even 80%) data.\n  Theoretically, we demonstrate that compound tasks inherently permit shortcuts\nin Q-A data that misalign with true reasoning principles, while CoT forces\ninternalization of valid dependency structures, and thus can achieve better\ngeneralization. Further, we show that transformer positional embeddings can\namplify generalization by emphasizing subtask condition recurrence in long CoT\nsequences.

Analysis of the AIA\nobservations reveals that the plasma flow along this helical coronal loop\nexhibits speeds of 77-384 km s$^{-1}$ and temperatures ranging from 3.46 to\n10.2 MK. Additionally, the densities were estimated to be between 4.3.106 and\n1.55.107 cm-3, with an estimated magnetic field strength of 0.05-0.3 G.\nFollowing the launch of a CME, we find clear evidence for impulsive heating and\nexpansion of plasma that travels a helical trajectory along a set of\npost-eruption loops.

    "abstract": "Low energy excitations of a magnetically ordered system are spin waves with\nmagnon being their excitation quanta. Magnons are demonstrated to be useful for\ndata processing and communication. To achieve magnon transport across extended\ndistances, it is essential to minimize magnonic dissipation which can be\naccomplished by material engineering to reduce intrinsic damping or by spin\ntorques that can counteract damping. This study introduces an alternative\nmethodology to effectively reduce magnon dissipation based on magnonic bound\nstates in the continuum (BIC). We demonstrate the approach for two\nantiferromagnetically coupled magnonic waveguides, with one waveguide being\nattached to a current carrying metallic layer. The current acts on the attached\nwaveguide with a spin-orbit torque effectively amplifying the magnonic signal.\nThe setup maps on a non-Hermitian system with coupled loss and more loss,\nenabling the formation of dissipationless magnon BIC. We investigate the\nnecessary criteria for the formation of magnon BIC through electric currents.\nThe influences of interlayer coupling constant, anisotropy constants and\napplied magnetic field on the current-induced magnon BIC are analyzed. The\nidentified effect can be integrated in the design of magnon delay lines,\noffering opportunities for the enhancement of magnonic devices and circuits.",

Because blockchain storage\nspace is limited, large multimodal data files, such as videos, are often stored\noffline, leaving only lightweight metadata on the chain. While this hybrid\nstorage approach enhances storage efficiency, it introduces significant\nchallenges for executing advanced queries on multimodal data. The metadata\nstored on-chain is often minimal and may not include all the attributes\nnecessary for queries like time range or fuzzy queries. In addition, existing\nblockchains do not provide native support for multimodal data querying.\nAchieving this capability would necessitate extensive modifications to the\nunderlying blockchain framework, even reconstructing its core architecture.\nConsequently, enabling blockchains with multimodal query capabilities remains a\nsignificant problem, which necessitates overcoming the following three key\nchallenges: (1) Designing efficient indexing methods to adapt to varying\nworkloads that involve frequent insertions and query operations; (2) Achieving\nseamless integration with existing blockchains without altering the underlying\ninfrastructure; (3) Ensuring high query performance while minimizing gas\nconsumption. To address these challenges, we propose MulChain, a novel\nmiddleware architecture to enable smooth integration with existing blockchains.\nAt the core of MulChain is the BHashTree, a flexible data structure that\ndynamically switches between tree and hash nodes based on workload\ncharacteristics, ensuring efficient insertion and query operations.\nFurthermore, the middleware provides standardized interfaces for blockchain\nsystems, unifying query methods across different platforms.",

    "abstract": "We propose a minimum distance estimation approach for quantile panel data\nmodels where unit effects may be correlated with covariates. This\ncomputationally efficient method involves two stages: first, computing quantile\nregression within each unit, then applying GMM to the first-stage fitted\nvalues. Our estimators apply to (i) classical panel data, tracking units over\ntime, and (ii) grouped data, where individual-level data are available, but\ntreatment varies at the group level. Depending on the exogeneity assumptions,\nthis approach provides quantile analogs of classic panel data estimators,\nincluding fixed effects, random effects, between, and Hausman-Taylor\nestimators. In addition, our method offers improved precision for grouped\n(instrumental) quantile regression compared to existing estimators. We\nestablish asymptotic properties as the number of units and observations per\nunit jointly diverge to infinity. Additionally, we introduce an inference\nprocedure that automatically adapts to the potentially unknown convergence rate\nof the estimator. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our estimator and\ninference procedure perform well in finite samples, even when the number of\nobservations per unit is moderate. In an empirical application, we examine the\nimpact of the food stamp program on birth weights. We find that the program's\nintroduction increased birth weights predominantly at the lower end of the\ndistribution, highlighting the ability of our method to capture heterogeneous\neffects across the outcome distribution.",

    "abstract": "For the 6G wireless networks, achieving high-performance integrated\nlocalization and communication (ILAC) is critical to unlock the full potential\nof wireless networks. To simultaneously enhance localization and communication\nperformance cost-effectively, this paper proposes sparse multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) based ILAC with nested and co-prime sparse arrays\ndeployed at the base station. Sparse MIMO relaxes the traditional\nhalf-wavelength antenna spacing constraint to enlarge the antenna aperture,\nthus enhancing localization degrees of freedom and providing finer spatial\nresolution. However, it also leads to undesired grating lobes, which may cause\nsevere inter-user interference for communication and angular ambiguity for\nlocalization. While the latter issue can be effectively addressed by the\nvirtual array technology, by forming sum or difference co-arrays via signal\n(conjugate) correlation among array elements, it is unclear whether the similar\nvirtual array technology also benefits wireless communications for ILAC\nsystems. In this paper, we first reveal that the answer to the above question\nis negative, by showing that forming virtual arrays for wireless communication\nwill cause destruction of phase information, degradation of signal-to-noise\nratio and aggravation of multi-user interference. Therefore, we propose the\nhybrid processing for sparse MIMO based ILAC, i.e., physical array based\ncommunication while virtual array based localization. To this end, we\ncharacterize the beam pattern of sparse arrays by three metrics, demonstrating\nthat despite of the introduction of grating lobes, sparse arrays can also bring\nbenefits to communications thanks to its narrower main lobe beam width than the\nconventional compact arrays. Extensive simulation results are presented to\ndemonstrate the performance gains of sparse MIMO based ILAC over that based on\nthe conventional compact MIMO.",

Despite recent advances in deep generative\nmodels (DGMs), existing methods often fail to produce realistic datapoints that\nare well-aligned with available background knowledge. In this paper, we address\nthis limitation by introducing Disjunctive Refinement Layer (DRL), a novel\nlayer designed to enforce the alignment of generated data with the background\nknowledge specified in user-defined constraints. DRL is the first method able\nto automatically make deep learning models inherently compliant with\nconstraints as expressive as quantifier-free linear formulas, which can define\nnon-convex and even disconnected spaces. Our experimental analysis shows that\nDRL not only guarantees constraint satisfaction but also improves efficacy in\ndownstream tasks.

Further, it improves\nperformance metrics by up to 21.4% in F1-score and 20.9% in Area Under the ROC\nCurve, thus demonstrating its practical impact on data generation.",

This\nphenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow\nwithout entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the\ntemperature gradient. The experimentally-measured thermal Hall angle in various\ninsulators does not exceed a bound and becomes maximal at the temperature of\npeak longitudinal thermal conductivity. The present paper aims to propose a\nscenario providing and explanation for these two experimental facts. It begins\nby noticing that at this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon\ncollisions become most frequent in comparison with Umklapp and boundary\nscattering events. Furthermore, the Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular\nwave functions are known to acquire a phase in the presence of a magnetic\nfield. In an anharmonic crystal, in which tensile and compressive strain do not\ncancel out, this field-induced atomic phase gives rise to a phonon Berry phase\nand generates phonon-phonon interference. The rough amplitude of the thermal\nHall angle expected in this picture is set by the phonon wavelength,\n$\\lambda_{ph}$, and the crest atomic displacement, $\\delta u_m$ at $T_{max}$.\nThe derived expression is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally\nfound in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.",

Leveraging computationally efficient\nalgorithms, JuliaGrid solves large-scale systems across all SE routines with\ncompetitive execution times compared to other open-source frameworks. These\ncapabilities are validated through simulations on power systems with 10000,\n20000 and 70000 buses.",

It is even a more complicated situation, when these data usually are\nmulti-label. In this paper, we propose an approach based on evidential deep\nlearning in order to meet these challenges applied to visual recognition\nproblems.

In principle, from specific to general mammal pose estimation,\nthe biggest issue is how to address the huge appearance and pose variances for\ndifferent species.

Instead of introducing external visual/text prompts, we devise\nkeypoints clustering to generate body part biases, aligning them with image\ncontext to generate corresponding instance-level prompts. Second, we propose a\nnovel interactive transformer that takes feature slices as input tokens without\nperforming spatial splitting.

In 1932, Fermi introduced the\ntwo-atom problem, which is a Gedanken-experiment that explores how two atoms\ninteract with the surrounding electromagnetic field via vacuum and\nsource-radiation induced processes, providing fundamental insights into the\nbehavior of quantum fields [5-9]. Recent advancements in ultrafast optics have\nenabled experimental analogues of this system using two laser pulses inside a\nnonlinear crystal [10-12]. Here, we demonstrate the detection of vacuum and\nsource radiation induced correlations, separated by their causal properties,\nbetween two laser pulses. In particular, we show that vacuum fluctuations and\nsource radiation correlate different quadratures of near-infrared laser pulses,\nallowing them to be individually probed through phase-sensitive detection. This\nresult provides an experimental verification of the time-domain\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem at the quantum level and offers a novel path to\nstudying quantum radiation effects in time-dependent media. Beyond resolving a\nlongstanding theoretical ambiguity, our findings open new possibilities for\ninvestigating quantum field phenomena in the context of relativistic quantum\ninformation such as entanglement harvesting from the quantum vacuum or quantum\nfield detection in analogues of curved space-times.",

An algorithm that is similar to the Kalman filter but robust to\noutliers is derived in this report. This algorithm -- called the normal\nvariance mixture filter (NVMF) -- replaces the Gaussian distribution for the\nnoise in the Kalman filter measurement model with a normal variance mixture\ndistribution that admits heavier tails. Choice of the mixing density determines\nthe complexity and performance of the NVMF. When the mixing density is the\nDirac delta function, the NVMF is equivalent to the Kalman filter. Choice of an\ninverse gamma mixing density leads to closed-form recursions for the state\nestimate and its error covariance matrix that are robust to outliers. The NVMF\nis compared to the benchmark probabilistic data association filter (PDAF), as\nwell as two other robust filters from the recent literature, for a simulated\nexample.

Furthermore, the\nparameters that distinguish RVE from $\\Lambda$CDM are fixed once the parameter\nof $f(R,T)$ gravity, $\\lambda$, is known. To illustrate our setup, we perform a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of three interaction scenarios using a\ncombination of different data. we find that the parameters characterizing the\nRVE model are very small as expected. These results give an accuracy to this\nequivalence between $f(R,T)$ gravity under consideration and support the recent\nresult obtained from a quantum field theory in curved space-time point of view\nwhich could open a new relationship between $f(R,T)$ gravity and quantum field\ntheory.

Our\nmodel-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors\nof atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor\ndensity of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching.\nCasting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we\nshow free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor\nentropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign\nrequires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel,\nreducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing\nlightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free\nenergy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds\nof CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential\nvariations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty\nquantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic\nintegration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15\nphases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the\nstringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase\nprediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors.

Here, we propose a mechanism to realize\ntriferroic order coexistence and multiple types of valley polarization by\nstructural phase transition in two-dimensional (2D) materials. The 1T and 2H\nphase OsBr2 monolayers exhibit non-magnetic semiconductor and ferromagnetic\nsemiconductor with valley polarization up to 175.49 meV, respectively.\nInterestingly, the 1T phase OsBr2 bilayer shows the tri-state valley\npolarization due to lattice symmetry breaking, while the valley polarization of\n2H phase bilayer originates from the combined effect of time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, the valley polarization and\nferroelectric polarization of 1T phase AB stackings and 2H phase AA stackings\ncan be manipulated via interlayer sliding. Importantly, we have verified that\nthe 2H phase can be transformed to 1T phase by Li+ ion intercalation, while the\n2H phase can occur the structural phase transition into the 1T phase by\ninfrared laser induction.

Common\napproaches to BSS, including independent vector analysis (IVA), and independent\nlow-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA), typically rely on second-order models to\ncapture the statistical independence of source signals for separation. However,\nthese methods generally do not account for the implicit structural information\nacross frequency bands, which may lead to model mismatches between the assumed\nsource distributions and the distributions of the separated source signals\nestimated from the observed mixtures. To tackle these limitations, this paper\nshows that conventional approaches such as IVA and ILRMA can easily be\nleveraged by the Sinkhorn divergence, incorporating an optimal transport (OT)\nframework to adaptively correct source variance estimates. This allows for the\nrecovery of the source distribution while modeling the inter-band signal\ndependence and reallocating source power across bands.

The three\ncore challenges of layout-aware IE with LLMs are 1) data structuring, 2) model\nengagement, and 3) output refinement. Our study investigates the sub-problems\nand methods within these core challenges, such as input representation,\nchunking, prompting, selection of LLMs, and multimodal models. It examines the\neffect of different design choices through LayIE-LLM, a new, open-source,\nlayout-aware IE test suite, benchmarking against traditional, fine-tuned IE\nmodels. The results on two IE datasets show that LLMs require adjustment of the\nIE pipeline to achieve competitive performance: the optimized configuration\nfound with LayIE-LLM achieves 13.3--37.5 F1 points more than a general-practice\nbaseline configuration using the same LLM. To find a well-working\nconfiguration, we develop a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method that achieves\nnear-optimal results. Our method is only 0.8--1.8 points lower than the best\nfull factorial exploration with a fraction (2.8%) of the required computation.\nOverall, we demonstrate that, if well-configured, general-purpose LLMs match\nthe performance of specialized models, providing a cost-effective,\nfinetuning-free alternative.

    "abstract": "The execution of Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) orders remains a\ncritical challenge in modern financial markets, particularly as trading volumes\nand market complexity continue to increase. In my previous work\narXiv:2502.13722, I introduced a novel deep learning approach that demonstrated\nsignificant improvements over traditional VWAP execution methods by directly\noptimizing the execution problem rather than relying on volume curve\npredictions. However, that model was static because it employed the fully\nlinear approach described in arXiv:2410.21448, which is not designed for\ndynamic adjustment. This paper extends that foundation by developing a dynamic\nneural VWAP framework that adapts to evolving market conditions in real time.\nWe introduce two key innovations: first, the integration of recurrent neural\nnetworks to capture complex temporal dependencies in market dynamics, and\nsecond, a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously\noptimizes execution decisions based on market feedback. The empirical analysis,\nconducted across five major cryptocurrency markets, demonstrates that this\ndynamic approach achieves substantial improvements over both traditional\nmethods and our previous static implementation, with execution performance\ngains of 10 to 15% in liquid markets and consistent outperformance across\nvarying conditions. These results suggest that adaptive neural architectures\ncan effectively address the challenges of modern VWAP execution while\nmaintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.",

We ground our work on CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained encoder\nmodel that can perform zero-shot classification by matching an image with text\nprompts ``a photo of a <class-name>.''. Purification is the path we choose\nsince it does not require adversarial training on specific attack types and\nthus can cope with any foreseen attacks. We then formulate purification risk as\nthe KL divergence between the joint distributions of the purification process\nof denoising the adversarial samples and the attack process of adding\nperturbations to benign samples, through bidirectional Stochastic Differential\nEquations (SDEs). The final derived results inspire us to explore purification\nin the multi-modal latent space of CLIP. We propose two variants for our\nCLIPure approach: CLIPure-Diff which models the likelihood of images' latent\nvectors with the DiffusionPrior module in DaLLE-2 (modeling the generation\nprocess of CLIP's latent vectors), and CLIPure-Cos which models the likelihood\nwith the cosine similarity between the embeddings of an image and ``a photo of\na.''. As far as we know, CLIPure is the first purification method in\nmulti-modal latent space and CLIPure-Cos is the first purification method that\nis not based on generative models, which substantially improves defense\nefficiency. We conducted extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and 13\ndatasets that previous CLIP-based defense methods used for evaluating zero-shot\nclassification robustness. Results show that CLIPure boosts the SOTA robustness\nby a large margin, e.g., from 71.7% to 91.1% on CIFAR10, from 59.6% to 72.6% on\nImageNet, and 108% relative improvements of average robustness on the 13\ndatasets over previous SOTA.

Technically, building on the proposed\nBennett-type inequality, we propose a new Talagrand-type inequality for the\nempirical process, and further develop a new analytical framework of the local\nfractional Rademacher complexity to enhance generalization analyses in MTL with\nmulti-graph dependent data. Finally, we apply the theoretical advancements to\napplications such as Macro-AUC optimization, illustrating the superiority of\nour theoretical results over prior work, which is also verified by experimental\nresults.",

Nine align\nwith the period-luminosity relation for fundamental-mode anomalous Cepheids\n(ACEPs), and only one (BL Bo\\\"otis) follows the relation for first-overtone\nACEPs, as determined from observations of ACEPs in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nFor sources in common between our catalog and the OGLE catalog, the\nclassification agrees in 94% of cases. In comparison, for sources shared\nbetween the Gaia Specific Object Study (SOS) and OGLE, the agreement is 74%. In\nthe dense environments of GCs, our analysis shows that the completeness of the\nGaia catalogs for Cepheids is 64% for the SOS and 74% for the classifier of\nvariable stars.

In the future, combining the sample of\nT2CEPs with the precise parallaxes obtained from GCs will strengthen the\ngeometric calibration of a distance ladder based on Population II stars.

Early\nefforts focused on the binary classification of SAR images, while recent\nadvances have enabled pixel-level segmentation, providing greater accuracy and\nspatial resolution. A case study using Sentinel-1 SAR data demonstrates the\neffectiveness of deep learning models for avalanche segmentation, achieving\nsuperior results over traditional methods. We also present an extension of this\nwork, testing recent state-of-the-art segmentation architectures on an expanded\ndataset of over 4,500 annotated SAR images.

This task is extremely\nchallenging due to human-object occlusions and the lack of 3D information in 2D\nimages, often leading to poor detail reconstruction and depth ambiguity. To\naddress these problems, we propose a novel attention-based neural implicit\nmodel that leverages image pixel alignment from both the input human-object\nimage for a global understanding of the human-object scene and from local\nseparate views of the human and object images to improve realism with, for\nexample, clothing details. Additionally, the network is conditioned on semantic\nfeatures derived from an estimated human-object pose prior, which provides 3D\nspatial information about the shared space of humans and objects. To handle\nhuman occlusion caused by objects, we use a generative diffusion model that\ninpaints the occluded regions, recovering otherwise lost details. For training\nand evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset featuring rendered scenes of\ninter-occluded 3D human scans and diverse objects. Extensive evaluation on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the superior quality of the\nproposed human-object reconstructions over competitive methods.",

The extent to which SAEs can help us understand\ncomputations is unclear because they are not designed to \"sparsify\"\ncomputations in any sense, only latent activations. To solve this, we propose\nJacobian SAEs (JSAEs), which yield not only sparsity in the input and output\nactivations of a given model component but also sparsity in the computation\n(formally, the Jacobian) connecting them. With a na\\\"ive implementation, the\nJacobians in LLMs would be computationally intractable due to their size. One\nkey technical contribution is thus finding an efficient way of computing\nJacobians in this setup. We find that JSAEs extract a relatively large degree\nof computational sparsity while preserving downstream LLM performance\napproximately as well as traditional SAEs. We also show that Jacobians are a\nreasonable proxy for computational sparsity because MLPs are approximately\nlinear when rewritten in the JSAE basis. Lastly, we show that JSAEs achieve a\ngreater degree of computational sparsity on pre-trained LLMs than on the\nequivalent randomized LLM. This shows that the sparsity of the computational\ngraph appears to be a property that LLMs learn through training, and suggests\nthat JSAEs might be more suitable for understanding learned transformer\ncomputations than standard SAEs.",

Data\nminimisation and compliance with data protection laws is also an important\nconsideration. Where there are a range of measurements that can be made, some\nmay be more informative and compliant with the overall measurement objective\nthan others. We develop an active sequential inference algorithm that uses the\nlow dimensional representational latent space from a variational autoencoder\n(VAE) to choose which measurement to make next. Our aim is to recover high\ndimensional data by making as few measurements as possible. We adapt the VAE\nencoder to map partial data measurements on to the latent space of the complete\ndata. The algorithm draws samples from this latent space and uses the VAE\ndecoder to generate data conditional on the partial measurements. Estimated\nmeasurements are made on the generated data and fed back through the partial\nVAE encoder to the latent space where they can be evaluated prior to making a\nmeasurement. Starting from no measurements and a normal prior on the latent\nspace, we consider alternative strategies for choosing the next measurement and\nupdating the predictive posterior prior for the next step. The algorithm is\nillustrated using the Fashion MNIST dataset and a novel convolutional Hadamard\npattern measurement basis. We see that useful patterns are chosen within 10\nsteps, leading to the convergence of the guiding generative images. Compared\nwith using stochastic variational inference to infer the parameters of the\nposterior distribution for each generated data point individually, the partial\nVAE framework can efficiently process batches of generated data and obtains\nsuperior results with minimal measurements.",

However, the tight coupling of query\nrewriting to the dense retriever limits its compatibility with hybrid\nretrieval, impeding further RAG performance improvements. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a high-level searcher that decomposes complex queries\ninto atomic queries, independent of any retriever-specific optimizations.\nAdditionally, to harness the strengths of sparse retrievers for precise keyword\nretrieval, we have developed a new sparse searcher that employs Lucene syntax\nto enhance retrieval accuracy.Alongside web and dense searchers, these\ncomponents seamlessly collaborate within our proposed method,\n\\textbf{LevelRAG}.

This approach enhances both the completeness\nand accuracy of the retrieval process, overcoming challenges associated with\ncurrent query rewriting techniques in hybrid retrieval scenarios.

Here we unify both concepts into a novel\nframework of coherent control for light interacting with open photonic systems.\nFrom the QNM perspective, scattered waves are superimposed radiations from all\nQNMs excited, and thus coherent controls can be mapped into another problem of\nQNM excitation manipulations. Within our framework, all incident properties\n(amplitudes, phases and polarizations) of waves from different directions can\nbe exploited simultaneously in a synchronous manner, facilitating independent\nmanipulations of each QNM and thus unlocking enormous flexibilities for\ncoherent controls of both scattering intensity and polarization: (i) A visible\nstructure under a single incident wave can be made invisible through shining\nextra waves; (ii) Along a direction where QNMs' radiation polarizations are\nidentical, scattering along this direction can be fully eliminated, thus\ngeneralizing Kerker effects from a distinct QNM perspective; (iii) Along a\ndirection of distinct QNM radiation polarizations, arbitrary scattering\npolarizations can be obtained. Given the ubiquity and profundity of QNMs and\ncoherent control in almost all branches of wave physics, our framework and its\nunderlying principles will inspire further fundamental explorations and\npractical applications beyond photonics, opening new opportunities for various\nforms of wave-matter interactions.",

    "abstract": "Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations have revealed that most of the solar\nwind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due\nto the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between\nelectrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality\nand zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact\nmechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration has not yet been\nidentified. We aim to provide a framework that incorporates the\nelectric-field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an\nadditional acceleration mechanism via a velocity-space diffusion of the\nparticles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond\nthe electric-field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the\nacceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing\nkinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration\nby including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived\nfrom the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP\nbetween 13.3 and 50 solar radii (Rs) with the electric field found\nself-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space\ndiffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar\nwind acceleration while leaving the electric potential unchanged. The approach\ndescribed in this work enables the diffusion to be adjusted to effectively\nreduce or increase the solar wind acceleration. Even without diffusion, the\nmodel can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the\nsolar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric\npotential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind\nacceleration.",

Owing to their control mechanisms\nand ever-changing operational factors, LAENets are inherently more complex and\nvulnerable to security threats than traditional terrestrial networks. As\napplications of LAENet continue to expand, the robustness of these systems\nbecomes crucial. In this paper, we propose a generative artificial intelligence\n(GenAI) optimization framework that tackles robustness challenges in LAENets.\nWe conduct a systematic analysis of robustness requirements for LAENets,\ncomplemented by a comprehensive review of robust Quality of Service (QoS)\nmetrics from the wireless physical layer perspective. We then investigate\nexisting GenAI-enabled approaches for robustness enhancement. This leads to our\nproposal of a novel diffusion-based optimization framework with a Mixture of\nExperts (MoE)-transformer actor network. In the robust beamforming case study,\nthe proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness by optimizing beamforming\nunder uncertainties, achieving a more than 15% increase over four learning\nbaselines in the worst-case achievable secrecy rate. These findings highlight\nthe significant potential of GenAI in strengthening LAENet robustness.",

Previous studies on single-phase flow demanded\nsignificant pump power to achieve higher CHF, but this approach risked\nexceeding the chip's mechanical limits and complicating packaging. The elevated\njunction temperature (above 175 C) of third-generation semiconductors makes\nthem ideal for two-phase water cooling which utilizes the huge latent heat\nduring boiling of water to minimize the flow rate and maximize the COP. In this\nwork, we designed an embedded hierarchical microchannel heat sink for heat\ntransfer by deionised water two-phase cooling. We observed an unprecedented\nCritical Heat Flux (CHF) of 1682W cm-2 with COP up to 23615 at flow rate of 3.0\nml s-1, which means Only 70 mW of power is needed to take away the heat on the\n1682 W per square centimetre chip, corresponding to a 3-fold increase compared\nto single-phase microchannels with same flowrate. At a high flow rate of 10 ml\ns-1, we even achieved a remarkable heat flux of 2500 W cm-2. This technology is\nanticipated to overcome the bottleneck in electronic thermal management.",

However, the free energy is not generally\ninvariant under the swap of $x$ and $y$; thus, the difference $F_g - F_g^\\vee$\nis nonzero.\n  We derive a new formula for this difference for all $g\\geq 2$ in terms of a\nresidue calculation at the singularities of $x$ and $y$, including cases where\n$x$ and $y$ have logarithmic singularities. For the derivation, we apply recent\ndevelopments from $x$-$y$ duality within the theory of (Logarithmic)\nTopological Recursion. The derived formulas are particularly useful for\nspectral curves with a trivial $x$-$y$ dual side, meaning those with vanishing\n$F_g^\\vee$. In such cases, one obtains an explicit result for $F_{g\\geq 2}$\nitself.\n  We apply this to several classes of spectral curves and prove, for instance,\na recent conjecture by Borot et al. that the free energies $F_g$ computed by\nTopological Recursion for the \"Gaiotto curve\" coincide with the perturbative\npart (in the $\\Omega$-background) of the Nekrasov partition function of\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory.

However, to\nconfidently claim the detection of an individual binary, we need not only more\nand better data, but also more sophisticated analysis techniques. In this\npaper, we develop two new approaches that can help us more robustly ascertain\nif a candidate found by a search algorithm is indeed an individual supermassive\nblack hole binary. One of these is a coherence test that directly compares the\nfull signal model to an incoherent version of that. The other is a model\nscrambling approach that builds null distributions of our detection statistic\nand compares that with the measured value to quantify our confidence in signal\ncoherence. Both of these rely on finding the coherence between pulsars\ncharacteristic to gravitational waves from a binary system. We test these\nmethods on simple simulated datasets and find that they work well in correctly\nidentifying both true gravitational waves and false positives. However, as\nexpected for such a flexible and simple signal model, confidently identifying\nsignal coherence is significantly harder than simply finding a candidate in\nmost scenarios. Our analyses also indicate that the confidence with which we\ncan identify a true signal depends not only on the signal-to-noise ratio, but\nalso on the number of contributing pulsars and the amount of frequency\nevolution shown by the signal.",

Many modern vector databases utilize graph indexes as\ntheir core algorithms, benefiting from various optimizations to enhance search\nperformance. However, the high indexing time associated with graph algorithms\nposes a significant challenge, especially given the increasing volume of data,\nquery processing complexity, and dynamic index maintenance demand. This has\nrendered indexing time a critical performance metric for users. In this paper,\nwe comprehensively analyze the underlying causes of the low graph indexing\nefficiency on modern CPUs, identifying that distance computation dominates\nindexing time, primarily due to high memory access latency and suboptimal\narithmetic operation efficiency. We demonstrate that distance comparisons\nduring index construction can be effectively performed using compact vector\ncodes at an appropriate compression error. Drawing from insights gained through\nintegrating existing compact coding methods in the graph indexing process, we\npropose a novel compact coding strategy, named Flash, designed explicitly for\ngraph indexing and optimized for modern CPU architectures. By minimizing random\nmemory accesses and maximizing the utilization of SIMD (Single Instruction,\nMultiple Data) instructions, Flash significantly enhances cache hit rates and\narithmetic operations.

In this setting, local data remains private, but its quality and\nquantity can vary significantly across nodes. The extent to which a fully\ndecentralized system is vulnerable to poor-quality or corrupted data remains\nunclear, but several factors could contribute to potential risks. Without a\ncentral authority, there can be no unified mechanism to detect or correct\nerrors, and each node operates with a localized view of the data distribution,\nmaking it difficult for the node to assess whether its perspective aligns with\nthe true distribution. Moreover, models trained on low-quality data can\npropagate through the network, amplifying errors. To explore the impact of\nlow-quality data on DFL, we simulate two scenarios with degraded data quality\n-- one where the corrupted data is evenly distributed in a subset of nodes and\none where it is concentrated on a single node -- using a decentralized\nimplementation of FedAvg. Our results reveal that averaging-based decentralized\nlearning is remarkably robust to localized bad data, even when the corrupted\ndata resides in the most influential nodes of the network. Counterintuitively,\nthis robustness is further enhanced when the corrupted data is concentrated on\na single node, regardless of its centrality in the communication network\ntopology. This phenomenon is explained by the averaging process, which ensures\nthat no single node -- however central -- can disproportionately influence the\noverall learning process.",

Additionally, we incorporate the\nEfficient Channel Attention (ECA) module to improve communication between\ndifferent channels. Instead of relying on physically shifted windows, our\napproach leverages frequency domain enhancement to implicitly bridge\ninformation across spatial regions. We validate our model on the iCartoonFace\ndataset and conduct downstream tasks on ImageNet, demonstrating that our model\nachieves lower parameter counts and computational overheads compared to shifted\nwindow approaches, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Furthermore, our\nvisualization operations clearly demonstrated that the Filter Enhancement\ntechnique achieves greater effectiveness in the model's shallow layers, where\nfeature maps are relatively larger.

To address this question, we run\na set of experiments comparing epsilon-lexicase and tournament selection with\ndifferent down-sampling techniques on synthetic problems of varying noise\nlevels and problem sizes as well as real-world symbolic regression problems.\nOverall, we find that down-sampling improves generalization and performance\neven when compared over the same number of generations.

In\nterms of the effective slope, $ES\\propto|{dA}/{dx}|$, where $x$ is the\nstreamwise direction, the analyzed cases included the configurations with $ES$\nranging from $ES=0$ (flat wall) to $ES=0.2455$ ($A/\\lambda=0.051$, where\n$\\lambda$ is the length of a single waviness).

While Behavior Trees (BTs) have been established as a popular control\narchitecture and are plannable for a single robot, the development of effective\nmulti-robot BT planning algorithms remains challenging due to the complexity of\ncoordinating diverse action spaces. We propose the Multi-Robot Behavior Tree\nPlanning (MRBTP) algorithm, with theoretical guarantees of both soundness and\ncompleteness. MRBTP features cross-tree expansion to coordinate heterogeneous\nactions across different BTs to achieve the team's goal. For homogeneous\nactions, we retain backup structures among BTs to ensure robustness and prevent\nredundant execution through intention sharing. While MRBTP is capable of\ngenerating BTs for both homogeneous and heterogeneous robot teams, its\nefficiency can be further improved. We then propose an optional plugin for\nMRBTP when Large Language Models (LLMs) are available to reason goal-related\nactions for each robot.

Next, we determine the energy emission rate for the Kerr\nMOG BH and analyze the influence of parameters $\\alpha$, $k_o$, $k_\\theta$, and\n$k_r$ on particle emissions in the BH vicinity. We further analyze the\ndeflection angle in the presence of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous plasma\nprofiles.

It not only facilitates the\nattainment of multifunctional integration but also promotes seamless\namalgamation with other elements. The current on the RIS element plays a\ncrucial role in determining the characteristics of the induced electromagnetic\nffeld components. Segments with high current intensity determine the\nperformance of RIS elements. Carving the parts with strong current distribution\ndensity into the metal patch of RIS element structure can achieve\nminiaturization. Based on this insight, this work proposes a topology design\nmethod that leverages current distribution and image processing techniques to\nachieve efffcient miniaturization of the RIS elements. In this proposed method,\nwe ffrst obtain the current distribution across different operational states\nand the period of the working frequency. Next, we employ the Otsu image\nsegmentation method to extract relevant image information from the current\ndistribution images of the RIS elements. Subsequently, we utilize linear\nmapping techniques to convert this image information into the structure of RIS\nelements. Then, based on the structure of the RIS elements, the Quasi-Newton\noptimization algorithm is utilized to obtain the parameters of the tunable\ndevice that correspond to various operational states. As a result, we\nsuccessfully construct the structural topology of the RIS elements based on\ntheir current distribution, designing areas with strong current distribution as\nmetal patches. To validate the performance of the proposed method, a 16 by 16\n3-bit RIS was developed, fabricated and measured.

    "abstract": "We introduce merge-width, a family of graph parameters that unifies several\nstructural graph measures, including treewidth, degeneracy, twin-width,\nclique-width, and generalized coloring numbers. Our parameters are based on new\ndecompositions called construction sequences. These are sequences of ever\ncoarser partitions of the vertex set, where each pair of parts has a specified\ndefault connection, and all vertex pairs of the graph that differ from the\ndefault are marked as resolved. The radius-$r$ merge-width is the maximum\nnumber of parts reached from a vertex by following a path of at most $r$\nresolved edges. Graph classes of bounded merge-width -- for which the\nradius-$r$ merge-width parameter can be bounded by a constant, for each fixed\n$r=1,2,3,\\ldots$ -- include all classes of bounded expansion or of bounded\ntwin-width, thus unifying two central notions from the Sparsity and Twin-width\nframeworks. Furthermore, they are preserved under first-order transductions,\nwhich attests to their robustness. We conjecture that classes of bounded\nmerge-width are equivalent to the previously introduced classes of bounded\nflip-width.\n  As our main result, we show that the model checking problem for first-order\nlogic is fixed-parameter tractable on graph classes of bounded merge-width,\nassuming the input includes a witnessing construction sequence. This unites and\nextends two previous model checking results: the result of Dvo\\v{r}\\'{a}k,\nKr\\'{a}l, and Thomas for classes of bounded expansion, and the result of\nBonnet, Kim, Thomass\\'e, and Watrigant for classes of bounded twin-width.\n  Finally, we suggest future research directions that could impact the study of\nstructural and algorithmic graph theory, in particular of monadically dependent\ngraph classes, which we conjecture to coincide with classes of almost bounded\nmerge-width.",

    "abstract": "Low-cost accelerometers play a crucial role in modern society due to their\nadvantages of small size, ease of integration, wearability, and mass\nproduction, making them widely applicable in automotive systems, aerospace, and\nwearable technology. However, this widely used sensor suffers from severe\naccuracy and range limitations. To this end, we propose a honed-energy\nregularized and optimal supervised GAN (HEROS-GAN), which transforms low-cost\nsensor signals into high-cost equivalents, thereby overcoming the precision and\nrange limitations of low-cost accelerometers. Due to the lack of frame-level\npaired low-cost and high-cost signals for training, we propose an Optimal\nTransport Supervision (OTS), which leverages optimal transport theory to\nexplore potential consistency between unpaired data, thereby maximizing\nsupervisory information. Moreover, we propose a Modulated Laplace Energy (MLE),\nwhich injects appropriate energy into the generator to encourage it to break\nrange limitations, enhance local changes, and enrich signal details. Given the\nabsence of a dedicated dataset, we specifically establish a Low-cost\nAccelerometer Signal Enhancement Dataset (LASED) containing tens of thousands\nof samples, which is the first dataset serving to improve the accuracy and\nrange of accelerometers and is released in Github. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that a GAN combined with either OTS or MLE alone can surpass the\nprevious signal enhancement SOTA methods by an order of magnitude. Integrating\nboth OTS and MLE, the HEROS-GAN achieves remarkable results, which doubles the\naccelerometer range while reducing signal noise by two orders of magnitude,\nestablishing a benchmark in the accelerometer signal processing.",

Furthermore, the magnetic-field-induced\nmixing of polarization selection rules and the breaking of in-plane symmetry\nlead to highly anisotropic polariton branches.

    "abstract": "The reliance on large-scale datasets and extensive computational resources\nhas become a major barrier to advancing representation learning in vision,\nespecially in data-scarce domains. In this paper, we address the critical\nquestion: Can we escape the big data paradigm in self-supervised representation\nlearning from images? We introduce SCOTT (Sparse Convolutional Tokenizer for\nTransformers), a shallow tokenization architecture that is compatible with\nMasked Image Modeling (MIM) tasks. SCOTT injects convolutional inductive biases\ninto Vision Transformers (ViTs), enhancing their efficacy in small-scale data\nregimes. Alongside, we propose to train on a Joint-Embedding Predictive\nArchitecture within a MIM framework (MIM-JEPA), operating in latent\nrepresentation space to capture more semantic features. Our approach enables\nViTs to be trained from scratch on datasets orders of magnitude smaller than\ntraditionally required --without relying on massive external datasets for\npretraining. We validate our method on three small-size, standard-resoultion,\nfine-grained datasets: Oxford Flowers-102, Oxford IIIT Pets-37, and\nImageNet-100. Despite the challenges of limited data and high intra-class\nsimilarity, frozen SCOTT models pretrained with MIM-JEPA significantly\noutperform fully supervised methods and achieve competitive results with SOTA\napproaches that rely on large-scale pretraining, complex image augmentations\nand bigger model sizes. By demonstrating that robust off-the-shelf\nrepresentations can be learned with limited data, compute, and model sizes, our\nwork paves the way for computer applications in resource constrained\nenvironments such as medical imaging or robotics.

    "abstract": "Gravitational wave (GW) signals of astrophysical origin are typically weak.\nThis is because gravity is a weak force, the weakest among the four forces we\nknow of. In order to detect GW signals, one must make differential measurements\nof effective lengths less than a thousandth of the size of a proton. In spite\nof the detectors achieving extraordinary sensitivity, the detector noise\ntypically overwhelms the signal, so that GW signals are deeply buried in the\ndata. The challenge to the data analyst is of extracting the GW signal from the\nnoise, that is, first deciding whether a signal is present or not then if\npresent, measuring its parameters.\n  However, in the search for coalescing compact binary (CBC) signals,\nshort-duration non-Gaussian noise transients (glitches) in the detector data\nsignificantly affect the search sensitivity. $\\chi^2$ discriminators are\ntherefore employed to mitigate their effect. We show that the underlying\nmathematical structure of any $\\chi^2$ is a vector bundle over the signal\nmanifold $\\mathcal{P}$, that is, the manifold traced out by the signal\nwaveforms in the Hilbert space of data segments $\\mathcal{D}$. The $\\chi^2$ is\nthen defined as the square of the $L_2$ norm of the data vector projected onto\na finite-dimensional subspace $\\mathcal{S}$ (fibre) of $\\mathcal{D}$ chosen\northogonal to the triggered template waveform.

Our first novelty lies in the front-end, which includes a\nfloor detection module capable of identifying stairways and assigning\nfloor-level semantic relations to the underlying layers. Floor-level semantics\nallows us to propose a floor-based loop closure strategy, that effectively\nrejects false positive closures that typically appear due to aliasing between\ndifferent floors of a building. Our second novelty lies in leveraging our\nrepresentation hierarchy in the optimization. Our proposal consists of: (1)\nlocal optimization over a window of recent keyframes and their connected\ncomponents across the four representation layers, (2) floor-level global\noptimization, which focuses only on keyframes and their connections within the\ncurrent floor during loop closures, and (3) room-level local optimization,\nmarginalizing redundant keyframes that share observations within the room,\nwhich reduces the computational footprint. We validate our algorithm\nextensively in different real multi-floor environments. Our approach shows\nstate-of-art-art accuracy metrics in large-scale multi-floor environments,\nestimating hierarchical representations up to 10x faster, in average, than\ncompeting baselines",

At\nthe same time, the amount of available cascade data remains relatively limited\ncompared to the vast datasets used for training large language models (LLMs).\nRecent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging LLMs for\ntime-series prediction by exploiting commonalities across different time-series\ndomains.

Currently, researchers are focus on searching\nthree-dimensional altermagnetism and exploring its novel physical properties.\nHowever, there is a lack of understanding of the physical origin of\ntwo-dimensional altermagnetic emergent behavior. Here, we propose an approach\nto realize the transition from Neel antiferromagnetism to altermagnetism in\ntwo-dimensional system using an electric field, Janus structure, and\nferroelectric substrate. In monolayer VPSe3, we demonstrate that\nmultiple-physical-fields cause the upper and lower Se atoms unequal to break PT\nsymmetry, resulting in altermagnetic spin splitting. Noted that monolayer VPSe3\nproduces a spontaneous valley splitting of 2.91 meV at the conduction band\nminimum. The electric field can effectively tune the valley splitting\nmagnitude, while the Janus structure not only changes the valley splitting\nmagnitude, but also alters the direction. More interestingly, when the\nferroelectric polarization of Al2S3 is upward, the direction of valley\npolarization is switched and the magnitude is almost unchanged. However, the\nvalley splitting sigfinicantly increases under the downward. It is worth noting\nthat the ferroelectric polarization can switch altermagnetic effect and realize\nanomalous valley Hall effect. Besides, we reveal the microscopic mechanism of\nvalley splitting by an effective Hamiltonian. Our findings not only provide a\nmethod to designing altermagnet, but also enriches the valley physics.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce\nViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich\ndocuments requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations\nin current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to\neffectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous\napproaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their\neffectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel\nmulti-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual\ndocuments. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy\nto effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's\nreasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating\nexploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for\ninvestigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on\nViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach.\nNotably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive\nViDoSeek benchmark.

    "abstract": "In previous works, we have shown that stars in the Orion and the Lagoon\nNebula Clusters, and simulations of collapsing clouds, exhibit constant\nvelocity dispersion as a function of mass, a result described by Lynden-Bell 50\nyears ago as an effect of a violent relaxation mechanism. In contrast,\nnumerical simulations of turbulent clouds show that newborn massive stars\nexperience stronger dynamical heating than low-mass stars. We analyzed\nturbulent numerical simulations and found that this effect arises from the fact\nthat, in clouds that are globally turbulence-supported against collapse,\nmassive stars are formed within more massive and denser clumps and in more\ncrowded environments compared to low-mass stars. This allows them to accrete\nmore mass and interact with other stars simultaneously. As they become more\nmassive, their orbits tighten, increasing their velocity dispersion. In\ncontrast, low-mass stars are formed in the periphery of such cores, more\nseparated, and at lower densities. Thus, their velocity dispersion remains\nlower because they do not accrete as vigorously as massive stars and tend to be\nmore isolated. We call this mechanism \"accretion-induced orbital tightening.\"\nOur results and previous findings about violent relaxation provide a key\nobservational diagnostic of how to distinguish the dynamic state of\nstar-forming molecular clouds through the kinematics of their newborn stars.",

Instead, we find that the\nsuperradiance phenomenon (specifically the electromagnetic version of the\neffect) causes the scalar condensate to become fully depleted through accretion\ninto the black hole and radiation to spatial infinity. The combination of the\ntwo effects, which we refer to as \"tachyonic superradiance\", may thus be seen\nas a particularly efficient mechanism for the extraction of energy from a black\nhole, exploiting both the tachyonic growth and superradiant emission.

However, conventional segmentation techniques face\nlimitations, including poor signal-to-noise ratio, inconsistent illumination,\nthresholding difficulties, and false positives from natural organic matter\n(NOM). To address these challenges, this study introduces the Fluorescence\nImaging Microplastic Analysis Platform (FIMAP), a retrofitted multispectral\ncamera with four optical filters and five excitation wavelengths. FIMAP enables\ncomprehensive characterization of the fluorescence behavior of ten Nile\nRed-stained MPs: HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, EPS, ABS, PVC, PC, PET, and PA, while\neffectively excluding NOM. Using K-means clustering for robust segmentation\n(Intersection over Union = 0.877) and a 20-dimensional color coordinate\nmultivariate nearest neighbor approach for MP classification (>3.14 mm), FIMAP\nachieves 90% precision, 90% accuracy, 100% recall, and an F1 score of 94.7%.\nOnly PS was occasionally misclassified as EPS. For smaller MPs (35-104\nmicrons), classification accuracy declined, likely due to reduced stain\nsorption, fewer detectable pixels, and camera instability.

    "abstract": "Digital twin (DT)-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a\npromising paradigm for wireless network optimization, offering safe and\nefficient training environment for policy exploration. However, in theory\nexisting methods cannot always guarantee real-world performance of DT-trained\npolicies before actual deployment, due to the absence of a universal metric for\nassessing DT's ability to support reliable DRL training transferrable to\nphysical networks. In this paper, we propose the DT bisimulation metric\n(DT-BSM), a novel metric based on the Wasserstein distance, to quantify the\ndiscrepancy between Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both the DT and the\ncorresponding real-world wireless network environment. We prove that for any\nDT-trained policy, the sub-optimality of its performance (regret) in the\nreal-world deployment is bounded by a weighted sum of the DT-BSM and its\nsub-optimality within the MDP in the DT. Then, a modified DT-BSM based on the\ntotal variation distance is also introduced to avoid the prohibitive\ncalculation complexity of Wasserstein distance for large-scale wireless network\nscenarios. Further, to tackle the challenge of obtaining accurate transition\nprobabilities of the MDP in real world for the DT-BSM calculation, we propose\nan empirical DT-BSM method based on statistical sampling. We prove that the\nempirical DT-BSM always converges to the desired theoretical one, and\nquantitatively establish the relationship between the required sample size and\nthe target level of approximation accuracy. Numerical experiments validate this\nfirst theoretical finding on the provable and calculable performance bounds for\nDT-driven DRL.",

Embedding of\nknowledge graph for facilitating downstream tasks such as knowledge graph\ncompletion, link prediction, recommendation, has been a major area of research\nrecently in classical machine learning. Because the size of knowledge graphs\nare becoming larger, one of the natural choices is to exploit quantum computing\nfor knowledge graph embedding. Recently, a hybrid quantum classical model for\nknowledge graph embedding has been studied in which a variational quantum\ncircuit is trained. One of the important aspects in knowledge graph embedding\nis the sampling of negative triples, which plays a crucial role in efficient\ntraining of the model. In classical machine learning various negative sampling\nstrategies have been studied. In quantum knowledge graph embedding model,\nalthough we can use these strategies in principle, it is natural to ask if we\ncan exploit quantum advantage in negative sampling.

In this paper, we propose Tensor Network Purification (TNP),\na novel model-free adversarial purification method by a specially designed\ntensor network decomposition algorithm. TNP depends neither on the pre-trained\ngenerative model nor the specific dataset, resulting in strong robustness\nacross diverse adversarial scenarios. To this end, the key challenge lies in\nrelaxing Gaussian-noise assumptions of classical decompositions and\naccommodating the unknown distribution of adversarial perturbations. Unlike the\nlow-rank representation of classical decompositions, TNP aims to reconstruct\nthe unobserved clean examples from an adversarial example. Specifically, TNP\nleverages progressive downsampling and introduces a novel adversarial\noptimization objective to address the challenge of minimizing reconstruction\nerror but without inadvertently restoring adversarial perturbations. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our\nmethod generalizes effectively across various norm threats, attack types, and\ntasks, providing a versatile and promising adversarial purification technique.",

We observe a shift in the resonator\nfrequency and an increase in its internal losses as a function of the gate\nvoltage, which we relate to a change in the imaginary and real components of\nthe nanowire impedance, respectively. We demonstrate that these changes are\ndescribed by the Mattis-Bardeen model with an effective temperature. We further\nstudy the resonator response to fast gate signals and measure characteristic\nresponse times of the order of 40 ns, both in time-domain and parametric\nmodulation experiments. Our study elucidates the impact of the gate on the\ncomplex impedance of the nanowire in the superconducting state, as well as its\ndynamic performance, providing a foundation for the design of gate-controlled\nsuperconducting devices.",

Human\ncreativity is influenced in complex, nonlinear ways by the actions of AI-driven\nagents within their social networks, but these influences are difficult to\nmeasure using traditional methods. This study examines how human-AI\ninteractions shape the evolution of collective creation within large-scale\nsocial network experiments, where human and AI participants collectively create\nstories. Participants (either humans or AI) joined 5x5 grid-based networks in\nwhich stories were selected, modified, and shared over many iterations.\nInitially, AI-only networks showed greater creativity (rated by a separate\ngroup of human raters) and collective diversity of stories than human-only and\nhuman-AI networks. However, over time, hybrid human-AI networks became more\ndiverse in their creations than AI-only networks. In part, this is because AI\nagents retained little from the original stories, while human-only networks\npreserved continuity. These findings highlight the value of experimental social\nnetworks in understanding human-AI hybrid societies.",

Second, the\nBiformer attention mechanism is added to the network to strengthen the focus on\nkey features, improving the network's ability to flexibly recognize feature\nimages. Finally, to more comprehensively evaluate the relationship between\npredicted and ground truth bounding boxes, the original loss function is\nreplaced with the MPDIoU function, addressing the issue of mismatched predicted\nbounding boxes.

    "abstract": "In the realm of sponsored search advertising, matching advertisements with\nthe search intent of a user's query is crucial. Query-to-bidwords(i.e. bidding\nkeywords) rewriting is a vital technique that has garnered significant\nattention. Recently, with the prevalence of LLMs, generative retrieval methods\nhave proven effective in producing high-relevance rewrites. However, we have\nidentified a significant limitation in existing approaches: While fine-tuning\nLLMs for specific domains enhances semantic relevance, these models have no\nperception of the intrinsic value of their generated outputs, such as\ncommercial value. Therefore, after SFT, a RLHF phase is often employed to\naddress this issue. Nevertheless, traditional preference alignment methods\noften face challenges in aligning fine-grained values and are susceptible to\noverfitting, which diminishes the effectiveness and quality of the generated\nresults. To address these challenges, we propose VALUE(Value-Aware Large\nlanguage model for qUery rewriting via wEighted trie), the first framework that\nensures the generation of high-value and highly relevant bidwords. Our approach\nutilizes weighted trie, an innovative modification of the traditional trie data\nstructure. By modulating the LLM's output probability distribution with value\ninformation from the trie during decoding process, we constrain the generation\nspace and guide the trajectory of text production. Offline experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method in semantic matching and preference\nalignment, showing a remarkable improvement in the value attribute by more than\nfivefold. Online A/B tests further revealed that our Revenue Per Mille (RPM)\nmetric increased by 1.64%.

However, despite significant\nadvancements, their autonomous capabilities remain inherently limited. As a\nresult, human operators are often essential for supervising and controlling\nthese systems, creating what is referred to as a human-multi-drone team. In\nrealistic settings, human operators must make real-time decisions while\naddressing a variety of signals, such as drone statuses and sensor readings,\nand adapting to dynamic conditions and uncertainty. This complexity may lead to\nsuboptimal operations, potentially compromising the overall effectiveness of\nthe team.

This work introduces an advising\nagent designed to enhance collaboration in human-multi-drone teams, with a\nspecific focus on SAR scenarios. The advising agent is designed to assist the\nhuman operator by suggesting contextual actions worth taking. To that end, the\nagent employs a novel computation technique that relies on a small set of human\ndemonstrations to generate varying realistic human-like trajectories.

The interrelation\nof the C*-algebras of ''compact'' operators, the Banach algebras of bounded\nmodule operators and the Banach spaces of bounded module operators of a Hilbert\nC*-module to its C*-dual Banach C*-module are characterized for pairs of\nHilbert C*-modules and their respective multiplier modules.

In addition, we find that the stacking\nengineering can effectively realize the transform from antiferromagnetism to\naltermagnetism and semiconductor to metal for the Jauns bilayer V2SeTeO. More\ninterestingly, the strain not only induces an intriguing multipiezo effect,\nencompassing the piezovalley, piezomagnetism and piezoelectric, but also\nachieves the abundant topological phase.

The HERMES-PF\nX-ray/gamma-ray detector is made by 60 GAGG:Ce scintillator crystals and 12 2x5\nsilicon drift detector (SDD) mosaics, used to detect both the cosmic X-rays\ndirectly and the optical photons produced by gamma-ray interactions with the\nscintillator crystals. This design provides a unique broad band spectral\ncoverage from a few keV to a few MeV. Furthermore, the use of fast GAGG:Ce\ncrystals and small SDD cells allows us to reach an exquisite time resolution\nbetter than a microsecond. We present a progress report on the missions\nfocusing the discussion on the scientific innovation of the project and on the\nmain lessons learned during the project development including: the importance\nand the challenges of using distributed architectures to achieve ambitious\nscientific objectives; the importance of developing critical technologies under\nscience agreements for the realization of high-performing but low-cost\npayloads; best use of COTS technologies in scientific missions. We finally\ndiscuss the prospects of applying these concepts for the creation of an\nall-sky, all-time monitor to search for the high-energy counterparts of\ngravitational wave events that Advanced LIGO/Virgo/Kagra will find at the end\nof this decade and the Einstein Telescope during the 2030s.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern, and early\ndetection through screening plays a critical role in reducing mortality. While\ndeep learning models have shown promise in improving polyp detection,\nclassification, and segmentation, their generalization across diverse clinical\nenvironments, particularly with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, remains a\nchallenge. Multi-center datasets like PolypGen have been developed to address\nthese issues, but their collection is costly and time-consuming. Traditional\ndata augmentation techniques provide limited variability, failing to capture\nthe complexity of medical images. Diffusion models have emerged as a promising\nsolution for generating synthetic polyp images, but the image generation\nprocess in current models mainly relies on segmentation masks as the condition,\nlimiting their ability to capture the full clinical context. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Progressive Spectrum Diffusion Model (PSDM) that\nintegrates diverse clinical annotations-such as segmentation masks, bounding\nboxes, and colonoscopy reports-by transforming them into compositional prompts.\nThese prompts are organized into coarse and fine components, allowing the model\nto capture both broad spatial structures and fine details, generating\nclinically accurate synthetic images. By augmenting training data with\nPSDM-generated samples, our model significantly improves polyp detection,\nclassification, and segmentation. For instance, on the PolypGen dataset, PSDM\nincreases the F1 score by 2.12% and the mean average precision by 3.09%,\ndemonstrating superior performance in OOD scenarios and enhanced\ngeneralization.",

Vectorized\nrepresentations, which preserve instance-level topological information while\nreducing computational overhead, have emerged as a promising paradigm. While\nexisting vectorized query-based frameworks often overlook the inherent spatial\ncorrelations among intra-instance points, resulting in geometrically\ninconsistent outputs (e.g., fragmented HD map elements or oscillatory\ntrajectories). To address these limitations, we propose InVDriver, a novel\nvectorized query-based system that systematically models intra-instance spatial\ndependencies through masked self-attention layers, thereby enhancing planning\naccuracy and trajectory smoothness. Across all core modules, i.e., perception,\nprediction, and planning, InVDriver incorporates masked self-attention\nmechanisms that restrict attention to intra-instance point interactions,\nenabling coordinated refinement of structural elements while suppressing\nirrelevant inter-instance noise. Experimental results on the nuScenes benchmark\ndemonstrate that InVDriver achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing\nprior methods in both accuracy and safety, while maintaining high computational\nefficiency.

Methods: A total of 130 multiple-choice questions (MCQs)\nrelated to diagnosis (n = 39) and management (n = 91) were collected from the\nChinese ophthalmology senior professional title examination and categorized\ninto six topics. These MCQs were translated into English using DeepSeek-R1. The\nresponses of DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.0 Pro, OpenAI o1 and o3-mini were generated\nunder default configurations between February 15 and February 20, 2025.\nAccuracy was calculated as the proportion of correctly answered questions, with\nomissions and extra answers considered incorrect. Reasoning ability was\nevaluated through analyzing reasoning logic and the causes of reasoning error.\nResults: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated the highest overall accuracy, achieving 0.862\nin Chinese MCQs and 0.808 in English MCQs. Gemini 2.0 Pro, OpenAI o1, and\nOpenAI o3-mini attained accuracies of 0.715, 0.685, and 0.692 in Chinese MCQs\n(all P<0.001 compared with DeepSeek-R1), and 0.746 (P=0.115), 0.723 (P=0.027),\nand 0.577 (P<0.001) in English MCQs, respectively. DeepSeek-R1 achieved the\nhighest accuracy across five topics in both Chinese and English MCQs. It also\nexcelled in management questions conducted in Chinese (all P<0.05). Reasoning\nability analysis showed that the four LLMs shared similar reasoning logic.\nIgnoring key positive history, ignoring key positive signs, misinterpretation\nmedical data, and too aggressive were the most common causes of reasoning\nerrors.

As the\nnumber of cases continues to rise, the reliance on manual drafting of legal\ncase documents is facing increasing pressure and challenges. The development of\nlarge language models (LLMs) offers a promising solution for automating\ndocument generation. However, existing benchmarks fail to fully capture the\ncomplexities involved in drafting legal case documents in real-world scenarios.\nTo address this gap, we introduce CaseGen, the benchmark for multi-stage legal\ncase documents generation in the Chinese legal domain.

It supports four key tasks: drafting defense statements, writing\ntrial facts, composing legal reasoning, and generating judgment results. To the\nbest of our knowledge, CaseGen is the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs\nin the context of legal case document generation.

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Deep Joint Geometry and\nAttribute point cloud Compression (Deep-JGAC) framework for dense colored point\nclouds, which exploits the correlation between the geometry and attribute for\nhigh compression efficiency. Firstly, we propose a flexible Deep-JGAC\nframework, where the geometry and attribute sub-encoders are compatible to\neither learning or non-learning based geometry and attribute encoders.\nSecondly, we propose an attribute-assisted deep geometry encoder that enhances\nthe geometry latent representation with the help of attribute, where the\ngeometry decoding remains unchanged. Moreover, Attribute Information Fusion\nModule (AIFM) is proposed to fuse attribute information in geometry coding.\nThirdly, to solve the mismatch between the point cloud geometry and attribute\ncaused by the geometry compression distortion, we present an optimized\nre-colorization module to attach the attribute to the geometrically distorted\npoint cloud for attribute coding. It enhances the colorization and lowers the\ncomputational complexity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that in\nterms of the geometry quality metric D1-PSNR, the proposed Deep-JGAC achieves\nan average of 82.96%, 36.46%, 41.72%, and 31.16% bit-rate reductions as\ncompared to the state-of-the-art G-PCC, V-PCC, GRASP, and PCGCv2, respectively.\nIn terms of perceptual joint quality metric MS-GraphSIM, the proposed Deep-JGAC\nachieves an average of 48.72%, 14.67%, and 57.14% bit-rate reductions compared\nto the G-PCC, V-PCC, and IT-DL-PCC, respectively.

However, there is a lack of comparison between these recent\napproaches and the classical architecture convolutional networks (CNNs) on\nfoundation model benchmarks. This raises the question: are CNNs truly being\nsurpassed by these recent approaches based on transformer and SSM\narchitectures? In this paper, we develop a simple but well-designed CNN-based\nmethod termed ConvNova. ConvNova identifies and proposes three effective\ndesigns: 1) dilated convolutions, 2) gated convolutions, and 3) a dual-branch\nframework for gating mechanisms. Through extensive empirical experiments, we\ndemonstrate that ConvNova significantly outperforms recent methods on more than\nhalf of the tasks across several foundation model benchmarks. For example, in\nhistone-related tasks, ConvNova exceeds the second-best method by an average of\n5.8%, while generally utilizing fewer parameters and enabling faster\ncomputation. In addition, the experiments observed findings that may be related\nto biological characteristics. This indicates that CNNs are still a strong\ncompetitor compared to Transformers and SSMs. We anticipate that this work will\nspark renewed interest in CNN-based methods for DNA foundation models.",

This paper introduces SIDSL\n(\\textbf{S}tructure-prior \\textbf{I}nformed \\textbf{D}iffusion model for\n\\textbf{S}ource \\textbf{L}ocalization), a novel framework that addresses three\nkey challenges in limited-data scenarios: unknown propagation patterns, complex\ntopology-propagation relationships, and class imbalance between source and\nnon-source nodes. SIDSL incorporates topology-aware priors through graph label\npropagation and employs a propagation-enhanced conditional denoiser with a\nGNN-parameterized label propagation module (GNN-LP). Additionally, we propose a\nstructure-prior biased denoising scheme that initializes from structure-based\nsource estimations rather than random noise, effectively countering class\nimbalance issues. Experimental results across four real-world datasets\ndemonstrate SIDSL's superior performance, achieving 7.5-13.3% improvements in\nF1 scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, when pretrained with\nsimulation data of synthetic patterns, SIDSL maintains robust performance with\nonly 10% of training data, surpassing baselines by more than 18.8%. These\nresults highlight SIDSL's effectiveness in real-world applications where\nlabeled data is scarce.",

We experiment on three real-world datasets, using\nfive baseline models alongside two popular fairness-aware models, to show the\neffectiveness of our metrics in evaluating gender bias.

    "abstract": "Despite extensive research efforts focused on OOD detection on images, OOD\ndetection on nodes in graph learning remains underexplored. The dependence\namong graph nodes hinders the trivial adaptation of existing approaches on\nimages that assume inputs to be i.i.d. sampled, since many unique features and\nchallenges specific to graphs are not considered, such as the heterophily\nissue. Recently, GNNSafe, which considers node dependence, adapted energy-based\ndetection to the graph domain with state-of-the-art performance, however, it\nhas two serious issues: 1) it derives node energy from classification logits\nwithout specifically tailored training for modeling data distribution, making\nit less effective at recognizing OOD data; 2) it highly relies on energy\npropagation, which is based on homophily assumption and will cause significant\nperformance degradation on heterophilic graphs, where the node tends to have\ndissimilar distribution with its neighbors. To address the above issues, we\nsuggest training EBMs by MLE to enhance data distribution modeling and remove\nenergy propagation to overcome the heterophily issues. However, training EBMs\nvia MLE requires performing MCMC sampling on both node feature and node\nneighbors, which is challenging due to the node interdependence and discrete\ngraph topology. To tackle the sampling challenge, we introduce DeGEM, which\ndecomposes the learning process into two parts: a graph encoder that leverages\ntopology information for node representations and an energy head that operates\nin latent space. Extensive experiments validate that DeGEM, without OOD\nexposure during training, surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving an average AUROC improvement of 6.71% on homophilic graphs and 20.29%\non heterophilic graphs, and even outperform methods trained with OOD exposure.\nOur code is available at: https://github.com/draym28/DeGEM.",

For all of them, the retrograde accretion of gas either\nfrom gas stripping from a nearby companion or from the circumgalactic medium is\nthe starting point of the formation process. This is followed by the\nco-existence of two distinct disks of gas rotating in opposite directions, the\npre-existing one in the inner parts and the accreted gas in the outer parts of\nthe galaxy. The latter progressively replaces the former leading to the final\ngas-star kinetic misalignment configuration. During the process, the star\nformation is first enhanced and then progressively decreases. We roughly\nestimate that a higher fraction of the pre-existing gas is converted into stars\nrather than being expelled. We also found that the black hole activity (BH)\ntends to be enhanced during the removal of the pre-existing gas. Furthermore,\nour analysis suggests that the formation of a counter-rotating gas component is\nalways accompanied with the formation of counter-rotating stellar disks. These\nstellar disks can have diverse properties but host in general a younger and\nmore metal rich population of stars with respect to the main disc, depending on\nthe star formation history and BH activity. The central part of\ncounter-rotating disks tend also to be characterized by a younger population,\nan enhanced star formation rate and a higher metallicity than their outer\nparts. The high metallicity comes the progressive metal enrichment of the\naccreted gas by mixing with the pre-existing gas and by supernovae activity as\nit sinks toward the center of the galaxy.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in\nmultimodal comprehension, thanks to extensive pre-training and fine-tuning on\nlarge-scale visual datasets. However, despite their robust textual safety\nmechanisms, they remain vulnerable to harmful visual inputs. Existing\nsafeguards-typically relying on pre-filtering or fine-tuning-incur high costs\nand diminish overall utility. To address this critical vulnerability, we\nintroduce SafeCLIP, a lightweight method that leverages LVLMs inherent\nmultimodal alignment for zero-shot toxic image detection. By projecting CLIPs\ndiscarded CLS token into its text space and matching it with toxic descriptors,\nSafeCLIP detects harmful content without any architectural changes-adding\nminimal latency and enabling dynamic safety corrections during inference and\nfine-tuning.Experiments show that SafeCLIP achieves a 66.9% defense success\nrate with only 3.2% false positive rate and 7.2% overhead. In contrast,\nstate-of-the-art methods achieve 52.9% success but have a 10.7% false positive\nrate and 210% overhead.

    "abstract": "Constant-envelope signals are widely employed in wireless communication\nsystems due to their hardware-friendly design, energy efficiency, and enhanced\nreliability. However, detecting these signals reliably using simple,\npower-efficient receivers remains a critical challenge. While coherent\ndetection methods generally offer superior performance, they require complex\nfrequency synchronization, which increases receiver complexity and power\nconsumption. In contrast, noncoherent detection is inherently simpler since it\navoids frequency synchronization. However, traditional noncoherent detection\napproaches still rely on In-phase and Quadrature-phase (IQ) demodulators to\nextract the noisy received signal magnitudes, and assume the energy detector as\nthe test statistic according to the IQ structure, without rigorous theoretical\njustification. Motivated by the practical need for robust and low-complexity\ndetection, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework for optimal signal\ndetection using a simple bandpass-filter envelope-detector (BFED) in\nconjunction with a Bayesian approach and the generalized likelihood ratio test\n(GLRT) under unknown amplitude conditions. By leveraging approximations of the\nmodified Bessel functions, we derive two distinct regimes of the optimal\ndetector. In the low SNR regime, we rigorously prove that the energy detector\nemerges as the Bayesian-optimal solution, thereby establishing its theoretical\nvalidity for the first time. In the high SNR regime, we derive a novel\namplitude-based detector that directly compares the estimated amplitude against\nthe noise standard deviation, leading to a simple yet optimal detection\nstrategy. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings, confirming\nthat both the energy and amplitude detectors achieve the minimum error\nprobability in their respective SNR domains.",

    "abstract": "Generalizable object fetching in cluttered scenes remains a fundamental and\napplication-critical challenge in embodied AI. Closely packed objects cause\ninevitable occlusions, making safe action generation particularly difficult.\nUnder such partial observability, effective policies must not only generalize\nacross diverse objects and layouts but also reason about occlusion to avoid\ncollisions. However, collecting large-scale real-world data for this task\nremains prohibitively expensive, leaving this problem largely unsolved. In this\npaper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework for this challenge. We\nfirst curate a large-scale synthetic dataset featuring 1M diverse scenes and\n500k representative demonstrations. Based on this dataset, FetchBot employs a\ndepth-conditioned method for action generation, which leverages structural cues\nto enable robust obstacle-aware action planning. However, depth is perfect in\nsimulation but noisy in real-world environments. To address this sim-to-real\ngap, FetchBot predicts depth from RGB inputs using a foundation model and\nintegrates local occupancy prediction as a pre-training task, providing a\ngeneralizable latent representation for sim-to-real transfer. Extensive\nexperiments in simulation and real-world environments demonstrate the strong\nzero-shot sim-to-real transfer, effective clutter handling, and adaptability to\nnovel scenarios. In cluttered environments, it achieves an average real-world\nsuccess rate of 89.95%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover,\nFetchBot demonstrates excellent robustness in challenging cases, such as\nfetching transparent, reflective, and irregular objects, highlighting its\npractical value.",

By employing advantageous techniques, these lenses\nwith nanostructures are directly patterned into thin polyimide membranes. The\ncomputational and experimental results have indicated that the focusing\nefficiency of these nanostructures at the primary focus increases significantly\nwith increasing the number of phase levels. Specifically, 16-level phase lenses\non a polyimide membrane can achieve a focusing efficiency of more than 91.6% of\nthe input signal (9.5 times better than that of a conventional amplitude-type\nFZP) and focus light into a diffraction-limited spot together with very weak\nside-lobes. Furthermore, these lenses exhibit considerably reduced unwanted\ndiffraction orders and produce extremely low background signals. The potential\nimpact of these lenses extends across various applications and techniques\nincluding microscopy, imaging, micro-diffraction, remote sensing, and space\nflight instruments which require lightweight and flexible configurations.",

However, LLMs still\nencounter challenges in effectively utilizing the knowledge from retrieved\ndocuments, often being misled by irrelevant or noisy information. To address\nthis issue, we introduce RankCoT, a knowledge refinement method that\nincorporates reranking signals in generating CoT-based summarization for\nknowledge refinement based on given query and all retrieval documents. During\ntraining, RankCoT prompts the LLM to generate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) candidates\nbased on the query and individual documents. It then fine-tunes the LLM to\ndirectly reproduce the best CoT from these candidate outputs based on all\nretrieved documents, which requires LLM to filter out irrelevant documents\nduring generating CoT-style summarization. Additionally, RankCoT incorporates a\nself-reflection mechanism that further refines the CoT outputs, resulting in\nhigher-quality training data. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nRankCoT, showing its superior performance over other knowledge refinement\nmodels. Further analysis reveals that RankCoT can provide shorter but effective\nrefinement results, enabling the generator to produce more accurate answers.\nAll code and data are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/RankCoT.",

The severity of this\nsituation calls for innovative diagnosis method for cardiovascular diseases.\nThis article aims to explore efficient, light-weight and rapid methods for\narrhythmia diagnosis, in resource-constrained healthcare settings. Due to the\nlack of Romanian public medical data, we trained our systems using\ninternational public datasets, having in mind that the ECG signals are the same\nregardless the patients' nationality. Within this purpose, we combined multiple\ndatasets, usually used in the field of arrhythmias classification: PTB-XL\nelectrocardiography dataset , PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, China 12-Lead ECG\nChallenge Database, Georgia 12-Lead ECG Challenge Database, and St. Petersburg\nINCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Database. For the input data, we employed ECG signal\nprocessing methods, specifically a variant of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm,\nuseful in arrhythmia classification because it provides a robust and efficient\nmethod for detecting QRS complexes in ECG signals. Additionally, we used\nmachine learning techniques, widely used for the task of classification,\nincluding convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs, 2D CNNs, ResNet) and Vision\nTransformers (ViTs). The systems were evaluated in terms of accuracy and F1\nscore. We annalysed our dataset from two perspectives. First, we fed the\nsystems with the ECG signals and the GRU-based 1D CNN model achieved the\nhighest accuracy of 93.4% among all the tested architectures.

    "abstract": "Diabetic macular ischemia (DMI), marked by the loss of retinal capillaries in\nthe macular area, contributes to vision impairment in patients with diabetes.\nAlthough color fundus photographs (CFPs), combined with artificial intelligence\n(AI), have been extensively applied in detecting various eye diseases,\nincluding diabetic retinopathy (DR), their applications in detecting DMI remain\nunexplored, partly due to skepticism among ophthalmologists regarding its\nfeasibility. In this study, we propose a graph neural network-based\nmultispectral view learning (GNN-MSVL) model designed to detect DMI from CFPs.\nThe model leverages higher spectral resolution to capture subtle changes in\nfundus reflectance caused by ischemic tissue, enhancing sensitivity to\nDMI-related features. The proposed approach begins with computational\nmultispectral imaging (CMI) to reconstruct 24-wavelength multispectral fundus\nimages from CFPs. ResNeXt101 is employed as the backbone for multi-view\nlearning to extract features from the reconstructed images. Additionally, a GNN\nwith a customized jumper connection strategy is designed to enhance\ncross-spectral relationships, facilitating comprehensive and efficient\nmultispectral view learning. The study included a total of 1,078\nmacula-centered CFPs from 1,078 eyes of 592 patients with diabetes, of which\n530 CFPs from 530 eyes of 300 patients were diagnosed with DMI. The model\nachieved an accuracy of 84.7 percent and an area under the receiver operating\ncharacteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.900 (95 percent CI: 0.852-0.937) on\neye-level, outperforming both the baseline model trained from CFPs and human\nexperts (p-values less than 0.01). These findings suggest that AI-based CFP\nanalysis holds promise for detecting DMI, contributing to its early and\nlow-cost screening.",

For example, jump size and\nwaiting time distributions follow power laws. Zipf's law was also established\nfor the frequency of visits to each location and rank. Relationship $S(t)\\sim\nt^\\mu$ exists between time t and the number of sites visited up to that time t.\nRecently, a universal law of visitation for human mobility was established.\nSpecifically, the number of people per unit area $\\rho(r,f)$, who reside at\ndistance r from a particular location and visit that location f times in a\ngiven period, is inversely proportional to the square of rf, i.e., $\\rho(r,f)\n\\propto (rf)^{-2}$ holds. The exploration and preferential return (EPR) model\nand its improved versions have been proposed to reproduce the above scaling\nlaws. However, some rules that follow the power law are preinstalled in the EPR\nmodel. We propose a simple walking model to generate movements toward and away\nfrom a target via a single mechanism by relaxing the concept of approaching a\ntarget. Our model can reproduce the abovementioned power laws and some of the\nrules used in the EPR model are generated. These results provide a new\nperspective on why or how the scaling laws observed in human mobility behavior\narise.",

The results show that the multi-scale\nmethodology successfully extends fine-scale classification to larger reef\nareas, achieving a high degree of accuracy in predicting coral morphotypes and\nassociated habitats. The method showed a strong alignment between\nunderwater-derived annotations and ground truth data, reflected by an AUC (Area\nUnder the Curve) score of 0.9251. This shows that the integration of underwater\nand aerial imagery, supported by deep-learning models, can facilitate scalable\nand accurate reef assessments. This study demonstrates the potential of\ncombining multi-scale imaging and AI to facilitate the monitoring and\nconservation of coral reefs. Our approach leverages the strengths of underwater\nand aerial imagery, ensuring the precision of fine-scale analysis while\nextending it to cover a broader reef area.",

Using our approach,\nwe translate articles across multiple scientific disciplines into 28 languages.\nTo evaluate translation accuracy, we introduce a novel question-and-answer (QA)\nbenchmarking method, in which an LLM generates comprehension-based questions\nfrom the original text and then answers them based on the translated text. Our\nbenchmark results show an average performance of 95.9%, showing that the key\nscientific details are accurately conveyed.

We take the\nmosaic models with slowly varying potentials as examples to illustrate this\nresult and derive its MEs from the effective Hamiltonian.

Prior work on reconfigurable\nantennas in communication theory is based on ideal radiation pattern\nabstractions.

We develop a\nmulti-port circuit-theoretic model of the hybrid array with parasitic elements\nand antennas with active RF chain validated through electromagnetic simulations\nwith a dipole array. We then derive the beamforming weight of the parasitic\nelement using the theoretical beam pattern expression for the case of a single\nactive antenna and multiple parasitic elements. We show that the parasitic\nbeamforming is challenging because the weights are subject to coupled magnitude\nand phase constraints. We simplify the beamforming optimization problem using a\nshift-of-origin transformation to the typical unit-modulus beamforming weight.\nWith this transformation, we derive a closed-form solution for the\nreconfigurable parasitic reactance. We generalize this solution to the\nmulti-active multi-parasitic hybrid array operating in a multi-path channel.\nOur proposed hybrid architecture with parasitic elements outperforms\nconventional architectures in terms of energy efficiency.",

However, adopting point clouds as 3D representation fails to fully\ncapture the intricacies of the 3D world and exhibits a noticeable gap between\nthe discrete points and the dense 2D pixels of images. To tackle this issue, we\npropose UniGS, integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into multi-modal\npre-training to enhance the 3D representation. We first rely on the 3DGS\nrepresentation to model the 3D world as a collection of 3D Gaussians with color\nand opacity, incorporating all the information of the 3D scene while\nestablishing a strong connection with 2D images. Then, to achieve\nLanguage-Image-3D pertaining, UniGS starts with a pre-trained vision-language\nmodel to establish a shared visual and textual space through extensive\nreal-world image-text pairs. Subsequently, UniGS employs a 3D encoder to align\nthe optimized 3DGS with the Language-Image representations to learn unified\nmulti-modal representations. To facilitate the extraction of global explicit 3D\nfeatures by the 3D encoder and achieve better cross-modal alignment, we\nadditionally introduce a novel Gaussian-Aware Guidance module that guides the\nlearning of fine-grained representations of the 3D domain.

Efficient training\nin this setting relies on min-edge-cut partitioning algorithms, which minimize\ncross-machine communication due to GNN neighborhood sampling. Yet, min-edge-cut\npartitioning over large graphs remains a challenge: State-of-the-art (SoTA)\noffline methods (e.g., METIS) are effective, but they require orders of\nmagnitude more memory and runtime than GNN training itself, while\ncomputationally efficient algorithms (e.g., streaming greedy approaches) suffer\nfrom increased edge cuts. Thus, in this work we introduce Armada, a new\nend-to-end system for distributed GNN training whose key contribution is GREM,\na novel min-edge-cut partitioning algorithm that can efficiently scale to large\ngraphs. GREM builds on streaming greedy approaches with one key addition: prior\nvertex assignments are continuously refined during streaming, rather than\nfrozen after an initial greedy selection. Our theoretical analysis and\nexperimental results show that this refinement is critical to minimizing edge\ncuts and enables GREM to reach partition quality comparable to METIS but with\n8-65x less memory and 8-46x faster. Given a partitioned graph, Armada leverages\na new disaggregated architecture for distributed GNN training to further\nimprove efficiency; we find that on common cloud machines, even with zero\ncommunication, GNN neighborhood sampling and feature loading bottleneck\ntraining. Disaggregation allows Armada to independently allocate resources for\nthese operations and ensure that expensive GPUs remain saturated with\ncomputation. We evaluate Armada against SoTA systems for distributed GNN\ntraining and find that the disaggregated architecture leads to runtime\nimprovements up to 4.5x and cost reductions up to 3.1x.",

    "abstract": "Without rigorous attention to the completeness of earthquake catalogs, claims\nof new discoveries or forecasting skills cannot be deemed credible. Therefore,\nestimating the completeness magnitude (Mc) is a critical step. Among various\napproaches, catalog-based methods are the simplest, most straightforward, and\nmost commonly used. However, current evaluation frameworks for these methods\nlack a unified simulation strategy for generating catalogs that are independent\nof specific Mc estimation methods. An effective strategy should also be capable\nof simulating datasets with non-uniform Mc distributions across both spatial\nand temporal dimensions. In this study, we assess nine catalog-based methods\nunder a robust evaluation framework specifically tailored for this purpose.\nThese methods are tested on datasets with homogeneous and heterogeneous Mc\ndistributions, as well as on real-world earthquake catalogs. The method of\nb-value stability by Woessner and Wiemer (2005), referred to as MBS-WW in this\nstudy, demonstrates the best overall performance. The prior model generated by\nMBS-WW is used as the foundation for generating an updated Mc map for China\nwith the Bayesian Magnitude of Completeness (BMC) method. We also introduce,\nBSReLU, an augmented Gutenberg-Richter model with a novel probabilistic\nframework for modeling. The BSReLU model replaces deterministic estimates of Mc\nwith a probabilistic framework that models the smooth transition in detection\nlikelihood from zero to one as earthquake magnitudes increase. By evaluating\nthe limitations of these foundational catalog-based methods, this study seeks\nto refine our understanding of their appropriate applications, offering a\nclearer, unbiased perspective on seismicity through improved observational data\nquality.",

    "abstract": "Attention-based transformers have played an important role in wireless sensor\nnetwork (WSN) timing anomaly detection due to their ability to capture\nlong-term dependencies. However, there are several issues that must be\naddressed, such as the fact that their ability to capture long-term\ndependencies is not completely reliable, their computational complexity levels\nare high, and the spatiotemporal features of WSN timing data are not\nsufficiently extracted for detecting the correlation anomalies of multinode WSN\ntiming data. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a WSN anomaly\ndetection method that integrates frequency-domain features with dynamic graph\nneural networks (GNN) under a designed self-encoder reconstruction framework.\nFirst, the discrete wavelet transform effectively decomposes trend and seasonal\ncomponents of time series to solve the poor long-term reliability of\ntransformers. Second, a frequency-domain attention mechanism is designed to\nmake full use of the difference between the amplitude distributions of normal\ndata and anomalous data in this domain. Finally, a multimodal fusion-based\ndynamic graph convolutional network (MFDGCN) is designed by combining an\nattention mechanism and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to adaptively\nextract spatial correlation features. A series of experiments conducted on\npublic datasets and their results demonstrate that the anomaly detection method\ndesigned in this paper exhibits superior precision and recall than the existing\nmethods do, with an F1 score of 93.5%, representing an improvement of 2.9% over\nthat of the existing models.",

However,\nconventional diagnostic AI systems lack decision transparency and cannot\noperate well in environments where there is a lack of pixel-level annotations.\nIn this study, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based\nframework, TagGAN, which is tailored for weakly-supervised fine-grained disease\nmap generation from purely image-level labeled data. TagGAN generates a\npixel-level disease map during domain translation from an abnormal image to a\nnormal representation.

Our method is first to generate fine-grained\ndisease maps to visualize disease lesions in a weekly supervised setting\nwithout requiring pixel-level annotations. This development enhances the\ninterpretability of diagnostic AI by providing precise visualizations of\ndisease-specific regions. It also introduces automated binary mask generation\nto assist radiologists. Empirical evaluations carried out on the benchmark\ndatasets, CheXpert, TBX11K, and COVID-19, demonstrate the capability of TagGAN\nto outperform current top models in accurately identifying disease-specific\npixels.

Incorporating this\nmechanism into our model leads to quantitative agreement with the experiments\nwithout fitting parameters. Our work provides new insights into colloidal\nmotion in complex fluids with microstructural inhomogeneities, offers a simple\nmechanistic theory for predicting the resulting migration, and underscores the\nnecessity of assimilating these findings in future designs of micro-machinery\nincluding swimmers, actuators, rheometers, and so on.",

Fractional\nsolitons are unstable at LI smaller or equal to 1, or LI smaller or equal to 2\nin uniform one-dimensional media with the cubic or quintic self-focusing,\nrespectively. We demonstrate that, in these cases, the solitons may be\neffectively stabilized by pinning to a delta-functional trapping potential\n(attractive defect), which is a relevant setting in optical waveguides with the\neffective fractional diffraction. Using the respective fractional nonlinear\nSchroedinger equation with the delta-functional potential term, we find that,\nin the case of the cubic self-focusing, the fractional solitons are fully\nstabilized by the pinning to the defect for LI = 1, and partly stabilized for\nLI < 1.

To tackle these challenges, hybrid beamforming with orthogonal\ndelay-Doppler multiplexing modulation (ODDM) is investigated in this paper.\nFirst, the integration of delay-Doppler waveform and MIMO is explored by\nderiving a hybrid beamforming-based UM-MIMO ODDM input-output relation.

For an image block size of 2^Sx2^Sy with q\ngray levels, the complexity of our approach can be succinctly expressed as,\nO[3q+log2Sx+log2Sy+2q(log2Sx+log2Sy)]. Here, Sx and Sy represent the X and Y\npositional control gates while q indicates the non-zero transform coefficients.\nMoreover, experimental evaluations strongly demonstrate that it excels in both\ncompressing and representing quantum images compared to the DCTEFRQI approach,\nparticularly excelling in the essential metrics of gate requirements and PSNR\nperformance. Embrace the future of quantum imaging with our innovative\nsolution, where efficiency meets excellence.",

    "abstract": "Users and creators are two crucial components of recommender systems. Typical\nrecommender systems focus on the user side, providing the most suitable items\nbased on each user's request. In such scenarios, a few items receive a majority\nof exposures, while many items receive very few. This imbalance leads to poorer\nexperiences and decreased activity among the creators receiving less feedback,\nharming the recommender system in the long term. To this end, we develop a\ncreator-side recommender system, called DualRec, to answer the following\nquestion: how to find the most suitable users for each item to enhance the\ncreators' experience? We show that typical user-side recommendation algorithms,\nsuch as retrieval and ranking algorithms, can be adapted into the creator-side\nversions with just a few modifications. This greatly simplifies algorithm\ndesign in DualRec. Moreover, we discuss a unique challenge in DualRec: the user\navailability issue, which is not present in user-side recommender systems. To\ntackle this issue, we incorporate a user availability calculation (UAC) module\nto effectively enhance DualRec's performance. DualRec has already been\nimplemented in Kwai, a short video recommendation system with over 100 millions\nuser and over 10 million creators, significantly improving the experience for\ncreators.",

    "abstract": "Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous\nenvironments. Traditional planning methods excel at long-horizon tasks but rely\non a predefined graph with fixed distance metrics. In contrast, safe\nReinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors without relying on\nmanual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in\ngoal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of\nboth planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL and safe RL\nto learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating\ncumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an\nautomated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the\nreplay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based\nplan that the agent follows until reaching its goal, effectively balancing\nfaster and safer routes over extended distances.\n  Utilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level\ngoal-conditioned safe RL policy, we extend this approach to address the\nmulti-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based\nSearch (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for\ntheir safe navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the\nscalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling\nefficient coordination among agents.\n  Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple\nagents in complex and hazardous environments.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in time series\nanalysis. However, the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), particularly\nvision-language models, for time series remains largely under-explored. One\nnatural way for humans to detect time series anomalies is through visualization\nand textual description. Motivated by this, we raise a critical and practical\nresearch question: Can multimodal LLMs perform time series anomaly detection?\nTo answer this, we propose VisualTimeAnomaly benchmark to evaluate MLLMs in\ntime series anomaly detection (TSAD). Our approach transforms time series\nnumerical data into the image format and feed these images into various MLLMs,\nincluding proprietary models (GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5) and open-source models\n(LLaVA-NeXT and Qwen2-VL), each with one larger and one smaller variant. In\ntotal, VisualTimeAnomaly contains 12.4k time series images spanning 3 scenarios\nand 3 anomaly granularities with 9 anomaly types across 8 MLLMs. Starting with\nthe univariate case (point- and range-wise anomalies), we extend our evaluation\nto more practical scenarios, including multivariate and irregular time series\nscenarios, and variate-wise anomalies. Our study reveals several key insights:\n  1) MLLMs detect range- and variate-wise anomalies more effectively than\npoint-wise anomalies.\n  2) MLLMs are highly robust to irregular time series, even with 25% of the\ndata missing.\n  3) Open-source MLLMs perform comparably to proprietary models in TSAD. While\nopen-source MLLMs excel on univariate time series, proprietary MLLMs\ndemonstrate superior effectiveness on multivariate time series.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to comprehensively\ninvestigate MLLMs for TSAD, particularly for multivariate and irregular time\nseries scenarios.

In contrast to text-based\nLLMs, the evaluation framework for SDMs should encompass both cognitive\ndimensions (e.g., logical reasoning, knowledge) and speech-related aspects\n(e.g., paralinguistic cues, audio quality). However, there is still a lack of\ncomprehensive evaluations for SDMs in speech-to-speech (S2S) scenarios. To\naddress this gap, we propose URO-Bench, an extensive benchmark for SDMs.\nNotably, URO-Bench is the first S2S benchmark that covers evaluations about\nmultilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and paralinguistics. Our benchmark is\ndivided into two difficulty levels: basic track and pro track, each comprising\n20 test sets, evaluating the spoken dialogue model's abilities in\nUnderstanding, Reasoning, and Oral conversation. Evaluations on our proposed\nbenchmark reveal that current open-source SDMs perform rather well in daily QA\ntasks, but lag behind their backbone LLMs in terms of instruction-following\nability and also suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Their performance in\nadvanced evaluations of paralinguistic information and audio understanding\nremains subpar, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.\nWe hope that URO-Bench can facilitate the development of spoken dialogue models\nby providing a multifaceted evaluation of existing models and helping to track\nprogress in this area.",

This assumption\nintroduces complexity, especially with multi-dimensional agent types, leading\nto mechanisms that, while optimal, may appear complex and unnatural.\nFurthermore, Hart and Nisan (2019) show that the gap between the performance of\nany simple mechanism and the optimal solution could be potentially unbounded.\nWe challenge this conventional view by showing that simple mechanisms can be\nhighly competitive if the information structure is endogenous and can be\ninfluenced by the designer.\n  We study a multi-dimensional generalization of a single-dimensional model\nproposed by Bergemann and Pesendorfer (2007), where the designer can shape the\ninformation structure via information disclosure. Specifically, we consider a\nfundamental multi-dimensional mechanism design problem, where a seller is\nselling m items to a single unit-demand buyer to maximize her revenue. The\nbuyer's values can be arbitrarily correlated across the items. Our main result\nshows that, following an appropriately chosen information disclosure scheme,\nitem pricing, i.e., set a take-it-or-leave-it price on each item is highly\ncompetitive and guarantees to attain at least 50.1% of the optimal revenue. To\nour knowledge, this is the first result demonstrating the (approximate)\noptimality of simple mechanisms in this extensively studied multi-dimensional\nsetting, without making any assumptions about the buyer's value distribution.\nWe believe our result not only demonstrates the power of information disclosure\nin enhancing the performance of simple mechanisms but also suggests a new\nframework for reevaluating their efficacy in multi-dimensional settings.",

Remote observations from GOES and CHASE captured two\nM5.0+ solar flares that peaked at 23:34 and 00:06 UT from the source region. In\ntandem, STEREO COR2 first recorded a small, narrow coronal mass ejection (CME)\nemerging at 22:54 UT and then saw a major halo CME emerge at 23:43 UT with a\nbright, rapidly expanding core and CME-driven magnetic shock with an estimated\nspeed of $\\sim$1400 $kms^{-1}$. Parker Solar Probe was positioned at 0.65 au,\nnear-perfectly on the nominal Parker spiral magnetic field line which connected\nEarth and the active region for a 537 $kms^{-1}$ ambient solar wind speed at\nL1. This fortuitous alignment provided the opportunity to examine how the SEP\nvelocity dispersion, energy spectra, elemental composition, and fluence varied\nfrom 0.65 to 1 au along a shared magnetic connection to the Sun.

Accurate modeling of the Sun's convective\nlayers is vital to predicting the Sun's behavior, including the solar dynamo\nand sunspot cycles. Currently, there are many efficient codes capable of\nconducting these large simulations; however, many assume an anealastic density\ndistribution. The anelastic assumption is capable of producing accurate results\nfor low mach numbers; however, it fails in regions with a higher mach number\nand a fully compressible flow must be considered. To avoid these issues, Wang\net al. [1] created a Compressible High-ORder Unstructured Spectral difference\n(CHORUS) code for simulating fluid dynamics inside stars and planets. CHORUS++\naugmented the CHORUS code to adopt a higher degree of polynomials by using\ncubed-sphere meshing and transfinite mapping to perform simulations on\nunstructured grids [2]. Recently, CHORUS++ was further developed for parallel\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solutions on GPUs at Clarkson University. In this\nstudy the solar benchmark problems presented by Chen et al.

Successful implementation of\nthese epitaxial techniques depends on creating a robust, uniform\ntwo-dimensional (2D) material surface. The conventional method for fabricating\ngraphene on silicon carbide (SiC) is high-temperature graphitization. However,\nthe extremely high temperature required for silicon sublimation (typically\nabove 1500 {\\deg}C) causes step-bunching of the SiC surface, forming\nnon-uniform multilayer graphene stripes and an unfavorable surface morphology\nfor epitaxial growth. Here, we developed a wafer-scale graphitization technique\nthat allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at ultra-low\ntemperatures by metal-assisted graphitization (MAG). We found annealing\nconditions that enable SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation,\nproducing uniform single-crystalline graphene while maintaining the surface\nmorphology of the substrate. The graphene thickness can be controlled by\nvarying the metal thickness or annealing temperature, enabling remote epitaxy\nor vdWE. We successfully produced freestanding single-crystalline III-N (AlN,\nGaN) films on graphene/SiC via the 2D material-based layer transfer technique.\nOur results show that low-temperature graphene synthesis via MAG offers a\npromising route to producing large-scale ultra-wide bandgap free-standing\ncrystalline membranes.",

    "abstract": "Radio interferometers must grapple with apparent fields of view that distort\nthe true radio sky. These so-called 'A-term' distortions may be direction-,\ntime- and baseline-dependent, and include effects like the primary beam and the\nionosphere. Traditionally, properly handling these effects has been\ncomputationally expensive and, instead, less accurate, ad-hoc methods have been\nemployed. Image domain gridding (IDG; van der Tol et al., 2018) is a recently\ndeveloped algorithm that promises to account for these A-terms both accurately\nand efficiently. Here we describe a new implementation of IDG known as the\nParallel Interferometric GPU Imager (Pigi). Pigi is capable of imaging at rates\nof almost half a billion visibilities per second on modest hardware, making it\nwell suited for the projected data rates of the Square Kilometre Array, and is\ncompatible with both NVIDIA and AMD GPU hardware. Its accuracy is principally\nlimited only by the degree to which A-terms are spatially sampled. Using\nsimulated data from the Murchison Widefield Array, we demonstrate the\nextraordinary effectiveness of Pigi in correcting for extreme ionospheric\neffects, and point to future work that would enable these results on real-world\ndata.",

This\nformulation, termed mean-field wave kinetics (MFWK), is based on the Weyl\nsymbol calculus and allows describing the interaction between the mean fields\n(magnetic field and fluid velocity) and turbulence without requiring scale\nseparation that is commonly assumed in literature. The turbulence is described\nby the Wigner--Moyal equation for the spectrum of the two-point correlation\nmatrix (Wigner matrix) of magnetic-field and velocity fluctuations and depicts\nthe turbulence as an effective plasma of quantumlike particles that interact\nvia the mean fields. Eddy--eddy interactions, which serve as `collisions' in\nthis effective plasma, are modeled within the standard minimal tau\napproximation to aid comparison with existing theories. Using MFWK, the\nnonlocal electromotive force is calculated for generic turbulence from first\nprinciples, modulo the limitations of MFWK. This result is then used to study,\nboth analytically and numerically, the modulational modes of MHD turbulence,\nwhich appear as linear instabilities of said effective quantumlike plasma of\nfluctuations.

The key principle of WDMA is to\nallocate each user with a dedicated waveguide, which is regarded as a new type\nof radio resources, so as to facilitate multi-user communications. By adjusting\nthe activation positions of pinching antennas (PAs) over each waveguide, the\npinching beamforming can be exploited for intended user signal enhancement and\ninter-user interference mitigation. Considering both ideal continuous and\npractical discrete PA position activation schemes, a joint power allocation and\npinching beamforming optimization problem is formulated for the maximization of\nthe sum rate. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to\naddress the formulated nonconvex problem. For solving the power allocation\nsubproblem, the successive convex approximation method is invoked. For the\npinching beamforming design subproblem, a penalty-based gradient ascent\nalgorithm is first developed for the continuous PA activation case. Then, for\nthe discrete PA activation case, a matching theory-based algorithm is proposed\nto achieve the near-optimal performance but with a low complexity. Numerical\nresults unveil that: 1) For both continuous and discrete activation cases, PASS\ncan achieve a significant performance gain over conventional fixed-position\nantenna systems; 2) the proposed WDMA can effectively underpin multi-user\ncommunications with the near orthogonality in free space achieved by the\npinching beamforming; and 3) the performance gap between the discrete and\ncontinuous activation cases can be significantly alleviated with practically\nfeasible numbers of PA candidate positions.",

    "abstract": "Tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) search occurs when a user struggles to recall a\nspecific identifier, such as a document title. While common, existing search\nsystems often fail to effectively support TOT scenarios. Research on TOT\nretrieval is further constrained by the challenge of collecting queries, as\ncurrent approaches rely heavily on community question-answering (CQA) websites,\nleading to labor-intensive evaluation and domain bias. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce two methods for eliciting TOT queries - leveraging\nlarge language models (LLMs) and human participants - to facilitate simulated\nevaluations of TOT retrieval systems. Our LLM-based TOT user simulator\ngenerates synthetic TOT queries at scale, achieving high correlations with how\nCQA-based TOT queries rank TOT retrieval systems when tested in the Movie\ndomain. Additionally, these synthetic queries exhibit high linguistic\nsimilarity to CQA-derived queries. For human-elicited queries, we developed an\ninterface that uses visual stimuli to place participants in a TOT state,\nenabling the collection of natural queries. In the Movie domain, system rank\ncorrelation and linguistic similarity analyses confirm that human-elicited\nqueries are both effective and closely resemble CQA-based queries. These\napproaches reduce reliance on CQA-based data collection while expanding\ncoverage to underrepresented domains, such as Landmark and Person. LLM-elicited\nqueries for the Movie, Landmark, and Person domains have been released as test\nqueries in the TREC 2024 TOT track, with human-elicited queries scheduled for\ninclusion in the TREC 2025 TOT track. Additionally, we provide source code for\nsynthetic query generation and the human query collection interface, along with\ncurated visual stimuli used for eliciting TOT queries.",

Traditional manual screening methods are\ntime-consuming and prone to errors. While AI-powered pre-screening offers\npotential solutions, challenges remain regarding accuracy, efficiency, and data\nprivacy. Methods: We developed a novel patient pre-screening pipeline that\nleverages clinical expertise to guide the precise, safe, and efficient\napplication of large language models. The pipeline breaks down complex criteria\ninto a series of composite questions and then employs two strategies to perform\nsemantic question-answering through electronic health records - (1) Pathway A,\nAnthropomorphized Experts' Chain of Thought strategy, and (2) Pathway B, Preset\nStances within an Agent Collaboration strategy, particularly in managing\ncomplex clinical reasoning scenarios. The pipeline is evaluated on three key\nmetrics-precision, time consumption, and counterfactual inference - at both the\nquestion and criterion levels. Results: Our pipeline achieved high precision\n(0.921, in criteria level) and efficiency (0.44s per task). Pathway B excelled\nin complex reasoning, while Pathway A was effective in precise data extraction\nwith faster processing times. Both pathways achieved comparable precision. The\npipeline showed promising results in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.878) and\ncirrhosis trials (0.843). Conclusions: This data-secure and time-efficient\npipeline shows high precision in hepatopathy trials, providing promising\nsolutions for streamlining clinical trial workflows. Its efficiency and\nadaptability make it suitable for improving patient recruitment.

In this paper, we provide rigorous privacy and utility\ncharacterization for DPSGD for smooth loss functions in both bounded and\nunbounded domains. We track the privacy loss over multiple iterations by\nexploiting the noisy smooth-reduction property and establish the utility\nanalysis by leveraging the projection's non-expansiveness and clipped SGD\nproperties.

Experimental evaluation on a 10TB distributed dataset demonstrates\nthat our approach achieves 96.4% detection accuracy, outperforming traditional\nbaseline models by 4.1 percentage points. The system reduces both false\npositive and false negative rates by 1.8 and 2.4 percentage points\nrespectively. Performance analysis shows that our system maintains efficient\nprocessing capabilities in distributed environments, requiring 180 seconds for\nmodel training and 3.8 seconds for threat detection across the distributed\nnetwork. These results demonstrate significant improvements in detection\naccuracy and computational efficiency while preserving data privacy, suggesting\nstrong potential for real-world deployment in large-scale security systems.",

    "abstract": "Oculomotor alterations constitute a promising biomarker to detect and\ncharacterize Parkinson's disease (PD), even in prodromal stages. Currently,\nonly global and simplified eye movement trajectories are employed to\napproximate the complex and hidden kinematic relationships of the oculomotor\nfunction. Recent advances on machine learning and video analysis have\nencouraged novel characterizations of eye movement patterns to quantify PD.\nThese schemes enable the identification of spatiotemporal segments primarily\nassociated with PD. However, they rely on discriminative models that require\nlarge training datasets and depend on balanced class distributions. This work\nintroduces a novel video analysis scheme to quantify Parkinsonian eye fixation\npatterns with an anomaly detection framework. Contrary to classical deep\ndiscriminative schemes that learn differences among labeled classes, the\nproposed approach is focused on one-class learning, avoiding the necessity of a\nsignificant amount of data. The proposed approach focuses only on Parkinson's\nrepresentation, considering any other class sample as an anomaly of the\ndistribution. This approach was evaluated for an ocular fixation task, in a\ntotal of 13 control subjects and 13 patients on different stages of the\ndisease. The proposed digital biomarker achieved an average sensitivity and\nspecificity of 0.97 and 0.63, respectively, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.95.

To address this issue, a Vessel Connectivity Network (VC-Net) was\ndeveloped for label-free assessment of vascular connectivity.

The VC-Net successfully evaluated the vascular connectivity with no\nsignificant deviation from that by fluorescence imaging.

    "abstract": "This thesis concerns the use of reinforcement learning to train neural\nnetworks to aid in the design of public transit networks. The Transit Network\nDesign Problem (TNDP) is an optimization problem of considerable practical\nimportance. Given a city with an existing road network and travel demands, the\ngoal is to find a set of transit routes - each of which is a path through the\ngraph - that collectively satisfy all demands, while minimizing a cost function\nthat may depend both on passenger satisfaction and operating costs. The\nexisting literature on this problem mainly considers metaheuristic optimization\nalgorithms, such as genetic algorithms and ant-colony optimization. By\ncontrast, we begin by taking a reinforcement learning approach, formulating the\nconstruction of a set of transit routes as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and\ntraining a neural net policy to act as the agent in this MDP. We then show\nthat, beyond using this policy to plan a transit network directly, it can be\ncombined with existing metaheuristic algorithms, both to initialize the\nsolution and to suggest promising moves at each step of a search through\nsolution space. We find that such hybrid algorithms, which use a neural policy\ntrained via reinforcement learning as a core component within a classical\nmetaheuristic framework, can plan transit networks that are superior to those\nplanned by either the neural policy or the metaheuristic algorithm. We\ndemonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to redesign the transit\nnetwork for the city of Laval, Quebec, and show that in simulation, the\nresulting transit network provides better service at lower cost than the\nexisting transit network.",

One of its peculiarities is the presence of a metal-rich population\nwhich does not show the phenomenon of light-element anti-correlations (C-N,\nNa-O, Mg-Al), a trait that is considered as characteristic of Galactic Globular\nClusters, and is in fact present among more metal-poor Omega Cen stars, leading\nto speculations that such anomalous population was accreted by the cluster. In\nthis paper, we aim at investigating the kinematics of Omega Cen populations to\ngain insight on the formation scenario of the cluster. Using the newly released\nGaia FPR and DR3 catalogue, we conducted a detailed kinematical analysis of\ncluster members within Omega Cen.

The mean proper motions (mu_r and mu_t) of the metallicity\npopulations do not show any significant differences.

This sequential zonotope fusion offers\nreduced computational complexity compared to batch zonotope fusion. Notice that\nthe proposed zonotope fusion criteria are designed to meet the state inclusion\nproperty and demonstrate performance superiority over local zonotopic\nestimates.

Their unique\nstructures and usage patterns can hinder the direct application of methods\nprimarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which\nhas relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less\nfrequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first\nbenchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists\nof text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres.\n  By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we\nilluminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated\nKorean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection\nmethod specifically designed for the Korean language. KatFishNet achieves an\naverage of 19.78% higher AUROC compared to the best-performing existing\ndetection method.

Malicious users\ncan exploit LLMs to produce paraphrased versions of proprietary code that\nclosely resemble the original. While the potential for LLM-assisted code\nparaphrasing continues to grow, research on detecting it remains limited,\nunderscoring an urgent need for detection system. We respond to this need by\nproposing two tasks. The first task is to detect whether code generated by an\nLLM is a paraphrased version of original human-written code. The second task is\nto identify which LLM is used to paraphrase the original code. For these tasks,\nwe construct a dataset LPcode consisting of pairs of human-written code and\nLLM-paraphrased code using various LLMs.\n  We statistically confirm significant differences in the coding styles of\nhuman-written and LLM-paraphrased code, particularly in terms of naming\nconsistency, code structure, and readability. Based on these findings, we\ndevelop LPcodedec, a detection method that identifies paraphrase relationships\nbetween human-written and LLM-generated code, and discover which LLM is used\nfor the paraphrasing.

    "abstract": "With the growing number of gravitational wave detections, achieving a\ncompetitive measurement of $H_0$ with dark sirens is becoming increasingly\nfeasible. The expansion of the Ligo-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration into a four\ndetector network will reduce both the localisation area and the luminosity\ndistance uncertainty associated with each gravitational wave event. It is\ntherefore essential to identify and mitigate other major sources of error that\ncould increase the uncertainty in $H_0$. In this work, we explore three\nscenarios relevant to the dark siren method in future observing runs. First, we\ndemonstrate that there is a precision gain offered by a catalogue of\nspectroscopic-like redshifts compared to photometric-like redshifts, with the\ngreatest improvements observed in smaller localisation areas. Second, we show\nthat redshift outliers (as occur in realistic photometric redshift catalogues),\ndo not introduce bias into the measurement of $H_0$. Finally, we find that\nuniformly sub-sampling spectroscopic-like redshift catalogues increases the\nuncertainty in $H_0$ as the completeness fraction is decreased; at a\ncompleteness of 50% the benefit of spectroscopic redshift precision is\noutweighed by the degradation from incompleteness. In all three scenarios, we\nobtain unbiased estimates of $H_0$. We conclude that a competitive measurement\nof $H_0$ using the dark siren method will require a hybrid catalogue of both\nphotometric and spectroscopic redshifts, at least until highly complete\nspectroscopic catalogues become available.",

Here, we report such a process consisting of\nsequential exposures of O$_2$ plasma and H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma. Exposure to O$_2$\nplasma rather than O$_2$ gas yields a greater fraction of Nb in the +5\noxidation state, which is then volatilized by NbF$_5$ formation with exposure\nto an H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma. The SF$_6$:H$_2$ flow rate ratio is chosen to\nproduce selective etching of Nb$_2$O$_5$ over NbN, enabling self-limiting\netching within a cycle. An etch rate of 1.77 \\r{A}/cycle was measured at 125\n$^\\circ$C using ex-situ ellipsometry.

Although Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Model\nPredictive Control controllers are widely used in these applications, they\noften require accurate system knowledge, struggle with repeatability when\nfacing payload or configuration changes, and can be time-consuming to\nfine-tune.

We characterize the efficiency lower bound\nunder the semi-supervised setting for an arbitrary inferential problem, and\nshow that incorporating unlabeled data can potentially improve efficiency if\nthe parameter is not well-specified. We then propose two types of\nsemi-supervised estimators: a safe estimator that imposes minimal assumptions,\nis simple to compute, and is guaranteed to be at least as efficient as the\ninitial supervised estimator; and an efficient estimator, which -- under\nstronger assumptions -- achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound.

    "abstract": "Domination theory has been studied extensively in the context of binary\nmonotone systems, where the structure function is a sum of products of the\ncomponent state variables, and with coefficients given by the signed domination\nfunction. Using e.g., matroid theory, many useful properties of the signed\ndomination function has been derived. In this paper we show how some of these\nresults can be extended to multistate systems. In particular, we show how the\nsigned domination function can be extended to such systems. Using M\\\"{o}bius\ninversion we show how the signed domination function can be expressed in terms\nof a multistate structure function. Moreover, using this expression we show how\ncalculating the signed domination function of a multistate system can be\nreduced to calculating the signed domination function of an associated binary\nsystem. This way many results from binary theory can easily be extended to\nmultistate theory.",

    "abstract": "Power-free integers and related lattice subsets give rise to interesting\ndynamical systems. They are revisited from a spectral perspective, in the\nsetting of the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. With respect to the natural patch\nfrequency measure, also known as the Mirsky measure, many of these systems have\npure-point dynamical spectrum, but trivial topological point spectrum. We\ncalculate the spectra explicitly, in additive notation, and derive their group\nstructure, both for a large class of $\\mathcal{B}$-free lattice systems in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ and for power-free integers in quadratic number fields. Further,\nin all cases, the eigenfunctions can be given in closed form, via the\nFourier--Bohr coefficients on the dense translation orbit of a generic element.\nBased on a simple argument via Kolmogorov's strong law of large numbers, we\nshow that they are also the eigenfunctions for the unique measure of maximal\nentropy.",

    "abstract": "The modern theory of polarization does not apply in its original form to\nsystems with non-trivial band topology. Chern insulators are one such example\nsince they are insulating in the bulk but exhibit metallic edge states,\ncomplicating the definition of polarization. Wannier functions formed a key\ningredient of the original modern theory of polarization, but it has been\nconsidered that these cannot be applied to Chern insulators since they are no\nlonger exponentially localized and the Wannier center is no longer gauge\ninvariant. In this Letter, we provide an unambiguous definition of absolute\npolarization for a Chern insulator in terms of the Zak phase. We obtain our\nexpression by studying the non-quantized fractional charge bound to lattice\ndislocations and it can be computed directly from bulk quantities and makes no\nassumption on the edge state filling. Our result is fully consistent with\nprevious results on the quantized charge bound to dislocations in the presence\nof crystalline symmetry. At the same time, our result is more general since it\nalso applies to Chern insulators which do not have crystalline symmetries other\nthan translations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents Phoeni6, a systematic approach for assessing the energy\nconsumption of neural networks while upholding the principles of fair\ncomparison and reproducibility. Phoeni6 offers a comprehensive solution for\nmanaging energy-related data and configurations, ensuring portability,\ntransparency, and coordination during evaluations. The methodology automates\nenergy evaluations through containerized tools, robust database management, and\nversatile data models. In the first case study, the energy consumption of\nAlexNet and MobileNet was compared using raw and resized images. Results showed\nthat MobileNet is up to 6.25% more energy-efficient for raw images and 2.32%\nfor resized datasets, while maintaining competitive accuracy levels. In the\nsecond study, the impact of image file formats on energy consumption was\nevaluated. BMP images reduced energy usage by up to 30% compared to PNG,\nhighlighting the influence of file formats on energy efficiency. These findings\nemphasize the importance of Phoeni6 in optimizing energy consumption for\ndiverse neural network applications and establishing sustainable artificial\nintelligence practices.",
