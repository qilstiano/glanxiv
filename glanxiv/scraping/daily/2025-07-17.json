    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug\ndesign by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with\nhigh affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent\nchallenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in\nidentifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose\nAutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive\ndomain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to\nprogressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The\ncomprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline\nmethods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two\nclinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate\nAutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving\nexpert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their\nmechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we\nfind that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug\ndesign which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further\nrevealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach\nfor lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.",

    "abstract": "As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have\nexpanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to\nalign to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more\nhelpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it\nmodels the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a\nnovel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns\ntext-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past\nconversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make\npersonalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We\ntrain the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the\nreward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show\nthat in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context\nlearning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful\naspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we\nshow that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users\ncan be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary\nmodels like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and\nportable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more\ntransparency and user control in LLM alignment.",

    "abstract": "Individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) is a non-pharmacological\nintervention for improving the cognition and quality of life of persons with\ndementia (PwDs); however, its effectiveness is limited by low adherence to\ndelivery by their family members. In this work, we present the user-centered\ndesign and evaluation of a novel socially assistive robotic system to provide\niCST therapy to PwDs in their homes for long-term use. We consulted with 16\ndementia caregivers and professionals. Through these consultations, we gathered\ndesign guidelines and developed the prototype. The prototype was validated by\ntesting it with three dementia professionals and five PwDs. The evaluation\nrevealed PwDs enjoyed using the system and are willing to adopt its use over\nthe long term. One shortcoming was the system's speech-to-text capabilities,\nwhere it frequently failed to understand the PwDs.",

    "abstract": "We represent interdependent infrastructure systems and communities alike with\na hetero-functional graph (HFG) that encodes the dependencies between\nfunctionalities. This graph naturally imposes a partial order of\nfunctionalities that can inform the sequence of repair decisions to be made\nduring a disaster across affected communities. However, using such technical\ncriteria alone provides limited guidance at the point where the functionalities\ndirectly impact the communities, since these can be repaired in any order\nwithout violating the system constraints. To address this gap and improve\nresilience, we integrate community preferences to refine this partial order\nfrom the HFG into a total order. Our strategy involves getting the communities'\nopinions on their preferred sequence for repair crews to address infrastructure\nissues, considering potential constraints on resources. Due to the delay and\ncost associated with real-world survey data, we utilize a Large Language Model\n(LLM) as a proxy survey tool. We use the LLM to craft distinct personas\nrepresenting individuals, each with varied disaster experiences. We construct\ndiverse disaster scenarios, and each simulated persona provides input on\nprioritizing infrastructure repair needs across various communities. Finally,\nwe apply learning algorithms to generate a global order based on the aggregated\nresponses from these LLM-generated personas.",

However, scaling these systems to millions of qubits for\npractical applications poses substantial challenges, particularly due to\ninterconnect bottlenecks. To address this challenge, extensive research has\nfocused on developing cryogenic multiplexers that enable minimal wiring between\nroom-temperature electronics and quantum processors. This paper investigates\nthe viability of commercial microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches for\ncryogenic multiplexers in large-scale quantum computing systems. DC and RF\ncharacteristics of the MEMS switches are evaluated at cryogenic temperatures (<\n10 K) through finite element simulations and experimental measurements. Our\nresults demonstrate that MEMS switches exhibit improved on-resistance, lower\noperating voltage, and superior RF performance at cryogenic temperatures, with\nreliable operation over 100 million cycles. Furthermore, stable single-pole\nfour-throw (SP4T) switching and logical operations, including NAND and NOR\ngates, are demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures, validating their potential\nfor quantum computing. These results underscore the promise of MEMS switches in\nrealizing large-scale quantum computing systems.",

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we analyze three\npolymorphic solid phases -- low-density triangular, stripe, and kagome -- and\nuncover distinct melting pathways. The triangular and kagome crystals undergo\nabrupt first-order transitions, driven by the interplay between energetic\nfrustration and structural reorganization. In particular, the LDT phase melts\nthrough a sharp transition induced by a crossover between the two\ncharacteristic length scales. In contrast, the stripe phase exhibits a\ncontinuous transition with liquid-crystalline features: orientational and\ntranslational order decay gradually, while intra-stripe mobility persists,\nconsistent with a KTHNY-like scenario. These findings demonstrate that melting\nin 2D soft-matter systems is inherently non-universal and governed by the\ncompetition between lattice symmetry, frustration, and multiple interaction\nscales.

Both regimes rely on feedback\nloops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in\nsubsequent steps. While this \"thinking aloud\" mirrors human reasoning,\nbiological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as\nlanguage. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without\nresorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an\nencoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed\npoint. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes\nthe input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix\ninternally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty.

Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,\nconfidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by\npost-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most\nrepresentative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them\nby confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with\nexisting replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay\nfidelity.

    "abstract": "The Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy provides a\ntime-reversal-symmetric framework for describing the nonequilibrium evolution\nof many-body systems. Despite the success of Boltzmann-based numerical\napproaches, systematically extending beyond this lowest-order truncation to the\nfull nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy remains a major challenge. Moreover, even at the\nBoltzmann level, accurately treating the nonlinear collision term still\npresents significant difficulties. Here we propose the spectral BBGKY\nhierarchy, an analytically equivalent and numerically tractable reformulation\nof the conventional BBGKY hierarchy. The spectral formulation reduces the\noriginal 6n-dimensional phase-space problem to the evolution of spectral\ncoefficients over the 3n-dimensional coordinate space. We also develop an\nanalytic scheme for computing the collision integrals, which achieves high\naccuracy and removes the need for ensemble averaging over repeated stochastic\nevolutions from the same initial state. The scheme evaluates the full\neight-fold integral exactly for massless particles, and reduces it to a\nthree-fold one for massive particles. The validity of the spectral BBGKY\nhierarchy is verified through conservation law analysis, comparison with an\nanalytical solution, convergence tests, and analysis of spectral coefficient\nleakage. At minimal truncation, the spectral BBGKY yields a spectral nonlinear\nBoltzmann equation that captures full dynamics with a computational cost\ncomparable to that of linearized approaches. When extended to higher-order\ntruncations, the spectral BBGKY hierarchy provides a flexible framework for\nstudying multiparticle correlations.

    "abstract": "The efficient computer optimization of magnetic resonance pulses and pulse\nsequences involves the calculation of a problem-adapted cost function as well\nas its gradients with respect to all controls applied. The gradients generally\ncan be calculated as a finite difference approximation, as a GRAPE\napproximation, or as an exact function, e.g. by the use of the augmented matrix\nexponentiation, where the exact gradient should lead to best optimization\nconvergence. However, calculation of exact gradients is computationally\nexpensive and analytical exact solutions to the problem would be highly\ndesirable. As the majority of todays pulse optimizations involve a single spin\n1/2, which can be represented by simple rotation matrices in the Bloch space or\nby their corresponding Cayley-Klein/quaternion parameters, the derivations of\nanalytical exact gradient functions appear to be feasible. Taking two\noptimization types, the optimization of point-to-point pulses using\n3D-rotations and the optimization of universal rotation pulses using\nquaternions, analytical solutions for gradients with respect to controls have\nbeen derived. Controls in this case can be conventional $x$ and $y$ pulses, but\nalso $z$-controls, as well as gradients with respect to amplitude and phase of\na pulse shape. In addition, analytical solutions with respect to pseudo\ncontrols, involving holonomic constraints to maximum rf-amplitudes, maximum\nrf-power, or maximum rf-energy, are introduced. Using the hyperbolic tangent\nfunction, maximum values are imposed in a fully continuous and differentiable\nway. The obtained analytical gradients allow the calculation two orders of\nmagnitude faster than the augmented matrix exponential approach. The exact\ngradients for different controls are finally compared in a number of\noptimizations involving broadband pulses for $^{15}$N, $^{13}$C, and $^{19}$F\napplications.",

Feature requests,\ntypically expressed in natural language, often suffer from ambiguity or\nincomplete information due to communication gaps or the requester's limited\ntechnical expertise. These issues can lead to misinterpretation, faulty\nimplementation, and reduced software quality. While seeking clarification from\nrequesters is a common strategy to mitigate these risks, little is known about\nhow developers engage in this clarification process in practice-how they\nformulate clarifying questions, seek technical or contextual details, align on\ngoals and use cases, or decide to close requests without attempting\nclarification. This study investigates how feature requests are prone to NL\ndefects (i.e. ambiguous or incomplete) and the conversational dynamics of\nclarification in open-source software (OSS) development, aiming to understand\nhow developers handle ambiguous or incomplete feature requests. Our findings\nsuggest that feature requests published on the OSS platforms do possess\nambiguity and incompleteness, and in some cases, both.

When clarification occurs, it emphasizes understanding user\nintent/goal and feasibility, rather than technical details.

Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are\nresource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of\nlinguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The\nuse of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought\nto reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the\nutility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity\nrequires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries\n(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream\nnarratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside\nestablished coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to\npredict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone\nrobustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic\ncoherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only\nmodels, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to\n\\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best\n\\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models).

Experiments demonstrate that\nNABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline\nalmost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,\nhuman evaluation score) and visual quality drop.

EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and\nGLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing\nneed for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that\ncapture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.\n  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic\nparameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound\nviews. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on\nKoopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical\nmetadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic\nsequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via\nattention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,\nresulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).\n  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac\npathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the\ncurve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five\nfolds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and\nspecificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based\nanalysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,\nwith optimal discrimination near this threshold.\n  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker\nfor cardiac function.

PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science\nprinciple known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable\ncounterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic\ntraining data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,\nhumor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that\nlearns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.\nThis approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse\nevaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social\ncommunities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by\n46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,\nPrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:\nscholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented\ncommunities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities\nemphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human\njudgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and\ntransparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more\ntrustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.",

This double convergence process leads to\nan implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove\nanalytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical\nobservations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured\nbut locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without\nvanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness\ntowards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning\nmethod for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these\nalgorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space\nbecomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the\nsolution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more\ncomplex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input\nmatrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce\nthe dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of\nthe original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using\nSCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a\nmatrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are\nthen transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the\naddition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.\nSCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series\npose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of\ncompressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension\nis no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates\nthat SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an\nevolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.",

Forecast stability (i.e.,\nconsistency between forecast cycles with different lead times) is particularly\nimportant for \"pre-tactical\" contrail avoidance strategies that adjust routes\nbased on forecasts with lead times as long as 24-48 hours. However, no study to\ndate has systematically quantified the degree to which forecast stability\nlimits the effectiveness of pre-tactical avoidance. This study addresses this\ngap by comparing contrail forecasts generated using ECMWF HRES weather\nforecasts with lead times up to 48 hours to contrail hindcasts generated based\non ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis. An analysis of forecast errors shows low pointwise\nconsistency between persistent-contrail-forming regions in forecasts and\nreanalysis, with pointwise error rates similar to those found in previous\ncomparisons of contrail-forming regions in reanalysis and reality. However, we\nalso show that spatial errors in the locations of contrail-forming regions are\nrelatively small, both when forecasts are compared to reanalysis and when\nreanalysis is compared to in-situ measurements. Finally, we show that designing\na trajectory optimizer to take advantage of relatively small spatial errors\nallows flight trajectory optimizations based on contrail forecasts to reduce\ncontrail climate forcing evaluated based on reanalysis by 80-90% at the 8-24\nhour lead times most relevant to flight planning, with fuel penalties under\n0.4%.

Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated\nseismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong\ncorrelation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz\nfrequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed\nacoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation\nremains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing\naccurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As\na case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise\nrecorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results\nwith those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed\nacoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor\nof 0.11 at 20 Hz.

    "abstract": "I measure and collect timings of phase markers (like eclipse times) for the\norbits of 25 X-ray binaries (XRBs) so as to calculate the steady evolutionary\nperiod change ($\\dot{P}$). I combine these with my observed $\\dot{P}$ measures\nfrom 52 cataclysmic variables (CVs). Further, I subtract out the contributions\nfrom gravitational radiation ($\\dot{P}_{\\rm GR}$) and mass transfer\n($\\dot{P}_{\\rm mt}$), deriving the period change from the residual unknown\nangular momentum loss ($\\dot{P}_{\\rm AML}$=$\\dot{P}$-$\\dot{P}_{\\rm\nGR}$-$\\dot{P}_{\\rm mt}$). I have $\\dot{P}_{\\rm AML}$ measures for 77 XRBs and\nCVs, with these being direct measures of the driver of binary evolution. The\nvenerable Magnetic Braking Model (MBM) of binary evolution has its most\nfundamental predictions tested, with most systems having predictions wrong by\nover one order-of-magnitude. Other proposed mechanisms to explain the AML also\nfail, so we are left with no known mechanism that dominates the AML. An\nalternative path to the AML law is empirical, where my $\\dot{P}_{\\rm AML}$\nmeasures are fitted to a power-law involving the fundamental binary properties.\nWith this, the dominant AML law for systems with orbital periods ($P$) from\n0.13--1.0 days is $\\dot{P}_{\\rm AML} = -1500\\times10^{-12} P^{1.29} M_{\\rm\nprim}^{2.75} M_{\\rm comp}^{-1.00}\\dot{M}^{0.43}_{-8}$, in appropriate units.\nSimilar AML laws for binaries below the Period Gap and for binaries with\n$P$$>$1.0 day are derived. These three AML laws are of good accuracy and are\nthe best representations of the actual evolution for all 77 XRBs and CVs of all\nclasses, so the three taken together can be called `universal'.",

Theoretically envisioned as driven by strong\nelectronic correlations, the intertwined order is usually found to be strongly\ncoupled to the lattice as signaled by pronounced phonon softening. Recently,\nboth charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) and superconductivity have been\ndiscovered in several Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, in particular trilayer\nnickelates RE4Ni3O10 (RE=Pr, La). The nature of the intertwined order and the\nrole of lattice-charge coupling are at the heart of the debate about these\nmaterials. Using inelastic X-ray scattering, we mapped the phonon dispersions\nin RE4Ni3O10 and found no evidence of phonon softening near the CDW wavevector\nover a wide temperature range. Calculations of the electronic susceptibility\nrevealed a peak at the observed SDW ordering vector but not at the CDW\nwavevector. The absence of phonon softening is in sharp contrast to that in\ncanonical oxide materials, notably cuprates. Our experimental and theoretical\nfindings highlight the crucial role of the spin degree of freedom and establish\na foundation for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and\ndensity-wave transitions in RP nickelate superconductors and beyond.",

By introducing advanced context-aware\ntoken management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed\narchitecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility\nenvironments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces\ntoken consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to\nTrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to\n23.0% improvement in efficiency.",

We\ndeveloped Metamate for Code Review (MetaMateCR) that provides AI-assisted fixes\nfor reviewer comments in production at scale.\n  Method. We developed an internal benchmark of 64k <review comment, patch>\ndata points to fine-tune Llama models. Once our models achieve reasonable\noffline results, we roll them into production. To ensure that our AI-assisted\nfixes do not negatively impact the time it takes to do code reviews, we conduct\nrandomized controlled safety trials as well as full production experiments.\n  Offline Results. As a baseline, we compare GPT-4o to our small and large\nLlama models. In offline results, our LargeLSFT model creates an exact match\npatch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The\ninternal models also use more modern Hack functions when compared to the PHP\nfunctions suggested by GPT-4o.\n  Safety Trial. When we roll MetaMateCR into production in a safety trial that\ncompares no AI patches with AI patch suggestions, we see a large regression\nwith reviewers taking over 5% longer to conduct reviews. After investigation,\nwe modify the UX to only show authors the AI patches, and see no regressions in\nthe time for reviews.\n  Production. When we roll LargeLSFT into production, we see an\nActionableToApplied rate of 19.7%, which is a 9.2pp improvement over GPT-4o.\nOur results illustrate the importance of safety trials in ensuring that AI does\nnot inadvertently slow down engineers, and a successful review comment to AI\npatch product running at scale.",

Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled\ndecision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system\ninteractions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL\nhas generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function\napproximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's\npolicy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify\nthe issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited\ninterpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces\nmodel-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy\napproximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and\nconstraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system\nknowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions,\nwhile deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We\noutline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents --\nexemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning\napproaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies,\nalong with their respective strengths.

Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry).

Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose\na novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)\nper-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such\nas matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,\nour method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the\nMVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering\nto error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a\nrobust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We\nevaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV\nimagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\napproaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,\nenergy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often\nlag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.\nWe show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in\ndifferent layers, discovered automatically by a tailored\nneural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from\nstandard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired\nlearning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to\nuse in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired\nlearning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a\nsingle rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of\nbio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on\nCIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on\nImageNet.

    "abstract": "Code samples play a pivotal role in open-source ecosystems (OSSECO), serving\nas lightweight artifacts that support knowledge transfer, onboarding, and\nframework adoption. Despite their instructional relevance, these samples are\noften governed informally, with minimal review and unclear ownership, which\nincreases their exposure to socio-technical degradation. In this context, the\nco-occurrence and longitudinal interplay of code smells (e.g., large classes,\npoor modularity) and community smells (e.g., lone contributors, fragmented\ncommunication) become particularly critical. While each type of smell has been\nstudied in isolation, little is known about how community-level dysfunctions\nanticipate or exacerbate technical anomalies in code samples over time. This\nstudy investigates how code and community smells emerge, co-occur, and evolve\nwithin code samples maintained in OSSECOs. A Multivocal Literature Review\nprotocol was applied, encompassing 30 peer-reviewed papers and 17\npractitioner-oriented sources (2013-2024). Thematic synthesis was conducted to\nidentify recurring socio-technical patterns related to smell dynamics. Nine\npatterns were identified, showing that community smells often precede or\nreinforce technical degradation in code samples. Symptoms such as \"radio\nsilence\" and centralized ownership were frequently associated with persistent\nstructural anomalies. Additionally, limited onboarding, the absence of\ncontinuous refactoring, and informal collaboration emerged as recurring\nconditions for smell accumulation. Conclusion: In OSSECOs, particularly within\ncode samples, community-level dysfunctions not only correlate with but often\nsignal maintainability decay. These findings underscore the need for\nsocio-technical quality indicators and lightweight governance mechanisms\ntailored to shared instructional artifacts.",

By simulating the dynamics in\n2+1-dimensional lattices, we have tracked the long-term evolution of the\nequation of state for about ten e-folds of expansion, for various coupling\nstrengths. The trilinear interaction initially excites daughter field modes\nthrough a process of tachyonic resonance immediately after inflation and\ntriggers a temporary deviation of the equation of state from $\\bar{w} = 0$ to a\nmaximum value $\\bar{w} = \\bar{w}_{\\rm max} < 1/3$. However, at much later\ntimes, the inflaton homogeneous mode once again dominates the energy density,\npushing the equation of state towards $\\bar{w} = 0$ until the onset of\nperturbative reheating. By combining the lattice results with a Boltzmann\napproach, we characterize the entire post-inflationary expansion history, which\nallows to calculate precise predictions for the inflationary CMB observables.\nWe also accurately compute the redshift of the stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground produced during preheating, and show that taking the temporary\nreturn of the equation of state towards $\\bar{w} = 0$ into account can reduce\nthe amplitude by many orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates.",

    "abstract": "Trapped-ion processors are leading candidates for scalable quantum\ncomputation. However, motional heating remains a key obstacle to fault-tolerant\noperation, especially when system size increases. Heating error is particularly\nchallenging to suppress due to is incoherence nature, and no general methods\ncurrently exist for mitigating their impact even in systems with more than two\nions. In this work, based on a careful analysis about the dependence of\nheating-induced infidelity on phase-space trajectories, we present a simple yet\ncomprehensive framework for suppressing heating errors in large trapped-ion\nquantum processors. Our approach is flexible, allowing various control pulse\nbases, ion numbers, and noise levels. Our approach is also compatible with\nexisting error-mitigation techniques, including those targeting laser phase and\nfrequency noise. Crucially, it relies on an efficiently computable cost\nfunction that avoids the exponential overhead of full fidelity estimation. We\nperform numerical simulations for systems with up to 55 qubits, demonstrating\nup to an order-of-magnitude reduction in infidelities. These results offer a\npractical route toward robust, large-scale quantum computation with trapped\nions.",

However, an inherent\nvulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of\ncompliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly\nchallenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and\nthe cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical\nto prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on\nstacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to\nguarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a\nsystematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in\ncompliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a\nsingle pair of compact hard-stop surfaces. Specifically, we introduce a\ntheoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry\nto maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that\nthe mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method\nto a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and\nprovide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers\nreliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling.

Fewer than a dozen LPTs have been detected so far, and\ntheir origin (source and emission mechanism) remains unclear. Here, we report\nthe discovery of a 1.5 hr LPT, ASKAP J144834-685644, adding to the current\nsample of sources. ASKAP J144834-685644 is one of the very few LPTs that has\nbeen detected from X-rays to radio. It shows a steep radio spectrum and\npolarised radio bursts, which resemble the radio emission in known LPTs. In\naddition, it also shows highly structured and periodic narrow-band radio\nemission. Multi-wavelength properties suggest that the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) peaks at near ultraviolet wavelengths, indicating the\npresence of a hot magnetic source. Combining multi-wavelength information, we\ninfer that ASKAP J144834-685644 may be a near edge-on magnetic white dwarf\nbinary (MWD), although we can not fully rule out ASKAP J144834-685644 being an\nisolated white dwarf pulsar or even a transitional millisecond pulsar (despite\nthe lack of radio pulsations). If ASKAP J144834-685644 is an MWD binary, the\nobserved broadband spectral energy distribution can be explained by emission\nfrom an accretion disk. This hints that some fraction of optically bright LPTs\nmay be accreting binaries with the radio period being the orbital period. It\nmight further suggest a connection between optically bright non-accreting\nsynchronized LPTs, such as polars, and non-accreting asynchronous WD pulsars,\nsuch as AR Sco and J1912-4410.",

A comprehensive study of comets over a wide heliocentric distance\nrange helps us understand the physical processes driving their activity and\nreveals compositional differences across dynamical groups. C/2017 K2\n(PANSTARRS) is a Dynamically New Oort Cloud comet (DNC) that showed activity as\nfar as 23.75 au and displayed a CO-rich coma at 6.72 au, making it a key object\nto investigate pre- and post-perihelion behavior.\n  Aims. We aim to study the long-term activity evolution and chemical\ncomposition of C/2017 K2 using photometry and spectroscopy, from October 2017\n(r$_h$ = 15.18 au) pre-perihelion to April 2025 (r$_h$ = 8.46 au)\npost-perihelion.\n  Methods. Broad-band and narrow-band imaging from both TRAPPIST telescopes\nenabled us to produce an 8-year light curve, color analysis, and derivation of\nactivity slopes. Production rates of OH, NH, CN, C$_3$, and C$_2$ were computed\nusing a Haser model, along with the dust proxy A(0)f$\\rho$. High-resolution\nspectra from CRIRES$^+$ and UVES at three epochs (May - September 2022)\nprovided simultaneous observations of parent and daughter species as the comet\ncrossed the water sublimation zone.\n  Results. The light curve of C/2017 K2 shows a complex evolution with varying\nslopes and a brightness plateau around perihelion, indicating multiple active\nspecies. Coma colors remained constant, suggesting uniform dust properties and\nsimilarity to other active long-period comets. Gas production rates indicate a\ntypical C$_2$/CN composition with a high dust-to-gas ratio. Analysis of\nforbidden oxygen lines shows a transition from CO and CO$_2$-driven activity to\nwater-driven sublimation inside 3 au. Infrared spectra reveal C/2017 K2 as a\ntypical-to-enriched comet, with HCN identified as the main parent of CN, and\nC$_2$ likely originating from C$_2$H$_2$ rather than C$_2$H$_6$.",

If most\nhot Jupiters arrive at their present orbit by high-eccentricity migration while\nwarm Jupiters emerge largely in situ, we expect the atmospheric water abundance\nof hot Jupiters to be significantly elevated compared to warm Jupiters, at a\nlevel that is easily detectable by Ariel transit survey. We provide suggestions\nfor future comparative atmospheric characterization between hot Jupiters and\nwide-orbit directly imaged planets to elucidate the properties of the dust\nsubstructures in protoplanetary disks.",

    "abstract": "Most general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole (BH)\nhot accretion flows are initialized with small rotating tori and produce stable\njets with only small fluctuations. However, recent studies using larger scale\nBondi-like initial conditions have reported intermittent jet activity and loss\nof coherent rotation. To investigate the differences, we modify the standard\ntorus setup across four BH spins: $a_*=0$, $0.5$, $0.9$, $-0.9$. First, we\nincrease the torus size significantly (pressure maximum at 500 gravitational\nradii), allowing long simulations ($2.8\\times10^5$ gravitational times) without\ngas depletion. These runs reproduce the weak variability seen in smaller tori,\nindicating that a larger dynamic range alone does not cause strong\nfluctuations. We observe moderate suppression of the accretion rate by factors\nof $\\sim 1.6, ~2.5$ for BH spins $a_*=0.5,~0.9$, respectively, compared to\n$a_*=0$. Also, the density profile scales as $\\rho(r)\\propto r^{-1.1}$ for\nprograde BHs. Next, we considerably strengthen the initial magnetic field in\nthe large torus by setting the plasma-$\\beta\\approx 1$. This induces strong\nvariability in the evolution. The jet efficiency in the $a_*=0.9$ model, for\ninstance, now varies by over 3 orders of magnitude, and gas rotation reverses\ndirections. Combining these results with prior studies, we propose that a key\nparameter is the ratio $R$ between the rotational and magnetic energies in the\ninitial state. Strong variability appears later in models with a larger value\nof $R$. The implication is that all simulations, and by extension all hot\naccretion flows in Nature, will ultimately develop intermittent jets if evolved\nlong enough.",

We discuss two complementary\nclassification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the\nmany-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic\ndynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and\n(2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies\nfree-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson\nlocalization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in\none-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of\narea-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical\nbulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime\n\\textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state\nensemble living on its temporal \\textit{boundary}. Building on this\ncorrespondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical\nphases using Gaussian adaptive circuits.

While circuits with exponentially local\noperations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with\nfinite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble.

Its high equilibrium temperature prohibits methane-based\nhaze formation, increasing the chances for a clear atmosphere on this planet.\nWe use HST data taken with WFC3 and STIS from the Sub-neptune Planetary\nAtmosphere Characterization Experiment (SPACE) Program to perform near-infrared\n1.1-1.7micrometer transmission spectroscopy and UV characterization of the host\nstar. We report a featureless transmission spectrum that is consistent within\n0.4 sigma with a constant transit depth of 418+-14ppm. The amplitude of this\nspectrum is only 0.01 scale heights for a H/He-dominated atmosphere, excluding\na cloud-free solar-metallicity atmosphere on HD 86226 c with a confidence of\n6.5 sigma. Based on an atmospheric retrieval analysis and forward models of\ncloud and haze formation, we find that the featureless spectrum could be due to\na metal enrichment [M/H] above 2.3 (3 sigma confidence lower limit) of a\ncloudless atmosphere, or silicate (MgSiO3), iron (Fe), or manganese sulfide\n(MnS) clouds. For these species, we perform an investigation of cloud formation\nin high-metallicity, high-temperature atmospheres. Our results highlight that\nHD 86226c does not follow the aerosol trend of sub-Neptunes found by previous\nstudies.

We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public\ncatalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved\nquasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic\neffects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy\npower spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a\nnovel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust\nbispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape\nanalysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard\ncosmological model, $\\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon\ndensity and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density\nfraction to $\\Omega_m=0.284\\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\\pm\n0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\\sigma_8=0.811\\pm 0.030$. The\nbispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the\nconstraints on $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_m$ by $\\approx 10$\\% and shifts\n$\\Omega_m$ by $\\approx 1\\sigma$ towards the Planck $\\Lambda$CDM value.\nCombining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO\nmeasurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \\textit{Planck}\nvalues, with $\\Omega_m=0.296\\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\\pm 0.006$, $\\sigma_8=0.818\\pm\n0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the\ngalaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias\nparameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation\ndistribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order\nstatistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal\ncosmological models.",

HI Ly absorption near the groups' recession velocities is\ndetected along 19 sightlines with HI column densities in the range log\nN(HI)=12.50-14.34, implying a high OGrM detection rate of more than 50 percent.\nWe transform this value into an incidence rate of OGrM absorbers per unit\nredshift of dN/dz=232pm58.This is 25 percent above the value derived for the\ngeneral population of Ly a absorbers within z = 0 filaments and more than twice\nthe value for the z = 0 Ly a forest.

UDGs are an enigmatic and diverse population, with evolutionary\npathways ranging from tidal processing to bursty feedback and high initial\nangular momentum. To determine F8D1's evolutionary drivers, we resolve stars in\nF8D1's central $\\sim$1 kpc and in a parallel field $\\sim$6 kpc along its major\naxis to deep photometric limits, reaching below the Red Clump. We also image\neight shallower fields along F8D1's major and minor axes. We calculate the star\nformation history (SFH) in the two deep fields, finding that while currently\nquiescent, both regions experienced a substantial burst $\\sim$2 Gyr ago and a\nsmaller burst $\\sim$500 Myr ago, which likely formed F8D1's nuclear star\ncluster. In the shallow fields, using the ratio of evolved Asymptotic Giant\nBranch and Red Giant Branch stars out to $\\sim$13 kpc along F8D1's known\nstellar stream, we confirm that F8D1 was globally star-forming until at least 2\nGyr ago.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans\nwith sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of\ninsufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos\nat novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack\nspatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this\npaper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the\nspatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define\na latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human\npose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the\nlatent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and\nfinally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised\nlatents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across\nthe latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field\nand thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory\nconsumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ\ndatasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and\nconsistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Complex free-energy landscapes with many local minima separated by large\nbarriers are believed to underlie glassy behavior across diverse physical\nsystems. This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry\nbreaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for\ncertain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a\nrigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models\nwith local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs.\nTo this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the\nmathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check\n(LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees\nextensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional\nassumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the\nlow-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an\nasymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the\nlandscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of\nthe total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states --\nwhich we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and\ntreats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those\nwith short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our\nresults apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p,\nand while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family\nof codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random\nregular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space. We show that both\nmodels undergo two transitions as a function of temperature, corresponding to\nthe onset of weak ergodicity breaking and spin glass order, respectively.",

To explore this gap, we\nbegin by developing and benchmarking novel, computationally-efficient tools for\nmaintaining norm-constrained weight matrices. Applying these tools, we are able\nto train transformer models with Lipschitz bounds enforced throughout training.\nWe find that optimizer dynamics matter: switching from AdamW to Muon improves\nstandard methods -- weight decay and spectral normalization -- allowing models\nto reach equal performance with a lower Lipschitz bound. Inspired by Muon's\nupdate having a fixed spectral norm, we co-design a weight constraint method\nthat improves the Lipschitz vs. performance tradeoff on MLPs and 2M parameter\ntransformers. Our 2-Lipschitz transformer on Shakespeare text reaches\nvalidation accuracy 60%. Scaling to 145M parameters, our 10-Lipschitz\ntransformer reaches 21% accuracy on internet text.

    "abstract": "Length generalization, the ability to solve problems of longer sequences than\nthose observed during training, poses a core challenge of Transformer-based\nlarge language models (LLM). Although existing studies have predominantly\nfocused on data-driven approaches for arithmetic operations and symbolic\nmanipulation tasks, these approaches tend to be task-specific with limited\noverall performance. To pursue a more general solution, this paper focuses on a\nbroader case of reasoning problems that are computable, i.e., problems that\nalgorithms can solve, thus can be solved by the Turing Machine. From this\nperspective, this paper proposes Turing MAchine Imitation Learning (TAIL) to\nimprove the length generalization ability of LLMs. TAIL synthesizes\nchain-of-thoughts (CoT) data that imitate the execution process of a Turing\nMachine by computer programs, which linearly expands the reasoning steps into\natomic states to alleviate shortcut learning and explicit memory fetch\nmechanism to reduce the difficulties of dynamic and long-range data access in\nelementary operations. To validate the reliability and universality of TAIL, we\nconstruct a challenging synthetic dataset covering 8 classes of algorithms and\n18 tasks. Without bells and whistles, TAIL significantly improves the length\ngeneralization ability as well as the performance of Qwen2.5-7B on various\ntasks using only synthetic data, surpassing previous methods and DeepSeek-R1.\nThe experimental results reveal that the key concepts in the Turing Machine,\ninstead of the thinking styles, are indispensable for TAIL for length\ngeneralization, through which the model exhibits read-and-write behaviors\nconsistent with the properties of the Turing Machine in their attention layers.\nThis work provides a promising direction for future research in the learning of\nLLM reasoning from synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "Shadow observations provide a powerful tool to separate foreground components\nof the soft diffuse X-ray background (SDXB) from the background components.\nSuch observations have now established that the ``local'' foreground is made of\nthe solar wind charge exchange and the local bubble, and the background\nemission is from the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way and\nfrom the unresolved extragalactic sources. New data and careful analyses of the\nSDXB led to two new discoveries in recent years: (1) excess emission near 0.5\nkeV that is identified as the NVII emission line, and (2) excess emission near\n0.8-1.0 keV that is identified with an additional, super-virial temperature hot\nthermal component of the CGM. The goal of this paper is to use Suzaku shadow\nobservations along six sightlines to determine whether either of these\ncomponents is from the ``local'' sources. We eliminate the ambiguity regarding\nthe origin of NVII emission, ruling out the local origin. We confirm that the\nMilky Way CGM contains nitrogen-rich plasma, with a super-solar average (N/O)\nof 2.6+-0.5, and suggest that nitrogen-enhanced plasma is widespread throughout\nthe CGM. We find super-solar Ne abundance in two sighlines, also from the CGM.\nSimilarly, we rule out the local origin of the hot thermal component and\nconfirm that it is present beyond the shadowing clouds. Furthermore, we provide\na revised model of the soft diffuse X-ray background, which is crucial for\nextragalactic astronomy.",

    "abstract": "Upcoming Stage-IV surveys will deliver measurements of distribution of matter\nwith unprecedented precision, demanding highly accurate theoretical models for\ncosmological parameter inference. A major source of modeling uncertainty lies\nin astrophysical processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution,\nwhich remain poorly understood. Probes such as the thermal and kinematic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, X-rays, and dispersion measure from fast radio\nbursts offer a promising avenue for mapping the distribution and thermal\nproperties of cosmic baryons. A unified analytical framework capable of jointly\nmodeling these observables is essential for fully harnessing the complementary\ninformation while mitigating probe-specific systematics. In this work, we\npresent a detailed assessment of existing analytical models, which differ in\ntheir assumptions and prescriptions for simultaneously describing the\ndistribution of matter and baryons in the universe. Using the Magneticum\nhydrodynamical simulation, we test these models by jointly analyzing the 3D\nauto- and cross-power spectra of the matter and baryonic fields that underpin\nthe above probes. We find that all models can reproduce the power spectra at\nsub-percent to few-percent accuracy, depending on the tracer combination and\nnumber of free parameters. Their ability to recover underlying halo properties,\nsuch as the evolution of gas abundance and thermodynamic profiles with halo\nmass, varies considerably. Our results suggest that these models require\nfurther refinement and testing for reliable interpretation of multi-wavelength\ndatasets.",

Our goal is to rigorously establish\nconvergence results among 3D-3D Darcy--Stokes, 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille, and 1D\nGreen's function methods commonly used to model this process. In Part I, we\npropose a 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille system where the coupling across the\npermeable vessel surface involves an angle-averaged Neumann boundary condition\ncoupled with a geometrically constrained Robin boundary condition. We show that\nthis model is well-posed and moreover limits to a 1D Green's function model as\nthe maximum vessel radius $\\epsilon\\to 0$. In the 1D model, the exterior blood\npressure is given by an explicit Green's function expression involving the\ninterior blood pressure. The interior pressure satisfies a novel 1D\nintegrodifferential equation in which the integral term incorporates the\neffects of the exterior pressure and the vessel geometry. Much of this paper is\ndevoted to analyzing this integrodifferential equation. Using the \\emph{a\npriori} bounds obtained here, we show that the solution to the 1D model\nconverges to the 3D-1D solution with a rate proportional to\n$\\epsilon^{1/2}|\\log\\epsilon|$.

These currents play a crucial role in mediating\nvertical exchange between the surface and ocean interior and in facilitating\ncross-scale energy transfers. Despite a growing understanding of their\ngeneration mechanisms and energy pathways, two fundamental questions remain\nunresolved - how does a finite Ro modify the dynamics of ML instabilities, and\nwhat mechanisms are responsible for ML frontal arrest when Ro is order one. In\nthis study, we address these questions through a linear stability analysis of a\ntwo-dimensional, geostrophically adjusted oceanic front based on the analytical\nmodel of Ou(1984), which allows systematic exploration across a range of Ro. In\nthe low Ro, order one Ri regime, the most unstable mode is that of baroclinic\ninstability, with the buoyancy flux serving as the primary source of\nperturbation kinetic energy.

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use.",

Central to these methods is the task of constructing a sparse\nnavigable search graph for a given dataset endowed with a distance function.\nUnfortunately, doing so is computationally expensive, so heuristics are\nuniversally used in practice.\n  In this work, we initiate the study of fast algorithms with provable\nguarantees for search graph construction. For a dataset with $n$ data points,\nthe problem of constructing an optimally sparse navigable graph can be framed\nas $n$ separate but highly correlated minimum set cover instances. This yields\na naive $O(n^3)$ time greedy algorithm that returns a navigable graph whose\nsparsity is at most $O(\\log n)$ higher than optimal. We improve significantly\non this baseline, taking advantage of correlation between the set cover\ninstances to leverage techniques from streaming and sublinear-time set cover\nalgorithms. Combined with problem-specific pre-processing techniques, we\npresent an $\\tilde{O}(n^2)$ time algorithm for constructing an $O(\\log\nn)$-approximate sparsest navigable graph under any distance function.\n  The runtime of our method is optimal up to logarithmic factors under the\nStrong Exponential Time Hypothesis via a reduction from Monochromatic Closest\nPair. Moreover, we prove that, as with general set cover, obtaining better than\nan $O(\\log n)$-approximation is NP-hard, despite the significant additional\nstructure present in the navigable graph problem. Finally, we show that our\ntechniques can also beat cubic time for the closely related and practically\nimportant problems of constructing $\\alpha$-shortcut reachable and\n$\\tau$-monotonic graphs, which are also used for nearest neighbor search.

We inspect the validity of the\neikonal model and its semiclassical correction by comparing it to exact\nsolutions (obtained from solving the optical model equation with a finite\ndifferences method) for a wide range of reactions. We also study the effect of\nrelativistic corrections, both kinematic and dynamic, by effectively\nincorporating the relativistic effects at intermediate energies.

Our study includes neutron and proton reactions on\n$^{27}$Al, $^{40}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr and $^{208}$Pb, for a wide range of energies\n$E_{lab}=0-400$ MeV. Our results show that for the proton absorption cross\nsection, the eikonal model can be used down to around $60$ MeV and the\nsemiclassical correction extends its use to $30$ MeV. However, the validity of\nthe eikonal model for the neutron total cross section only goes down to\n$\\approx120$ MeV, a range extended to $\\approx 50$ MeV when using the\nsemiclassical correction.

First introduced by Baccelli and\nBordenave in 2007 in the case $p=d=2$, this graph has a natural forest\nstructure. In this work, we study the number of disjoint trees in the $\\ell^p$\nDSF for arbitrary dimensions $d\\geq2$ and various values of $p\\in [1,\\infty]$.\nWe prove that for $p\\in\\{1, 2,\\infty\\}$, the graph is almost surely a tree when\n$d=3$, and consists of infinitely many disjoint trees when $d\\geq 4$.\nAdditionally, we show that for all $p\\in[1,\\infty]$, the DSF in dimension $2$\nis almost surely a tree and, under appropriate diffusive scaling, converges\nweakly to the Brownian web, generalizing the result previously known for p=2.\nAlthough these results were expected from a heuristic point of view, and the\nmain strategies and tools were largely understood, extending them beyond the\nplanar setting ($d=2$) and to the singular case $p=\\infty$ presented a\nsignificant challenge. Notably, in the absence of planarity, which plays a\ncrucial role in existing arguments, delicate and innovative techniques were\nrequired to manage the complex geometric dependencies of the model. We develop\nsubstantially new ideas to handle arbitrary dimension $d\\geq2$ and various\nvalues of $p\\in [1,\\infty]$ within a unified framework. In particular, we\nintroduce a novel stochastic domination argument that allows us to compare the\nfully dependent model with a simplified version in which the geometric\ncorrelations are suppressed.",

Under these conditions, dynamical\nmean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the\ncharge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping.

This approach\nenables a more detailed representation of vertical momentum transfer and\ncomplex velocity profiles while retaining hyperbolicity.

The latter is more challenging due to the occurrence of infinite\nvariance when $p\\in (1, 2)$. Under these two gradient noise assumptions, the\nin-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs have been extensively\nstudied in the contexts of convex optimization and standard smooth\noptimization. However, for weakly convex objectives-a class that includes all\nLipschitz-continuous convex objectives and smooth objectives-our understanding\nof the in-expectation and high-probability convergence of SFOMs under these two\ntypes of noises remains incomplete. We investigate the high-probability\nconvergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under\nsub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation\nconvergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are\nconducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex\nobjectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that\nthe theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and\nnumber of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the\ncase of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the\nnon-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the\ntheoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to\nthe smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a\nwell-known lower bound for smooth optimization.",

    "abstract": "We report on the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray observations\ncarried out with \\textit{Chandra}, \\textit{XMM-Newton} and \\textit{NuSTAR} of\nthe pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR B1853+01, located inside the\nW44 supernova remnant (SNR). Previous X-ray observations unveiled the presence\nof a fast-moving pulsar, PSR B1853+01, located at the southern edge of the W44\nthermal X-ray emission region, as well as an elongated tail structure trailing\nthe pulsar. Our analysis reveals, in addition, the presence of an ``outflow''\nfeature ahead of the pulsar extending for about 1 \\arcmin ($\\sim$ 1.0 pc at the\ndistance of 3.2 kpc). At larger scales, the entire PWN seems to be surrounded\nby a faint, diffuse X-ray emission structure. The southern part of this\nstructure displays the same unusual morphology as the ``outflow'' feature ahead\nof the pulsar, and extends along $\\sim 6$ \\arcmin ($\\sim$ 5 pc) in the\ndirection of the pulsar proper motion. In this report, a spatially-resolved\nspectral analysis for the different extended regions around PSR B1853+01 is\ncarried out. For an updated value of the column density of\n$0.65_{+0.46}^{-0.42} \\times 10^{22} ~\\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, a power-law fit to the\n``outflow'' region yields a spectral index $\\Gamma \\approx\n1.24_{+0.23}^{-0.24}$, which is significantly harder than that of the pulsar\n($\\Gamma \\approx 1.87_{+0.48}^{-0.43}$) and the pulsar tail ($\\Gamma \\approx\n2.01_{+0.39}^{-0.38}$). We argue that both the ``outflow'' structure and the\nsurrounding halo-like X-ray emission might be produced by high-energy particles\nescaping the PWN around PSR B1853+01, a scenario recently suggested also for\nother Bow-shock PWNe with jet-like structures and/or TeV halos.",

But Johann Heinrich Lambert also published in 1771 an even\nlesser-known article, which is the subject of this publication. This article,\nwritten in Old French and published in a German journal, described in a rather\nstriking manner the idea of a global observation network where the Earth would\nbe divided into different zones where observers would record the same wind,\ntemperature, pressure, and other current weather data at the same fixed times.\nThe goal would then be to pool all this data to seek to understand how\nmeteorological phenomena evolve in space and time, and to make meteorology a\nscience on a par with astronomy.",

    "abstract": "Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in\nreal scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They\nare considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage\nafter inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their\nlifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between\nthe inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic\nreheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single\noscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By\nnumerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the\ninhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance\nbehavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the\noscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across\ndifferent regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we\nshow that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too\nlimited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our\nsimulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of\nthe external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical\nenergy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not\nnecessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of\nstrong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons\ncan remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential\nimplications for their role in cosmological evolution.",

The lab consists of two\ntasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,\nGerman, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.\nBoth corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and\nmanually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor\nmarket data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.\n  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered\nthe evaluation of gender bias.\n  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most\nsystems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual\nencoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them\nincorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking.

We first set the data in production comes from dataization of the\ntotal output of the society and is exponentially functionally related to the\ntechnology. Secondly, the data production function is used to solve the\noptimization problem for firms and households and to construct a dynamic\ngeneral equilibrium of 'consumption-capital' based on the endogenous interest\nrate solved by maximizing the returns of firms. Finally, by using numerical\nsimulation and phase diagram analysis, we find that the effects of increasing\ndataization and encouraging technological progress each exhibit different\nnonlinear characteristics for equilibrium capital and equilibrium consumption,\nwe thus conclude that dataization enables the positive effects of technological\nprogress on economic development to be more rapid and persistent. We select two\ntypes of Chinese policies regarding data openness to represent the role of\ndataization, and demonstrate the catalysis role of datatization for the\ndevelopment of the digital economy by setting up difference in difference (DID)\nexperiments, which provide persuasive evidence for the theoretical\ninterpretation of the paper.",

Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient\nis able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from\nalphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior.

    "abstract": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box\noptimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation\nspaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\\Omega(n^2)$ representation that\nexplicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close\nrelationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a\nnovel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on\nsorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as\na special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the\n\\textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic\ncomplexity with $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity.\nThe resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in\nlinearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation\ndistances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing\ncompactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic\ndescriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element\ndisplacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line,\nwhich encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the\ntwo halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which\nsummarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our\nempirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation\noptimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more\ncompact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation\nspace.",

These low-rank matrices are commonly derived\nthrough the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection\nmatrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we\nobserve an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within\nany weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent\nin the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality\nimplies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error,\nsignifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the\nfine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as\nthe pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of\nfine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an\nApproximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the\nlow-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to\ngenerate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the\ndown/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices\nwith those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image\nclassification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization\ncapability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.",

    "abstract": "AT 2019qiz is the first standard optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with\ndetection of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing strong evidence\nfor TDE-QPE association. Moreover, it belongs to the rare subset of optical\nTDEs with prominent infrared (IR) echoes revealed by the multi-epoch photometry\nfrom the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The IR light curve shows\nan early bump, followed by a steady rise until the second-to-last epoch, after\nwhich it appears to enter a plateau phase. The dust temperature decreased until\nthe fourth epoch and remains approximately constant for the subsequent five\nepochs. We have fitted the last five epochs using a convex dust ring model,\nresulting in an inner radius $>1.2$pc. Such a large radius greatly exceeds the\ninner radius of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus for a $10^6\\,M_{\\odot}$\nblack hole and thus could be a torus remnant with the inner part having\nvanished, further supporting the unified scenario of recently faded AGNs, TDEs,\nand QPEs. Consequently, a connection between QPEs and IR-bright TDEs is\nnaturally expected. Moreover, the echo requires at least a peak bolometric\nluminosity of $(6.6, 9.5, 1.0)\\times 10^{44} \\,\\text{erg}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\nassuming silicate, silicon carbide, and graphite dust grains, respectively, all\nof which are significantly higher than the peak optical blackbody luminosity.\nIt adds to the accumulating evidence that the missing energy of TDEs may lie in\nthe unobservable extreme UV. This work highlights the unique value of IR echoes\nin the study of TDEs and QPEs, and a promising prospect in the era of the\nNear-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, the successor to WISE.",

While\ndata-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high\nforecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input\ncovariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published\nprices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones\ncan improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a\nstate-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22%\nand 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3)\nrespectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with\nearlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement\nholds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also\nyields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary\nfor maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs,\nand using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a\nfact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast\nmodels. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market\nparticipants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within\nincreasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.",

We report on an\nXMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation performed on 2025 March 4, more\nthan twenty days after the outburst onset. From the X-ray spectrum - well\ndescribed by an absorbed Comptonization model - we estimated an unabsorbed\n0.5$-$10 keV luminosity of $L_X \\sim 7 \\times 10^{33} \\, \\mathrm{erg \\,\ns^{-1}}$ (assuming a source distance equal to the upper limit of $6.9$ kpc). To\nplace this in context, we analyzed an archival Chandra observation performed in\n2019, which yielded a quiescent luminosity of $L_\\mathrm{X,q} \\sim 2 \\times\n10^{32} \\, \\mathrm{erg \\, s^{-1}}$ in the same energy band. Although this\ncomparison indicates that the source was still well above its quiescent level\nduring the XMM-Newton observation, the estimated low luminosity during the late\nstage of the 2025 outburst would typically place the source in the propeller\nregime. Nevertheless, we unexpectedly detected coherent X-ray pulsations with\nan amplitude peaking at $\\sim$42% in the 0.3$-$3 keV band. We also observed a\nspectral softening compared to the early stages of the outburst. Finally, we\nreport a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit of 60 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ on the source flux\ndensity at 5.5 GHz from ATCA observations acquired on 2025 April 12, following\na decline of the accretion activity, as indicated by our analysis of NICER data\nfrom 2025 March 15, which revealed no significant X-ray pulsations at a\nluminosity level of $L_X \\sim 1 \\times 10^{34} \\, \\mathrm{erg \\, s^{-1}}$.

    "abstract": "Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental\nefforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most\nworkflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and\noptical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient\nthan laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial\ncomputational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have\nrecently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in\nresource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we\nreproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency\nlimit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By\nquantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy,\nwe evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost.\nOur results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different\npoints along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of\nscalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable\nthan using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly,\nML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative\nexchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the\nconsistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to\nimprove ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model\narchitectures tailored to PV-relevant features.

Mode,\nand sometimes only particle entanglement, can yield quantum enhancement of\nprecision in continuous- and discrete-variable regimes, yet a clear connection\nbetween these regimes remains elusive. In this work, we present a unified\nframework for quantum metrology that encompasses all known precision-enhancing\nregimes using bosonic resources.

This approach\nprovides a description of the electromagnetic field which is formally\nequivalent to the one employed in atomic systems, and we show how it\nencompasses both the discrete and the continuous limits of quantum optics.\nWithin this framework, we consistently recover established results while\noffering a coherent physical interpretation of the quantum resources\nresponsible for precision enhancement.

In the solid solution members, Ge shows preferential occupancy for one of\nthe two Wyckoff sites, reaching $\\sim$60$\\%$ and 100$\\%$ occupancy when x = 1\nand 2, respectively.

After a short thermalization\nperiod, the evolution of this medium can be described by the equations of\nrelativistic hydrodynamics. As the system expands and cools, the QGP undergoes\na transition into hadronic matter, marking the onset of quark confinement.\nDirect photons offer insights into an essential stage of evolution, spanning\nfrom the onset of thermalization to the suppression of thermal photon\nproduction, which occurs within the hadronic phase. This paper builds upon and\nextends a previously published solution of relativistic hydrodynamics,\nincorporating an equation of state that falls within the same class as that\npredicted by lattice QCD. Based on this solution, a completely analytic model\nis constructed to describe thermal photon production, accounting for the\nquark-hadron transition. The model is tested against PHENIX measurements of\nnon-prompt direct photon spectra in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$\nGeV. Good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the\nexperimental data, enabling the investigation of the centrality dependence of\nthe initial temperature. These results provide a benchmark for future\ntheoretical and experimental studies of thermal radiation in heavy-ion\ncollisions.",

It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc,\ndistance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a\ncentrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an\nenhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR\nimages and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an\narc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust\ncondensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of\n12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the\nperiphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm\nthe presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO)\nlocated near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps\nuncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the\ncenter of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like\nmorphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the\nvelocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar\nfeedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of\nthe expanding E71 bubble.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency\nby 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different\nconditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the\nfirst MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual\nmanipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.",

Subsequently, we present a sampling-based\nSTL-compliant motion planning strategy tailored to meet the STL specification.\nThe proposed model-free approach, which generates feasible STL-compliant motion\nplans across various environments, is validated on differential-drive and\nquadruped robots across various STL specifications.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to significant improvements\nin the quality of generated visual content. As AI-generated visual content\nbecomes increasingly indistinguishable from real content, the challenge of\ndetecting the generated content becomes critical in combating misinformation,\nensuring privacy, and preventing security threats. Although there has been\nsubstantial progress in detecting AI-generated images, current methods for\nvideo detection are largely focused on deepfakes, which primarily involve human\nfaces. However, the field of video generation has advanced beyond DeepFakes,\ncreating an urgent need for methods capable of detecting AI-generated videos\nwith generic content. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages pre-trained visual models to distinguish between real and generated\nvideos. The features extracted from these pre-trained models, which have been\ntrained on extensive real visual content, contain inherent signals that can\nhelp distinguish real from generated videos. Using these extracted features, we\nachieve high detection performance without requiring additional model training,\nand we further improve performance by training a simple linear classification\nlayer on top of the extracted features. We validated our method on a dataset we\ncompiled (VID-AID), which includes around 10,000 AI-generated videos produced\nby 9 different text-to-video models, along with 4,000 real videos, totaling\nover 7 hours of video content. Our evaluation shows that our approach achieves\nhigh detection accuracy, above 90% on average, underscoring its effectiveness.\nUpon acceptance, we plan to publicly release the code, the pre-trained models,\nand our dataset to support ongoing research in this critical area.",

Many computational-statistical tradeoffs have been shown under\naverage-case assumptions, but since statistical problems are average-case in\nnature, it has been a challenge to base them on standard worst-case\nassumptions.\n  In PAC learning where such tradeoffs were first studied, the question is\nwhether computational efficiency can come at the cost of using more samples\nthan information-theoretically necessary. We base such tradeoffs on\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-hardness and obtain:\n  $\\circ$ Sharp computational-statistical tradeoffs assuming $\\mathsf{NP}$\nrequires exponential time: For every polynomial $p(n)$, there is an $n$-variate\nclass $C$ with VC dimension $1$ such that the sample complexity of\ntime-efficiently learning $C$ is $\\Theta(p(n))$.\n  $\\circ$ A characterization of $\\mathsf{RP}$ vs. $\\mathsf{NP}$ in terms of\nlearning: $\\mathsf{RP} = \\mathsf{NP}$ iff every $\\mathsf{NP}$-enumerable class\nis learnable with $O(\\mathrm{VCdim}(C))$ samples in polynomial time.

Thus the\nvertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is\nexpected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We\nprove all of these statements.\n  The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of\ncomplete flag varieties, for which the $q$-difference equations can be\nexplicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in\nthis reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of\nthe cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer\" flag\nvariety.

We complemented these observations with\na reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo\nobservations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is\nwell described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT ~ 0.15\nkeV, mildly under-solar N and O abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3.\nAccording to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kyr old and lies at a\ndistance of 4-5 kpc. A distinct \"Clump\" region shows hard emission equally well\ndescribed by a thermal (kT ~ 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma ~ 2.7). The\nbrightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Halpha\nfilament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous\nmedium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of\nthe massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within\nthe uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this\npeculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the\nGalactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy\nmorphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments\nindicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though\na mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded.",

INRs model time series as continuous functions and\nnaturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they\nhave shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle\nunder distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of\nTimeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.\nBuilding on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen\npatterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a\ndistinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the\nobserved context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and\nout-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block\nand pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for\nadaptable foundation imputation models.",

In this work, we close this gap by modelling classical systems as\ncommutative unital C*-algebras, arguably encompassing all potentially\nphysically relevant classical systems. We show that these systems cannot\nmediate entanglement between two quantum systems A and B, even if A and B are\nthemselves infinite-dimensional or described by arbitrary unital C*-algebras\n(as in Quantum Field Theory), composed with an arbitrary C*-tensor product.\nThis result reinforces the conclusion that the observation of gravity-induced\nentanglement would require the gravitational field to possess inherently\nnon-classical features.",

    "abstract": "The Sliced Gromov-Wasserstein (SGW) distance, aiming to relieve the\ncomputational cost of solving a non-convex quadratic program that is the\nGromov-Wasserstein distance, utilizes projecting directions sampled uniformly\nfrom unit hyperspheres. This slicing mechanism incurs unnecessary computational\ncosts due to uninformative directions, which also affects the representative\npower of the distance. However, finding a more appropriate distribution over\nthe projecting directions (slicing distribution) is often an optimization\nproblem in itself that comes with its own computational cost. In addition, with\nmore intricate distributions, the sampling itself may be expensive. As a\nremedy, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution that provides fast\nsampling for the Monte Carlo approximation. We do so by introducing the\nRelation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise\nassociation of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their\nambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution\n(RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we\nintroduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance\nWeighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We\ntheoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess\nusing extensive experiments on various alignment tasks.",

    "abstract": "One-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs) are widely used platforms for\nguiding, filtering, and enhancing light at the nanoscale. Traditionally,\ndesigns have favored high refractive index contrast to maximize the photonic\nband gap (PBG) size. Here, we demonstrate that low-index contrast systems offer\na powerful and underexplored route to achieving improved optical\nfunctionalities. In particular, we show that low index contrast enables more\nclosely aligned PBGs for transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM)\npolarizations, allowing for broadband superposition of TE and TM Bloch Surface\nWaves (BSWs). As a demonstration of this functionality, we use this approach to\ndesign 1DPCs capable of generating planar superchiral fields for enhanced\ncircular dichroism spectroscopy. To realize such structures, we use an\nautomated design framework based on multi-objective genetic optimization. By\ncomparing optimized designs in both high and low index contrast regimes, we\nfind that low index contrast systems yield significantly greater overlap\nbetween the TE and TM BSW dispersion relations and exhibit a pronounced\nreduction in optical anisotropy - both of which contribute to enhanced optical\nchirality across the operational bandwidth. Furthermore, simulations reveal\nthat these low index contrast structures offer improved robustness to\nfabrication tolerances and support a wider dynamic range of chiral analyte\nconcentrations. In addition to their optical performance advantages, low-index\ncontrast systems are naturally compatible with polymeric materials, which offer\nbenefits such as low cost, sustainability, and mechanical flexibility. While\nthis work focuses on mode alignment and its consequences for surface wave\nbehavior, the underlying principles have broader implications for\npolarization-independent photonic technologies, including optical sensing,\ncomputing, and spectral filtering.",

This is essential for applications\nsuch as qubit readout, quantum sensing, and communication, where signal\nfidelity and coherence preservation are critical. Unlike CMOS and HEMT\namplifiers used in conventional RF systems, JPAs are specifically optimized for\nmillikelvin (mK) cryogenic environments. CMOS amplifiers offer good integration\nbut perform poorly at ultra-low temperatures due to high noise. HEMT amplifiers\nprovide better noise performance but are power-intensive and less suited for mK\noperation. JPAs, by contrast, combine low power consumption with ultra-low\nnoise and excellent cryogenic compatibility, making them ideal for quantum\nsystems. The first part of this study compares these RF amplifier types and\nexplains why JPAs are preferred in cryogenic quantum applications. The second\npart focuses on the design and analysis of JPAs based on both single Josephson\njunctions and junction arrays. While single-junction JPAs utilize nonlinear\ninductance for amplification, they suffer from gain compression, limited\ndynamic range, and sensitivity to fabrication variations. To overcome these\nchallenges, this work explores JPA designs using Josephson junction arrays.\nArrays distribute the nonlinear response, enhancing power handling, linearity,\nimpedance tunability, and coherence while reducing phase noise. Several\nadvanced JPA architectures are proposed, simulated, and compared using quantum\ntheory and CAD tools to assess performance trade-offs and improvements over\nconventional designs.",

The reduced 6G latency coupled\nwith edge processing infrastructure will for the first time provide a realistic\noffloading scenario in cellular networks where several computationally\nintensive functions, including rendering, can migrate from the user device and\ninto the network. A key advantage of doing so is the lowering of the battery\nneeds in the user devices and the possibility to design new devices with\nsmaller form factors. However, offloading introduces increased delays compared\nto local execution, primarily due to network transmission latency and queuing\ndelays at edge servers, especially under multi-user concurrency. Despite the\ncomputational power of edge platforms, the resulting motion-to-photon (MTP)\nlatency negatively impacts user experience. To mitigate this, motion prediction\nhas been proposed to offset delays. Existing approaches build on either deep\nlearning or Kalman filtering. Deep learning techniques face scalability\nlimitations at the resource-constrained edge, as their computational expense\nintensifies with increasing user concurrency, while Kalman filtering suffers\nfrom poor handling of complex movements and fragility to packet loss inherent\nin 6G's high-frequency radio interfaces. In this work, we introduce a\ncontext-aware error-state Kalman filter (ESKF) prediction framework, which\nforecasts the user's head motion trajectory to compensate for MTP latency in\nremote XR. By integrating a motion classifier that categorizes head motions\nbased on their predictability, our algorithm demonstrates reduced prediction\nerror across different motion classes. Our findings demonstrate that the\noptimized ESKF not only surpasses traditional Kalman filters in positional and\norientational accuracy but also exhibits enhanced robustness and resilience to\npacket loss.",

This phenomenon\nis important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike\ngalaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum\nsky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show\nthat the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended\nseparation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries\nselected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational\nacceleration boost factor, $\\gamma_g \\equiv g_{\\rm obs}/g_{\\mathrm N}$, is\n$1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\\delta_{\\rm obs-newt}\\equiv\n(\\log_{10}\\gamma_g)/\\sqrt{2}=0.147\\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations\n$g_{\\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens\nof kau for solar-mass binaries.

These results are consistent with the\ngeneric prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are\nnot sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior.

The FCN, trained on bead-derived datasets, accurately estimates\ncoincident event counts and generalizes to immunomagnetically labeled CD4+ and\nCD14+ cells in whole blood without retraining. Using this count, the CS module\nreconstructs individual signal components with high fidelity, enabling precise\nrecovery of single-cell features, including velocity, amplitude, and\nhydrodynamic diameter. Benchmarking against conventional state-machine\nalgorithms shows superior performance - recovering up to 21% more events and\nimproving classification accuracy beyond 97%.

This paper argues that\ntraditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this\nmismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper\nproffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based\nartificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative\nintegrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,\ncorrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral\nimagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term \"SMA-LLS\" (Simulating\nMoral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater\nalignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years.

We implement a stochastic SFH module in CIGALE using power spectrum\ndensities, to estimate the burstiness level of star formation in galaxies at\n6<z<12. We find that SFHs with a high level of stochasticity better reproduce\nthe SEDs of z>6 galaxies, while smoother assumptions introduce biases when\napplied to galaxies with bursty star-formation activity. The assumed\nstochasticity level of the SFH also affects the constraints on galaxies'\nphysical properties, including the main sequence. Successively assuming\ndifferent levels of burstiness, we determined the best-suited SFH for each\n6<z<12 galaxy in the JADES sample from a Bayes Factor analysis. Galaxies are\nclassified according to their level of burstiness, and the corresponding\nphysical properties are associated to them. For massive galaxies (log\nMstar/Msun> 8.8), the fraction of bursty galaxies increases from 0.42+/-0.08 to\n0.76+/-0.20 from z=6 to 12, respectively. At all redshifts, only <20% of\nlow-mass galaxies are classified as bursty, due to their faintness resulting in\nlow S/N. For bursty galaxies, the log10(SFR10/SFR100) ratio, another indicator\nof bursty star formation, does not evolve with redshift, but the fraction of\ngalaxies with high log10(SFR10/SFR100) slightly increases from 0.25+/-0.06 to\n0.37+/-0.11 between z=6 and z=9.

We\ndiscuss in detail the particular case of infinite sums of discrete groups and\ninfinite products of compact groups, which correspond precisely to infinite\nquantum spin systems. Further examples include $n$-adic systems, where $n\\geq\n2$ is an arbitrary integer (not necessarily a prime), as well as solenoid\ngroups.",

These methods exhibited excellent\ngeneralization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning.\nHowever, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning\nabilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and\nthus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this,\nwe drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and\nproposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the\nability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it\nwas the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework\nwas proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a\nhierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into\nreusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to\nretrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection\nmodule to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the\nSE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen\nenvironments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0%\nover current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets,\nrespectively.

The\nomputational results were validated by high-speed imaging experiments, with\nparticular focus on the types of rebound, asymmetric deformation, and\ndroplet-wall contact time. Results show that, the spinning motion of droplets\nleads to two novel rebound scenarios. Specificially, the front-raise tumbling\nrebound occurs at a lower $\\mathit{\\Omega}$ and is caused by the unsymmetrical\nLaplace pressure, while the rear-raise tumbling rebound emerges at a higher\n$\\mathit{\\Omega}$ and is attributed to the rotational inertia. The angular\nmomentum of the spinning droplet is dissipated or even reversed, while its\ndirection upon detachment is inconsistent with the visually observed spinning\nmotion. With the increase of the angular velocity, the droplet-wall contact\ntime is largely reduced, which is attributed to the asymmetric spreading by the\nspinning motion rather than the increased kinetic energy. A theoretical model\nwas also established to predict asymmetric spreading and the contact time and\nvalidated against numerical results in wide ranges of $We$ and\n$\\mathit{\\Omega}$.",

Our MCMC analysis produces posterior distributions for model\nparameters, revealing close agreement between the theoretical QPO frequencies\nand the observations for GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40.

In previous editions of the BraTS Local\nSynthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but\nsuffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D\nimage generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D\ninpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule\nand the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for\nhigh-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial\ntraining. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet\ndiffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting\nmodel, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a\nPSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these\nscores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81\ns per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue\ninpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior\nperformance metrics.

Recent advances in\nvisual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and\ngeneralization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains\nlimited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a\nfeature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its\nsparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a\nsalient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features.

Finally, a\ntransformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable\nprecise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior\ndetector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater\nrobustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy\nand generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone\nDINOv2 coarse features.

This study investigates the extent to which\nannotator demographic features influence labeling decisions compared to text\ncontent. Using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we quantify this inf luence,\nfinding that while statistically present, demographic factors account for a\nminor fraction ( 8%) of the observed variance, with tweet content being the\ndominant factor. We then assess the reliability of Generative AI (GenAI) models\nas annotators, specifically evaluating if guiding them with demographic\npersonas improves alignment with human judgments. Our results indicate that\nsimplistic persona prompting often fails to enhance, and sometimes degrades,\nperformance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, explainable AI (XAI)\ntechniques reveal that model predictions rely heavily on content-specific\ntokens related to sexism, rather than correlates of demographic\ncharacteristics. We argue that focusing on content-driven explanations and\nrobust annotation protocols offers a more reliable path towards fairness than\npotentially persona simulation.",

In this work, we\nsystematically investigate how the inclusion of temperature-dependent\ncorrections to the effective potential affects key phase transition parameters,\nincluding the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration\nparameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the\nphase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting\nstochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic\ncomputational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these\nconditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of\nforthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO.

NGTM represents graphs as mixtures of latent\ntopics, each defining a distribution over semantically meaningful\nsubstructures, which facilitates explicit interpretability at both local and\nglobal scales. The generation process transparently integrates these topic\ndistributions with a global structural variable, enabling clear semantic\ntracing of each generated graph.

    "abstract": "The quest for efficient and scalable thermoelectric materials has catalyzed\nintense interest in quasi 1D nanoribbons, where reduced dimensionality and\nstructural tunability can decouple key transport parameters to enhance energy\nconversion. In this work, we present a unified comparative study of the\nthermopower in armchair nanoribbons derived from five archetypal 2D materials:\ngraphene, silicene, germanene, stanene and phosphorene. Using a tight binding\nmodel parametrized by first principles inputs and solved within the Landauer\nButtiker formalism, we compute strain and width dependent thermopower across\nnanoribbons classified by width families (3p, 3p+1, 3p+2) over a wide range of\nuniaxial tensile strain. Our results reveal that thermoelectric behavior is\ngoverned by a complex interplay of bandgap evolution, chemical potential\nasymmetry, and quantum confinement. While graphene and silicene exhibit\npronounced family and width sensitive thermopower enhancement under moderate\nstrain, heavier Xenes such as germanene and stanene show diminished responses.\nIn particular, phosphorene nanoribbons emerge as exceptional, exhibiting\nremarkably high thermopower (62 kB/e), a consequence of their large, persistent\nbandgap and anisotropic electronic structure. Across all systems, the 3p+2\nfamily transitions from near-metallic to semiconducting under strain, enabling\ndramatic activation of thermopower in previously inactive configurations. This\nsystematic cross material analysis delineates the design principles for the\noptimization of TE in 1D nanoribbons, highlighting the strategic use of width\ncontrol and strain engineering.

    "abstract": "For a fixed graph $H$, the $H$-Coloring problem asks whether a given graph\nadmits an edge-preserving function from its vertex set to that of $H$. A\nseminal theorem of Hell and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il asserts that the $H$-Coloring\nproblem is NP-hard whenever $H$ is loopless and non-bipartite. A result of\nJansen and Pieterse implies that for every graph $H$, the $H$-Coloring problem\nparameterized by the vertex cover number $k$ admits a kernel with\n$O(k^{\\Delta(H)})$ vertices and bit-size bounded by $O(k^{\\Delta(H)} \\cdot \\log\nk)$, where $\\Delta(H)$ denotes the maximum degree in $H$. For the case where\n$H$ is a complete graph on at least three vertices, this kernel size nearly\nmatches conditional lower bounds established by Jansen and Kratsch and by\nJansen and Pieterse.\n  This paper presents new upper and lower bounds on the kernel size of\n$H$-Coloring problems parameterized by the vertex cover number. The upper\nbounds arise from two kernelization algorithms. The first is purely\ncombinatorial, and its size is governed by a structural quantity of the graph\n$H$, called the non-adjacency witness number. As applications, we obtain\nkernels whose size is bounded by a fixed polynomial for natural classes of\ngraphs $H$ with unbounded maximum degree. More strikingly, we show that for\nalmost every graph $H$, the degree of the polynomial that bounds the size of\nour combinatorial kernel grows only logarithmically in $\\Delta(H)$. Our second\nkernel leverages linear-algebraic tools and involves the notion of faithful\nindependent representations of graphs. It strengthens the general bound from\nprior work and, among other applications, yields near-optimal kernels for\nproblems concerning the dimension of orthogonal graph representations over\nfinite fields. We complement these results with conditional lower bounds,\nthereby nearly settling the kernel complexity of the problem for various target\ngraphs $H$.",

    "abstract": "Detecting tiny objects in remote sensing (RS) imagery has been a\nlong-standing challenge due to their extremely limited spatial information,\nweak feature representations, and dense distributions across complex\nbackgrounds. Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still\nunderperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a\nmulti-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS\ntiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel\ndesigns: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.\nGuided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement\nmodules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)\nmodule employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny\nobjects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive\nfusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow\nand fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural\ndetail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our\nRS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and\n6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior\ndetection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that\nthe proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and\npractical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.",

    "abstract": "In cylindrical positron emission tomography (PET) systems, the center of the\nfield of view (FOV) is typically assumed to have the highest system\nsensitivity. This assumption underlies standardized protocols such as NEMA NU\n2-2018, which specify measurements at the CFOV, and influences how systems are\ncharacterized and compared. However, experimental studies report varying radial\nsensitivity trends, some showing comparable or higher sensitivity off center,\nwhile others reveal more complex, non-monotonic patterns. Despite these\nobservations, a first-principles theoretical model describing radial plane\nsensitivity has not been clearly established. In this work, we derive an\nanalytic model for the radial sensitivity distribution in a cylindrical PET\nsystem, based solely on ideal scanner geometry and basic detection physics. To\nour knowledge, this is the first closed-form theoretical formulation of its\nkind, offering a foundational description of radial sensitivity variation under\nidealized conditions. The model excludes system-specific factors such as\ndetector efficiency or crystal shape, and thus provides a generalizable\nbaseline for conceptual understanding and practical reference. To evaluate the\nmodel's relevance in real-world systems, we perform both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and physical experiments using a representative PET system. The\nmeasured and simulated sensitivity profiles align well with theoretical\npredictions, with deviations attributable to system-specific factors.

This article focuses\non the development of a set of conversion tools for these CMME files to meet\nmore up-to-date standards of music encoding, namely MEI. A workshop was\norganised in September 2024 at the Campus Condorcet in Paris, gathering experts\nwith a wide range of knowledge on mensural music notation, XML formats and\nprogramming. A converter was developped directly in the open-source rendering\nlibrary Verovio, allowing the conversion from CMME to MEI mensural. A\nconversion to MEI CMN was implemented afterwards, enabling to load these files\nin common engraving softwares such as MuseScore with minimal loss of\ninformation. With the availability of a direct import of CMME-XML into Verovio,\nthe corpus of existing CMME files gets a new life.

Recent advances in deep learning and\nlarge vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in various\nvisual recognition tasks.

Applying an intense femtosecond laser\npulse, the 5-7 ML thin Pb film experiences a strong heat up by 10-120 K while\nthe Si substrate remains cold at $\\approx$ 10 K. At such large temperature\ndiscontinuities we observe a significantly faster cooling for stronger excited\nPb films. The decrease of the corresponding cooling time constant is explained\nthrough the thermal boundary conductance in the framework of the diffuse\nmismatch model. The thermal boundary conductance is reduced by more than a\nfactor of three in comparison with Pb films grown on H-terminated substrates,\npointing out the importance of the morphology of substrate, heterofilm and\ntheir interface.",

To address different behaviors exhibited by\nthe numerical scheme, we introduce appropriate notions of strong stability.\nThey account for the potential absence of a continuous extension of the stable\nvector bundle associated with the bulk scheme on the unit circle for certain\ncomponents.

Existing approaches for continual visual concept learning are\nconstrained by two fundamental challenges: catastrophic forgetting and\nparameter expansion. In this paper, we propose Redundancy-Removal Mixture of\nExperts (R^2MoE), a parameter-efficient framework for lifelong visual concept\nlearning that effectively learns new concepts while incurring minimal parameter\noverhead. Our framework includes three key innovative contributions: First, we\npropose a mixture-of-experts framework with a routing distillation mechanism\nthat enables experts to acquire concept-specific knowledge while preserving the\ngating network's routing capability, thereby effectively mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a strategy for eliminating\nredundant layer-wise experts that reduces the number of expert parameters by\nfully utilizing previously learned experts. Third, we employ a hierarchical\nlocal attention-guided inference approach to mitigate interference between\ngenerated visual concepts. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our\nmethod generates images with superior conceptual fidelity compared to the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) method, achieving an impressive 87.8\\% reduction in\nforgetting rates and 63.3\\% fewer parameters on the CustomConcept 101 dataset.\nOur code is available at {https://github.com/learninginvision/R2MoE}",

However, little is\nknown about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in\nreal-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how\nidentity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five\ndifferent high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,\npolitics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are\nextremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,\ngender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For\ninstance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different\nstandards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same\nsymptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a\nconservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by\nolder (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for\nnon-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken\ntogether, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these\napplications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps,\nand create different political factual realities for people of different\nidentities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for\nevaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts\nmodel decisions.

For a distinguished choice of equilibrium, the\nresulting long-range spin chain has a real spectrum and admits a short-range\nlimit, providing an integrable interpolation from nearest-neighbour to\nlong-range interacting spins.

The bright and anisotropic\nGalactic foreground, which is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm\nsignal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces\nadditional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In\nthis paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment,\nwhere the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be\nused. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the\nforeground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple\nregions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the\nfull covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the\n21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest\nwavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm\nsignals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing\nantenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is\nrobust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent\ndesign and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical\nsolution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in\nspace.",

While there is some evidence\nsuggesting these patterns are related to each other, the explicit nature of\ntheir relation, as well as the explicit mechanisms by which they are related to\nextreme heatwaves is still not known. The double jet structure has gained\nattention recently due to evidence that its persistence has been increasing,\npossibly explaining the rise in the number of extreme heatwaves over Europe. In\nthis paper we study the occurrence and persistence of double jet states in ERA5\nand in stationary simulations with the CESM1.2 model, using an index which\nmeasures the degree of jet separation. Additionally, we perform simulations\nwith CESM1.2 coupled to a rare event algorithm in order to improve the\nstatistics of rare summer-long double jet states.

Actually computing an\nembedding then boils down to solving a system of linear equations. A\nparticularly appealing feature of this method is the flexibility given by the\nchoice of the barycentric weights. Generalizations of Tutte's theorem to\nsurfaces of nonpositive curvature are known, but due to their inherently\ncontinuous nature, they do not lead to an algorithm.\n  In this paper, we propose a purely discrete analog of Tutte's theorem for\nsurfaces (with or without boundary) of nonpositive curvature, based on the\nrecently introduced notion of reducing triangulations. We prove a Tutte theorem\nin this setting: every drawing homotopic to an embedding such that each vertex\nis harmonious (a discrete analog of being in convex position) is a weak\nembedding (arbitrarily close to an embedding). We also provide a\npolynomial-time algorithm to make an input drawing harmonious without\nincreasing the length of any edge, in a similar way as a drawing can be put in\nconvex position without increasing the edge lengths.",

Second, we ask the\nnatural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show\nhow Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations.

However, it is highly\nsusceptible to intrinsic signal errors and human-induced labeling errors, which\nlead to label noise and ultimately degrade model performance. To enhance EEG\nlearning, multimodal knowledge distillation (KD) has been explored to transfer\nknowledge from visual models with rich representations to EEG-based models.\nNevertheless, KD faces two key challenges: modality gap and soft label\nmisalignment. The former arises from the heterogeneous nature of EEG and visual\nfeature spaces, while the latter stems from label inconsistencies that create\ndiscrepancies between ground truth labels and distillation targets. This paper\naddresses semantic uncertainty caused by ambiguous features and weakly defined\nlabels. We propose a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that\nmitigates both modality and label inconsistencies.

Considering that with a\nmassive UCA, its polar angles of array sensors can approximately represent\nazimuth angles over $360^{\\circ}$ using angle quantization, a simple\ntwo-dimensional DOA estimation method for a single source is proposed. In this\nmethod, the quantized azimuth angle estimate is obtained by only calculating\nand comparing a number of covariances, based on which the elevation angle\nestimate is then obtained by an explicit formula. Thus, the proposed method is\ncomputationally simple and suitable for real-time signal processing.

It involves\ncollaboration among stakeholders to extract explicit requirements and address\npotential conflicts, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recently,\nmulti-agent systems for software development have attracted much attention.\nHowever, existing research provides limited support for requirements\ndevelopment and overlooks the injection of human knowledge into agents and the\nhuman-agent collaboration. % To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nknowledge-driven multi-agent framework for intelligent requirement development,\nnamed iReDev. iReDev features: iReDev consists of six knowledge-driven agents\nto support the entire requirements development. They collaboratively perform\nvarious tasks to produce a software requirements specification. iReDev focuses\non integrating human knowledge for agents, enabling them to simulate real-world\nstakeholders. iReDev uses an event-driven communication mechanism based on an\nartifact pool. Agents continuously monitor the pool and autonomously trigger\nthe next action based on its changes, enabling iReDev to handle new\nrequirements quickly. iReDev introduces a human-in-the-loop mechanism to\nsupport human-agent collaboration, ensuring that the generated artifacts align\nwith the expectations of stakeholders. We evaluated the generated artifacts and\nresults show that iReDev outperforms existing baselines in multiple aspects.

    "abstract": "Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising technology for\nnext-generation indoor positioning systems (IPS), particularly within the scope\nof sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Its attractiveness stems from\nleveraging existing lighting infrastructures equipped with light-emitting\ndiodes (LEDs), enabling cost-efficient deployments and achieving high-precision\npositioning accuracy in the centimeter-todecimeter range. However, widespread\nadoption of traditional VLP solutions faces significant barriers due to the\nincreased costs and operational complexity associated with modulating LEDs,\nwhich consequently reduces illumination efficiency by lowering their radiant\nflux. To address these limitations, recent research has introduced the concept\nof unmodulated Visible Light Positioning (uVLP), which exploits Light Signals\nof Opportunity (LSOOP) emitted by unmodulated illumination sources such as\nconventional LEDs. This paradigm offers a cost-effective, lowinfrastructure\nalternative for indoor positioning by eliminating the need for modulation\nhardware and maintaining lighting efficiency. This paper delineates the\nfundamental principles of uVLP, provides a comparative analysis of uVLP versus\nconventional VLP methods, and classifies existing uVLP techniques according to\nreceiver technologies into intensity-based methods (e.g., photodiodes, solar\ncells, etc.) and imaging-based methods. Additionally, we propose a\ncomprehensive taxonomy categorizing techniques into demultiplexed and\nundemultiplexed approaches. Within this structured framework, we critically\nreview current advancements in uVLP, discuss prevailing challenges, and outline\npromising research directions essential for developing robust, scalable, and\nwidely deployable uVLP solutions.",

The 3D bounding box detections from the two LiDARs are used to\nclassify vehicle counts based on traffic directions, vehicle movements, and\nvehicle classes.

Since\nthe fidelity susceptibility is closely related to the two-point correlation\nfunction, we first calculate the relevant correlation functions of a random\nmatrix belonging to the Gaussian unitary ensemble in terms of the spectral form\nfactor of the total Hamiltonian, show how to obtain the fidelity susceptibility\nfrom this correlation function, and explain the role played by energy level\ncorrelation. Next, by performing suitable coordinate transformations, we solve\nthe geodesic equations corresponding to the quantum metric tensor obtained from\nan integrability-breaking random matrix Hamiltonian and obtain the geodesic\ndistance between two points on the parameter manifold to show that any point\nfar away from the integrable phase can be reached by a finite value of this\ndistance.

Furthermore, it actively controls the\nRUS by executing physician commands and transparently relays these actions to\nthe patient. By integrating LLM-powered dialogue with speech-to-text,\ntext-to-speech, and robotic control, our system enhances the efficiency,\nclarity, and accessibility of robotic ultrasound acquisition. This work\nconstitutes a first step toward understanding how IVS can bridge communication\ngaps in physician-robot-patient interaction, providing more control and\ntherefore trust into physician-robot interaction while improving patient\nexperience and acceptance of robotic ultrasound.",

    "abstract": "Expanders are powerful algorithmic structures with two key properties: they\nare\n  a) routable: for any multi-commodity flow unit demand, there exists a routing\nwith low congestion over short paths, where a demand is unit if the amount of\ndemand sent / received by any vertex is at most the number of edges adjacent to\nit.\n  b) stable / prunable: for any (sequence of) edge failures, there exists a\nproportionally small subset of vertices that can be disabled, such that the\ngraph induced on the remaining vertices is an expander.\n  Two natural algorithmic problems correspond to these two existential\nguarantees: expander routing, i.e. computing a low-congestion routing for a\nunit multi-commodity demand on an expander, and expander pruning, i.e.,\nmaintaining the subset of disabled vertices under a sequence of edge failures.\n  This paper considers the combination of the two problems: maintaining a\nrouting for a unit multi-commodity demand under pruning steps. This is done\nthrough the introduction of a family of expander graphs that, like hypercubes,\nare easy to route in, and are self-pruning: for an online sequence of edge\ndeletions, a simple self-contained algorithm can find a few vertices to prune\nwith each edge deletion, such that the remaining graph always remains an\neasy-to-route-in expander in the family.\n  Notably, and with considerable technical work, this self-pruning can be made\nworst-case, i.e., such that every single adversarial deletion only causes a\nsmall number of additional deletions. Our results also allow tight\nconstant-factor control over the length of routing paths (with the usual\ntrade-offs in congestion and pruning ratio) and therefore extend to\nconstant-hop and length-constrained expanders in which routing over constant\nlength paths is crucial.",

However, multiple physical\nmechanisms, including pion/kaon condensation, magnetic fields, superfluidity,\ndark matter clustering, and violations of general relativity, can lead to a\npressure anisotropy. This work presents a comprehensive measurement of pressure\nanisotropy in neutron stars. Our analysis incorporates both an extensive set of\nnuclear experimental constraints and multi-messenger astrophysical\nobservations, including gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic\nobservations. The Bayesian framework employed marginalizes over equation of\nstate uncertainties and allows the anisotropy to vary between individual\nneutron stars. We find the Bayes factor for anisotropy against isotropy is\n$e^{0.46}=10^{0.20}=1.58\\gtrsim 3:2$. Additionally, the posterior indicates a\npopulation-wide preference for negative pressure anisotropy, with GW170817\nserving as the primary contributor. The individual variability suggests\ndensity-scale-independent anisotropy, potentially attributable to magnetic\nfields, dark matter clustering, or deviations from general relativity rather\nthan phase transitions.

Manipulated agents produce multiple plausible yet incorrect responses,\nexploiting LLMs' conformity tendencies to propagate misinformation and degrade\nconsensus quality.

Extensive experiments on five\nbenchmark datasets with varying difficulty levels demonstrate that MAD-Spear\nconsistently outperforms the baseline attack in degrading system performance.\nAdditionally, we observe that agent diversity substantially improves MAD\nperformance in mathematical reasoning tasks, which challenges prior work\nsuggesting that agent diversity has minimal impact on performance.

We demonstrate\nthis principle through two simulated case studies, one with a binary endpoint\nand one with a continuous endpoint, comparing the performance of ER against\npreplanned Fixed Unequal Randomisation and Response-Adaptive Randomisation\ntargeting Neyman allocation. Our results show that unequal ratios can increase\nstatistical power while simultaneously allocating a substantially larger\nproportion of patients to the superior treatment arm compared to ER.

The measurements reveal that the pinching of the\nhysteresis loop, characterized by a phase angle of the third harmonic close to\n--270 deg, is stronger for low frequencies. This confirms that the pinching is\ninduced by the presence of polar nanoregions (PNRs), whose responses are also\nstrongly dependent on frequency. When repeating the measurement, the PNR\ncontribution changes since the phase angle of the third-harmonic response\nevolves from pinched to conventional relaxor. This shows that strong changes in\nthe PNR configuration can be induced, even for low AC fields. First-order\nreversal curves (FORCs) confirm the presence of a pinched hysteresis loop. When\nrepeating the FORC measurement a second time, the distribution drastically\nchanges and corresponds to a soft ferroelectric. The asymmetry of the Preisach\nplane measured using FORCs is confirmed by a proposed measurement strategy:\nunipolar impedance measurements.",

For the first time, we systematically evaluate several\nego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical\npipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action\nprediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,\nmap-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning.

To address the challenge of\nacquiring high-quality annotations, some recent weakly supervised methods\nutilize image-level labels to segment manipulated regions. However, the\nperformance is still limited due to insufficient supervision signals. In this\nstudy, we explore a form of weak supervision that improves the annotation\nefficiency and detection performance, namely scribble annotation supervision.\nWe re-annotated mainstream IML datasets with scribble labels and propose the\nfirst scribble-based IML (Sc-IML) dataset. Additionally, we propose the first\nscribble-based weakly supervised IML framework. Specifically, we employ\nself-supervised training with a structural consistency loss to encourage the\nmodel to produce consistent predictions under multi-scale and augmented inputs.\nIn addition, we propose a prior-aware feature modulation module (PFMM) that\nadaptively integrates prior information from both manipulated and authentic\nregions for dynamic feature adjustment, further enhancing feature\ndiscriminability and prediction consistency in complex scenes. We also propose\na gated adaptive fusion module (GAFM) that utilizes gating mechanisms to\nregulate information flow during feature fusion, guiding the model toward\nemphasizing potential tampered regions. Finally, we propose a confidence-aware\nentropy minimization loss (${\\mathcal{L}}_{ {CEM }}$). This loss dynamically\nregularizes predictions in weakly annotated or unlabeled regions based on model\nuncertainty, effectively suppressing unreliable predictions. Experimental\nresults show that our method outperforms existing fully supervised approaches\nin terms of average performance both in-distribution and out-of-distribution.",

    "abstract": "The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task,\nprimarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel\nreserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital\ncorrections.

In this paper, we propose a\nmaneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the\nEarth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it\nis possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument\nof perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the\nneed for extensive propulsion-based corrections.

However, it is unclear how this early functional structure\ncan be achieved by different growth processes. Here, we systematically study\nthe growth of connected planar networks, quantifying functionality of the\ngrowing network structure. We compare random growth with various greedy and\nhuman-designed, manual growth strategies. We evaluate our results via the\nfundamental performance metrics of directness and coverage, finding non-trivial\ntrade-offs between them. Manual strategies fare better than greedy strategies\non both metrics, while random strategies perform worst and are unlikely to be\nPareto efficient. Centrality-based greedy strategies tend to perform best for\ndirectness but are worse than random strategies for coverage, while\ncoverage-based greedy strategies can achieve maximum global coverage as fast as\npossible but perform as poorly for directness as random strategies.\nDirectness-based greedy strategies get stuck in local optimum traps.

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent\nrelations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nKGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such\nas translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These\ngeometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific\nstructural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs\nby KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific\ntransformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by\nensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite\nversion of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent\nall the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how\nwell each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this\nranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each\nrelation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply\nacross all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT\nin low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we\nuse the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low\ndimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The\neffectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations\non three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a\nperformance comparable to leading models",

The pronounced time-dependence of light\nabsorption during aging renders the precise estimation of their impact on\nglobal warming difficult. Single particle studies of such aerosols would be\nvery useful to better understand their aging in the atmosphere through\nprocesses such as photochemistry. However previously proposed optical traps\ncannot continuously trap particles whose absorption state changes from strongly\nabsorbing to non-absorbing or vice versa. Some of the traps presented can\nisolate absorbing and non-absorbing particles, but require mechanical alignment\nof the trap depending on the strength of particle absorption. However,\nmechanical realignment is not compatible with continuous trapping and\nobservation. Here, we introduce a flexible optical universal trap which does\nnot require mechanical realignment. The versatility of the trap relies on four\ntrapping beams - either vortex Laguerre- Gaussian (LG) or fundamental Gaussian\nbeams - which are modulated with a spatial light modulator (SLM), The\nperformance of the trap is demonstrated by trapping different types of\nabsorbing and non-absorbing particles. We also show that the trap can be used\nto observe the photochemical reaction of aqueous droplets containing fulvic\nacid, a common component of BrC. Digital holography measurements demonstrate\nthat the confinement of the particles in the trap can be controlled by changing\nthe orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the LG beams.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the short-term forecasting of carbon emissions from\nelectricity generation in the Italian power market. Using hourly data from 2021\nto 2023, several statistical models and forecast combination methods are\nevaluated and compared at the national and zonal levels. Four main model\nclasses are considered: (i) linear parametric models, such as seasonal\nautoregressive integrated moving average and its exogenousvariable extension;\n(ii) functional parametric models, including seasonal functional autoregressive\nmodels, with and without exogenous variables; (iii) (semi) non-parametric and\npossibly non-linear models, notably the generalised additive model (GAM) and\nTBATS (trigonometric seasonality, Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, trend,\nand seasonality); and (iv) a semi-functional approach based on the K-nearest\nneighbours. Forecast combinations are also considered including simple\naveraging, the optimal Bates and Granger weighting scheme, and a\nselection-based strategy that chooses the best model for each hour. The overall\nfindings indicate that GAM reports the most accurate forecasts during the\ndaytime hours, while functional parametric models perform best during the early\nmorning period. GAM can also be considered the best individual model according\nto the hourly average root mean square error and the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test.\nAmong the combination methods, the selection-based approach consistently\noutperforms all individual models and forecast combinations, resulting in a\nsubstantial reduction in the root mean square error compared to single models\nand a primary choice for the DM test. These findings underline the value of\nhybrid forecasting frameworks in improving the accuracy and reliability of\nshort-term carbon emissions predictions in power systems.",

    "abstract": "Safe and effective motion planning is crucial for autonomous robots.\nDiffusion models excel at capturing complex agent interactions, a fundamental\naspect of decision-making in dynamic environments. Recent studies have\nsuccessfully applied diffusion models to motion planning, demonstrating their\ncompetence in handling complex scenarios and accurately predicting multi-modal\nfuture trajectories. Despite their effectiveness, diffusion models have\nlimitations in training objectives, as they approximate data distributions\nrather than explicitly capturing the underlying decision-making dynamics.\nHowever, the crux of motion planning lies in non-differentiable downstream\nobjectives, such as safety (collision avoidance) and effectiveness\n(goal-reaching), which conventional learning algorithms cannot directly\noptimize. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training\nscheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn\nnon-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.\nSpecifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to\nshape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and\noutperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art\nperformance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various\nbaselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective\nmotion planning.",

Recognizing the\nimportance of spectral and temporal information, we introduce the\nWaveletInception-BiLSTM network. The WaveletInception feature extractor\nutilizes a Learnable Wavelet Packet Transform (LWPT) as the stem for extracting\nvibration signal features, incorporating spectral information in the early\nnetwork layers. This is followed by 1D Inception networks that extract\nmulti-scale, high-level features at deeper layers. The extracted vibration\nsignal features are then integrated with operational conditions via a Long\nShort-term Memory (LSTM) layer. The resulting feature extraction network\neffectively analyzes drive-by vibration signals across various measurement\nspeeds without preprocessing and uses LSTM to capture interrelated temporal\ndependencies among different modes of information and to create feature vectors\nfor health condition estimation. The estimator head is designed with a\nsequential modeling architecture using bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks,\ncapturing bi-directional temporal relationships from drive-by measurements.\nThis architecture allows for a high-resolution, beam-level assessment of\ninfrastructure health conditions.

    "abstract": "Spectral reconstruction (SR) is a crucial problem in image processing that\nrequires reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from the corresponding RGB\nimages. A key difficulty in SR is estimating the unobservable feature, which\nencapsulates significant spectral information not captured by RGB imaging\nsensors. The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR. As the RGB-LDM and its corresponding\nspatial autoencoder (SpaAE) already excel in spatial knowledge, the ULDM can\nfocus on modeling spectral structure. Moreover, separating the unobservable\nfeature from the HSI reduces the redundant spectral information and empowers\nthe ULDM to learn the joint distribution in a compact latent space.\nSpecifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline consisting of spectral structure\nrepresentation learning and spectral-spatial joint distribution learning to\ntransform the RGB-LDM into the ULDM. In the first stage, a spectral\nunobservable feature autoencoder (SpeUAE) is trained to extract and compress\nthe unobservable feature into a 3D manifold aligned with RGB space. In the\nsecond stage, the spectral and spatial structures are sequentially encoded by\nthe SpeUAE and the SpaAE, respectively. The ULDM is then acquired to model the\ndistribution of the coded unobservable feature with guidance from the\ncorresponding RGB images. Experimental results on SR and downstream relighting\ntasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.",

By providing direct\nand calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform\nanalysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust\napproach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional\nelectromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In\nthis review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren\ncosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining\ncosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard\nsirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian\nframework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the\nmeasurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and\npresent the potential role of future standard siren observations in\ncosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the\nunique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies\ninherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy\ndirections of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in\nsome cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on\ncosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the\nmost critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we\nhighlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging\nlate-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity\nmapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe\nfor exploring the late universe.

    "abstract": "Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who\nconstitute the majority of fracture cases. Computer vision presents a promising\navenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable\nchallenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such\nas images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful\ndata types. This study addresses the problem using a multifaceted approach:\nframing it as a fine-grained recognition task, fusing patient metadata with\nX-rays, and leveraging weights from a separate fine-grained dataset rather than\nfrom a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet. Unlike prior work, this is the\nfirst application of metadata integration for wrist pathology recognition. Our\nresults show that combining fine-grained transformer approach, fine-grained\npre-training, and metadata integration improves diagnostic accuracy by 2% on\nsmall custom curated dataset and over 10% on a larger fracture dataset.",

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing has been successfully applied to graphs as a\npreprocessing method to improve the training efficiency of Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs). However, a common issue that arises when repeatedly applying\nlayer operators on graphs is over-smoothing, which consists in the convergence\nof graph signals toward low-frequency components of the graph Laplacian. This\nwork revisits the definition of the reservoir in the Multiresolution Reservoir\nGraph Neural Network (MRGNN), a spectral reservoir model, and proposes a\nvariant based on a Fairing algorithm originally introduced in the field of\nsurface design in computer graphics. This algorithm provides a pass-band\nspectral filter that allows smoothing without shrinkage, and it can be adapted\nto the graph setting through the Laplacian operator. Given its spectral\nformulation, this method naturally connects to GNN architectures for tasks\nwhere smoothing, when properly controlled, can be beneficial,such as graph\nclassification. The core contribution of the paper lies in the theoretical\nanalysis of the algorithm from a random walks perspective. In particular, it\nshows how tuning the spectral coefficients can be interpreted as modulating the\ncontribution of redundant random walks. Exploratory experiments based on the\nMRGNN architecture illustrate the potential of this approach and suggest\npromising directions for future research.",

We identify three interdependent layers of uncertainty--physical,\ntechnical, and societal--central to the evolution of quantum technologies. The\nproposed Quantum Risk Simulator (QRS) serves as a conceptual example, an\nimaginative blueprint rather than a prescriptive tool, meant to illustrate how\nprobabilistic reasoning could guide dynamic, uncertainty-based governance.

Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial\nlandmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and\nstruggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack\nsupport for multi-character animation, as driving features from different\nindividuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To\naddress these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer\nbased framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations\nfor both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an\nexpression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations\nto capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to\nrender fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked\ncross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression\ngeneration, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in\nthis area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are\nspecifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating\nmulti-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both\nquantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in\nchallenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts.

    "abstract": "Interpretability can improve the safety, transparency and trust of AI models,\nwhich is especially important in healthcare applications where decisions often\ncarry significant consequences. Mechanistic interpretability, particularly\nthrough the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for\nuncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models.\nIn this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal\nlarge language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using\nlarge-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range\nof clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and\ntube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and\ncardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the\ninfluence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating\ndirectional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal\npractical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into\nthe internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper\nmechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted\nmultimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model\ntransparency.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be\nexplained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,\nalong with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this\nlearned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these\nuncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may\nbe estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of\ncardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the\nefficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty\nand its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered\npractical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.",

However, structural disorder is inevitable in\nmany real QSL candidates and its impact remains a topic of intense debate. In\nthis work, we conduct comprehensive investigations on CuGa$_2$O$_4$, a spinel\ncompound with significant structural disorder, focusing on its thermodynamic\nproperties and spectroscopic behaviors. No long-range magnetic order is\nobserved down to $\\sim$80 mK, as evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, specific\nheat and elastic neutron scattering measurements. More intriguingly, inelastic\nneutron scattering experiments reveal a broad gapless continuum of magnetic\nexcitations around the Brillouin zone boundary, resembling the magnetic\nexcitation spectra expected for a QSL. Nevertheless, a spin-freezing transition\nat $T_{\\rm{f}} \\approx $ 0.88 K is identified from the cusp in the dc\nsusceptibility curves, where a bifurcation between zero-field-cooling and\nfield-cooling curves occurs. Furthermore, ac susceptibility measurements show a\npeak close to $T_{\\rm{f}}$ at low frequency, which shifts to higher temperature\nwith increasing frequency. These results are evident that CuGa$_2$O$_4$ has\nspin-glass ground state, consistent with the establishment of short-range order\ninferred from the specific heat measurements. Collectively, these results\nillustrate the crucial role of disorder in defining the excitation spectrum out\nof the disordered ground state.

The recently introduced hyperspin machine, which is a network of\nlinearly and nonlinearly coupled parametric oscillators, provides a versatile\nsimulator of general classical vector spin models in arbitrary dimension,\nfinding the minimum of the simulated spin Hamiltonian and implementing novel\nannealing algorithms. In the hyperspin machine, oscillators evolve in time\nminimizing a cost function that must resemble the desired spin Hamiltonian in\norder for the system to reliably simulate the target spin model. This condition\nis met if the hyperspin amplitudes are equal in the steady state. Currently, no\nmechanism to enforce equal amplitudes exists. Here, we bridge this gap and\nintroduce a method to simulate the hyperspin machine with equalized amplitudes\nin the steady state. We employ an additional network of oscillators (named\nequalizers) that connect to the hyperspin machine via an antisymmetric\nnonlinear coupling and equalize the hyperspin amplitudes. We demonstrate the\nperformance of such an equalized hyperspin machine by large-scale numerical\nsimulations up to $10000$ hyperspins. Compared to the hyperspin machine without\nequalization, we find that the equalized hyperspin machine (i) Reaches orders\nof magnitude lower spin energy, and (ii) Its performance is significantly less\nsensitive to the system parameters.

    "abstract": "We report a pronounced dependence of magnetic Feshbach resonance spectra on\nthe initial hyperfine-Zeeman state of Li in ultracold $^{138}$Ba$^+$+$^6$Li\ncollisions. The measured number and distribution of resonances differ\nsignificantly between the two lowest states despite their similar electron spin\ncharacter. We address this puzzle by developing a comprehensive yet generic\ncomputational model calibrated against key statistical features in the\nexperimental spectrum. We confirm that strong spin-orbit coupling induces\nessential changes in the distribution of resonances, leading to an increase in\nthe number of resolvable resonances. Our model reproduces the statistics of the\nspectrum with the lowest Li state but struggles with the second-lowest state,\nwhere a significantly smaller number of resonances is experimentally observed.",

Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility\nfor large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC\nacceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to\nmaintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end\napplications. This paper introduces \\textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware\nco-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC\nacceleration. Firstly, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity\nthrough an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd\ndimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and\nmemory parameters. Secondly, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware\naccelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels\nwith a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units,\nreconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular\naccess. Thirdly, the core of \\textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel\nsampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the\nend-to-end case study, \\textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\\times$,\n$1.4\\times$, $2.0\\times$, $84.2\\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU\nand state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but\ncome with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in\nresource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative\nnature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers,\nleading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned\nEquivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute\nquantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall\nquantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having\nsmall quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error\naccumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to\nprioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that\nlayers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we\nintroduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust\nselection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting\nalgorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths\nsuch as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image\ngeneration quality and model stability.

While\nexisting defense methods offer partial protection, they face critical\nlimitations, including weak adaptability to unseen user data, poor scalability\nto long audio, rigid reliance on white-box knowledge, and high computational\nand temporal costs during the encryption process. To address these challenges\nand defend against personalized voice deepfake threats, we propose Enkidu, a\nnovel user-oriented privacy-preserving framework that leverages universal\nfrequential perturbations generated through black-box knowledge and few-shot\ntraining on a small amount of user data. These highly malleable\nfrequency-domain noise patches enable real-time, lightweight protection with\nstrong generalization across variable-length audio and robust resistance to\nvoice deepfake attacks, all while preserving perceptual quality and speech\nintelligibility. Notably, Enkidu achieves over 50 to 200 times processing\nmemory efficiency (as low as 0.004 gigabytes) and 3 to 7000 times runtime\nefficiency (real-time coefficient as low as 0.004) compared to six\nstate-of-the-art countermeasures.

Understanding how the shape of cloud particle size distributions\naffects the atmospheric properties of sub-stellar atmospheres is a key area to\nexplore, particularly in the JWST era of broad wavelength coverage, where\nobservations are sensitive to particle size distributions. It is therefore\nimportant to elucidate how underlying cloud microphysical processes influence\nthe size distribution, in order to better understand how clouds affect observed\natmospheric properties. Aims. In this follow-up paper, we aim to extend our\nsub-stellar atmosphere microphysical cloud formation framework from Paper I to\ninclude effects of assuming a polydisperse gamma particle size distribution,\nrequiring a three-moment solution set of equations. Methods. We develop a\nthree-moment framework for sub-stellar mineral cloud particle microphysical\nnucleation, condensation, evaporation and collisional growth assuming a gamma\ndistribution. As in Paper I, we demonstrate the effects of polydispersity using\na simple one-dimensional Y-dwarf KCl cloud formation scenario, and compare the\nresults with the monodisperse case. Results. Our three-moment scheme provides a\ngeneralised framework applicable to any size distribution with a defined moment\ngeneration expression. In our test case, we show that the gamma distribution\nevolves with altitude, initially broad at the cloud base and narrowing at lower\npressures. We find that differences between the gamma and monodisperse cloud\nstructures can be significant, depending on the surface gravity of the\natmosphere. Conclusions.

    "abstract": "Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary\nsystems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After\nhaving characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and\n2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently\ndiscovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of\nthis complex topic.\n  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties\nof 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.\n  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible\nreflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of\nactivity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the\nOSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the\nTwo-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses\nof Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic\nbackground.\n  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum slightly redder\nthan those of D-type asteroids, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, with a spectral\nslope of 18.3%/1000 A in the 4000-9000 A range, which is similar to those of\nTNOs and Centaurs. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79\nh. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) =\n(-51.233, -19.456, 18.930) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of\na sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that\nits parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like\nstar with slightly sub-solar metallicity.",

Especially, the new era has witnessed\na remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling\ntasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point\nclouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results\nin information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone\nto omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.\nBesides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of\ndetails caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense\nreconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency\nwith 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene\ncomponents, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on\nthese insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that\nleverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In\ngeneral, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model\n(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D\nmulti-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to\ntackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and\ncamera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features\nto create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach\ncompensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and\nhelps LLMs better understand the 3D world.

It is the only confirmed sdO-type mass-donor star of an X-ray binary\nthat has a high-mass (1.28 $M_\\odot$) white-dwarf or neutron-star primary with\na spin period of only 13.2 s.

    "abstract": "The traditional approach to quantum parameter estimation focuses on the\nquantum state, deriving fundamental bounds on precision through the quantum\nFisher information. In most experimental settings, however, performing\narbitrary quantum measurements is highly unfeasible. In open quantum systems,\nan alternative approach to metrology involves the measurement of stochastic\ncurrents flowing from the system to its environment. However, the present\nunderstanding of current-based metrology is mostly limited to Markovian master\nequations. Considering a parameter estimation problem in a two-terminal\nmesoscopic conductor, we identify the key elements that determine estimation\nprecision within the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism. Crucially, this approach\nallows us to address arbitrary coupling and temperature regimes. Furthermore,\nwe obtain analytical results for the precision in linear-response and\nzero-temperature regimes. For the specific parameter estimation task that we\nconsider, we demonstrate that the boxcar transmission function is optimal for\ncurrent-based metrology in all parameter regimes.",

Our analysis reveals a\nstrong dependence on elemental abundance, so that FSL/H$\\alpha$ traces\nmetallicity, [N II]/[C II] traces N/O, and $\\sim$80% of [C II] emission arises\nfrom neutral gas without systematic variations.

We argue that [C II] is physically a metallicity-dependent\nstar formation rate (SFR) tracer, while its correlations with atomic or\nmolecular gas masses are secondary. Crucially, the [C II] ``deficit'' is only\npart of a universal ``deficit'' problem that shows in all neutral and ionized\ngas lines including extinction-corrected H$\\alpha$, caused by infrared (IR)\nluminosities and characterized by a dichotomy in gas and dust behaviors. This\nuniversal ``deficit'' marks a breakdown of the obscuration-corrected\nstar-formation rate (SFR) calibration and imperils SFR estimates. We argue that\nit is caused by either IR ``excess'' or ionized gas ``deficit'', and present\npossible scenarios. A renewed picture of ISM structure is needed to reconcile\nwith ionized--neutral gas coherence, metallicity dependence, and gas--dust\ndichotomy.

    "abstract": "Lane detection is a critical component of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems\n(ADAS) and Automated Driving System (ADS), providing essential spatial\ninformation for lateral control. However, domain shifts often undermine model\nreliability when deployed in new environments. Ensuring the robustness and\nsafety of lane detection models typically requires collecting and annotating\ntarget domain data, which is resource-intensive. Estimating model performance\nwithout ground-truth labels offers a promising alternative for efficient\nrobustness assessment, yet remains underexplored in lane detection. While\nprevious work has addressed performance estimation in image classification,\nthese methods are not directly applicable to lane detection tasks. This paper\nfirst adapts five well-performing performance estimation methods from image\nclassification to lane detection, building a baseline. Addressing the\nlimitations of prior approaches that solely rely on softmax scores or lane\nfeatures, we further propose a new Lane Performance Estimation Framework\n(LanePerf), which integrates image and lane features using a pretrained image\nencoder and a DeepSets-based architecture, effectively handling zero-lane\ndetection scenarios and large domain-shift cases. Extensive experiments on the\nOpenLane dataset, covering diverse domain shifts (scenes, weather, hours),\ndemonstrate that our LanePerf outperforms all baselines, achieving a lower MAE\nof 0.117 and a higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.727. These\nfindings pave the way for robust, label-free performance estimation in ADAS,\nsupporting more efficient testing and improved safety in challenging driving\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Dual galaxy system (DGS) is one of the widely accepted scenarios to explain\nthe double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) due to orbital motions of the\ntwo galaxies in a merging system. After considering no physical connections\nbetween two independent narrow emission line regions in two galaxies in one\nDGS, there should be no correlations between flux ratios $R_{R}$ of red-shifted\nnarrow emission components from one galaxy and flux ratios $R_{B}$ of\nblue-shifted narrow emission components from the other galaxy in the DGS.\nHowever, after checking the large sample of DPNELs in the SDSS, there are\nstrong linear correlations in different groups between $R_{R}$ as the flux\nratio of red-shifted narrow [O~{\\sc iii}] to the red-shifted narrow H$\\alpha$\nand $R_{B}$ as the flux ratio of blue-shifted narrow [O~{\\sc iii}] to the\nblue-shifted narrow H$\\alpha$. Meanwhile, after checking narrow emission line\nproperties of galaxy pairs within 30 (20, 10) arcmins, there are no connections\nbetween narrow emission line fluxes in the galaxy pairs, to support the\ndetected linear correlations being robust enough between $R_{R}$ and $R_{B}$ in\nthe DPNELs in SDSS.

Currently, data-driven mechanisms\nstrive to balance inter-BS load and reduce unnecessary handovers. The challenge\nis that over a large number of BSs, networks observe an oscillatory effect of\nload evolution that causes high inter-BS messaging. Without a calculus function\nthat integrates network topology to describe the evolution of load states,\ncurrent data-driven algorithms cannot explain the oscillation phenomenon\nobserved in load states, nor can they provide theoretical guarantees on the\nstability of the ideal synchronised state. Whilst we know load state\noscillation is coupled with the load balancing process algorithms and the\ntopology structure of inter-BS boundary relations, we do not have a theoretical\nframework to prove this and a pathway to improving load balancing algorithms.\nHere, we abstract generic and heterogeneous data-driven algorithms into a\ncalculus dynamics space, so that we can establish the synchronization\nconditions for networked load balancing dynamics with any network topology. By\nincorporating what is known as \"non-conservative error\" and the eigenvalue\nspectrum of the networked dynamics, we can adjust the inter-BS load balancing\nmechanisms to achieve high efficiency and convergence guarantee, or to mitigate\nthe oscillation when the synchronisation condition cannot be satisfied.",

While recent advances in generative modeling have\nenabled notable progress in long-form song generation, current systems for\nfull-length song synthesis still face major challenges, including data\nimbalance, insufficient controllability, and inconsistent musical quality.\nDiffRhythm, a pioneering diffusion-based model, advanced the field by\ngenerating full-length songs with expressive vocals and accompaniment. However,\nits performance was constrained by an unbalanced model training dataset and\nlimited controllability over musical style, resulting in noticeable quality\ndisparities and restricted creative flexibility. To address these limitations,\nwe propose DiffRhythm+, an enhanced diffusion-based framework for controllable\nand flexible full-length song generation. DiffRhythm+ leverages a substantially\nexpanded and balanced training dataset to mitigate issues such as repetition\nand omission of lyrics, while also fostering the emergence of richer musical\nskills and expressiveness. The framework introduces a multi-modal style\nconditioning strategy, enabling users to precisely specify musical styles\nthrough both descriptive text and reference audio, thereby significantly\nenhancing creative control and diversity. We further introduce direct\nperformance optimization aligned with user preferences, guiding the model\ntoward consistently preferred outputs across evaluation metrics.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial\nimprovements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models\n(LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24. These findings\nsuggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail\nto generalize beyond specific numerical forms.

    "abstract": "We present an agent-based model (ABM) simulating proactive community\nadaptation to climate change in an urban context. The model is applied to\nBergen, Norway, represented as a complex socio-ecological system. It integrates\nmultiple agent types: municipal government (urban planners and political\nactors), civil society (individual citizens), environmental NGOs and activists,\nand media. Agents interact during urban planning processes - particularly the\nevaluation and approval of new development proposals. Urban planners provide\ntechnical assessments, while politicians (organized by party) make final\ndecisions to approve, modify, or reject projects. Environmental NGOs, activist\ngroups, and the media shape public perception and influence policymakers\nthrough campaigns, lobbying, protests, and news coverage. Individual citizens\ndecide whether to engage in collective action based on personal values and\nsocial influences. The model captures the resulting decision-making ecosystem\nand reveals feedback loops and leverage points that determine climate-adaptive\noutcomes. By analyzing these dynamics, we identify critical intervention points\nwhere targeted policy measures can facilitate systemic transformation toward\nmore climate-resilient urban development.",

    "abstract": "Information diffusion prediction (IDP) is a pivotal task for understanding\nhow information propagates among users. Most existing methods commonly adhere\nto a conventional training-test paradigm, where models are pretrained on\ntraining data and then directly applied to test samples. However, the success\nof this paradigm hinges on the assumption that the data are independently and\nidentically distributed, which often fails in practical social networks due to\nthe inherent uncertainty and variability of user behavior. In the paper, we\naddress the novel challenge of distribution shifts within IDP tasks and propose\na robust test-time training (TTT)-based framework for multi-scale diffusion\nprediction, named T3MAL. The core idea is to flexibly adapt a trained model to\naccommodate the distribution of each test instance before making predictions\nvia a self-supervised auxiliary task. Specifically, T3MAL introduces a\nBYOL-inspired self-supervised auxiliary network that shares a common feature\nextraction backbone with the primary diffusion prediction network to guide\ninstance-specific adaptation during testing. Furthermore, T3MAL enables fast\nand accurate test-time adaptation by incorporating a novel meta-auxiliary\nlearning scheme and a lightweight adaptor, which together provide better weight\ninitialization for TTT and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets demonstrate that T3MAL outperforms various\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

In microservice systems, as the number of services\nand the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as\ncomputing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To\naddress this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on\nreinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the\nenvironment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the\nexperiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load\nscenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including\nresponse time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The\nexperimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling\nmethod significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low\nload and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource\nutilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource\nconditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve\noptimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource\nallocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger\nadaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation\nstrategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in\ndynamically changing load and resource environments.",

In this Letter, we present the discovery of an intriguing\nX-ray transient, EP J182730.0-095633, via the Einstein Probe (EP) and\nsubsequent multi-wavelength follow-up studies.

Its X-ray spectrum is non-thermal and consistent with a power-law model\nwith a nearly constant photon index of $\\Gamma \\sim2$ throughout the outburst.\nA long-lasting millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signal was detected\nin its X-ray light curve, centered around a frequency of $\\sim0.04$ Hz. A\ntransient near-infrared source was identified as its counterpart, although no\noptical emission was detectable, likely due to significant extinction.

The X-ray spectral and temporal characteristics, along with\nthe multi-wavelength properties, indicate that the source is a faint low-mass\nX-ray binary, with the compact object likely being a black hole.

      "Chenhao Wang"
    ],
    "abstract": "A $k$-submodular function naturally generalizes submodular functions by\ntaking as input $k$ disjoint subsets, rather than a single subset. Unlike\nstandard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for\nthe solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the\nsubset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that\nthe greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular\nmaximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether\na firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack\nconstraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question\naffirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses\nan appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the\ngreedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically\ntight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many\nvalue oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We\nfurther show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone\nproblem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it\nwell-suited for practical applications. Using the thresholding technique from\n(Badanidiyuru and Vondrak, SODA 2014), it runs in nearly $\\tilde O(n^2k^2)$\ntime.\n  The proof idea is simple: we introduce a novel continuous transformation from\nan optimal solution to a greedy solution, using the multilinear extension to\nevaluate every fractional solution during the transformation. This continuous\nanalysis approach yields two key extensions. First, it enables improved\napproximation ratios of various existing algorithms. Second, our method\nnaturally extends to $k$-submodular maximization problems under broader\nconstraints, offering a more flexible and unified analysis framework.",

Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on\ndomain-shared entities (\\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain\nknowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.\nSome studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable\nsemantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.\nNevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.\nDeveloping more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for\nfurther exploration.\n  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper\nintroduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target\ncross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically\nquantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain\nknowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item\ntokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and\nthen formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training\na domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain\ninformation to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive\nloss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific\nfine-tuning on the unified recommender.

    "abstract": "The formation of planetesimals is a necessary step in the formation of\nplanets. While several mechanisms have been proposed, a local dust-to-gas ratio\nabove unity is a strong requirement to trigger the collapse of pebble clouds\ninto planetesimals. A prime location for this is the water-ice line, where\nlarge water-rich pebbles evaporate and release their smaller silicate cores.\nThis enhances the local dust-to-gas ratio due to the different inward drift\nspeeds of large and small pebbles. Previous work suggested that planetesimal\nformation becomes difficult at overall dust-to-gas ratios below 0.6\\%,\nconsistent with the occurrence of close-in super Earths. However, the influence\nof disc composition on planetesimal formation remains unclear. Observations of\nstellar abundances show both a decrease and a wide spread in C/O ratios for\nlow-metallicity stars. Using the C/O ratio as a proxy to determine water ice\nabundance in discs, we use the 1D disc evolution code chemcomp to simulate\nprotoplanetary discs with varying C/O and dust-to-gas ratios over 3 Myr.\nPlanetesimal formation is modeled using conditions based on dust-gas dynamics\nand pebble fragmentation. Our results confirm that planetesimal formation\nstrongly depends on disc metallicity, with lower metallicity discs forming\nsignificantly fewer planetesimals. A lower carbon fraction generally promotes\nplanetesimal formation by increasing water ice, while higher carbon fractions\nsuppress it. The opposite is seen for oxygen: higher oxygen content leads to\nmore efficient planetesimal formation at the same dust-to-gas ratio. We thus\npredict that planets around low-metallicity stars should be more common when\ntheir C/O ratio is low and oxygen is enhanced, a trend that can be tested\nobservationally. Our simulations thus open a pathway to understand if the\ncomposition of the planet forming material influences the growth of planets.",

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

A main reason for this success is the ability of\nLLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the\ndesign of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,\nemploying LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task\nexamples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained\nengineers.

To address these challenges, we propose\nDEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex\noptimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding\nrepresentations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from\ninverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task\ndemonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures\ntarget and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that\nhardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance\nof the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering\nexpertise for designing in-context examples.

    "abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from source domains and\napply it to unseen target domains with out-of-distribution data. Owing to\nCLIP's strong ability to encode semantic concepts, it has attracted increasing\ninterest in domain generalization. However, CLIP often struggles to focus on\ntask-relevant regions across domains, i.e., domain-invariant regions, resulting\nin suboptimal performance on unseen target domains. To address this challenge,\nwe propose an attention-refocusing scheme, called Simulate, Refocus and\nEnsemble (SRE), which learns to reduce the domain shift by aligning the\nattention maps in CLIP via attention refocusing. SRE first simulates domain\nshifts by performing augmentation on the source data to generate simulated\ntarget domains. SRE then learns to reduce the domain shifts by refocusing the\nattention in CLIP between the source and simulated target domains. Finally, SRE\nutilizes ensemble learning to enhance the ability to capture domain-invariant\nattention maps between the source data and the simulated target data. Extensive\nexperimental results on several datasets demonstrate that SRE generally\nachieves better results than state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is an effective approach for semantic\ncommunication. However, current JSCC methods are difficult to integrate with\nexisting communication network architectures, where application and network\nproviders are typically different entities. Recently, a novel paradigm termed\nSplit DeepJSCC has been under consideration to address this challenge. Split\nDeepJSCC employs a bit-level interface that enables separate design of source\nand channel codes, ensuring compatibility with existing communication networks\nwhile preserving the advantages of JSCC in terms of semantic fidelity and\nchannel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a learning-based interface\ndesign by treating its parameters as trainable, achieving improved end-to-end\nperformance compared to Split DeepJSCC. In particular, the interface enables\nspecification of bit-level importance at the output of the source code.\nFurthermore, we propose an Importance-Aware Net that utilizes the\ninterface-derived bit importance information, enabling dynamical adaptation to\ndiverse channel bandwidth ratios and time-varying channel conditions.\nExperimental results show that our method improves performance in wireless\nimage transmission tasks.

    "abstract": "As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods --\nspanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate\nknowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans\nmore effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the\nexploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping\ncriteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We\nevaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark\nthat spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites.

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments.",

In parallel, recent work on\nGradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in\nwhich the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely\nproportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored\nthe underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the\nunderstanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still\nmissing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in\ndetail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates\ncause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK\nmatrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the\nunderlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for\na two-layer linear network.

As an\napplication, we show the thermodynamic inequality originating from the\nconvexity of free energy can be further tightened. Second, by extending the\nprojection operator, we establish a bound relation between the Drude weight and\nthe orbital magnetization.

We apply the resulting inequality to two orbital ferromagnets and support\nthat the twisted bilayer graphene system is close to the Landau level system.\nMoreover, we show that an analogous inequality also holds for a higher-order\nmultipole, magnetic quadrupole.

An $n$-dimensional augmented cube\n$AQ_n$ is constructed by augmenting the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with\nadditional edges, thus making $Q_n$ a spanning subgraph of $AQ_n$. Dong and\nWang (2019) first posed the problem of determining the number of\n$Q_n$-isomorphic subgraphs in $AQ_n$, which still remains open. By exploiting\nthe Cayley properties of $AQ_n$, we establish a lower bound for this number.\nWhat's more, we develop a method for constructing pairs of $Q_n$-isomorphic\nsubgraphs in $AQ_n$ with the minimum number of common edges. This is\naccomplished through the use of reciprocal perfect matchings, a technique that\nalso relies on the Cayley property of $AQ_n$. As an application, we prove that\n$AQ_n$ admits $n-1$ edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles when $n\\geq3$ is odd and\n$n-2$ cycles when $n$ is even, thereby confirming a conjecture by Hung (2015)\nfor the odd case. Additionally, we prove that $AQ_n$ has a fault-free cycle of\nevery even length from $4$ to $2^n$ with up to $4n-8$ faulty edges, when each\nvertex is incident to at least two fault-free edges. This result not only\nprovides an alternative proof for the fault-tolerant Hamiltonicity of\nestablished by Hsieh and Cian (2010), but also extends their work by\ndemonstrating the fault-tolerant bipancyclicity of $AQ_n$.",

To\naddress these gaps we: 1) conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of\nacoustic tokens for speech enhancement, including the effect of bitrate and\nnoise strength; 2) introduce a novel transducer-based autoregressive\narchitecture specifically designed for this task. Experiments on VoiceBank and\nLibri1Mix datasets show that acoustic tokens outperform semantic tokens in\nterms of preserving speaker identity, and that our autoregressive approach can\nfurther improve performance. Nevertheless, we observe that discrete\nrepresentations still fall short compared to continuous ones, highlighting the\nneed for further research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Composed image retrieval (CIR) is a vision language task that retrieves a\ntarget image using a reference image and modification text, enabling intuitive\nspecification of desired changes. While effectively fusing visual and textual\nmodalities is crucial, existing methods typically adopt either early or late\nfusion. Early fusion tends to excessively focus on explicitly mentioned textual\ndetails and neglect visual context, whereas late fusion struggles to capture\nfine-grained semantic alignments between image regions and textual tokens. To\naddress these issues, we propose FAR-Net, a multi-stage fusion framework\ndesigned with enhanced semantic alignment and adaptive reconciliation,\nintegrating two complementary modules. The enhanced semantic alignment module\n(ESAM) employs late fusion with cross-attention to capture fine-grained\nsemantic relationships, while the adaptive reconciliation module (ARM) applies\nearly fusion with uncertainty embeddings to enhance robustness and\nadaptability. Experiments on CIRR and FashionIQ show consistent performance\ngains, improving Recall@1 by up to 2.4% and Recall@50 by 1.04% over existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, empirically demonstrating that FAR Net provides a\nrobust and scalable solution to CIR tasks.",

    "abstract": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task of retrieving a target image from\na gallery using a composed query consisting of a reference image and a\nmodification text. Among various CIR approaches, training-free zero-shot\nmethods based on pre-trained models are cost-effective but still face notable\nlimitations. For example, sequential VLM-LLM pipelines process each modality\nindependently, which often results in information loss and limits cross-modal\ninteraction. In contrast, methods based on multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) often focus exclusively on applying changes indicated by the text,\nwithout fully utilizing the contextual visual information from the reference\nimage. To address these issues, we propose multi-faceted Chain-of-Thought with\nre-ranking (MCoT-RE), a training-free zero-shot CIR framework. MCoT-RE utilizes\nmulti-faceted Chain-of-Thought to guide the MLLM to balance explicit\nmodifications and contextual visual cues, generating two distinct captions: one\nfocused on modification and the other integrating comprehensive visual-textual\ncontext. The first caption is used to filter candidate images. Subsequently, we\ncombine these two captions and the reference image to perform multi-grained\nre-ranking. This two-stage approach facilitates precise retrieval by aligning\nwith the textual modification instructions while preserving the visual context\nof the reference image. Through extensive experiments, MCoT-RE achieves\nstate-of-the-art results among training-free methods, yielding improvements of\nup to 6.24% in Recall@10 on FashionIQ and 8.58% in Recall@1 on CIRR.",

This situation sets the study apart from a standard\nrandomized controlled trial, where the treatment assignment is random. Due to\nthis situation, the estimated average treatment effect becomes biased. To\naddress this issue, a standard approach is to incorporate the estimated\npropensity score when estimating the average treatment effect. However, these\nmethods incur the risk of misspecification in propensity score models. To solve\nthis issue, a novel method called the \"Self balancing neural network\" (Sbnet),\nwhich lets the model itself obtain its pseudo propensity score from the\nbalancing net, is proposed in this study. The proposed method estimates the\naverage treatment effect by using the balancing net as a key part of the\nfeedforward neural network. This formulation resolves the estimation of the\naverage treatment effect in one step. Moreover, the multi-pseudo propensity\nscore framework, which is estimated from the diversified balancing net and used\nfor the estimation of the average treatment effect, is presented. Finally, the\nproposed methods are compared with state-of-the-art methods on three simulation\nsetups and real-world datasets.

This\nconclusion stems from its unusually low mass and compact radius, which\nchallenge standard neutron star models. If confirmed, such a quark star could\ngenerate cosmic rays through the transition from the two-flavor\ncolor-superconducting (2SC) phase to the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase,\npotentially releasing strangelets, hypothetical strange quark matter particles.\nDetecting these strangelets in cosmic rays would provide groundbreaking\nevidence for quark matter.

We analyze theoretical predictions for these gamma-ray\nsignals and evaluate CTA's potential to detect or constrain them. Additionally,\nwe present an in-depth assessment of CTA observations of HESS J1731-347,\nfocusing on spectral features that could confirm strangelet production.

    "abstract": "Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the\ninterpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods\nprimarily utilize question and answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal\ncharacteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically\nevent-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each\nvideo. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts,\nand descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented\nscene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization\nand higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question\ngeneration with the integration of question embeddings for video question\nanswering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability\nof the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ\ngenerates Q&A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the\ntraining data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&A pairs enable\nthe model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced\ngeneralizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign\nmodule that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features,\nensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the\nadaptability of downstream tasks.

To address this, we propose ReLOAD (Reinforcement Learning\nwith Offline Reward Annotation via Distillation), a novel reward annotation\nframework for offline RL. Unlike existing methods that depend on complex\nalignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to\ngenerate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet\neffective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to\nmimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.\nLater, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal\nfor each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured\nreward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a\nformal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction\nerrors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like\ntransitions.

Operator learning\napproaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing\nmappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to\ndata across different resolutions.

We establish a discretization error\nbound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization\nconvergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are\npresented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial\ndifferential equations.

Studies report up to 10% of such\nfractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way\nto assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap\nthrough a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a\nmulti-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.\nArchitectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and\nRF-DETR.

Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI\ncan reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical\nrelevance.

The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new\nparadigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native\nmechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged\nto tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of\nLLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,\nillustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,\nand interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.\nLLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate\neffectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external\nknowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven\narchitectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of\nconventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for\nunderstanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the\ntrade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance.

As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses\nprofiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through\nrequest-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked\nprefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing\npolicies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.",

Advanced fine-tuning methods typically adjust visual\nencoders while neglecting the semantics derived from the frozen text encoder,\noverlooking the visual and textual alignment. To strengthen this alignment, we\npropose a novel approach, Semantic-guided fine-tuning of foundation model for\nlong-tailed visual recognition (Sage), which incorporates semantic guidance\nderived from textual modality into the visual fine-tuning process.\nSpecifically, we introduce an SG-Adapter that integrates class descriptions as\nsemantic guidance to guide the fine-tuning of the visual encoder.

While Transformer-based\narchitectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence\nlength hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements\nin State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for\nlong-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and\ntransient dynamics effectively.

Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking\ntechniques to further enhance and complement its robustness.

    "abstract": "Bipolar photoresponse - where photocurrent polarity reverses with excitation\nwavelength, gate voltage, or other conditions - is essential for optical logic,\nneuromorphic computing, and imaging. Unlike unipolar responses, bipolar\nbehavior enables direct binary encoding and enhanced photodetection contrast.\nHowever, in conventional photoconductive or photovoltaic systems, the\nsimultaneous and opposite-directional transport of electrons and holes often\nsuppresses polarity switching. Recent self-powered Shockley-Ramo (SR)\nphotoresponse in gapless materials also show only unipolar signals due to\nstrong, irreversible electron-hole asymmetry. Here, we demonstrate for the\nfirst-time bipolar SR photoresponse in GaAs nanoconstriction devices by\nexploiting reversible electron-hole asymmetry. The longer carrier lifetimes in\nGaAs enable sub-diffusion-length control of carrier dynamics through geometry.\nBy tuning photocarrier dynamics near the nanoconstriction for both majority\nelectrons and minority holes, we modulate the SR response to exhibit dual\npolarities. At low excitation, photoelectrons dominate; as excitation\nincreases, intervalley scattering populates higher-energy L-valleys, reducing\nelectron contribution and leading to polarity reversal driven by the growing\ndominance of photoexcited holes. These results, supported by SR theory, show\nthat nanoscale geometric engineering, together with the reversible\nelectron-hole asymmetry, enables self-powered bipolar photocurrent responses,\noffering new routes toward advanced optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness frequently underdiagnosed due to\nsubtle early symptoms and social stigma. This paper explores the advanced\nnatural language processing (NLP) models for recognizing signs of bipolar\ndisorder based on user-generated social media text. We conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA,\nDistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized\n(BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed\non a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity\nthrough sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate\nthat RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an\nF1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical\nresults. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture\nmeaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the\ncritical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In\naddition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers\nan optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Applying these rules to $C_{4z}$ and $C_{6z}$ operations, we\nobtain explicit formulas that relate the Euler class to the rotation\neigenvalues at high-symmetry points. We then extend our analysis to\nthree-dimensional systems, focusing on the difference in the Euler class\nbetween the two $C_{2z}T$-invariant planes. We derive analytic expressions that\nrelate the difference in the Euler class to two types of\nrepresentation-protected invariants and analyze their phase transitions. We\nfurther construct tight-binding models and perform numerical calculations to\nsupport our analysis and elucidate the bulk-boundary correspondence.",

Recent efforts have integrated transformer\nblocks into compact neural architectures for computer vision, giving rise to\nvarious efficient vision transformers. In this work, we introduce Transformer\nwith Kernel Complexity Reduction, or KCR-Transformer, a compact transformer\nblock equipped with differentiable channel selection, guided by a novel and\nsharp theoretical generalization bound. KCR-Transformer performs input/output\nchannel selection in the MLP layers of transformer blocks to reduce the\ncomputational cost. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis\nestablishing a tight generalization bound for networks equipped with\nKCR-Transformer blocks. Leveraging such strong theoretical results, the channel\npruning by KCR-Transformer is conducted in a generalization-aware manner,\nensuring that the resulting network retains a provably small generalization\nerror. Our KCR-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact\ntransformer networks, such as ViT and Swin, and it reduces the FLOPs of the\nvision transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction\naccuracy. In the experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in the\nvision transformers with KCR-Transformer blocks, leading to KCR-Transformer\nnetworks with different backbones. The resulting TCR-Transformers achieve\nsuperior performance on various computer vision tasks, achieving even better\nperformance than the original models with even less FLOPs and parameters.",

This is a black-box optimization problem\nsince the user's satisfaction function is unknown. Substantive work has been\ndone on this topic where the key idea is to play audio samples to the user,\neach shaped by a different filter $h_i$, and query the user for their\nsatisfaction scores $f(h_i)$. A family of ``surrogate\" functions is then\ndesigned to fit these scores and the optimization method gradually refines\nthese functions to arrive at the filter $\\hat{h}^*$ that maximizes\nsatisfaction. In certain applications, we observe that a second type of\nquerying is possible where users can tell us the individual elements $h^*[j]$\nof the optimal filter $h^*$. Consider an analogy from cooking where the goal is\nto cook a recipe that maximizes user satisfaction. A user can be asked to score\nvarious cooked recipes (e.g., tofu fried rice) or to score individual\ningredients (say, salt, sugar, rice, chicken, etc.). Given a budget of $B$\nqueries, where a query can be of either type, our goal is to find the recipe\nthat will maximize this user's satisfaction. Our proposal builds on Sparse\nGaussian Process Regression (GPR) and shows how a hybrid approach can\noutperform any one type of querying. Our results are validated through\nsimulations and real world experiments, where volunteers gave feedback on\nmusic/speech audio and were able to achieve high satisfaction levels.

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown promise on task-conditioned\ncontrol in complex settings such as bimanual manipulation. However, the heavy\nreliance on task-specific human demonstrations limits their generalization and\nincurs high data acquisition costs. In this work, we present a new notion of\ntask-agnostic action paradigm that decouples action execution from\ntask-specific conditioning, enhancing scalability, efficiency, and\ncost-effectiveness. To address the data collection challenges posed by this\nparadigm -- such as low coverage density, behavioral redundancy, and safety\nrisks -- we introduce ATARA (Automated Task-Agnostic Random Actions), a\nscalable self-supervised framework that accelerates collection by over $\n30\\times $ compared to human teleoperation. To further enable effective\nlearning from task-agnostic data, which often suffers from distribution\nmismatch and irrelevant trajectories, we propose AnyPos, an inverse dynamics\nmodel equipped with Arm-Decoupled Estimation and a Direction-Aware Decoder\n(DAD). We additionally integrate a video-conditioned action validation module\nto verify the feasibility of learned policies across diverse manipulation\ntasks. Extensive experiments show that the AnyPos-ATARA pipeline yields a 51%\nimprovement in test accuracy and achieves 30-40% higher success rates in\ndownstream tasks such as lifting, pick-and-place, and clicking, using\nreplay-based video validation.

    "abstract": "As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents\nhave emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior\nresearch has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in\ntask processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring\nthat agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical\nchallenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this\npaper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults:\ndecision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social\nresponsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research\ndirections: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the\nethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2)\nOperationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing\nautonomy measures.",

To address these issues, we introduce auxiliary\nvariables to separate the layers of deep neural networks.

New loss functions with auxiliary variables are\nestablished, in which only variables from two neighboring layers are coupled.\nCorresponding algorithms based on alternating directions are developed, where\nmany variables can be updated optimally in closed forms. Moreover, we provide\ntheoretical analyses demonstrating the consistency between the LySep model and\nthe original deep model.

As a first step in this direction, we focus on the\none-dimensional viscous Burgers equation as a toy model. Its solutions\nexhibiting self-similar behavior, in a precisely-defined sense, are found by\nframing this problems in terms of PDE-constrained optimization. The main\nphysical parameters are the time window over which self-similar behavior is\nsought (equal to approximately one eddy turnover time), viscosity (inversely\nproportional to the ``Reynolds number\") and an integer parameter characterizing\nthe distance in the Fourier space over which self-similar interactions occur.\nLocal solutions to this nonconvex PDE optimization problems are obtained with a\nstate-of-the-art adjoint-based gradient method. Two distinct families of\nsolutions, termed viscous and inertial, are identified and are distinguished\nprimarily by the behavior of enstrophy which, respectively, uniformly decays\nand grows in the two cases. The physically meaningful and appropriately\nself-similar inertial solutions are found only when a sufficiently small\nviscosity is considered. These flows achieve the self-similar behaviour by a\nuniform steepening of the wave fronts present in the solutions.

The effect of the magnetic fields on chaos is shown clearly\nthrough an explicit symplectic integrator and a fast Lyapunov indicator.

The\nphotometric results show that the radius of the nucleus is $1.11\\pm0.02$ km\nwith assumed geometric albedo of $p_r = 0.05$, and the color index of the\nnucleus is relatively close to that of the ejecta around the nucleus, with a\nvalue of $H_g - H_r = 0.44\\pm0.07$.

Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but\nsignificant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by\nexploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report\nall-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals\nA-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic\nsemiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves\na tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic\nfield switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in\nthe AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition.

Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism\nassociated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the\nspin-independent nature of bulk FCGT.

    "abstract": "With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit\nquantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.\nTo enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized\nmodels using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when\nquantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%\nimprovement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques.",

In\nparticular, we introduce the Dehn quasi-homothetic functions, which behave\nsimilarly to homotheties under repeated Dehn twists. We prove that any two\npositive such functions of the same type induce different oriented graphs\nunless they are proportional. This leads to a new rigidity result for closed\nhyperbolic surfaces -- distinct from the $9g-9$ theorem and length spectrum\nrigidity -- knowing only for any two disjoint simple closed curves which one is\nlonger (in terms of hyperbolic or extremal length) suffices to determine the\nhyperbolic metric on the surface. We also prove that each automorphism of the\noriented graph induced by a function with sublevel sets finite is induced by a\nself-homeomorphism of $S$.",

    "abstract": "Dismantling criminal networks or containing epidemics or misinformation\nthrough node removal is a well-studied problem. To evaluate the effectiveness\nof such efforts, one must measure the strength of the network before and after\nnode removal. Process P1 is considered more effective than P2 if the strength\nof the residual network after removing k nodes via P1 is smaller than that from\nP2. This leads to the central question: How should network strength be\nmeasured?\n  Existing metrics rely solely on structural properties of the graph, such as\nconnectivity. However, in real-world scenarios, particularly in law\nenforcement, the perception of agents regarding network strength can differ\nsignificantly from structural assessments. These perceptions are often ignored\nin traditional metrics.\n  We propose a new strength metric that integrates both structural properties\nand human perception. Using human subject surveys, we validate our approach\nagainst existing metrics. Our metric not only aligns more closely with human\njudgment but also outperforms traditional methods in identifying authoritative\nnodes and effectively dismantling both synthetic and real-world networks.",

    "abstract": "Weighted equitable partitioning of a graph has been of interest lately due to\nseveral applications, including redistricting, network algorithms, and image\ndecomposition. Weighting a partition according to the spanning-tree metric has\nbeen of mathematical and practical interest because it typically favors\npartitions with more compact pieces. An appealing algorithm suggested by\nCharikar et al. is to sample a random spanning tree and remove k-1 edges,\nproducing a random forest. If the components of the forest form a balanced\npartition, the partition is equitable under an easily computed acceptance\nprobability. Cannon et al. recently showed that spanning trees on grid graphs\nand grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized pieces\nwith probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling\nalgorithm for a class of graphs. We present complementary results showing that\nspanning trees on dense random graphs also have inverse polynomial probability\nof being splittable, giving another class of graphs where equitable partitions\ncan be efficiently sampled exactly. These proofs also guarantee fast\nalmost-uniform sampling for the up-down walk on forests, giving another\nprovably efficient randomized method for generating equitable partitions.\n  Further, we show that problems with the well-studied ReCom algorithm for\nequitable partitioning are more extensive than previously known, even in\nspecial cases that were believed to be more promising. We present a family of\ngraphs where the Markov chain fails to be irreducible when it must keep the\ncomponents perfectly equitable; yet when the chain is allowed an imbalance of\njust one vertex between components, the rejection sampling step may take\nexponential time. This is true even when the graph satisfies desirable\nproperties that have been conjectured to be sufficient for fast sampling.",

Existing construction\nmethods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual\nintervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,\nthey struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces\nsuitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce\nAortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces\ndirectly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided\nconditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines\nconditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then\nautomatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,\nensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are\nfitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh\nrepresentation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,\nincluding an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,\nand the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric\nfidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively\neven with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and\npathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or\ncoarctation.

    "abstract": "The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its\nmass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational\npotential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \\lesssim 4$\nkpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear\nstellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies\nremain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling\nand those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics.\nTo investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations\nincluding cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic\ngravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to\nobservational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks,\ndark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate\nsynthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity\nmethod to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed\nterminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature\narises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity\nmethod to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \\sim 0.4$\nkpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner\ngas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass\nconcentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not\nrequire a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming\nmotions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear,\nMilky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of\ndynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate\nmass inference in the inner Milky Way.",

    "abstract": "The path integral of pure 3D gravity with negative cosmological constant is\nformulated on a finite region of spacetime $M$, with boundary conditions that\nfix geodesic lengths or dihedral angles on $\\partial M$. In the dual CFT, this\nquasi-local amplitude calculates corrections to the Gaussian ensemble of OPE\ncoefficients for black hole states. By triangulating $M$ with generalized\ntetrahedra, we develop a general method to construct semiclassical geometries\nand to calculate the exact gravitational path integral on a fixed hyperbolic\ntopology. The path integral with fixed-length boundary conditions is a Virasoro\nTQFT amplitude-squared, and with fixed-angle boundary conditions it is a\npartition function of Conformal Turaev-Viro theory. The two are related by a\nmodular S-transform. In addition, we show how to translate the calculation of\nOPE statistics from Virasoro TQFT to the metric formalism, on general\ntopologies. These results are derived exactly, and some examples are also\nchecked semiclassically, including the geometries dual to the Virasoro\n6j-symbol and the modular S-matrix. The classical saddlepoint geometries are\nfinite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds ending on pleated Riemann surfaces, which\nhave vanishing extrinsic curvature except on geodesics where they can bend into\ncorners. The hyperbolic volumes of these geometries match the predictions of\nConformal Turaev-Viro theory and the dual CFT.",

    "abstract": "We introduce AdaptiSent, a new framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based\nSentiment Analysis (MABSA) that uses adaptive cross-modal attention mechanisms\nto improve sentiment classification and aspect term extraction from both text\nand images. Our model integrates dynamic modality weighting and\ncontext-adaptive attention, enhancing the extraction of sentiment and\naspect-related information by focusing on how textual cues and visual context\ninteract. We tested our approach against several baselines, including\ntraditional text-based models and other multimodal methods. Results from\nstandard Twitter datasets show that AdaptiSent surpasses existing models in\nprecision, recall, and F1 score, and is particularly effective in identifying\nnuanced inter-modal relationships that are crucial for accurate sentiment and\naspect term extraction. This effectiveness comes from the model's ability to\nadjust its focus dynamically based on the context's relevance, improving the\ndepth and accuracy of sentiment analysis across various multimodal data sets.\nAdaptiSent sets a new standard for MABSA, significantly outperforming current\nmethods, especially in understanding complex multimodal information.",
