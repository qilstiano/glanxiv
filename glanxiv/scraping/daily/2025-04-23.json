Bayesian inference for such models is challenging since the\nresulting posterior distribution is doubly intractable. Although auxiliary\nvariable MCMC (AVM) algorithms are known to be the most practical, they are\ncomputationally expensive due to the repeated auxiliary variable simulations.\nTo address this, we propose delayed-acceptance AVM (DA-AVM) methods, which can\nreduce the number of auxiliary variable simulations. The first stage of the\nkernel uses a cheap surrogate to decide whether to accept or reject the\nproposed parameter value. The second stage guarantees detailed balance with\nrespect to the posterior. The auxiliary variable simulation is performed only\non the parameters accepted in the first stage. We construct various surrogates\nspecifically tailored for doubly intractable problems, including subsampling\nstrategy, Gaussian process emulation, and frequentist estimator-based\napproximation.

The\nmethod involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a\nbiased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$.\nWe provide a rigorous theoretical framework, utilizing probability generating\nfunctions and roots of unity, demonstrating that this simple operation\nguarantees the exponential convergence of the output distribution to the ideal\nuniform distribution over $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$. A key theoretical result is\nthe method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias\n(provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, crucially, is maintained\neven under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise, which are common\nin physical systems. Analytical bounds quantify this exponential rate of\nconvergence, and are empirically validated by numerical simulations.

In this paper, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning\nmodel, the Cascade Mask R-CNN with a multi-scale vision transformer-based\nbackbone, to delineate RTS features across the Arctic. Two new strategies were\nintroduced to optimize multimodal learning and enhance the model's predictive\nperformance: (1) a feature-level, residual cross-modality attention fusion\nstrategy, which effectively integrates feature maps from multiple modalities to\ncapture complementary information and improve the model's ability to understand\ncomplex patterns and relationships within the data; (2) pre-trained unimodal\nlearning followed by multimodal fine-tuning to alleviate high computing demand\nwhile achieving strong model performance. Experimental results demonstrated\nthat our approach outperformed existing models adopting data-level fusion,\nfeature-level convolutional fusion, and various attention fusion strategies,\nproviding valuable insights into the efficient utilization of multimodal data\nfor RTS mapping.

For example, a localized drought can disrupt\nthe supply of critical raw materials such as cobalt or copper, affecting\nbattery and electric vehicle production. Similarly, regional conflicts can\nimpede cross-border trade, leading to broader economic consequences. Building\non an existing model of simultaneous supply and demand shocks, we introduce a\nnew propagation algorithm, Priority with Constraint, which modifies standard\npriority-based rationing by incorporating a minimum supply guarantee for all\ncustomers, regardless of their size or priority ranking. We also identify a\nbuffer effect inherent in the Industry Proportional algorithm, which reflects\nreal-world economic resilience. Finally, we extend the static shock propagation\nmodel to incorporate dynamic processes. We introduce mechanisms for gradual\nshock propagation, reflecting demand stickiness and the potential buffering\nrole of inventories, and gradual recovery, modeling the simultaneous recovery\nof supply capacity and the inherent tendency for demand to return to pre-shock\nlevels.

Those challenges include\nensuring state consistency, maintaining durability, and managing the\napplication lifecycle. At the same time, the shift to a distributed computing\ninfrastructure introduced new issues, such as message delivery, task\nscheduling, containerization, and (auto)scaling.\n  Although the data management community has made progress in developing\nanalytical and transactional database systems, transactional cloud applications\nhave received little attention in database research.

Although matching is appealing\nin its simplicity, it suffers important limitations in terms of clarity of the\ntarget estimand and the efficiency or precision with which is it estimated.\nScientifically justified causal estimands of vaccine effectiveness may be\ndifficult to define owing to the fact that vaccine uptake varies over calendar\ntime when infection dynamics may also be rapidly changing. We propose a causal\nestimand of vaccine effectiveness that summarizes vaccine effectiveness over\ncalendar time, similar to how vaccine efficacy is summarized in a randomized\ncontrolled trial. We describe the identification of our estimand, including its\nunderlying assumptions, and propose simple-to-implement estimators based on two\nhazard regression models. We apply our proposed estimator in simulations and in\na study to assess the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to\nprevent infections with SARS-CoV2 in children 5-11 years old.

    "abstract": "Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a\npowerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of\nvarious dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex\nnonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and\neffective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable\ncontraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time\nnonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of\ncontraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex\noptimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the\nassumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of\nNN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges\ndue to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge\nthis gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal\nneural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming\nonly the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational\nperspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the\nstate-of-the-art neural network verifier $\\alpha,\\!\\beta$-CROWN, which scales\nup non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic\nlinear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we\nfurther develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics\nfrom sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful\nsynthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear\nexamples.",

    "abstract": "Due to the proliferation of short-form content and the rapid adoption of AI,\nopportunities for deep, reflective thinking have significantly diminished,\nundermining users' critical thinking and reducing engagement with the reasoning\nbehind AI-generated outputs. To address this issue, we propose an Interactive\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) Framework that enhances human-centered explainability\nand responsible AI usage by making the model's inference process transparent,\nmodular, and user-editable. The framework decomposes reasoning into clearly\ndefined blocks that users can inspect, modify, and re-execute, encouraging\nactive cognitive engagement rather than passive consumption. It further\nintegrates a lightweight edit-adaptation mechanism inspired by preference\nlearning, allowing the system to align with diverse cognitive styles and user\nintentions. Ethical transparency is ensured through explicit metadata\ndisclosure, built-in bias checkpoint functionality, and privacy-preserving\nsafeguards. This work outlines the design principles and architecture necessary\nto promote critical engagement, responsible interaction, and inclusive\nadaptation in AI systems aimed at addressing complex societal challenges.",

The first quantity is the\nstage waiting time distribution (survival function), representing the\nproportion of individuals who remain in stage j within time t after entering\nstage j. The second quantity is the cumulative incidence function, representing\nthe proportion of individuals who transition from stage j to stage j' within\ntime t after entering stage j. To estimate these quantities, we present two\nnonparametric approaches. The first uses an inverse probability of censoring\nweighting (IPCW) method, which reweights the counting processes and the number\nof individuals at risk (the at-risk set) to address dependent right censoring.\nThe second method utilizes the notion of fractional observations (FRE) that\nmodifies the at-risk set by incorporating probabilities of individuals (who\nmight have been censored in a prior stage) eventually entering the stage of\ninterest in the uncensored or full data experiment. Neither approach is limited\nto the assumption of independent censoring or Markovian multi-stage frameworks.\nSimulation studies demonstrate satisfactory performance for both sets of\nestimators, though the IPCW estimator generally outperforms the FRE estimator\nin the setups considered in our simulations.

To address these two aforementioned issues, we\npropose a three-stage meta-judge selection pipeline: 1) developing a\ncomprehensive rubric with GPT-4 and human experts, 2) using three advanced LLM\nagents to score judgments, and 3) applying a threshold to filter out\nlow-scoring judgments.

Additionally, gender has no significant impact on network\nresilience, whether through random dismantling or targeted attacks on the\nlargest component. Males are more likely to be involved in multiple scandals\nthan females, and scandals predominantly involving females are rare, though\nthese differences are explained by a null network model in which gender is\nrandomly assigned while maintaining gender proportions.

While it\nis intuitive to assume that information accuracy in the LLM's responses would\nbe one of the influential variables, recent studies have found that inaccurate\nLLM's responses could still be preferable when they are perceived to be more\nauthoritative, certain, well-articulated, or simply verbose. These variables\ninterestingly fall under the broader category of language style, implying that\nthe style in the LLM's responses might meaningfully influence users'\npreferences. This hypothesized dynamic could have double-edged consequences:\nenhancing the overall user experience while simultaneously increasing their\nsusceptibility to risks such as LLM's misinformation or hallucinations. In this\nshort paper, we present our preliminary studies in exploring this subject.\nThrough a series of exploratory and experimental user studies, we found that\nLLM's language style does indeed influence user's preferences, but how and\nwhich language styles influence the preference varied across different user\npopulations, and more interestingly, moderated by the user's very own\nindividual traits. As a preliminary work, the findings in our studies should be\ninterpreted with caution, particularly given the limitations in our samples,\nwhich still need wider demographic diversity and larger sample sizes. Our\nfuture directions will first aim to address these limitations, which would\nenable a more comprehensive joint effect analysis between the language style,\nindividual traits, and preferences, and further investigate the potential\ncausal relationship between and beyond these variables.",

    "abstract": "Current quantum processors are fragile, noisy and fairly limited in both\nquantity and quality with tens of qubits and physical error rates of around\n10^-3. To realize practical quantum applications, however, error rates need to\nbe below 10^-15 across millions of qubits. To bridge this gap and fully harness\nthe potential of quantum computers, quantum error correction (QEC) is\nessential. QEC codes are designed to protect quantum information by redundantly\nencoding it onto multiple physical qubits. This encoding allows for the\ndetection and correction of local errors affecting individual qubits, e.g.,\nthrough stabilizer measurements. Importantly, if the physical error rates are\nbelow a specific threshold, QEC codes can exponentially suppress logical error\nrates by increasing the number of physical qubits involved. This is essential\nfor achieving fault-tolerant computations, which are key to unlocking the full\npotential of quantum computers. The work presented in this thesis focuses on\nthe implementation and optimization of small-scale QEC experiments using the\nsurface code and flux-tunable superconducting qubits (Transmons). It addresses\nseveral key challenges: enhancing two-qubit gate fidelity in Surface-4 (Chapter\n2), implementing an error-detection code with Surface-7 (Chapter 3), automating\nthe calibration and benchmarking of the building blocks in Surface-17 (Chapter\n4), reducing leakage into higher excited states with leakage reduction units\n(Chapter 5), assessing and enhancing the performance of logical qubits\n(Chapters 7 and 8).",

During\ninference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject\nthis physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative\nprocess toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional\npost-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design\nproblems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that\nour method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such\nas MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders\nof magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning\napproaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization\nschedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a\nstreamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for\nnext-generation photonic device design. Our open-source implementation is\navailable at https://github.com/dongjin-seo2020/AdjointDiffusion.",

    "abstract": "Generative image models are increasingly being used for training data\naugmentation in vision tasks. In the context of automotive object detection,\nmethods usually focus on producing augmented frames that look as realistic as\npossible, for example by replacing real objects with generated ones. Others try\nto maximize the diversity of augmented frames, for example by pasting lots of\ngenerated objects onto existing backgrounds. Both perspectives pay little\nattention to the locations of objects in the scene. Frame layouts are either\nreused with little or no modification, or they are random and disregard realism\nentirely. In this work, we argue that optimal data augmentation should also\ninclude realistic augmentation of layouts. We introduce a scene-aware\nprobabilistic location model that predicts where new objects can realistically\nbe placed in an existing scene. By then inpainting objects in these locations\nwith a generative model, we obtain much stronger augmentation performance than\nexisting approaches. We set a new state of the art for generative data\naugmentation on two automotive object detection tasks, achieving up to\n$2.8\\times$ higher gains than the best competing approach ($+1.4$ vs. $+0.5$\nmAP boost). We also demonstrate significant improvements for instance\nsegmentation.",

However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods\nhave convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we\nconduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing\ndatasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to\nenable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by\nautomatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that\nthese methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model\nlevels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human\nevaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is\ncomplex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not\ncurrently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human\nevaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future\nevaluations of LLM misgendering.

It can also be easily\nintegrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless,\nautoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a\nnatural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text\ngeneration, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image\ngeneration. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right)\nguides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that\nthis order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image\ncontent: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an\nautoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color\nof clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this\nwork, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in\nany-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each\npatch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune\nthe any-given-order model to produce better-quality images.

This\nis compounded by certain behavioral practices like retention of older, less\nefficient appliances, resulting in missed energy savings. Thus, the need to\nenhance efficiency becomes critical in these households. However, due to a lack\nof comprehensive data in India, little is understood about their electricity\nconsumption patterns and usage efficiency. Estimating inefficiency and\nassessing its determinants is crucial for improving their quality of life. This\nstudy measures the inefficiency in electricity consumption due to household\npractices and appliances in social housing in Mumbai, India. It considers\ntechnological determinants in addition to socio-economic variables. The study\nemploys primary data collected from rehabilitation housing and slums in Mumbai.\nStochastic frontier analysis, a parametric approach, is applied to estimate\nindicators of electricity consumption and inefficiency. While household size\nand workforce participation significantly affect consumption behavior in\nrehabilitation housing, it is limited to the workforce in slums. The ownership\nof appliances, except for washing machines in slums, also exhibits considerable\nimpacts. The mean efficiency scores of 83% and 91% for rehabilitation housing\nand slums, respectively, empirically quantify the potential savings achievable.\nFactors that positively influence inefficiency include the duration of\noperating refrigerators, washing machines, iron, and AC. These results hold\nimplications for enhancing the uptake of efficient appliances in addition to\naccelerating energy efficiency retrofits in the region. Policies should focus\non awareness and the development of appliance markets through incentives.",

To address this, load-balancing\ntechniques are employed in software-defined networks. Controller load balancing\ncan be categorized into two main approaches: (1) single-level thresholds and\n(2) multi-level thresholds. However, previous studies have predominantly relied\non single-level thresholds, which result in an imprecise classification of\ncontrollers or have assumed uniform controller capacities in multi-level\nthreshold methods. This study explores controller load balancing with a focus\non utilizing multi-level thresholds to accurately assess controller status.\nSwitch migration operations are utilized to achieve load balancing, considering\nfactors such as the degree of load imbalance of the target controller and\nmigration efficiency. This includes evaluating the post-migration status of the\ntarget controller and the distance between the migrating switch and the target\ncontroller to select the appropriate target controller and migrating switch.\nThe proposed scheme reduces controller response time, migration costs,\ncommunication overhead, and throughput rate. Results demonstrate that our\nscheme outperforms others regarding response time and overall performance.",

It is well-known that random lozenge tilings of the hexagon correspond\nto a two-dimensional determinantal point process via a bijection with ensembles\nof non-intersecting paths. The starting point of our analysis is a formula for\nthe correlation kernel due to Duits and Kuijlaars which involves the\nChristoffel-Darboux kernel of a particular family of non-Hermitian orthogonal\npolynomials. Our main results are split into two parts: the first part concerns\nthe family of orthogonal polynomials, and the second concerns the behavior of\nthe boundary of the so-called arctic curve. In the first half, we identify the\northogonal polynomials as a non-standard instance of little $q$-Jacobi\npolynomials and compute their large degree asymptotics in the $q \\to 1$ regime.\nA consequence of this analysis is a proof that the zeros of the orthogonal\npolynomials accumulate on an arc of a circle and an asymptotic formula for the\nChristoffel-Darboux kernel. In the second half, we use these asymptotics to\nshow that the boundary of the liquid region converges to the Airy process, in\nthe sense of finite dimensional distributions, away from the boundary of the\nhexagon.

Second,\nVirtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of\na full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional\nfine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token\ncompression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free,\nmaking it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures.\nExtensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that\nDyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving\ncomparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures,\nincluding the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore,\nthrough qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts\ntoken reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems,\nprovides users more control over computational costs.

Existing methods for satellite-based air pollution\nestimation model the relationship between satellite and in-situ measurements at\nselect point locations. While these approaches have advanced our ability to\nprovide air quality estimations on a global scale, they come with inherent\nlimitations. The most notable limitation is the computational intensity\nrequired for generating comprehensive estimates over extensive areas. Motivated\nby these limitations, this study introduces a novel dense estimation technique.\nOur approach seeks to balance the accuracy of high-resolution estimates with\nthe practicality of computational constraints, thereby enabling efficient and\nscalable global environmental assessment.

    "abstract": "Long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs), including their subclasses of low-luminosity\nGRBs (LL-GRBs) and X-ray flashes (XRFs) characterized by low spectral peak\nenergies, are known to be associated with broad-lined Type Ic supernovae (SNe\nIc-BL), which result from the core collapse of massive stars that lose their\nouter hydrogen and helium envelopes. However, the soft and weak end of the\nGRB/XRF population remains largely unexplored, due to the limited sensitivity\nto soft X-ray emission. Here we report the discovery of a fast X-ray transient,\nEP250108a, detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) in the soft X-ray band at\nredshift $z = 0.176$, which was followed up by extensive multiband\nobservations. EP250108a shares similar X-ray luminosity as XRF\\,060218, the\nprototype of XRFs, but it extends GRBs/XRFs down to the unprecedentedly soft\nand weak regimes, with its $E_{\\rm peak} \\lesssim 1.8\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ and\n$E_{\\rm iso} \\lesssim 10^{49}\\, \\mathrm{erg}$, respectively. Meanwhile,\nEP250108a is found to be associated with SN\\,2025kg, one of the most luminous\nand possibly magnetar-powered SNe Ic-BL detected so far.

Adaptive\nOptics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric\nmeasurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to\nthe incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of\natmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the\nperformance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space\nOptical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel\ndata-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision\nfor Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid\nwavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed\nsimulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO\nsimulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront\nsensors.

FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network\nfor weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European\nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset\nat single levels and different pressure levels.

The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete.

We demonstrate both\n(i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated\napplication programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to\ntrain the original FourCastNet model.

Aims. Our aim is to assemble the largest\npossible sample of star-forming galaxies with potential detectability by the\nnew-generation of Cherenkov telescopes. Methods. To achieve this, we compile a\ncomprehensive sample of galaxies, including those previously detected by\nFermi-LAT in the GeV energy range as well as a larger sample of star-forming\ngalaxies in the Local Volume that have been cataloged in the near-infrared\nband. We estimate their {\\gamma}-ray flux assuming a proportional relationship\nwith their star formation rate, and then select the brightest candidates. The\npredicted spectra in the TeV band are derived using a simple empirical model\nnormalized to the star formation rate and a model based on extrapolating the\nlatest Fermi-LAT data to higher energies. The ground-based detectability of\n{\\gamma}-ray emission from these sources is assessed through a comparison to\nthe most recent instrument response functions. Results.

The observation of numerous star-forming\ngalaxies in the TeV band is a fundamental piece of the panchromatic puzzle for\nunderstanding the physics inside these galaxies.

While quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping\ntimes are well understood within black-hole perturbation theory, their\nexcitation amplitudes remain challenging to model, as they depend on the merger\nphase. The complexity increases for precessing black-hole binaries, where\nmultiple emission modes can contribute comparably to the ringdown. In this\npaper, we investigate the phenomenology of precessing binary black hole\nringdowns using the SXS numerical relativity simulations catalog.

Using Gaussian process regression, we construct the first fits for\nthe ringdown amplitudes of the most relevant modes in precessing systems.",

Recent results for\nthe latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value\nequivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and\nmonotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse \"trivial\" equivalence\nclasses in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the\ncollapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant\nreductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing\nalgorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used\nas a fast pre-processing step in practice.",

Since the introduction of code-specific\nmodels, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the\ntask of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved\nand will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we\nintroduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be\nused within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and\noff-the-shelf automated theorem provers.

To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage\nfine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model\nto generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that\nencourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover.

Assuming that they are\norbiting a supermassive black hole in orthogonal orbits, we perform a general\nrelativistic simulation of the collision, varying the relative velocity $V_0$\nfrom $0.032c$ to $0.2c$ (where $c$ is the speed of light) with a variety of\ndisk thickness and a realistic local density profile for the disk. Our findings\nindicate that the mass of the outflow matter from the disk, $m_{\\rm ej}$, is\nslightly less than the expected value. Meanwhile, the typical energy associated\nwith this outflow $E_{\\rm ej}$ is $\\sim m_{\\rm ej}V_0^2$. Thus, the predicted\npeak luminosity from disk flares is approximately equal to the Eddington\nluminosity of the black hole, whereas the peak time and duration of the flares,\nwhich are $\\propto m_{\\rm ej}^{1/2}$, are shorter than that previously\nbelieved. We also demonstrate that the property of the outflow matter induced\nby the incoming and outgoing stages of the black hole collision is appreciably\ndifferent. We find that a high mass accretion rate onto the black hole from the\ndisk persists for a timescale of $\\sim 10^6$ Schwarzschild time of the black\nhole after the collision for $V_0/c \\lesssim 0.1$, making this long-term\naccretion onto the black hole the dominant emission process for black hole-disk\ncollision events.

Here, we go beyond the single-excitation level\nto show that such systems can give rise to few-particle Laughlin-like states.\nIn particular, we consider small honeycomb ``flakes,'' where the divergences\ncan be smeared out by finite-size effects. By choosing an appropriate value of\nmagnetic field we thereby obtain an energy spectrum and eigenstates resembling\nthose of Landau levels. The native hard-core nature of atomic excitations then\ngives rise to multi-excitation Laughlin-like states. This phenomenon occurs not\nonly in samples of tens of sites, but also in a minimal nanoring system of only\nsix sites. Next, considering two-particle Laughlin-like states, we show that\nthey can be driven by uniform light, and that correlations of the output light\ncontain identifying fingerprints of these states.

Furthermore, we discuss main\nchallenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and\nhow human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To\nverify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The\nobjective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to\nneutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first\nimplement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called\nCogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads\nto faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding\ndirection for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of\nadvice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and\nunder-training.

In this work, we introduce a\ntheoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting\nhallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the\nclassical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent\nadaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate\nwhether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language\n$K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can\nreliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute\nhallucinations.\n  First, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the\nclassical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination\ndetection method can be converted into a language identification method, and\nconversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for\nhallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language\nidentification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally\nimpossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only\ncorrect examples from the target language.\n  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the\ndetector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples\n(explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this\nconclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination\ndetection becomes possible for all countable language collections.\n  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in\ntraining hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for\nfeedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.",

An intermediate state bridges the gap between MAD and\nSANE regimes, with moderate magnetic support (plasma-$\\beta \\sim 1$) producing\nmixed outflow morphologies and complex variability.

Comparing two with three dimensional simulations demonstrates that\nwhile quantitative details differ, the qualitative features distinguishing\ndifferent accretion states remain robust. The outflow power and variability\nfollow a fundamental scaling relation with mass determined by the magnetic\nfield configuration, demonstrating how similar accretion physics operates from\nstellar-mass X-ray binaries (XRBs) to intermediate mass black hole sources.\nThis could be extrapolated further to supermassive black holes.",

Lower-mass halos are however\nunlikely to be filled with a similar quasi-static hot phase, due to rapid\nradiative cooling. Using the FIRE cosmological zoom simulations, we demonstrate\nthat the hot phase is indeed sub-dominant at inner radii ($\\lesssim 0.3\\,R_{\\rm\nvir}$) of $\\lesssim 10^{12}\\,M_\\odot$ halos, and the inner CGM is instead\nfilled with $T \\ll T_{\\rm vir}$ gas originating in outflows and inflows, with a\nturbulent velocity comparable to the halo virial velocity.

UV absorption features from such CGM trace the wide\nlognormal density distributions of the predominantly cool and turbulent\nvolume-filling phase, in contrast with tracing localized cool 'clouds' embedded\nin a hot medium.

    "abstract": "Dark matter (DM) candidates with very small masses, and correspondingly large\nnumber densities, have gained significant interest in recent years. These DM\ncandidates are typically said to behave \"classically\". More specifically, they\nare often assumed to reside in an ensemble of coherent states. One notable\nexception to this scenario is when isocurvature fluctuations of the DM are\nproduced during inflation (or more generally by any Bogoliubov transformation).\nIn such contexts, the ultralight DM instead resides in a squeezed state. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that these two scenarios can be distinguished via the\nstatistics of the DM density fluctuations, such as the matter power spectrum\nand bispectrum. This provides a probe of the DM state which persists in the\nlimit of large particle number and does not rely on any non-gravitational\ninteractions of the DM. Importantly, the statistics of these two states differ\nwhen the modes of the squeezed state are all in-phase, as is the case at the\nend of inflation. Later cosmological dynamics may affect this configuration.\nOur work motivates future numerical studies of how cosmological dynamics may\nimpact the initial squeezed state and the statistics of its density\nfluctuations.",

    "abstract": "The mass of the Local Group (LG), comprising the Milky Way (MW), Andromeda\n(M31), and their satellites, is crucial for validating galaxy formation and\ncosmological models. Traditional virial mass estimates, which rely on\nline-of-sight (LoS) velocities and simplified infall assumptions, are prone to\nsystematic biases due to unobserved velocity components and anisotropic\nkinematics. Using the TNG cosmological simulation, we examine two limiting\ncases: the \\underline{minor infall} model -- ignoring perpendicular velocities\nto the LoS directions) and the \\underline{major infall} model -- assuming\npurely radial motion towards the Center of Mass (CoM). Our simulations\ndemonstrate that geometric corrections are vital: the minor-infall model\nunderestimates the true mass, while the major-infall model overestimates it. By\napplying these calibrated corrections to observed dwarf galaxy kinematics\nwithin 1 Mpc of the LG's CoM, we derive a refined LG mass of $M_{\\mathrm{LG}} =\n(2.99 \\pm 0.60) \\times 10^{12}\\, M_\\odot$. This finding aligns with predictions\nfrom the $\\Lambda$CDM model, timing arguments, and independent mass estimates,\nresolving previous discrepancies.

This condition is known to break down in\nlow-energy effective theories, such as $P(X)$ models with a derivative\ninteraction term of the ``wrong sign\". Despite their Lorentz-invariant form,\nthese theories can exhibit superluminal propagation on Lorentz-breaking\nbackgrounds. We approach this phenomenon by computing the full operator-valued\ncommutator in position space, perturbatively in interaction picture. After\ntesting this formalism on a $\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory, we apply it to a $P(X)$\nmodel. There, we show that the perturbative corrections to the free-theory\ncommutator contain derivatives of delta functions with support on the standard\nMinkowski light cone. While these corrections vanish on Lorentz-invariant\nstates, they become ``activated\" on states where Lorentz symmetry is\nspontaneously broken. In this case, they approximate the new ``sound-cone\" by\nmeans of a Taylor expansion. By applying linear response theory to an extended\nsource, we show that deviations from standard causality are already present at\nfirst order in this expansion.

Using the\ndistributions of minimum pair distances and nearest-neighbor distances, we find\nthat when the stealthiness parameter $\\chi$ is lower than 0.5, the maximal\nvalues of $\\phi$, denoted by $\\phi_{\\max}$, decrease to zero on average as the\nparticle number $N$ increases if there are no soft-core repulsions. By\ncontrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large\n$\\phi_{\\max}$ independent of $N$, reaching up to $\\phi_{\\max}=1.0, 0.86, 0.63$\nin the zero-$\\chi$ limit and decreasing to $\\phi_{\\max}=1.0, 0.67, 0.47$ at\n$\\chi=0.45$ for $d=1,2,3$, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for\n$\\phi_{\\max}$ as functions of $\\chi$ and $N$ for a given $d$. For $d=2,3$, our\nsoft-core SHU packings for small $\\chi$ become configurationally very close to\nthe jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as\nmeasured by the pair statistics. As $\\chi$ increases beyond $0.20$, the\npackings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains. The resulting\nstructure factors $S(k)$ and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ reveal that\nsoft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range\ncorrelations in the SHU ground states.

    "abstract": "Many sparse attention mechanisms such as Neighborhood Attention have\ntypically failed to consistently deliver speedup over the self attention\nbaseline. This is largely due to the level of complexity in attention\ninfrastructure, and the rapid evolution of AI hardware architecture. At the\nsame time, many state-of-the-art foundational models, particularly in computer\nvision, are heavily bound by attention, and need reliable sparsity to escape\nthe O(n^2) complexity. In this paper, we study a class of promising sparse\nattention mechanisms that focus on locality, and aim to develop a better\nanalytical model of their performance improvements. We first introduce\nGeneralized Neighborhood Attention (GNA), which can describe sliding window,\nstrided sliding window, and blocked attention. We then consider possible design\nchoices in implementing these approaches, and create a simulator that can\nprovide much more realistic speedup upper bounds for any given setting.\nFinally, we implement GNA on top of a state-of-the-art fused multi-headed\nattention (FMHA) kernel designed for the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture in\nCUTLASS. Our implementation can fully realize the maximum speedup theoretically\npossible in many perfectly block-sparse cases, and achieves an effective\nutilization of 1.3 petaFLOPs/second in FP16. In addition, we plug various GNA\nconfigurations into off-the-shelf generative models, such as Cosmos-7B,\nHunyuanVideo, and FLUX, and show that it can deliver 28% to 46% end-to-end\nspeedup on B200 without any fine-tuning.

We investigate the coupling\nbetween the tidal field and quasi-normal modes in hybrid stars and show that\nthe discontinuity mode ($g$-mode)--intrinsically associated with first-order\nphase transitions and buoyancy--can rival the contribution of the fundamental\n$f$-mode. We find that the $g$-mode overlap integral can reach up to $\\sim\n10\\%$ of the $f$-mode value for hybrid star masses in the range\n1.4-2.0$M_{\\odot}$, with the largest values generally associated with larger\ndensity jumps. This leads to a GW phase shift due to the $g$-mode of $\\Delta\n\\phi_g \\lesssim 0.1$-$1$ rad (i.e., up to $\\sim$5\\%-10\\% of $\\Delta \\phi_f$),\nwith the largest shifts occurring for masses near the phase transition. At\nhigher masses, the shifts remain smaller and nearly constant, with $\\Delta\n\\phi_g \\lesssim 0.1$ rad (roughly $\\sim 1\\%$ of $\\Delta \\phi_f$). These GW\nshifts may be relevant even at the design sensitivity of current\nsecond-generation GW detectors in the most optimistic cases. Moreover, if a\n$g$-mode is present and lies near the $f$-mode frequency, neglecting it in the\nGW modeling can lead to systematic biases in neutron star parameter estimation,\nresulting in radius errors of up to $1\\%-2\\%$.

We observe that in T2V generation tasks, the generated videos\noften contain substantial redundant information not explicitly specified in the\ntext prompts, such as environmental elements, secondary objects, and additional\ndetails, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to embed hidden\nharmful content. Exploiting this inherent redundancy, we introduce BadVideo,\nthe first backdoor attack framework tailored for T2V generation. Our attack\nfocuses on designing target adversarial outputs through two key strategies: (1)\nSpatio-Temporal Composition, which combines different spatiotemporal features\nto encode malicious information; (2) Dynamic Element Transformation, which\nintroduces transformations in redundant elements over time to convey malicious\ninformation. Based on these strategies, the attacker's malicious target\nseamlessly integrates with the user's textual instructions, providing high\nstealthiness.

To avoid excessively accurate reconstruction, reprojected point\ncloud multi-plane fitting and two complexity control strategies are proposed,\nthus improving upon multipath estimation speed. Experiments were conducted in\nLujiazui, Shanghai, a typical multipath-prone district. The results show that\nthe method achieves an average reconstruction accuracy of 2.4 meters in dense\nurban environments featuring glass curtain wall structures, a traditionally\ntough case for reconstruction, and achieves a ray-tracing-based multipath\ncorrection rate of 30 image frames per second, 10 times faster than the\ncontemporary benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Tokenization is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP),\nespecially for low resource languages, where subword segmentation influences\nvocabulary structure and downstream task accuracy. Although Byte Pair Encoding\n(BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its\nsuitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages\nremains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological\ncomplexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and\nCharacter Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low\nresource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as\nextremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We\nassess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of\nvocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic\ndownstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual\ntransfer.\n  Our experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing\napproach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero\nshot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While\nBPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of\ngeneralization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity\nlabels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes\na better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low\nresource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and\nManipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization\nacross scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to\nSentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within\nmultilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.",

By\nmapping over-densities in [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe], we seek to identify spiral arms\nin both radial and vertical planes, detect substructures, and compare our\nresults with recent Galactic chemical evolution models.

We compared our\nresults with the spiral arm models proposed by Spitoni et al. (2023) and\nBarbillon et al. (2024). For the first time, the inner spiral arms were\nrevealed using chemical abundance patterns. We detected [Fe/H] enhancements and\n[Mg/Fe] under-abundances that consistently trace the Scutum and Sagittarius\narms. A connecting spur between these arms is observed in the [Mg/H] plane. The\nalignment between our observations and the results of our 2D chemical evolution\nmodels reinforces the significance of spiral arm transits in driving both\nazimuthal and radial variations in chemical abundances. Our results confirm\nthat spiral arms can be traced using stellar chemical abundances with GES data,\nproviding a new perspective on the structure of the inner Galaxy. The\nconsistency between enhanced [Fe/H] and lower [Mg/Fe] ratios, as observed in\nprevious studies, further strengthens the reliability of our findings.

It's widely accepted that magnetic exchange-coupling between core and\nshell plays the crucial role in enhancing SLP of magnetic core/shell\nnanoparticles. However, the physical contribution of exchange coupling to SLP\nhas not been systematically investigated, and the underlying mechanism remains\nunclear. In this study, magnetic hard/soft CoFe$_2$O$_4$/MnFe$_2$O$_4 and\ninverted soft/hard MnFe$_2$O$_4$/CoFe$_2$O$_4$ core/shell nanoparticles were\nsynthesized, systematically varying the number of shell layers, to investigate\nthe physical contribution of internal bias coupling at the core/shell interface\nto AC heat induction (SLP). Our results show that a unique magnetic property,\ndouble-hysteresis loop, was present and clearly observed, which was never\nreported in previous core/shell research literature. According to the\nexperimentally and theoretically analyzed results, the double-hysteresis\nbehavior in core/shell nanoparticles was caused by the difference in magnetic\nanisotropy between core and shell materials, separated by a non-magnetic\ninterface. The enhanced SLP and maximum temperature rise (TAC,max) of\ncore/shell nanoparticles are attributed to the optimized magnetic anisotropy,\nAC magnetic softness and double hysteresis behavior due to the internal bias\ncoupling. These results demonstrate that the rational design capabilities to\nseparately control the magnetic anisotropy, AC/DC magnetic properties by\nvarying the volume ration between core and shell and by switching hard or soft\nphase materials between core and shell are effective modalities to enhance the\nAC heat induction of core/shell nanoparticles for magnetic nanoparticle\nhyperthermia.",

Gonzalez gave a classification of almost contact\nmetric manifolds into $2^{12}$ classes, based on the behaviour of the covariant\nderivative $\\nabla^g\\Phi$ of the fundamental $2$-form $\\Phi$. This large number\nmakes it difficult to deal with this class of manifolds. We propose a new\napproach to almost contact metric manifolds by introducing two intrinsic\nendomorphisms $S$ and $h$, which bear their name from the fact that they are,\nbasically, the entities appearing in the intrinsic torsion. We present a new\nclassification scheme for them by providing a simple flowchart based on\nalgebraic conditions involving $S$ and $h$, which then naturally leads to a\nregrouping of the Chinea-Gonzalez classes, and, in each step, to a further\nrefinement, eventually ending in the single classes. This method allows a more\nnatural exposition and derivation of both known and new results, like a new\ncharacterization of almost contact metric manifolds admitting a characteristic\nconnection in terms of intrinsic endomorphisms. We also describe in detail the\nremarkable (and still very large) subclass of $\\mathcal{H}$-parallel almost\ncontact manifolds, defined by the condition $(\\nabla^g_X\\Phi)(Y,Z)=0$ for all\nhorizontal vector fields, $X,Y,Z\\in\\mathcal{H}$.",

Different to previous\napproaches in the same spirit, the computation of a new candidate set only\nrequires the solution of one prescribed mean curvature problem instead of the\nresolution of a fractional minimization task analogous to finding a generalized\nCheeger set. After discretization, the former can be realized by a single run\nof a graph cut algorithm leading to significant speedup in practice. We prove\nthe global sublinear convergence of the resulting method, under mild\nassumptions, and its asymptotic linear convergence in a more restrictive\ntwo-dimensional setting which uses results of stability of surfaces of\nprescribed curvature under perturbations of the curvature.

Text analysis relies on understanding\ndocuments through structured attributes spanning various granularities of the\ndocuments such as words, phrases, sentences, topics, or clusters. However,\ncurrent text visualization tools typically adopt a fixed representation\ntailored to specific tasks or domains, requiring users to switch tools as their\nanalytical goals change. To address this limitation, we present Texture, a\ngeneral-purpose interactive text exploration tool. Texture introduces a\nconfigurable data schema for representing text documents enriched with\ndescriptive attributes. These attributes can appear at arbitrary levels of\ngranularity in the text and possibly have multiple values, including\ndocument-level attributes, multi-valued attributes (e.g., topics), fine-grained\nspan-level attributes (e.g., words), and vector embeddings. The system then\ncombines existing interactive methods for text exploration into a single\ninterface that provides attribute overview visualizations, supports\ncross-filtering attribute charts to explore subsets, uses embeddings for a\ndataset overview and similar instance search, and contextualizes filters in the\nactual documents. We evaluated Texture through a two-part user study with 10\nparticipants from varied domains who each analyzed their own dataset in a\nbaseline session and then with Texture. Texture was able to represent all of\nthe previously derived dataset attributes, enabled participants to more quickly\niterate during their exploratory analysis, and discover new insights about\ntheir data.

    "abstract": "Primal-dual algorithm (PDA) is a classic and popular scheme for\nconvex-concave saddle point problems. It is universally acknowledged that the\nproximal terms in the subproblems about the primal and dual variables are\ncrucial to the convergence theory and numerical performance of primal-dual\nalgorithms. By taking advantage of the information from the current and\nprevious iterative points, we exploit two new proximal terms for the\nsubproblems about the primal and dual variables. Based on two new proximal\nterms, we present a new primal-dual algorithm for convex-concave saddle point\nproblems with bilinear coupling terms and establish its global convergence and\nO(1/N ) ergodic convergence rate. When either the primal function or the dual\nfunction is strongly convex, we accelerate the above proposed algorithm and\nshow that the corresponding algorithm can achieve O(1/N^2) convergence rate.\nSince the conditions for the stepsizes of the proposed algorithm are related\ndirectly to the spectral norm of the linear transform, which is difficult to\nobtain in some applications, we also introduce a linesearch strategy for the\nabove proposed primal-dual algorithm and establish its global convergence and\nO(1/N ) ergodic convergence rate . Some numerical experiments are conducted on\nmatrix game and LASSO problems by comparing with other state-of-the-art\nalgorithms, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed three\nprimal-dual algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning Integrated Model Predictive\nControl (ML-MPC) are promising approaches for optimizing hydrogen-diesel\ndual-fuel engine control, as they can effectively control multiple-input\nmultiple-output systems and nonlinear processes. ML-MPC is advantageous for\nproviding safe and optimal controls, ensuring the engine operates within\npredefined safety limits. In contrast, RL is distinguished by its adaptability\nto changing conditions through its learning-based approach. However, the\npractical implementation of either method alone poses challenges. RL requires\nhigh variance in control inputs during early learning phases, which can pose\nrisks to the system by potentially executing unsafe actions, leading to\nmechanical damage. Conversely, ML-MPC relies on an accurate system model to\ngenerate optimal control inputs and has limited adaptability to system drifts,\nsuch as injector aging, which naturally occur in engine applications. To\naddress these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid RL and ML-MPC approach\nthat uses an ML-MPC framework while incorporating an RL agent to dynamically\nadjust the ML-MPC load tracking reference in response to changes in the\nenvironment. At the same time, the ML-MPC ensures that actions stay safe\nthroughout the RL agent's exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of this\napproach, fuel pressure is deliberately varied to introduce a model-plant\nmismatch between the ML-MPC and the engine test bench. The result of this\nmismatch is a root mean square error (RMSE) in indicated mean effective\npressure of 0.57 bar when running the ML-MPC. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that RL successfully adapts to changing boundary conditions by\naltering the tracking reference while ML-MPC ensures safe control inputs. The\nquantitative improvement in load tracking by implementing RL is an RSME of 0.44\nbar.",

While\nprior works have largely focused on theoretical aspects, real-time validation\nunder user mobility remains underexplored. In this work, we propose and\nexperimentally evaluate an adaptive beamforming algorithm that enables RIS\nreconfiguration via a low-rate feedback link from the mobile user equipment\n(UE) to the RIS controller, operating without requiring UE position knowledge.\nThe algorithm maintains the received signal power above a predefined threshold\nusing only a single-bit comparison of received power levels. To analyze the\nalgorithms performance, we establish a simulation-based Monte Carlo (MC)\noptimization benchmark that assumes full UE position knowledge, accounts for\npractical hardware constraints, and serves as an upper bound for performance\nevaluation. Using a hexagonal RIS with 127 elements and 1-bit phase\nquantization at 23.8 GHz, we validate the proposed approach in a semi-anechoic\nenvironment over a 60 cm by 92 cm area. The results demonstrate that the\nsingle-bit feedback-driven algorithm closes much of the performance gap to the\nMC upper bound while achieving up to 24 dB gain in received power compared to\nan inactive RIS baseline.

However, the presence\nof unknown systematics present in differrent datasets can lead to a biased\ninference of the cosmological parameters. In this work, we test the consistency\nof the two independent tracers of the low-redshift cosmic expansion, namely the\nsupernovae dataset from Pantheon$+$ and the BAO dataset from DESI DR2 using the\ndistance duality relation which is a cornerstone relation in cosmology under\nthe framework of General Relativity. We find that these datasets violate the\ndistance duality relation and show a signature of redshift evolution, hinting\ntoward unaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts. Coincidentally\nthis effect mimics a redshift evolving dark energy scenario when supernovae\ndataset and DESI datasets are combined without accounting for this\ninconsistency. Accounting for this effect in the likelihood refutes the\nprevious claim of evidence of non-cosmological constant as dark energy model\nfrom DESI DR2, and shows a result consistent with cosmological constant with\n$w_0= -0.92\\pm 0.08$ and $w_a= -0.49^{+0.33}_{-0.36}$. This indicates that the\ncurrent conclusion from DESI DR2 in combination with Pantheon$+$ is likely due\nto the combination of two inconsistent datasets resulting in precise but\ninaccurate inference of cosmological parameters. In the future, tests of this\nkind for the consistency between different cosmological datasets will be\nessential for robust inference of cosmological parameters and for deciphering\nunaccounted physical effects or observational artifacts from supernovae and BAO\ndatasets.",

For instance, if a jobs program benefits members\nof one city more than another, is that due to differences in program\nparticipants (particular covariates) or the local labor markets (outcomes given\ncovariates)? The Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder (KOB) decomposition is a standard tool\nin econometrics that explains the difference in the mean outcome across two\npopulations. However, the KOB decomposition assumes a linear relationship\nbetween covariates and outcomes, while the true relationship may be\nmeaningfully nonlinear. Modern machine learning boasts a variety of nonlinear\nfunctional decompositions for the relationship between outcomes and covariates\nin one population. It seems natural to extend the KOB decomposition using these\nfunctional decompositions. We observe that a successful extension should not\nattribute the differences to covariates -- or, respectively, to outcomes given\ncovariates -- if those are the same in the two populations. Unfortunately, we\ndemonstrate that, even in simple examples, two common decompositions --\nfunctional ANOVA and Accumulated Local Effects -- can attribute differences to\noutcomes given covariates, even when they are identical in two populations. We\nprovide a characterization of when functional ANOVA misattributes, as well as a\ngeneral property that any discrete decomposition must satisfy to avoid\nmisattribution. We show that if the decomposition is independent of its input\ndistribution, it does not misattribute.

Then, we prove that for almost all values of the Weber number\nbelow this threshold any small solution lives for almost all times, remaining\nclose to the equilibrium. Our analysis reveals a remarkable stabilization\nphenomenon: the presence of both non-zero background velocity jump and\ncapillarity effects enables to prevent nonlinear instability phenomena, despite\nthe inherently unstable nature of the classical Kelvin-Helmholtz problem. This\nlong-time existence would not be achievable in a setting where capillarity\nalone provides linear stabilization, without the richer modulation induced by\nthe velocity jump. Our proof exploits the Hamiltonian nature of the equations.\nSpecifically, we employ Hamiltonian Birkhoff normal form techniques for\nquasi-linear systems together with a general approach for paralinearization of\nnon-linear singular integral operators. This approach allows us to control\nresonances and quasi-resonances at arbitrary order, ensuring the desired\nlong-time stability result.",

However, existing dialogue planning methods generate\ndialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from\ncompounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages\ndiffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates\ndialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance,\nand leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the\ndialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD\nintroduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types,\noffering flexible guidance toward diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive\nexperiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively\nperform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a\nlong horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong\nflexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios.

Generalised\ntime-translation-invariance is obtained, out of equilibrium, from a change of\nrepresentation of the Lie algebra generators of the dynamical symmetries of\nscale-invariance and time-translation-invariance. Observable consequences\ninclude the algebraic form of the scaling functions for large arguments of the\ntwo-time auto-correlators and auto-responses, the equality of the\nauto-correlation and the auto-response exponents $\\lambda_C=\\lambda_R$, the\ncross-over scaling form for an initially magnetised critical system and the\nexplanation of a novel finite-size scaling if the auto-correlator or\nauto-response converge for large arguments $y=t/s\\gg 1$ to a plateau. For\nglobal two-time correlators, the time-dependence involving the initial critical\nslip exponent $\\Theta$ is confirmed and is generalised to all temperatures\nbelow criticality and to the global two-time response function, and their\nfinite-size scaling is derived as well. This also includes the time-dependence\nof the squared global order-parameter. The celebrate Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann\nscaling relation with the auto-correlation exponent is thereby extended to all\ntemperatures below the critical temperature. A simple criterion on the\nrelevance of non-linear terms in the stochastic equation of motion is derived,\ntaking the dimensionality of couplings into account.

When numerical experiments\nare initialized with equal energy content, increasing turbulence intensity\nenhances the evaporation of n-heptane throughout the simulation, while ammonia\nevaporation soon becomes less sensitive to turbulence due to rapid vapor\nsaturation.

We use the equations of motion to compute the transient response of\nthe driven and dissipative spin-phonon system, which we characterize using the\nphonon displacement, phonon number, and triplon occupations. In the Fourier\ntransforms of each quantity we discover a low-frequency energetic oscillation\nbetween the lattice and spin sectors, which is an intrinsically nonequilibrium\ncollective mode, and demonstrate its origin as a beating between mutually\nrepelling composite excitations. We introduce a phonon-bitriplon approximation\nthat captures all the physics of hybridization, collective mode formation, and\ndifference-frequency excitation, and show that sum-frequency phenomena also\nleave clear signatures in the repsonse. We model the appearance of such\nmagnetophononic phenomena in the strongly-coupled spin-chain compound\nCuGeO$_3$, whose overlapping phonon and spin excitation spectra are well\ncharacterized, to deduce the criteria for their possible observation in quantum\nmagnetic materials.",

Methods. We observed pi1 Gru with ALMA and VLT/SPHERE.\nIn addition, we collected archival photometry data and used the Hipparcos-Gaia\nproper motion anomaly. We derive the best orbital parameters from Bayesian\ninference. Results. In June-July 2019, the inner companion, pi1 Gru C, was\nlocated at 37.4 +/- 2.0 mas from the primary (a projected separation of 6.05\n+/- 0.55 au at 161.7 +/- 11.7 pc). The best orbital solution yields a companion\nmass of 0.86 (+0.22/-0.20) Msun (using the derived mass of the primary) and a\nsemi-major axis of 7.05(+0.54/-0.57) au, corresponding to an orbital period of\n11.0 (+1.7/-1.5) yr. The preferred solution is an elliptical orbit with\neccentricity e = 0.35(+0.18/-0.17), although a circular orbit cannot be fully\nexcluded. The close companion could be either a K1V (F9.5V to K7V) star or a\nwhite dwarf (WD). Ultraviolet and millimeter continuum photometry are\nconsistent with the presence of an accretion disk around the close companion.\nThe ultraviolet emission may originate from hot spots in an overall cooler\ndisk, or from a hot disk if the companion is a WD. Conclusions. Although the\nclose companion and the AGB star are interacting and an accretion disk is\nobserved around the companion, the mass-accretion rate is too low to trigger a\nType Ia supernova, but it could produce novae every ~900 yr. Short-wavelength,\nspatially resolved observations are required to further constrain the nature of\nthe C companion. Searches for close-in companions similar to this system will\nimprove our understanding of the physics of mass and angular momentum transfer,\nas well as orbital evolution during late evolutionary stages.",

In this paper, we demonstrate that standard quantum mechanics,\nformulated in a complex Hilbert space, admits an equivalent reformulation in a\nreal Kahler space. By establishing a natural isomorphism between the operator\ntheories of the complex Hilbert space and the real Kahler space, we prove the\nequivalence of the two formulations including composite system.\n  This Kahler-space framework preserves all essential features of quantum\nmechanics while offering a key advantage: it inherently incorporates a\nHamiltonian symplectic structure analogous to classical mechanics.

We\nstudy the problem of scheduling the availability time of the edges of a\ntemporal graph in such a way that all pairs of vertices are connected within a\ngiven maximum allowed time $a$ and the overall number of labels is minimized.\n  The problem, known as \\emph{Minimum Aged Labeling} (MAL), has several\napplications in logistics, distribution scheduling, and information spreading\nin social networks, where carefully choosing the time-labels can significantly\nreduce infrastructure costs, fuel consumption, or greenhouse gases.\n  The problem MAL has previously been proved to be NP-complete on undirected\ngraphs and \\APX-hard on directed graphs.

Web APIs that employ the REST style are\nknown as RESTful (or REST) APIs. When using or testing a RESTful API,\ndevelopers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by\nopen-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). However, it can\nbe very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these\nspecifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially\nwhen the software requirements change. Many tools and methods have been\nproposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core. OAS\ngeneration can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a\nformal description of API endpoints derived from the source code. A potential\nsolution for this may involve using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have\nstrong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation. Motivated\nby this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs\nusing LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen). To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to\ngenerate OASs for RESTful APIs. Compared with existing tools and methods,\nLRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with\npartial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.). To evaluate the\nLRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20\nreal-world RESTful APIs. The results show that two LLMs (GPT-4o mini and\nDeepSeek V3) can both support LARSGen to generate accurate specifications, and\nLRASGen-generated specifications cover an average of 48.85% more missed\nentities than the developer-provided specifications.",

This is a long-standing\nopen problem, of which only a few sub-cases and variations are known to be\ndecidable. In a significant but technically difficult step, Colcombet and\nL\\\"oding reduced the problem to the uniform universality of distance-parity\nautomata. In this article, we revisit the index problem using tools from the\nparity game literature.\n  We add some counters to Lehtinen's register game, originally used to solve\nparity games in quasipolynomial time, and use this novel game to characterise\n$J$-feasibility. This provides a alternative proof to Colcombet and L\\\"oding's\nreduction.\n  We then provide a second characterisation, based on the notion of attractor\ndecompositions and the complexity of their structure, as measured by a\nparameterised version of their Strahler number, which we call $n$-Strahler\nnumber. Finally, we rephrase this result using the notion of universal tree\nextended to automata: a guidable automaton recognises a $[1,2j]$-feasible\nlanguage if and only if it admits a universal tree with $n$-Strahler number\n$j$, for some $n$. In particular, a language recognised by a guidable automaton\n$A$ is B\\\"uchi-feasible if and only if there is a uniform bound $n\\in\n\\mathbb{N}$ such that all trees in the language admit an accepting run with an\nattractor decomposition of width bounded by $n$, or, equivalently, if and only\n$A$ admits a \\textit{finite} universal tree.\n  While we do not solve the decidability of the index problem, our work makes\nthe state-of-the-art more accessible and brings to light the deep relationships\nbetween the $J$-feasibility of a language and attractor decompositions,\nuniversal trees and Lehtinen's register game.",

    "abstract": "Beyond classical physics, pendulum-like dynamics arise in diverse systems,\nsuch as superconducting Josephson junctions, Bose-Einstein condensates\ntunneling, and emerging artificial intelligence models for nonlinear pattern\nrecognition. While the nonlinear pendulum admits long-standing exact solutions\nin terms of Jacobi elliptic functions, they do not reveal the frequency content\nof the motion. Consequently, studies of pendulum-like dynamics must rely on\nperturbative, approximate, or numerical methods when characterizing their\noscillatory behavior. Here, we present complete, exact, and closed-form\nfrequency-domain solutions for the energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum across\nall initial conditions and regimes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. These\nsolutions are derived through angular-velocity frequency analysis and expressed\nin terms of elementary functions. Their accuracy is validated by agreement with\nnumerical values to machine precision and by frequency analysis of dynamical\nsimulations performed using Velocity Verlet integration. A comparison with the\nperturbation method is presented. Applications to quantum analogues are also\ndiscussed.",

Each node has a limited scope as it can only access local\nmeasurements and share data with its neighbors. The problem of designing the\nobserver gains is divided into two separate sub-problems: (i) design local\noutput injection gains to mitigate the impact of measurement noise, and (ii)\ndesign diffusive gains to compensate for the lack of information through a\nconsensus protocol. A direct and computationally efficient synthesis strategy\nis formulated by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and solved via semidefinite\nprogramming. Finally, two simulative scenarios are presented to illustrate the\neffectiveness of the distributed observer when two different node-wise\ndecompositions are adopted.",

    "abstract": "Multiobject tracking provides situational awareness that enables new\napplications for modern convenience, applied ocean sciences, public safety, and\nhomeland security. In many multiobject tracking applications, including radar\nand sonar tracking, after coherent prefiltering of the received signal,\nmeasurement data is typically structured in cells, where each cell represent,\ne.g., a different range and bearing value. While conventional detect-then-track\n(DTT) multiobject tracking approaches convert the cell-structured data within a\ndetection phase into so-called point measurements in order to reduce the amount\nof data, track-before-detect (TBD) methods process the cell-structured data\ndirectly, avoiding a potential information loss. However, many TBD tracking\nmethods are computationally intensive and achieve a reduced tracking accuracy\nwhen objects interact, i.e., when they come into close proximity. We here\ncounteract these difficulties by introducing the concept of probabilistic\nobject-to-cell contributions. As many conventional DTT methods, our approach\nuses a probabilistic association of objects with data cells, and a new object\ncontribution model with corresponding object contribution probabilities to\nfurther associate cell contributions to objects that occupy the same data cell.\nFurthermore, to keep the computational complexity and filter runtimes low, we\nhere use an efficient Poisson multi-Bernoulli filtering approach in combination\nwith the application of belief propagation for fast probabilistic data\nassociation. We demonstrate numerically that our method achieves significantly\nincreased tracking performance compared to state-of-the-art TBD tracking\napproaches, where performance differences are particularly pronounced when\nmultiple objects interact.",

In this work, the\nCavity Enhanced Long Light Path Attenuation Length Screening (CELLPALS) method\nfor the determination of the attenuation length is presented for the first\ntime. The method is based on an experimental setup similar to a Fabry-P\\'erot\ninterferometer but adding up multiple-reflected intensities of a modulated\nlight source. CELLPALS was developed to measure the attenuation length of\nhighly transparent liquids (> 10 m) with significantly lower uncertainties than\nwith UV-Vis spectroscopy, which is a standard method for determining the\nattenuation length. In addition to the attenuation length, the group velocity\nof light in the sample can also be derived from the free spectral range of the\ncavity, which is not provided by any conventional method for determining the\nattenuation length. In this work, the CELLPALS method, its achievable precision\nand an experimental setup to demonstrate its feasibility are discussed. The\nattenuation lengths and group velocities of several transparent liquids were\nmeasured at wavelengths between 420 nm and 435 nm. In addition, the attenuation\nlength and group velocity of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) samples after different\npurification stages and a purified LAB-based liquid scintillator were measured\nat a wavelength of 425 nm. The results confirmed the potential of CELLPALS to\ndetermine the attenuation length with an uncertainty of ~ 2 %. The group\nvelocity of light in the sample can be determined with an uncertainty of ~ 0.03\n%.",

In this work, we introduce a\ncomputational framework that probes the bimolecular potential energy landscape\nof candidate molecules, enabling us to dissect the role of directional\nintermolecular interactions in establishing polar order. In closely related\nfamilies of materials we find conflicting preferences for (anti)parallel\nordering which can be accounted for by specific interactions between molecules.\nThus, our results allow us to argue that the presence (or absence) of polar\norder is a product of specific molecular features and strong directional\nintermolecular interactions rather than being simply a product of dipole-dipole\nforces.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\nDecoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA) framework that improves compositional\nunderstanding while substantially mitigating losses in general capabilities. To\noptimize the retention of the model's inherent capabilities, we incorporate a\nself-distillation mechanism within the global alignment process, aligning the\nlearnable image-text encoder with a frozen teacher model derived from an\nexponential moving average. Under the constraint of self-distillation, it\neffectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge\nduring fine-tuning. To improve compositional understanding, we first leverage\nthe in-context learning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct\nabout 2M high-quality negative captions across five types. Subsequently, we\npropose the Image-Grounded Contrast (IGC) loss and Text-Grounded Contrast (TGC)\nloss to enhance vision-language compositionally. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the DeGLA framework. Compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art methods, DeGLA achieves an average enhancement of 3.5% across\nthe VALSE, SugarCrepe, and ARO benchmarks. Concurrently, it obtains an average\nperformance improvement of 13.0% on zero-shot classification tasks across\neleven datasets. Our code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/xiaoxing2001/DeGLA",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a passive source localization system, where a single base\nstation (BS) is employed to estimate the positions and attitudes of multiple\nmobile stations (MSs). The BS and the MSs are equipped with uniform rectangular\narrays, and the MSs are located in the near-field region of the BS array. To\navoid the difficulty of tackling the problem directly based on the near-field\nsignal model, we establish a subarray-wise far-field received signal model. In\nthis model, the entire BS array is divided into multiple subarrays to ensure\nthat each MS is in the far-field region of each BS subarray. By exploiting the\nangles of arrival (AoAs) of an MS antenna at different BS subarrays, we\nformulate the attitude and location estimation problem under the Bayesian\ninference framework. Based on the factor graph representation of the\nprobabilistic problem model, a message passing algorithm named array\npartitioning based pose and location estimation (APPLE) is developed to solve\nthis problem. An estimation-error lower bound is obtained as a performance\nbenchmark of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nproposed APPLE algorithm outperforms other baseline methods in the accuracy of\nposition and attitude estimation.",

We find that the\nthickness of the gas layer increases with the droplet temperature, explaining\nthat the thermal delay of coalescence is due to the thicker gas layer. During\nthe hot droplet impact, the temperature gradient at the bottom of the droplet\ninduces Maranogni flow, which can delay the drainage of the intervening gas\nlayer.

To ensure that only tensile stresses and not compressive stresses\ndrive crack growth, several models have been proposed that aim to distinguish\nbetween compressive and tensile loads. However, these models have a critical\nshortcoming: they do not account for the crack direction, and hence they cannot\ndistinguish between crack-normal tensile stresses that drive crack growth and\ncrack-parallel stresses that do not.\n  In this study, we apply a phase-field fracture model, developed in our\nearlier work, that uses the crack direction to distinguish crack-parallel\nstresses from crack-normal stresses. This provides a transparent energetic\nformulation that drives cracks to grow in when crack faces open or slide past\neach other, while the cracks respond like the intact solid when the crack faces\ncontact under normal compressive loads. We compare our approach against two\nwidely used approaches, Spectral splitting and the Volumetric-Deviatoric\nsplitting, and find that these predict unphysical crack growth and unphysical\nstress concentrations under loading conditions in which these should not occur.\nSpecifically, we show that the splitting models predict spurious crack growth\nand stress concentration under pure crack-parallel normal stresses.

We present a\npreemption aware scheduling approach for priority and deadline constrained task\noffloading in homogeneous edge networks. Our scheduling approach consists of\ntwo distinct scheduling algorithms, designed to accommodate the differing\nrequirements of high and low priority tasks. To satisfy a task's deadline, our\nscheduling approach considers the availability of both communication and\ncomputational resources in the network when making placements in both the\ncurrent time-slot and future time-slots. The scheduler implements a\ndeadline-aware preemption mechanism to guarantee resource access to high\npriority tasks. When low-priority tasks are selected for preemption, the\nscheduler will attempt to reallocate them if possible before their deadline. We\nimplement this scheduling approach into a task offloading system which we\nevaluate empirically in the real-world on a network of edge devices composed of\nfour Raspberry Pi 2 Model B's. We evaluate this system under against a version\nwithout a task preemption mechanism as well as workstealing approaches to\ncompare the impact on high priority task completion and the ability to complete\noverall frames.

We solve this\nproblem by adopting a design science approach and introducing a new monitoring\nframework, the Machine Learning Monitoring Agent (MLMA), that is designed to\nwork at scale for any ML model with reasonable labor cost. A key feature of our\nframework concerns test-based automated re-training based on a data-adaptive\nreference loss batch. The MLOps engineer is kept in the loop via key metrics\nand also acts, pro-actively or retrospectively, to maintain performance of the\nML model in the production stage. We conduct a large-scale test at a last-mile\ndelivery platform to empirically validate our monitoring framework.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and analyzing video actions are essential for producing\ninsightful and contextualized descriptions, especially for video-based\napplications like intelligent monitoring and autonomous systems. The proposed\nwork introduces a novel framework for generating natural language descriptions\nfrom video datasets by combining textual and visual modalities. The suggested\narchitecture makes use of ResNet50 to extract visual features from video frames\nthat are taken from the Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus (MSVD), and\nBerkeley DeepDrive eXplanation (BDD-X) datasets. The extracted visual\ncharacteristics are converted into patch embeddings and then run through an\nencoder-decoder model based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2). In\norder to align textual and visual representations and guarantee high-quality\ndescription production, the system uses multi-head self-attention and\ncross-attention techniques. The model's efficacy is demonstrated by performance\nevaluation using BLEU (1-4), CIDEr, METEOR, and ROUGE-L. The suggested\nframework outperforms traditional methods with BLEU-4 scores of 0.755 (BDD-X)\nand 0.778 (MSVD), CIDEr scores of 1.235 (BDD-X) and 1.315 (MSVD), METEOR scores\nof 0.312 (BDD-X) and 0.329 (MSVD), and ROUGE-L scores of 0.782 (BDD-X) and\n0.795 (MSVD).

To\naddress these limitations, we propose PAR-RAG (Plan-then-Act-and-Review RAG), a\nnovel framework inspired by the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, to enhance both\nthe accuracy and factual consistency in multi-hop question answering.\nSpecifically, PAR-RAG selects exemplars matched by the semantic complexity of\nthe current question to guide complexity-aware top-down planning, resulting in\nmore precise and coherent multi-step reasoning trajectories. This design\nmitigates reasoning drift and reduces the risk of suboptimal path convergence,\na common issue in existing RAG approaches. Furthermore, a dual-verification\nmechanism evaluates and corrects intermediate errors, ensuring that the\nreasoning process remains factually grounded. Experimental results on various\nQA benchmarks demonstrate that PAR-RAG outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, validating its effectiveness in both performance and reasoning\nrobustness.",

To address these challenges, we propose\nMOOSComp, a token-classification-based long-context compression method that\nenhances the performance of a BERT-based compressor by mitigating the\nover-smoothing problem and incorporating outlier scores. In the training phase,\nwe add an inter-class cosine similarity loss term to penalize excessively\nsimilar token representations, thereby improving the token classification\naccuracy. During the compression phase, we introduce outlier scores to preserve\nrare but critical tokens that are prone to be discarded in task-agnostic\ncompression. These scores are integrated with the classifier's output, making\nthe compressor more generalizable to various tasks. Superior performance is\nachieved at various compression ratios on long-context understanding and\nreasoning benchmarks.

A strong Rashba spin-splitting is observed in the valence\nband, resulting in an increase in the Seebeck coefficient for p-type. The\nlattice thermal conductivity of MoTe$_{2}$/PtS$_{2}$ is remarkably low about of\n0.6 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at $T = 300$ K due to large anharmonic scattering.\nFurthermore, biaxial strain enhances the power factor (PF) by introducing band\nconvergence. At a strain of 2\\%, the optimal PF for the n-type material reaches\n170 $\\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$, indicating approximately 84.78\\% increase compared to the\nunstrained state (92 $\\mu$W/cmK$^{2}$).

An industrial case study reported\nthat developers spend 1.28% of their time repairing flaky tests at a monthly\ncost of $2,250. We discovered that flaky tests often exist in clusters, with\nco-occurring failures that share the same root causes, which we call systemic\nflakiness. This suggests that developers can reduce repair costs by addressing\nshared root causes, enabling them to fix multiple flaky tests at once rather\nthan tackling them individually. This study represents an inflection point by\nchallenging the deep-seated assumption that flaky test failures are isolated\noccurrences. We used an established dataset of 10,000 test suite runs from 24\nJava projects on GitHub, spanning domains from data orchestration to job\nscheduling. It contains 810 flaky tests, which we levered to perform a\nmixed-method empirical analysis of co-occurring flaky test failures. Systemic\nflakiness is significant and widespread. We performed agglomerative clustering\nof flaky tests based on their failure co-occurrence, finding that 75% of flaky\ntests across all projects belong to a cluster, with a mean cluster size of 13.5\nflaky tests. Instead of requiring 10,000 test suite runs to identify systemic\nflakiness, we demonstrated a lightweight alternative by training machine\nlearning models based on static test case distance measures. Through manual\ninspection of stack traces, conducted independently by four authors and\nresolved through negotiated agreement, we identified intermittent networking\nissues and instabilities in external dependencies as the predominant causes of\nsystemic flakiness.",

IsaBIL inherits the full flexibility\nof BAP, allowing us to verify binaries for a wide range of languages (C, C++,\nRust), toolchains (LLVM, Ghidra) and target architectures (x86, RISC-V), and\ncan also be used when the source code for a binary is unavailable.\n  To make verification tractable, we develop a number of big-step rules that\ncombine BIL's existing small-step rules at different levels of abstraction to\nsupport reuse. We develop high-level reasoning rules for RISC-V instructions\n(our main target architecture) to further optimise verification. Additionally,\nwe develop Isabelle proof tactics that exploit common patterns in C binaries\nfor RISC-V to discharge large numbers of proof goals (often in the 100s)\nautomatically.

In zero external field, compounds 2Tb, 3Dy and 4Ho show\nclear maxima in the out-of-phase component of the ac susceptibility whereas\nsmall magnetic fields are needed to suppress quantum tunneling in 6Tm. Combined\nhigh-field electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetisation\nmeasurements unambiguously reveal an easy-plane anisotropy of the V$^{\\rm III}$\nion and antiferromagnetic Ising-like 3d-4f exchange couplings. The strength of\n$J_{\\rm 3d-4f}$ is shown to decrease upon variation of the 4f ion from Tb to\nHo, while increasing antiferromagnetic interaction can be observed from Ho to\nTm. The exact inverse chemical trend is found for the relative angle between\nthe 3d and 4f main anisotropy axes, which highlights the important role of the\nlanthanide 4f electron distribution anisotropy for 3d-4f exchange.",

    "abstract": "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising\nvariational algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems on\nnear-term devices. However, as the number of layers in a QAOA circuit\nincreases, which is correlated with the quality of the solution, the number of\nparameters to optimize grows linearly. This results in more iterations required\nby the classical optimizer, which results in an increasing computational burden\nas more circuit executions are needed. To mitigate this issue, we introduce\nQAOA-PCA, a novel reparameterization technique that employs Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the QAOA parameter space. By\nextracting principal components from optimized parameters of smaller problem\ninstances, QAOA-PCA facilitates efficient optimization with fewer parameters on\nlarger instances. Our empirical evaluation on the prominent MaxCut problem\ndemonstrates that QAOA-PCA consistently requires fewer iterations than standard\nQAOA, achieving substantial efficiency gains. While this comes at the cost of a\nslight reduction in approximation ratio compared to QAOA with the same number\nof layers, QAOA-PCA almost always outperforms standard QAOA when matched by\nparameter count. QAOA-PCA strikes a favorable balance between efficiency and\nperformance, reducing optimization overhead without significantly compromising\nsolution quality.",

HEMA combines Compact Memory - a continuously updated one-sentence\nsummary preserving global narrative coherence, and Vector Memory - an episodic\nstore of chunk embeddings queried via cosine similarity. When integrated with a\n6B-parameter transformer, HEMA maintains coherent dialogues beyond 300 turns\nwhile keeping prompt length under 3,500 tokens. Experimental results show\nsubstantial improvements: factual recall accuracy increases from 41% to 87%,\nand human-rated coherence improves from 2.7 to 4.3 on a 5-point scale. With 10K\nindexed chunks, Vector Memory achieves P@5 >= 0.80 and R@50 >= 0.74, doubling\nthe area under the precision-recall curve compared to summarization-only\napproaches. Ablation studies reveal two key insights: semantic forgetting\nthrough age-weighted pruning reduces retrieval latency by 34% with minimal\nrecall loss, and a two-level summary hierarchy prevents cascade errors in\nultra-long conversations exceeding 1,000 turns.

Moreover, almost all kinds of\ninterferometers heavily rely on a pair of high-quality quantum point contacts\nwhere the presence of impurities significantly modifies the behavior of such\nconstrictions, which in turn can alter the outcome of the measurements.\nAntidots, potential hills in the quantum Hall regime, are particularly valuable\nin this context, as they overcome the geometric limitations of conventional\ngeometries and act as controlled impurities within a quantum point contact.\nFurthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle charge detection through simple\nconductance measurements, replacing the need for complex techniques such as\nshot noise. Here, we use a gate-defined bilayer graphene antidot, operated in\nthe Coulomb-dominated regime. By varying the antidot potential, we can tune\ninter-edge interactions, enabling a crossover from a single-dot to a double-dot\nbehavior. In the latter, strong coupling between the two edge states leads to\nedge-state pairing, resulting in a measured doubling of the tunneling charge.\nWe find that in certain regimes, the inter-edge coupling completely dominates\nover other energy scales of the system, overshadowing the interference effects\nthese devices are mainly designed to probe.

Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset\nreveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a\ngreater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects.

These\ndifficulties are present both in the midst of searching as well as when\nresuming a search that spans multiple sessions. In this paper, we present a\nsearch interface design and prototype implementation to support cross-session\nexploratory search in a public digital library context.\n  Methods: Search Timelines provides a visualization of current and past search\nactivities via a dynamic timeline of the search activity (queries and saved\nresources). This timeline is presented at two levels of detail. An Overview\nTimeline is provided alongside the search results in a typical search engine\nresults page design. A Detailed Timeline is provided in the workspace, where\nsearchers can review the history of their search activities and their saved\nresources. A controlled laboratory study (n=32) was conducted to compare this\napproach to a baseline interface modelled after a typical public digital\nlibrary search/workspace interface.\n  Results: Participants who used Search Timelines reported higher levels of\nuser engagement, usability, and perceived knowledge gain, during an initial\nsearch session and when resuming the search after a 7-8 day interval. This came\nat the expense of the searchers taking more time to complete the search task,\nwhich we view as positive evidence of engagement in cross-session exploratory\nsearch processes.\n  Conclusion: Search Timelines serves as an example of how lightweight\nvisualization approaches can be used to enhance typical search interface\ndesigns to support exploratory search. The results highlight the value of\nproviding persistent representations of past search activities within the\nsearch interface.}",

However, SAM's performance decreases substantially when applied\nto non-natural domains like microscopic imaging. Furthermore, due to SAM's\ninteractive design, it requires a precise prompt for each image and object,\nwhich is unfeasible in many automated biomedical applications. Previous\nsolutions adapt SAM by training millions of parameters via fine-tuning large\nparts of the model or of adapter layers. In contrast, we show that as little as\n2,048 additional parameters are sufficient for turning SAM into a use-case\nspecialist for a certain downstream task. Our novel PTSAM (prompt-tuned SAM)\nmethod uses prompt-tuning, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, to\nadapt SAM for a specific task. We validate the performance of our approach on\nmultiple microscopic and one medical dataset. Our results show that\nprompt-tuning only SAM's mask decoder already leads to a performance on-par\nwith state-of-the-art techniques while requiring roughly 2,000x less trainable\nparameters. For addressing domain gaps, we find that additionally prompt-tuning\nSAM's image encoder is beneficial, further improving segmentation accuracy by\nup to 18% over state-of-the-art results.

Operating in such settings presents many\nchallenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth\nfuture paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at\nany moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions.\n  Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve\nthe necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee\ncollision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint\nmethods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation\ntimes.\n  To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS\nGlobal Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in\nspatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D\nenvironment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of\nexploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when\npotential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the\nFast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination\napproach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by\npre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still\nensuring collision-free trajectories.\n  We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests,\nconfined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments\nshow that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are\napproximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods.

We compare the apparent brightness of known quasars\nthat have been observed with two IR surveys, covering up to a twenty-year\nbaseline: the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS; 1997-2001) and the VISTA\nHemisphere Survey (VHS; 2009-2017).

We\nbuild a sample of ~2500 quasars that show statistically significant variability\nbetween the 2MASS and VHS. About 1500 of these come from the new Quaia sample\nbased on Gaia spectra and about 1/3 of these have hardly been studied. The\nQuaia sample constitutes the main product of this work. Based on ensemble\nvariability and structure function analysis we demonstrate that the selected\nobjects in our sample are representative of the typical quasar population and\nshow behaviour, consistent with other quasar samples. Our analysis strengthens\nprevious results, for example that variability decreases with the rest-frame\nwavelength and that it exhibits peaks for certain absolute magnitudes of the\nquasars. Similarly, the structure function shows an increase in variability for\nrest-frame time lags below ~1500 d and a decrease for longer lags, just like in\nprevious studies.

However, multi-angle resource constraints, multi-user task\ncompetition, and the complexity of task offloading decisions in dynamic MEC\nenvironments present new technical challenges. Therefore, a user-centric deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) model splitting inference scheme is proposed to\naddress the problem. This scheme combines model splitting inference technology\nand designs a UCMS_MADDPG-based offloading algorithm to realize efficient model\nsplitting inference responses in the dynamic MEC environment with multi-angle\nresource constraints. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem\nthat integrates resource allocation, server selection, and task offloading,\naiming to minimize the weighted sum of task execution delay and energy\nconsumption. We also introduce a user-server co-selection algorithm to address\nthe selection issue between users and servers. Furthermore, we design an\nalgorithm centered on user pre-decision to coordinate the outputs of continuous\nand discrete hybrid decisions, and introduce a priority sampling mechanism\nbased on reward-error trade-off to optimize the experience replay mechanism of\nthe network. Simulation results show that the proposed UCMS_MADDPG-based\noffloading algorithm demonstrates superior overall performance compared with\nother benchmark algorithms in dynamic environments.",

Urban planning, a\nprofessional discipline that fundamentally shapes our daily surroundings, is\none such field heavily relying on multifaceted domain knowledge and experience\nof human experts. The extent to which LLMs can assist human practitioners in\nurban planning remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a\ncomprehensive benchmark, UrbanPlanBench, tailored to evaluate the efficacy of\nLLMs in urban planning, which encompasses fundamental principles, professional\nknowledge, and management and regulations, aligning closely with the\nqualifications expected of human planners. Through extensive evaluation, we\nreveal a significant imbalance in the acquisition of planning knowledge among\nLLMs, with even the most proficient models falling short of meeting\nprofessional standards. For instance, we observe that 70% of LLMs achieve\nsubpar performance in understanding planning regulations compared to other\naspects. Besides the benchmark, we present the largest-ever supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) dataset, UrbanPlanText, comprising over 30,000 instruction\npairs sourced from urban planning exams and textbooks.

To generate more controllable and precise human\nmotions, we propose \\textbf{ProMoGen (Progressive Motion Generation)}, a novel\nframework that integrates trajectory guidance with sparse anchor motion\ncontrol. Global trajectories ensure consistency in spatial direction and\ndisplacement, while sparse anchor motions only deliver precise action guidance\nwithout displacement.

Recently, the Density-Matrix Renormalization\nGroup (DMRG) algorithm was developed for simulating quantum circuits using\nmatrix product states (MPS). Although MPS is efficient for representing quantum\nstates with one-dimensional correlation structures, the fixed linear geometry\nrestricts the expressive power of the MPS.

To benchmark the method, we simulate\nrandom circuits and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with\nvarious two-qubit gate connectivities. For the random circuits, we devise\ntree-like gate layouts that are suitable for TTN and show that TTN requires\nless memory than MPS for the simulations.

Creating a large training dataset encompassing\nall relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the\ncomputational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor.\nCommonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain.\nHere, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast\nprobabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts\nback to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not\nrequired to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a\nsignificant reduction in the data collection time. We achieve this by creating\nphases in the computational domain corresponding to the different models. These\nphases evolve using a phase-field model driven by the surrogate uncertainty.\nWhen the surrogate uncertainty becomes large, the phase-field model causes a\nlocal transition from the surrogate to the high-fidelity model, maintaining a\nhighly accurate simulation. We discuss the requirements of this approach to\nachieve accurate and numerically stable results and compare the phase-field\nmodel to a purely local approach that does not enforce spatial smoothness for\nthe phase mixing.

This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML\nmodel behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be\noperationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require\n\"indirect\" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate\noperationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit\nmultiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with\nvarying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates\nunpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with\npredictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or\nheuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations.\nCurrent methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they\neither focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model\ndevelopment without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we\nintroduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and\nML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates\ndesigning ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing\nmodels that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for\noperationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical\nfeasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric\nvalues.

We evaluate our framework\non multiple MDS datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in ROUGE\nmetrics while confirming its scalability and flexibility across diverse model\narchitectures. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness through an in-depth\nanalysis, emphasizing its ability to dynamically select appropriate queries and\naccurately rank documents based on their relevance scores.

We focus on those contributions that emerge from a heavy scalar\nsector that is linearly realized. In particular, we explore the decoupling\nlimit of the aligned 2HDM. In this model, Barr-Zee diagrams with a fermion loop\nproduce logarithmically-enhanced contributions that are proportional to\npotentially large new sources of CP violation. In the decoupling limit these\ncontributions are generated by effective dimension-6 operators via the mixing\nof four-fermion operators into electroweak dipole operators. These logarithmic\ncontributions are not present in more constrained versions of the 2HDM where a\n$\\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry is imposed, which then controls the basis of effective\noperators needed to describe the new physics contributions to the electron EDM.\nThus, the $\\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry provides a suppression mechanism. We then\nstudy how the experimental bounds on the electron EDM constrain the set of\nparameters of the aligned 2HDM.",

Recently, Vision Transformers (ViT) have\nbeen employed in FGIR due to their powerful self-attention mechanism for\nmodeling long-range dependencies. However, most Transformer-based methods focus\nprimarily on leveraging self-attention to distinguish fine-grained details,\nwhile overlooking the high computational complexity and redundant dependencies\ninherent to these models, limiting their scalability and effectiveness in\nlarge-scale FGIR. In this paper, we propose an Efficient and Effective\nViT-based framework, termed \\textbf{EET}, which integrates token pruning module\nwith a discriminative transfer strategy to address these limitations.\nSpecifically, we introduce a content-based token pruning scheme to enhance the\nefficiency of the vanilla ViT, progressively removing background or\nlow-discriminative tokens at different stages by exploiting feature responses\nand self-attention mechanism. To ensure the resulting efficient ViT retains\nstrong discriminative power, we further present a discriminative transfer\nstrategy comprising both \\textit{discriminative knowledge transfer} and\n\\textit{discriminative region guidance}. Using a distillation paradigm, these\ncomponents transfer knowledge from a larger ``teacher'' ViT to a more efficient\n``student'' model, guiding the latter to focus on subtle yet crucial regions in\na cost-free manner. Extensive experiments on two widely-used fine-grained\ndatasets and four large-scale fine-grained datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "Josephson junctions (JJs) are the key element of many devices operating at\ncryogenic temperatures. Development of time-efficient wafer-scale JJ\ncharacterization for process optimization and control of JJ fabrication is\nessential. Such statistical characterization has to rely on room temperature\ntechniques since cryogenic measurements typically used for JJs are too time\nconsuming and unsuitable for wafer-scale characterization. In this work, we\nshow that from room temperature capacitance and current-voltage measurements,\nwith proper data analysis, we can independently obtain useful parameters of the\nJJs on wafer-scale, like oxide thickness, tunnel coefficient, and interfacial\ndefect densities. Moreover, based on detailed analysis of current vs voltage\ncharacteristics, different charge transport mechanisms across the junctions can\nbe distinguished. We exemplary demonstrate the worth of these methods by\nstudying junctions fabricated on 200 mm wafers with an industrially scale-able\nconcept based on subtractive processing using only CMOS compatible tools. From\nthese studies, we find that our subtractive fabrication approach yields\njunctions with quite homogeneous average oxide thickness across the full\nwafers, with a spread of less then 3$\\,$%. The analysis also revealed a\nvariation of the tunnel coefficient with oxide thickness, pointing to a\nstoichiometry gradient across the junctions' oxide width. Moreover, we\nestimated relatively low interfacial defect densities in the range of 70 -\n5000$\\,$defects/cm$^2$ for our junctions and established that the density\nincreased with decreasing oxide thickness, indicating that the wet etching\nprocess applied in the JJs fabrication for oxide thickness control leads to\nformation of interfacial trap state",

We separate\n122 galaxy clusters from the HeCS-SZ, HeCS-redMapper, and HeCS samples into\nfour samples with increasing mass; we estimate four robust, highly constraining\ncaustic profiles for these samples. The caustic masses of the four stacked\nclusters agree within $ 10\\%$ with the corresponding median values of each\ncluster sample. By adopting the NFW density profile to model the gravitational\npotential, we recover the caustic profile $\\mathcal{A}(r)$ up to radius $r_{\\rm\np} \\sim 4.0\\, {\\rm Mpc}$. This comparison is a first-order validation of the\nmass-concentration relation for galaxy clusters expected in the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel. We thus impose this correlation as a prior in our analysis. Based on our\nstacked clusters, we estimate the value of the filling factor, which enters the\ncaustic technique, $\\mathcal{F}_{\\beta} = 0.59\\pm 0.05$; we derive this value\nusing real data alone and find it consistent with the value usually adopted in\nthe literature.

We find that the\ncaustic profiles provide a stringent upper limit of $|f_{\\rm R0}| \\lesssim 4\n\\times 10^{-6}$ at $95\\%$ C.L. limits in the $f(\\mathcal{R})$ scenario.

    "abstract": "Context. The emerging population of inert black hole binaries (BHBs) provides\na unique opportunity to constrain black hole (BH) formation physics. These\nsystems are composed of a stellar-mass BH in a wide orbit around a\nnon-degenerate star with no observed Xray emission. Inert BHBs allow for narrow\nconstraints to be inferred on the natal kick and mass loss during BH-forming\ncore-collapse events. Aims. In anticipation of the upcoming BLOeM survey, we\naim to provide tight constraints on BH natal kicks by exploiting the full\nparameter space obtained from combined spectroscopic and astrometric data to\ncharacterize the orbits of inert BHBs. Multi-epoch spectroscopy from the BLOeM\nproject will provide measurements of periods, eccentricities, and radial\nvelocities for inert BHBs in the SMC, which complements Gaia astrometric\nobservations of proper motions. Methods. We present a Bayesian parameter\nestimation framework to infer natal kicks and mass loss during core-collapse\nfrom inert BHBs, accounting for all available observables, including the\nsystemic velocity and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. The\nframework further allows for circumstances when some of the observables are\nunavailable, such as for the distant BLOeM sources which preclude resolved\norbits. Results. With our new framework, we are able to distinguish between BH\nformation channels, even in the absence of a resolved orbit. In cases when the\npre-explosion orbit can be assumed to be circular, we precisely recover the\nparameters of the core-collapse, highlighting the importance of understanding\nthe eccentricity landscape of pre-explosion binaries, both theoretically and\nobservationally. Treating the near-circular, inert BHB, VFTS 243, as a\nrepresentative of the anticipated BLOeM systems, we constrain the natal kick to\nless than 27 km/s and the mass loss to less than 2.9 Msun within a 90% credible\ninterval.",

Shapley\nvalue (SV) has been advocated as the standard metric for data valuation in FL\ndue to its desirable properties. However, the computational overhead of SV is\nprohibitive in practice, as it inherently requires training and evaluating an\nFL model across an exponential number of dataset combinations. Furthermore,\nexisting solutions fail to achieve high accuracy and efficiency, making\npractical use of SV still out of reach, because they ignore choosing suitable\ncomputation scheme for approximation framework and overlook the property of\nutility function in FL.

Self-supervised representation learning methods\nsuch as SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) or BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) have been very\nsuccessful at learning meaningful latent representations from unlabeled image\ndata, resulting in much more general and transferable representations for\ndownstream tasks. Broadly, self-supervised methods fall into two types: 1)\nContrastive methods, such as SimCLR; and 2) Non-Contrastive methods, such as\nBYOL. Contrastive methods are generally trying to maximize mutual information\nbetween related data points, so they need to compare every data point to every\nother data point, resulting in high variance, and thus requiring large batch\nsizes to work well. Non-contrastive methods like BYOL have much lower variance\nas they do not need to make pairwise comparisons, but are much trickier to\nimplement as they have the possibility of collapsing to a constant vector. In\nthis paper, we aim to develop a self-supervised objective that combines the\nstrength of both types. We start with a particular contrastive method called\nthe Spectral Contrastive Loss (HaoChen et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2024), and we\nconvert it into a more general non-contrastive form; this removes the pairwise\ncomparisons resulting in lower variance, but keeps the mutual information\nformulation of the contrastive method preventing collapse. We call our new\nobjective the Mutual Information Non-Contrastive (MINC) loss. We test MINC by\nlearning image representations on ImageNet (similar to SimCLR and BYOL) and\nshow that it consistently improves upon the Spectral Contrastive loss baseline.",

In order to separate these similar information and\ntheir respective advantages, reduce the feature redundancy in the fusion stage.\nThis paper introduces a diff-attention aware state space fusion model\n(DAS2F-Model) for multimodal remote sensing image classification. Based on the\nselective state space model, a cross-modal diff-attention module (CMDA-Module)\nis designed to extract and separate the common features and their respective\ndominant features of MS and PAN images. Among this, space preserving visual\nmamba (SPVM) retains image spatial features and captures local features by\noptimizing visual mamba's input reasonably. Considering that features in the\nfusion stage will have large semantic differences after feature separation and\nsimple fusion operations struggle to effectively integrate these significantly\ndifferent features, an attention-aware linear fusion module (AALF-Module) is\nproposed. It performs pixel-wise linear fusion by calculating influence\ncoefficients. This mechanism can fuse features with large semantic differences\nwhile keeping the feature size unchanged.

    "abstract": "We present Skywork R1V2, a next-generation multimodal reasoning model and a\nmajor leap forward from its predecessor, Skywork R1V. At its core, R1V2\nintroduces a hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that jointly leverages the\nMixed Preference Optimization (MPO) and the Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO), which harmonizes reward-model guidance with rule-based strategies,\nthereby addressing the long-standing challenge of balancing sophisticated\nreasoning capabilities with broad generalization. To further enhance training\nefficiency, we propose the Selective Sample Buffer (SSB) mechanism, which\neffectively addresses the vanishing advantages dilemma inherent in GRPO by\nprioritizing high-value samples throughout the optimization process. Notably,\nwe observe that excessive reinforcement signals can induce visual\nhallucinations--a phenomenon we systematically monitor and mitigate through\ncalibrated reward thresholds throughout the training process. Empirical results\naffirm the exceptional capability of R1V2, with benchmark-leading performances\nsuch as 62.6 on OlympiadBench, 78.9 on AIME2024, 63.6 on LiveCodeBench, and\n73.6 on MMMU. These results underscore R1V2's superiority over existing\nopen-source models and demonstrate significant progress in closing the\nperformance gap with premier proprietary systems, including Gemini 2.5 and\nOpenAI-o4-mini.

In this study, we proposed a novel architecture named Transformer\nbased Encoder Decoder Network (TED Net) designed for estimating human skeleton\nposes from WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). TED Net integrates\nconvolutional encoders with transformer based attention mechanisms to capture\nspatiotemporal features from CSI signals. The estimated skeleton poses were\nused as input to a customized Directed Graph Neural Network (DGNN) for action\nrecognition. We validated our model on two datasets: a publicly available multi\nmodal dataset for assessing general pose estimation, and a newly collected\ndataset focused on fall related scenarios involving 20 participants.\nExperimental results demonstrated that TED Net outperformed existing approaches\nin pose estimation, and that the DGNN achieves reliable action classification\nusing CSI based skeletons, with performance comparable to RGB based systems.\nNotably, TED Net maintains robust performance across both fall and non fall\ncases. These findings highlight the potential of CSI driven human skeleton\nestimation for effective action recognition, particularly in home environments\nsuch as elderly fall detection. In such settings, WiFi signals are often\nreadily available, offering a privacy preserving alternative to vision based\nmethods, which may raise concerns about continuous camera monitoring.",

Despite their potential, inconsistencies\nand inadequate evaluation methodologies in prior research have hindered\nmeaningful comparisons and a comprehensive, unbiased understanding of their\ncapabilities. This paper introduces MAYA, a unified, customizable,\nplug-and-play benchmarking framework designed to facilitate the systematic\ncharacterization and benchmarking of generative password-guessing models in the\ncontext of trawling attacks. Using MAYA, we conduct a comprehensive assessment\nof six state-of-the-art approaches, which we re-implemented and adapted to\nensure standardization. Our evaluation spans eight real-world password datasets\nand covers an exhaustive set of advanced testing scenarios, totaling over\n15,000 compute hours. Our findings indicate that these models effectively\ncapture different aspects of human password distribution and exhibit strong\ngeneralization capabilities. However, their effectiveness varies significantly\nwith long and complex passwords. Through our evaluation, sequential models\nconsistently outperform other generative architectures and traditional\npassword-guessing tools, demonstrating unique capabilities in generating\naccurate and complex guesses. Moreover, the diverse password distributions\nlearned by the models enable a multi-model attack that outperforms the best\nindividual model.

Although\nrecent advances in robotic hardware and embodied AI have expanded their\ncapabilities, current systems still struggle with handling thin, flat, and\ndeformable objects such as paper and fabric. This limitation arises from the\nlack of suitable perception techniques for robust state estimation under\ndiverse object appearances, as well as the absence of planning techniques for\ngenerating appropriate grasp motions. To bridge these gaps, this paper\nintroduces PP-Tac, a robotic system for picking up paper-like objects. PP-Tac\nfeatures a multi-fingered robotic hand with high-resolution omnidirectional\ntactile sensors \\sensorname. This hardware configuration enables real-time slip\ndetection and online frictional force control that mitigates such slips.\nFurthermore, grasp motion generation is achieved through a trajectory synthesis\npipeline, which first constructs a dataset of finger's pinching motions. Based\non this dataset, a diffusion-based policy is trained to control the hand-arm\nrobotic system. Experiments demonstrate that PP-Tac can effectively grasp\npaper-like objects of varying material, thickness, and stiffness, achieving an\noverall success rate of 87.5\\%.

Aiming to overcome the drawbacks of traditional\ntuning systems, like the limited tuning range of piezoelectric tuner and the\nlow-speed tuning of stepper-motor-based tuner, this novel tuner is crafted to\nimprove SRF cavity performance and stability via efficient and accurate\nfrequency tuning. The design encompasses several key elements. The cavity\nstructure includes a commonly used 1.3 GHz single-cell superconducting cavity\nand a room-temperature coaxial tuner cavity. The coupling mechanism between the\ntwo cavities, along with the coupling window design, ensures effective energy\ntransfer while minimizing losses. The mechanical tuning system, driven by\nelectromagnetic coils, enables precise adjustments, and the cooling mechanisms\nfor both cavities guarantee stable operation. Functioning by coupling an\nexternal resonant cavity to the superconducting one, this tuner can adjust\nfrequencies through mechanical or electromagnetic methods. It realizes rapid\ntuning, with a speed much faster than traditional mechanical tuner,\nhigh-precision tuning down to the sub-mHz level, and a wide tuning range\ncovering a broader frequency spectrum. Theoretical analysis and simulations\nverify that the tuner can remarkably enhance tuning speed, precision, and\nrange. It also has distinct advantages such as a simplified structure, which\nreduces manufacturing and maintenance complexity, and enhanced reliability due\nto its non-contact tuning operation. In particle accelerators, this cavity\ntuner holds great potential.

To restore the\nall-in-focus NeRF, we introduce the dual-camera from smartphones, where the\nultra-wide camera has a wider depth-of-field (DoF) and the main camera\npossesses a higher resolution. The dual camera pair saves the high-fidelity\ndetails from the main camera and uses the ultra-wide camera's deep DoF as\nreference for all-in-focus restoration.

In this work, we provide a definitive platform for\nexamining pure rarefaction solitons propagating through a strain-softening\nmechanical lattice, addressing these challenges. Employing a theoretical\nframework based on the Boussinesq approximation and multiple-scale analysis, we\npredict soliton behavior, including phase shifts resulting from head-on\ncollisions. These theoretical insights are corroborated through numerical\nsimulations and systematic experiments designed to generate and measure pure\nrarefaction solitons with high precision. Both symmetric and asymmetric\ncollisions are examined, revealing practically elastic interaction behaviors\nand amplitude-dependent phase shifts. Furthermore, collision dynamics, such as\nspeed and phase shifts during rarefaction soliton collisions, from the\nexperimental results show agreement with theoretical and numerical models.\nThese results validate our experimental platform and findings, underscoring the\npotential of mechanical rarefaction solitons as robust, controllable wave\npackets.

Elucidating the underlying\nmechanism behind the CDW transition is crucial for unraveling the complex\ninteractions among these phases. However, the driving force of the CDW remains\na topic of debate due to the intertwined interactions among the system's\nvarious excitations. Here we investigated the CDW transition in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by\nisolating the ultrafast electronic phase transition using time- and\nangleresolved photoemission spectroscopy. An ultrafast electronic phase\ntransition was observed at a critical photoexcitation fluence, F$_c$, without\nreduction in CDW lattice-distortion-induced band folding. This folded band\npersisted up to 150 K under equilibrium heating, well above the CDW\ncondensation temperature of T$_c$ = 78 K. Notably, the pump-induced band shifts\nat F$_c$ were comparable to those caused by thermal effects at T$_c$. These\nfindings suggest that in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, a fluctuating lattice-driven in-plane\nCDW emerges above 150 K, with out-of-plane electronic correlations leading to\nthe $2\\times2 \\times 2$ CDW near T$_c$, offering key insights into the\ninterplay between the electronic and structural dynamics in AV$_3$Sb$_5$.",

Key advantages include enhanced\nspectral and energy efficiency, expanded network coverage, and flexible\ndeployment. One of the main challenges in employing UAV-mounted IRS (UMI)\ntechnology is the random fluctuations of hovering UAVs. Focusing on this\nchallenge, this paper explores the capabilities of UMI with passive/active\nelements affected by UAV fluctuations in both horizontal and vertical angles,\nconsidering the three-dimensional (3D) radiation pattern of the IRS. The\nrelationship between UAV fluctuations and IRS pattern is investigated by taking\ninto account the random angular vibrations of UAVs. A tractable and closed-form\ndistribution function for the IRS pattern is derived, using linear\napproximation and by dividing it into several sectors. In addition, closed-form\nexpressions for outage probability (OP) are obtained using central limit\ntheorem (CLT) and Gamma approximation. The theoretical expressions are\nvalidated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings indicate that the\nrandom fluctuations of hovering UAVs have a notable impact on the performance\nof UMI systems. To avoid link interruptions due to UAV instability, IRS should\nutilize fewer elements, even though this leads to a decrease in directivity.

    "abstract": "Purpose: In this study, we investigate the training of foundation models\nusing federated learning to address data-sharing limitations and enable\ncollaborative model training without data transfer for minimally invasive\nsurgery. Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked\nAutoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is\npretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and\nevaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition,\nand Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that\nintegrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves\npretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The\napplication of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance\ncomparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over\nCEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action\ntriplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings\nhighlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training\nof surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for\nsurgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated\nlearning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the\ninherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in\nvideo-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating\nspatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.",

The impact risk it poses needs to be evaluated for\nany spacecraft crossing the ring. This study aims to provide a first model of\nthe dust ring, in terms of distribution of particles (including size\ndistribution), velocity, density of the ring, and deduce a first estimation of\nthe impact risk to spacecrafts crossing the ring. We seek to describe the\norbits of dust particles in the ring. We explore a first simple model, that\nleads us to propose a second, more elaborate, model. This model is then\npopulated by particles that we integrate for 2000 years. We demonstrate that\nthe dust ring will persist over the next 2000 years, only slightly extending\nradially and perpendicularly to the Venus orbital plane. We show that particles\ntend to accumulate at Venus orbit, but that along it the differences in density\nis negligible. We compute the number of particles we can expect to find in the\nring. Finally, as an example, we apply this model to Bepi-Colombo to obtain a\nfirst estimate of the impact flux in function of radius and mass, for radii\nbetween 2 $\\mu$m and 2 cm (i.e. for masses between 10^-2 kg and 10^-14 kg).

    "abstract": "Buildings account for a significant share of global energy consumption and\nemissions, making it critical to operate them efficiently. As electricity grids\nbecome more volatile with renewable penetration, buildings must provide\nflexibility to support grid stability. Building automation plays a key role in\nenhancing efficiency and flexibility via centralized operations, but it must\nprioritize occupant-centric strategies to balance energy and comfort targets.\nHowever, incorporating occupant information into large-scale, centralized\nbuilding operations remains challenging due to data limitations. We investigate\nthe potential of using whole-building smart meter data to infer both occupancy\nand system operations. Integrating these insights into data-driven building\nenergy analysis allows more occupant-centric energy-saving and flexibility at\nscale. Specifically, we propose OccuEMBED, a unified framework for occupancy\ninference and system-level load analysis. It combines two key components: a\nprobabilistic occupancy profile generator, and a controllable and interpretable\nload disaggregator supported by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN). This design\nembeds knowledge of occupancy patterns and load-occupancy-weather relationships\ninto deep learning models. We conducted comprehensive evaluations to\ndemonstrate its effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets compared\nto various occupancy inference baselines. OccuEMBED always achieved average F1\nscores above 0.8 in discrete occupancy inference and RMSE within 0.1-0.2 for\ncontinuous occupancy ratios. We further demonstrate how OccuEMBED integrates\nwith building load monitoring platforms to display occupancy profiles, analyze\nsystem-level operations, and inform occupant-responsive strategies. Our model\nlays a robust foundation in scaling occupant-centric building management\nsystems to meet the challenges of an evolving energy system.",

Even for a fixed problem,\nthe number of possible transformation paths -- from industry-relevant\nformulations through binary constrained linear programs (BILPs), to quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and finally to a hardware-executable\nrepresentation -- is remarkably large. Each step introduces free parameters,\nsuch as Lagrange multipliers, encoding strategies, slack variables, rounding\nschemes or algorithmic choices -- making brute-force exploration of all paths\nintractable. In this work, we benchmark a representative subset of these\ntransformation paths using a real-world industrial production planning problem\nwith industry data: the optimization of work allocation in a press shop\nproducing vehicle parts. We focus on QUBO reformulations and algorithmic\nparameters for both quantum annealing (QA) and the Linear Ramp Quantum\nApproximate Optimization Algorithm (LR-QAOA). Our goal is to identify a reduced\nset of effective configurations applicable to similar industrial settings. Our\nresults show that QA on D-Wave hardware consistently produces near-optimal\nsolutions, whereas LR-QAOA on IBM quantum devices struggles to reach comparable\nperformance. Hence, the choice of hardware and solver strategy significantly\nimpacts performance. The problem formulation and especially the penalization\nstrategy determine the solution quality. Most importantly,\nmathematically-defined penalization strategies are equally successful as\nhand-picked penalty factors, paving the way for automated QUBO formulation.\nMoreover, we observe a strong correlation between simulated and quantum\nannealing performance metrics, offering a scalable proxy for predicting QA\nbehavior on larger problem instances.",

Because of this, a new didactic framework is needed.\n  This paper presents a new method of structuring educational contents around\nskills: something that a student is expected to be able to do. It defines Skill\nTrees that show dependencies between skills, and subsequently couples these to\nConcept Trees that contain intuitive ideas/notional machines. Due to the\nalgorithmic nature of computer science, this step-wise approach is especially\nwell-suited to this field of education. Next to formal definitions on Skill\nTrees and Concept Trees, guidelines are given on how to design them and how to\nplan a course using them.\n  The Skill Trees framework has been applied to improve the structure of a\nuniversity database course.

    "abstract": "Safety assessment of patients with one-dimensionally structured passive\nimplants, like cranial meshes or stents, exposed to low or medium frequency\nmagnetic fields, like those generated in magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic\nhyperthermia, can be challenging, because of the different length scales of the\nimplant and the human body. Most of the methods used to estimate the heating\ninduced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials\nwithin the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this\nlimitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and\none-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. The proposed method is compared\nwith measurements performed on a cranial mesh exposed to the magnetic field\ngenerated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging. Then, it is\napplied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial\nmesh is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic\nhyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment. The experimental comparison\nof the proposed method predictions and the measurement data shows an improved\naccuracy near the maximum temperature increase up to 25% with respect to the\nmethod based on thermal seeds. The application of the proposed method applied\nto the magnetic hyperthermia case study leads to a prediction of the maximum\ntemperature increase that is 10% lower than the one overestimated by relying on\nthermal seeds. At the same time, the proposed method corrects the\nunderestimation of the thermal seeds in the regions where the electromagnetic\npower is not directly deposited and the temperature increase is only due to\nheat transfer. The proposed method leads to improved results with respect to\nprevious approximations by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly\nconductive metallic implants.",

    "abstract": "It is explained why relatively gas-poor ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), a\nsubset of IC 3475 galaxy types, do not have unexpectedly large sizes but large\nsizes that are in line with expectations from the curved size-luminosity\nrelation defined by brighter early-type galaxies (ETGs). These UDGs extend the\nfaint end of the (absolute magnitude, $\\mathfrak{M}$)-log(S\\'ersic index, $n$)\nand $\\mathfrak{M}$-(central surface brightness, $\\mu_{\\rm 0}$) relations\ndefined by all ETGs, leading to the large effective half-light radii, $R_{\\rm\ne}$, in these UDGs. It is detailed how the scatter in $\\mu_{\\rm 0}$, at a given\n$\\mathfrak{M}$, relates to variations in the galaxies' values of $n$ and\neffective surface brightness, $\\mu_{\\rm e}$. These variations map into changes\nin $R_{\\rm e}$ and produce the scatter about the $\\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\\rm e}$\nrelation at fixed $\\mathfrak{M}$. Similarly, the scatter in $\\mathfrak{M}$, at\nfixed $\\mu_{\\rm 0}$ and $n$, can be mapped into changes in $R_{\\rm e}$. The\nsuggestion that there may be two types of relatively gas-poor UDGs appears\nill-founded, arising from the scatter about the $\\mathfrak{M}$-$\\mu_{\\rm 0}$\nrelation. The increased scatter about the faint end of the\n$\\mathfrak{M}$-$R_{\\rm e}$ relation and the smaller scatter about\n$\\mathfrak{M}$-(isophotal radii, $R_{\\rm iso}$) relations are explained.\nArtificial and potentially misleading size-luminosity relations for UDGs are\nalso addressed.

The partition insensitivity of the proposed\nalgorithm refers to the fact that the solutions obtained by the algorithm will\nnot change with the distributed storage of data. In addition, the algorithm has\nglobal convergence and a sublinear convergence rate. Experimental results\nindicate that, as compared with traditional variable selection classification\ntechniques, the PLR with manually-labeled noisy data achieves higher estimation\nand classification accuracy across multiple large-scale datasets.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in\nunderstanding and analyzing code for security vulnerabilities, such as Common\nWeakness Enumerations (CWEs). However, their reliance on cloud infrastructure\nand substantial computational requirements pose challenges for analyzing\nsensitive or proprietary codebases due to privacy concerns and inference costs.\nThis work explores the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a viable\nalternative for accurate, on-premise vulnerability detection. We investigated\nwhether a 350-million parameter pre-trained code model (codegen-mono) could be\neffectively fine-tuned to detect the MITRE Top 25 CWEs specifically within\nPython code. To facilitate this, we developed a targeted dataset of 500\nexamples using a semi-supervised approach involving LLM-driven synthetic data\ngeneration coupled with meticulous human review. Initial tests confirmed that\nthe base codegen-mono model completely failed to identify CWEs in our samples.\nHowever, after applying instruction-following fine-tuning, the specialized SLM\nachieved remarkable performance on our test set, yielding approximately 99%\naccuracy, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.04% F1-score. These results\nstrongly suggest that fine-tuned SLMs can serve as highly accurate and\nefficient tools for CWE detection, offering a practical and privacy-preserving\nsolution for integrating advanced security analysis directly into development\nworkflows.",

    "abstract": "We propose a family of modulated honeycomb lattices, a class of quasiperiodic\ntilings characterized by the metallic mean. These lattices consist of six\ndistinct hexagonal prototiles with two edge lengths, $\\ell$ and $s$, and can be\nregarded as a continuous deformation of the honeycomb lattice. The structural\nproperties are examined through their substitution rules. To study the\nelectronic properties, we construct a tight-binding model on the tilings,\nintroducing two types of hopping integrals, $t_L$ and $t_S$, corresponding to\nthe two edge lengths, $\\ell$ and $s$, respectively. By diagonalizing the\nHamiltonian on these quasiperiodic tilings, we compute the corresponding\ndensity of states (DOS). Our analysis reveals that the introduction of\nquasiperiodicity in the distribution of hopping integrals induces a spiky\nstructure in the DOS at higher energies, while the linear DOS at low energies\n($E\\sim 0$) remains robust. This contrasts with the smooth DOS in the\ndisordered tight-binding model, where two types of hopping integrals are\nrandomly distributed according to a given ratio. Furthermore, we study the\nmagnetic properties of the Hubbard model on modulated honeycomb lattices by\nmeans of real-space Hartree approximations. A magnetic phase transition occurs\nat a finite interaction strength due to the absence of the noninteracting DOS\nat the Fermi level. When $t_L\\sim t_S$, the phase transition point is primarily\ngoverned by the linear DOS. However, far from the condition $t_L=t_S$, the\nquasiperiodic structure plays a significant role in reducing the critical\ninteraction strength, which is in contrast to the disordered system. Using\nperpendicular space analysis, we demonstrate that sublattice asymmetry inherent\nin the quasiperiodic tilings emerges in the magnetic profile, providing\ninsights into the interplay between quasiperiodicity and electronic\ncorrelations.",

Previous works usually suffer\nfrom data sparsity and cold-start problems, and may fail to adequately explore\nsemantic user-product associations from multimodal data. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Hypergraph Contrastive Learning (MMHCL)\nframework for user recommendation. For a comprehensive information exploration\nfrom user-product relations, we construct two hypergraphs, i.e. a user-to-user\n(u2u) hypergraph and an item-to-item (i2i) hypergraph, to mine shared\npreferences among users and intricate multimodal semantic resemblance among\nitems, respectively. This process yields denser second-order semantics that are\nfused with first-order user-item interaction as complementary to alleviate the\ndata sparsity issue. Then, we design a contrastive feature enhancement paradigm\nby applying synergistic contrastive learning. By maximizing/minimizing the\nmutual information between second-order (e.g. shared preference pattern for\nusers) and first-order (information of selected items for users) embeddings of\nthe same/different users and items, the feature distinguishability can be\neffectively enhanced. Compared with using sparse primary user-item interaction\nonly, our MMHCL obtains denser second-order hypergraphs and excavates more\nabundant shared attributes to explore the user-product associations, which to a\ncertain extent alleviates the problems of data sparsity and cold-start.\nExtensive experiments have comprehensively demonstrated the effectiveness of\nour method.

However, in scenarios\ninvolving sensitive interactions -- such as e-voting or e-cash -- there is a\ngrowing need for more controlled signing mechanisms. Strong-Designated Verifier\nSignature (SDVS) offers such control by allowing the signer to specify and\nrestrict the verifier of a signature. The existing state-of-the-art SDVS are\nmostly based on number-theoretic hardness assumptions. Thus, they are not\nsecure against quantum attacks. Moreover, Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)-based\nSDVS are inefficient and have large key and signature sizes. In this work, we\naddress these challenges and propose an efficient post-quantum SDVS (namely,\nLaSDVS) based on ideal lattices under the hardness assumptions of the Ring-SIS\nand Ring-LWE problems. LaSDVS achieves advanced security properties including\nstrong unforgeability under chosen-message attacks, non-transferability,\nnon-delegatability, and signer anonymity. By employing the algebraic structure\nof rings and the gadget trapdoor mechanism of Micciancio et al., we design\nLaSDVS to minimize computational overhead and significantly reduce key and\nsignature sizes. Notably, our scheme achieves a compact signature size of\n$\\mathcal{O}(n\\log q)$, compared to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ size, where $n$ is the\nsecurity parameter, in the existing state-of-the-art PQC designs. To the best\nof our knowledge, LaSDVS offers the \\textit{smallest private key and signature\nsize} among the existing PQC-based SDVS schemes.",

However, while\ncurrent exemplar-based CAC methods offer flexibility at inference time, they\nstill rely heavily on labeled data for training, which limits scalability and\ngeneralization to many downstream use cases. In this paper, we introduce\nCountingDINO, the first training-free exemplar-based CAC framework that\nexploits a fully unsupervised feature extractor. Specifically, our approach\nemploys self-supervised vision-only backbones to extract object-aware features,\nand it eliminates the need for annotated data throughout the entire proposed\npipeline. At inference time, we extract latent object prototypes via ROI-Align\nfrom DINO features and use them as convolutional kernels to generate similarity\nmaps. These are then transformed into density maps through a simple yet\neffective normalization scheme. We evaluate our approach on the FSC-147\nbenchmark, where we consistently outperform a baseline based on an SOTA\nunsupervised object detector under the same label- and training-free setting.\nAdditionally, we achieve competitive results -- and in some cases surpass --\ntraining-free methods that rely on supervised backbones, non-training-free\nunsupervised methods, as well as several fully supervised SOTA approaches. This\ndemonstrates that label- and training-free CAC can be both scalable and\neffective. Code: https://lorebianchi98.github.io/CountingDINO/.",

However, the\nlarge number of independent SMEFT operators allows for the possibility of blind\ndirections, parameter combinations to which electroweak precision data are\nlargely insensitive. In this work, we demonstrate that such blind directions\nare not merely an artefact of agnostic effective field theory scans, but arise\ngenerically in realistic ultraviolet completions involving multiple heavy\nfields. We identify several concrete multi-field extensions of the Standard\nModel whose low-energy SMEFT projections align with known blind subspaces, and\nshow that these persist even after accounting for renormalisation group\nevolution and finite one-loop matching effects.

However, simple experiments on human\ndecision makers found them to be not fully rational, due to their subjective\nrisk perception. Prospect theory was proposed as an empirically-grounded model\nto incorporate irrational behaviours into game-theoretic models. But, how\nprospect theory shapes the set of Nash equilibria when considering irrational\nagents, is still poorly understood. To this end, we study how prospect\ntheoretic transformations may generate new equilibria while eliminating\nexisting ones. Focusing on aggregative games, we show that capturing users'\nirrationality can preserve symmetric equilibria while causing the vanishing of\nasymmetric equilibria. Further, there exist value functions which map\nuncountable sets of equilibria in the expected-utility maximization framework\nto finite sets. This last result may shape some equilibrium selection theories\nfor human-in-the-loop systems where computing a single equilibrium is\ninsufficient and comparison of equilibria is needed.",

Our key\nobservation is that for any generalized linear model (GLM), one can construct\nan associated game of sequential probability assignment such that achieving low\nregret in the game implies a high-probability upper bound on the excess\nlikelihood of the true parameter of the GLM. This allows us to develop a scheme\nthat we call online-to-confidence-set conversions, which effectively reduces\nthe problem of proving the desired statistical claim to an algorithmic\nquestion. We study two varieties of this conversion scheme: 1) analytical\nconversions that only require proving the existence of algorithms with low\nregret and provide confidence sets centered at the maximum-likelihood estimator\n2) algorithmic conversions that actively leverage the output of the online\nalgorithm to construct confidence sets (and may be centered at other,\nadaptively constructed point estimators). The resulting methodology recovers\nall state-of-the-art confidence set constructions within a single framework,\nand also provides several new types of confidence sets that were previously\nunknown in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Complex spatial patterns in biological systems often arise through\nself-organization without a central coordination, guided by local interactions\nand chemical signaling. In this study, we explore how motility-dependent\nchemical deposition and concentration-sensitive feedback can give rise to\nfractal-like networks, using a minimal agent-based model. Agents deposit\nchemicals only while moving, and their future motion is biased by local\nchemical gradients. This interaction generates a rich variety of self-organized\nstructures resembling those seen in processes like early vasculogenesis and\nepithelial cell dispersal. We identify a diverse phase diagram governed by the\nrates of chemical deposition and decay, revealing transitions from uniform\ndistributions to sparse and dense networks, and ultimately to full phase\nseparation. At low chemical decay rates, agents form stable, system-spanning\nnetworks; further reduction leads to re-entry into a uniform state. A continuum\nmodel capturing the co-evolution of agent density and chemical fields confirms\nthese transitions and reveals how linear stability criteria determine the\nobserved phases. At low chemical concentrations, diffusion dominates and\npromotes fractal growth, while higher concentrations favor nucleation and\ncompact clustering. These findings unify a range of biological phenomena - such\nas chemotaxis, tissue remodeling, and self-generated gradient navigation -\nwithin a simple, physically grounded framework. Our results also offer insights\ninto designing artificial systems with emergent collective behavior, including\nrobotic swarms or synthetic active matter.",

    "abstract": "Background: A growing number of cancer patients with brain metastases can\nbenefit from stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) thanks to recent advances in\nsystemic therapies. With an increasing patient load, single-isocenter\ntreatments on widely available C-arm linear accelerators are an attractive\noption. However, the planning of such treatments is challenging for\nmulti-target cases due to the island blocking problem, which occurs when the\nmulti-leaf collimator cannot conform to all targets simultaneously.\n  Purpose: We propose a multi-target partitioning algorithm that mitigates\nexcessive exposure of normal tissue caused by the island blocking problem.\n  Methods: The algorithm divides (partitions) the set of targets into subsets\nto treat with separate arc passes, optimizing both subsets and collimator\nangles to minimize island blocking. The algorithm was incorporated into a fully\nautomated treatment planning script and evaluated on 20 simulated patient\ncases, each with 10 brain metastases and 21 Gy prescriptions. It was also\nretrospectively evaluated on six clinical cases.\n  Results: Partitioning significantly improved the gradient index, global\nefficiency index, and brain V12Gy compared to simultaneous treatment of all\nmetastases. For example, the average gradient index improved from 5.9 to 3.3,\nglobal efficiency index from 0.32 to 0.46, and normal brain V12Gy from 49 cm3\nto 26 cm3 between 3 and 9 arcs. The proposed algorithm outperformed baselines\nin utilizing a limited number of arcs. All target partitioning strategies\nincreased the total number of monitor units (MUs).\n  Conclusions: The dose gradient in single-isocenter VMAT plans can be\nsubstantially improved by treating a smaller subset of metastases at a time.\nThis requires more MUs and arcs, implying a trade-off between delivery time and\nplan quality which can be explored using the algorithm proposed in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Software systems with large parameter spaces, nondeterminism and high\ncomputational cost are challenging to test. Recently, software testing\ntechniques based on causal inference have been successfully applied to systems\nthat exhibit such characteristics, including scientific models and autonomous\ndriving systems. One significant limitation is that these are restricted to\ntest properties where all of the variables involved can be observed and where\nthere are no interactions between variables. In practice, this is rarely\nguaranteed; the logging infrastructure may not be available to record all of\nthe necessary runtime variable values, and it can often be the case that an\noutput of the system can be affected by complex interactions between variables.\nTo address this, we leverage two additional concepts from causal inference,\nnamely effect modification and instrumental variable methods. We build these\nconcepts into an existing causal testing tool and conduct an evaluative case\nstudy which uses the concepts to test three system-level requirements of CARLA,\na high-fidelity driving simulator widely used in autonomous vehicle development\nand testing. The results show that we can obtain reliable test outcomes without\nrequiring large amounts of highly controlled test data or instrumentation of\nthe code, even when variables interact with each other and are not recorded in\nthe test data.",

A\npossible reason is that the unreliable item modality data hurts the fusion\nresult. Several existing studies have introduced weights for different\nmodalities to reduce the contribution of the unreliable modality data in\npredicting the final user rating. However, they fail to provide appropriate\nsupervisions for learning the modality weights, making the learned weights\nimprecise. Therefore, we propose a modality reliability guided multimodal\nrecommendation framework that uniquely learns the modality weights supervised\nby the modality reliability. Considering that there is no explicit label\nprovided for modality reliability, we resort to automatically identify it\nthrough the BPR recommendation objective. In particular, we define a modality\nreliability vector as the supervision label by the difference between\nmodality-specific user ratings to positive and negative items, where a larger\ndifference indicates a higher reliability of the modality as the BPR objective\nis better satisfied. Furthermore, to enhance the effectiveness of the\nsupervision, we calculate the confidence level for the modality reliability\nvector, which dynamically adjusts the supervision strength and eliminates the\nharmful supervision. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.",

An optimization problem is formulated to\ndetermine the optimal arrangement of antenna elements where the trade-off\nbetween spectral efficiency (SE) and sidelobe levels (SLL) can be tuned.\nClustered array configurations are optimized by genetic algorithm and\nAlgorithm-X based methodologies, where the former relies on a randomized search\nand the latter exploits brute-force search, respectively.

In this paper, we introduce a unified data selection\nframework called QuaDMix, which automatically optimizes the data distribution\nfor LLM pretraining while balancing both quality and diversity. Specifically,\nwe first propose multiple criteria to measure data quality and employ domain\nclassification to distinguish data points, thereby measuring overall diversity.\nQuaDMix then employs a unified parameterized data sampling function that\ndetermines the sampling probability of each data point based on these quality\nand diversity related labels. To accelerate the search for the optimal\nparameters involved in the QuaDMix framework, we conduct simulated experiments\non smaller models and use LightGBM for parameters searching, inspired by the\nRegMix method. Our experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate\nthat QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across\nmultiple benchmarks. These results outperform the independent strategies for\nquality and diversity, highlighting the necessity and ability to balance data\nquality and diversity.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of active bead-spring critical\npercolation clusters under the action of monopolar and dipolar forces.\nPreviously, Langevin dynamics simulations of Rouse-type dynamics were performed\non a deterministic fractal -- the Sierpinski gasket -- and combined with\nanalytical theory [Chaos {\\bf 34}, 113107 (2024)]. To study disordered\nfractals, we use here the critical (bond) percolation infinite cluster of\nsquare and triangular lattices, where beads (occupying nodes) are connected by\nharmonic springs. Two types of active stochastic forces, modeled as random\ntelegraph processes, are considered: force monopoles, acting on individual\nnodes in random directions, and force dipoles, where extensile or contractile\nforces act between pairs of nodes, forming dipole links. A dynamical steady\nstate is reached where the network is dynamically swelled for force monopoles.\nThe time-averaged mean square displacement (MSD) shows sub-diffusive behavior\nat intermediate times longer than the force correlation time, whose anomalous\nexponent is solely controlled by the spectral dimension $(d_s)$ of the fractal\nnetwork yielding MSD $\\sim t^{\\nu}$, with $\\nu=1-\\frac{d_s}{2}$, similar to the\nthermal system and in accord with the general analytic theory. In contrast,\ndipolar forces require a diverging time to reach a steady state, depending on\nthe fraction of dipoles, and lead to network shrinkage. Within a\nquasi-steady-state assumption, we find a saturation behavior at the same\ntemporal regime. Thereafter, a second ballistic-like rise is observed for\nnetworks with a low fraction of dipole forces, followed by a linear, diffusive\nincrease. The second ballistic rise is, however, absent in networks fully\noccupied with force dipoles. These two behaviors are argued to result from\nlocal rotations of nodes, which are either persistent or fluctuating.",

However, destructive diagnostics must be avoided in superconducting\nsections to prevent the occurrence of particulates and outgassing, rendering\ndirect measurements of the beam envelope particularly challenging. This study\npresents a non-destructive method that uses beam position monitors (BPMs) to\nestimate the transverse beam envelope based on measurements of the quadrupole\nmoment of the beam distribution. Although this concept was originally proposed\nin the 1980s, its application, especially to hadron beams, has been limited\nbecause of low signal sensitivity and the accuracy constraints associated with\nconventional BPM geometries. To overcome these challenges, we employed\n$\\cos{2\\theta}$-type BPMs, which offer improved sensitivity to quadrupole\ncomponents and are well-suited for low-$\\beta$ heavy ion beams. This method was\napplied to the heavy ion beams in the superconducting RIKEN linac (SRILAC), for\nwhich data from eight BPMs were combined with transfer matrix calculations and\nsupplemental wire scanner data. The resulting beam envelope estimates exhibited\ngood agreement with conventional quadrupole scan results, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of this technique for routine, non-destructive beam monitoring in\nsuperconducting accelerator sections.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression is a technique that can automatically derive analytic\nmodels from data. Traditionally, symbolic regression has been implemented\nprimarily through genetic programming that evolves populations of candidate\nsolutions sampled by genetic operators, crossover and mutation. More recently,\nneural networks have been employed to learn the entire analytical model, i.e.,\nits structure and coefficients, using regularized gradient-based optimization.\nAlthough this approach tunes the model's coefficients better, it is prone to\npremature convergence to suboptimal model structures. Here, we propose a\nneuro-evolutionary symbolic regression method that combines the strengths of\nevolutionary-based search for optimal neural network (NN) topologies with\ngradient-based tuning of the network's parameters. Due to the inherent high\ncomputational demand of evolutionary algorithms, it is not feasible to learn\nthe parameters of every candidate NN topology to full convergence. Thus, our\nmethod employs a memory-based strategy and population perturbations to enhance\nexploitation and reduce the risk of being trapped in suboptimal NNs. In this\nway, each NN topology can be trained using only a short sequence of\nbackpropagation iterations. The proposed method was experimentally evaluated on\nthree real-world test problems and has been shown to outperform other NN-based\napproaches regarding the quality of the models obtained.",

We are interested in the probability $\\pi(s,t)$ that such\na random walk starting in $s$ ends in $t$. We wish to, with constant\nprobability, estimate $\\pi(s, t)$ within a constant relative error, unless\n$\\pi(s, t) < \\delta$ for some given threshold $\\delta$.\n  The current status is as follows. Algorithms with worst-case running time\n$\\tilde O(m)$ and $O(1/\\delta)$ are known. A more complicated algorithm is\nknown, which does not perform better in the worst case, but for the average\nrunning time over all $n$ possible targets $t$, it achieves an alternative\nbound of $O(\\sqrt{d/\\delta})$. All the above algorithms assume query access to\nthe adjacency list of a node.\n  On the lower bound side, the best-known lower bound for the worst case is\n$\\Omega(n^{1/2}m^{1/4})$ with $\\delta \\leq 1/(n^{1/2}m^{1/4})$, and for the\naverage case it is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ with $\\delta \\leq 1/n$. This leaves\nsubstantial polynomial gaps in both cases.\n  In this paper, we show that the above upper bounds are tight across all\nparameters $n$, $m$ and $\\delta$. We show that the right bound is\n$\\tilde\\Theta(\\min\\{m, 1/\\delta\\})$ for the worst case, and\n$\\tilde\\Theta(\\min\\{m, \\sqrt{d/\\delta}, 1/\\delta\\})$ for the average case.\n  We also consider some additional graph queries from the literature. One\nallows checking whether there is an edge from $u$ to $v$ in constant time.\nAnother allows access to the adjacency list of $u$ sorted by out-degree. We\nprove that none of these access queries help in the worst case, but if we have\nboth of them, we get an average-case bound of $\\tilde\n\\Theta(\\min\\{m,\\sqrt{d/\\delta}, (1/\\delta)^{2/3}\\})$.",

The surface energy is calculated thermodynamically on the\nsurface of a mathematical layer with no thickness. The surface energy concept\nis certainly practical and elegant, but it doesn't seem entirely satisfactory\nto us. In an earlier article 1 , we proposed a thought experiment in which\nsurface tension is replaced with an equivalent force per unit area according to\nthe principles of fluid mechanics. This theoretical tool can be used to rewrite\nthe classical static equations in terms of surface stress gradient and propose\na new way of calculating known phenomena such as meniscus, capillary tube,\nwater drops, etc. In this article, we propose a new thought experiment assuming\nthat beyond the classical interaction forces acting at short distance,\nmolecules at liquid interfaces statistically reorganize according to a\nstationary process of creation/destruction at long distance. The process is\nsuch that the degree of statistical molecular organization decreases with a\ngradient from the surface to the bulk, where the molecules recover the natural\ndisorder of Brownian motion.

Due to the practical importance of this\ntask, numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge. However,\nmost previous methods are heuristically designed and intuitively justified,\nlacking a theoretical foundation. To bridge this gap, we derive a novel\ntransferability bound that offers provable guarantees for adversarial\ntransferability. Our theoretical analysis has the advantages of \\textit{(i)}\ndeepening our understanding of previous methods by building a general attack\nframework and \\textit{(ii)} providing guidance for designing an effective\nattack algorithm. Our theoretical results demonstrate that optimizing AEs\ntoward flat minima over the surrogate model set, while controlling the\nsurrogate-target model shift measured by the adversarial model discrepancy,\nyields a comprehensive guarantee for AE transferability. The results further\nlead to a general transfer-based attack framework, within which we observe that\nprevious methods consider only partial factors contributing to the\ntransferability. Algorithmically, inspired by our theoretical results, we first\nelaborately construct the surrogate model set in which models exhibit diverse\nadversarial vulnerabilities with respect to AEs to narrow an instantiated\nadversarial model discrepancy. Then, a \\textit{model-Diversity-compatible\nReverse Adversarial Perturbation} (DRAP) is generated to effectively promote\nthe flatness of AEs over diverse surrogate models to improve transferability.\nExtensive experiments on NIPS2017 and CIFAR-10 datasets against various target\nmodels demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack.",

    "abstract": "As intelligent computing devices increasingly integrate into human life,\nensuring the functional safety of the corresponding electronic chips becomes\nmore critical. A key metric for functional safety is achieving a sufficient\nfault coverage. To meet this requirement, extensive time-consuming fault\nsimulation of the RTL code is necessary during the chip design phase.The main\noverhead in RTL fault simulation comes from simulating behavioral nodes (always\nblocks). Due to the limited fault propagation capacity, fault simulation\nresults often match the good simulation results for many behavioral nodes. A\nkey strategy for accelerating RTL fault simulation is the identification and\nelimination of redundant simulations. Existing methods detect redundant\nexecutions by examining whether the fault inputs to each RTL node are\nconsistent with the good inputs. However, we observe that this input comparison\nmechanism overlooks a significant amount of implicit redundant execution:\nalthough the fault inputs differ from the good inputs, the node's execution\nresults remain unchanged. Our experiments reveal that this overlooked redundant\nexecution constitutes nearly half of the total execution overhead of behavioral\nnodes, becoming a significant bottleneck in current RTL fault simulation. The\nunderlying reason for this overlooked redundancy is that, in these cases, the\ntrue execution paths within the behavioral nodes are not affected by the\nchanges in input values. In this work, we propose a behavior-level redundancy\ndetection algorithm that focuses on the true execution paths. Building on the\nelimination of redundant executions, we further developed an efficient RTL\nfault simulation framework, Eraser.Experimental results show that compared to\ncommercial tools, under the same fault coverage, our framework achieves a 3.9\n$\\times$ improvement in simulation performance on average.",

    "abstract": "Quantum algorithms rely on quantum computers for implementation, but the\nphysical connectivity constraints of modern quantum processors impede the\nefficient realization of quantum algorithms. Qubit mapping, a critical\ntechnology for practical quantum computing applications, directly determines\nthe execution efficiency and feasibility of algorithms on superconducting\nquantum processors. Existing mapping methods overlook intractable quantum\nhardware fidelity characteristics, reducing circuit execution quality. They\nalso exhibit prolonged solving times or even failure to complete when handling\nlarge-scale quantum architectures, compromising efficiency. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel qubit mapping method HAQA. HAQA first introduces\na community-based iterative region identification strategy leveraging hardware\nconnection topology, achieving effective dimensionality reduction of mapping\nspace. This strategy avoids global search procedures, with complexity analysis\ndemonstrating quadratic polynomial-level acceleration. Furthermore, HAQA\nimplements a hardware-characteristic-based region evaluation mechanism,\nenabling quantitative selection of mapping regions based on fidelity metrics.\nThis approach effectively integrates hardware fidelity information into the\nmapping process, enabling fidelity-aware qubit allocation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that HAQA significantly improves solving speed and fidelity while\nensuring solution quality. When applied to state-of-the-art quantum mapping\ntechniques Qsynth-v2 and TB-OLSQ2, HAQA achieves acceleration ratios of 632.76\nand 286.87 respectively, while improving fidelity by up to 52.69% and 238.28%",

    "abstract": "Aircraft recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is a\nfundamental mission in both military and civilian applications. Recently deep\nlearning (DL) has emerged a dominant paradigm for its explosive performance on\nextracting discriminative features. However, current classification algorithms\nfocus primarily on learning decision hyperplane without enough comprehension on\naircraft structural knowledge. Inspired by the fined aircraft annotation\nmethods for optical remote sensing images (RSI), we first introduce a\nstructure-based SAR aircraft annotations approach to provide structural and\ncompositional supplement information. On this basis, we propose a multi-task\nstructure guided learning (MTSGL) network for robust and interpretable SAR\naircraft recognition. Besides the classification task, MTSGL includes a\nstructural semantic awareness (SSA) module and a structural consistency\nregularization (SCR) module. The SSA is designed to capture structure semantic\ninformation, which is conducive to gain human-like comprehension of aircraft\nknowledge. The SCR helps maintain the geometric consistency between the\naircraft structure in SAR imagery and the proposed annotation. In this process,\nthe structural attribute can be disentangled in a geometrically meaningful\nmanner. In conclusion, the MTSGL is presented with the expert-level aircraft\nprior knowledge and structure guided learning paradigm, aiming to comprehend\nthe aircraft concept in a way analogous to the human cognitive process.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on a self-constructed multi-task SAR\naircraft recognition dataset (MT-SARD) and the effective results illustrate the\nsuperiority of robustness and interpretation ability of the proposed MTSGL.",

Recent methods, like\nRoboDreamer, utilize linguistic decomposition to divide instructions into\nseparate lower-level primitives, conditioning the world model on these\nprimitives to achieve compositional instruction-following. However, these\nseparate primitives do not consider the relationships that exist between them.\nFurthermore, recent methods neglect valuable visual guidance, including depth\nand semantic guidance, both crucial for enhancing visual quality. This paper\nintroduces ManipDreamer, an advanced world model based on the action tree and\nvisual guidance. To better learn the relationships between instruction\nprimitives, we represent the instruction as the action tree and assign\nembeddings to tree nodes, each instruction can acquire its embeddings by\nnavigating through the action tree. The instruction embeddings can be used to\nguide the world model. To enhance visual quality, we combine depth and semantic\nguidance by introducing a visual guidance adapter compatible with the world\nmodel. This visual adapter enhances both the temporal and physical consistency\nof video generation. Based on the action tree and visual guidance, ManipDreamer\nsignificantly boosts the instruction-following ability and visual quality.\nComprehensive evaluations on robotic manipulation benchmarks reveal that\nManipDreamer achieves large improvements in video quality metrics in both seen\nand unseen tasks, with PSNR improved from 19.55 to 21.05, SSIM improved from\n0.7474 to 0.7982 and reduced Flow Error from 3.506 to 3.201 in unseen tasks,\ncompared to the recent RoboDreamer model.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based networks have achieved strong performance in low-level\nvision tasks like image deraining by utilizing spatial or channel-wise\nself-attention. However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps\nchallenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to\nintegrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To\naddress this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment\nTransformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and\nalignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and\nglobal-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and\nbetween paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction\nand fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the\nTransformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial\npixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel\ndependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain\ndistribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature\nmisalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive\nAlignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in\na two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity.\nThis reduces the information gap within and between paradigms. Through this\nunified cross-paradigm dynamic interaction framework, we achieve the extraction\nof the most valuable interactive fusion information from the two paradigms.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on eight benchmark datasets and further validates CPRAformer's\nrobustness in other image restoration tasks and downstream applications.",

Recent advances in generative models,\ninspired by natural language processing, suggest the potential for unifying\nthese stages to mitigate such loss. This paper presents the Unified Generative\nRecommendation Framework (UniGRF), a novel approach that integrates retrieval\nand ranking into a single generative model. By treating both stages as sequence\ngeneration tasks, UniGRF enables sufficient information sharing without\nadditional computational costs, while remaining model-agnostic. To enhance\ninter-stage collaboration, UniGRF introduces a ranking-driven enhancer module\nthat leverages the precision of the ranking stage to refine retrieval\nprocesses, creating an enhancement loop. Besides, a gradient-guided adaptive\nweighter is incorporated to dynamically balance the optimization of retrieval\nand ranking, ensuring synchronized performance improvements. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that UniGRF significantly outperforms existing models\non benchmark datasets, confirming its effectiveness in facilitating information\ntransfer. Ablation studies and further experiments reveal that UniGRF not only\npromotes efficient collaboration between stages but also achieves synchronized\noptimization.

The detector provides a high and steady rate of detected photons in\nthe low-frequency range ($<1$ Hz), opens a potential window to identify GWs in\nthe mid-frequency range ($1\\sim10$ Hz), which is absent in other contemporary\nGW detectors, and establishes a selection rule for GW frequencies in the\nhigh-frequency range ($>10$ Hz), allowing for the adjustment of detector\nparameters to focus on specific GW frequencies. Furthermore, the detector is\ninsensitive to seismic noise, and the detectable photon count rate is\nproportional to the square of the GW amplitude, making it more advantageous for\ndetermining the distance of the source compared to current interferometer\ndetectors.

We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram\nmatrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap after training in terms of\nthe alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''.\nEmpirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this\nanalysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, at any point during\ntraining, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram\nmatrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the training process\nis benign, i.e., it does not lead to significant deterioration of the\ngeneralization gap (which is zero at initialization).

Inferring a\npossible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link\nprediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may\nnot always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise\nand misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN\ninference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase.\nTherefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior\nknowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional\ninformations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more\nconfident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration\nof multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory\nNetworks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene\nexpression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological\nsignals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming\nthem into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded\nwith a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene\nacross all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the\ninput gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within\nthe graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model,\ntermed GT-GRN, for GRN inference.

In this study, we explore\nthe possibility that the narrow structure is caused by a decay cascade via an\nintermediate nucleon resonance decaying to $\\eta p$ final states. The\ncandidates for the intermediate nucleon resonances are $N(1700)3/2^{-}$ and\n$N(1710)1/2^{+}$, with masses near the observed structure. We consider the\n$t$-channel $\\rho$- and $\\omega$-exchange diagrams, the $u$-channel\nnucleon-pole exchange diagram, the contact term, and the $s$-channel pole\ndiagrams of nucleon, $\\Delta$, and nucleon resonances when constructing the\nreaction amplitudes to reproduce the stripped individual contribution of the\nnarrow structure. Our analysis indicates that the signature strength of the\ndecay cascade $\\gamma p \\to \\pi^{0}N(1700)3/2^{-} \\to \\pi^{0}\\eta p$ is too\nweak to reach the experimental curve of the narrow structure due to the small\ndecay branching ratio of $N(1700)3/2^{-}$ to $\\eta p$. Although the decay\ncascade $\\gamma p \\to \\pi^{0}N(1710)1/2^{+} \\to \\pi^{0}\\eta p$ can\nqualitatively reproduce the experimental curve of the invariant mass\ndistributions, its cross-section width is much larger than that of the\ncorresponding experimental curve.

    "abstract": "Optimizing the similarity between parametric shapes is crucial for numerous\ncomputer vision tasks, where Intersection over Union (IoU) stands as the\ncanonical measure. However, existing optimization methods exhibit significant\nshortcomings: regression-based losses like L1/L2 lack correlation with IoU,\nIoU-based losses are unstable and limited to simple shapes, and task-specific\nmethods are computationally intensive and not generalizable accross domains. As\na result, the current landscape of parametric shape objective functions has\nbecome scattered, with each domain proposing distinct IoU approximations. To\naddress this, we unify the parametric shape optimization objective functions by\nintroducing Marginalized Generalized IoU (MGIoU), a novel loss function that\novercomes these challenges by projecting structured convex shapes onto their\nunique shape Normals to compute one-dimensional normalized GIoU. MGIoU offers a\nsimple, efficient, fully differentiable approximation strongly correlated with\nIoU. We then extend MGIoU to MGIoU+ that supports optimizing unstructured\nconvex shapes. Together, MGIoU and MGIoU+ unify parametric shape optimization\nacross diverse applications. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate\nthat MGIoU and MGIoU+ consistently outperform existing losses while reducing\nloss computation latency by 10-40x. Additionally, MGIoU and MGIoU+ satisfy\nmetric properties and scale-invariance, ensuring robustness as an objective\nfunction. We further propose MGIoU- for minimizing overlaps in tasks like\ncollision-free trajectory prediction. Code is available at\nhttps://ldtho.github.io/MGIoU",

This exact local configuration of opinions, combined with network\ndegree distributions, allows us to obtain exact solutions for consensus times\nand evolutionary trajectories.

Specifically, we leverage the shared private knowledge base to\ngenerate a set of private digital codebooks in advance using neural network\n(NN)-based encoders. For each transmission, we encode the transmitted data into\ndigital sequence Y1 and associate Y1 with a sequence randomly picked from the\nprivate codebook, denoted as Y2, through superposition coding.

By optimizing the power allocation\nbetween the inner and outer codes, the legitimate receiver can reconstruct the\ntransmitted data using successive decoding with the index of Y2 shared, while\nthe eavesdropper' s decoding performance is severely degraded, potentially to\nthe point of random guessing.

However, current deep forecasting methods can achieve promising\nperformance but generally lack interpretability, hindering trustworthiness and\npractical deployment in safety-critical applications such as auto-driving and\nhealthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for\ncredible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model\ndecision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability\nachieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies,\nprior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively\nguide model learning under complex intertwined time series data. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrated that iTFKAN can achieve promising forecasting\nperformance while simultaneously possessing high interpretive capabilities.",

In this work, we present Target Concrete Score Matching (TCSM),\na novel and versatile objective for training and fine-tuning discrete diffusion\nmodels. TCSM provides a general framework with broad applicability. It supports\npre-training discrete diffusion models directly from data samples, and many\nexisting discrete diffusion approaches naturally emerge as special cases of our\nmore general TCSM framework. Furthermore, the same TCSM objective extends to\npost-training of discrete diffusion models, including fine-tuning using reward\nfunctions or preference data, and distillation of knowledge from pre-trained\nautoregressive models. These new capabilities stem from the core idea of TCSM,\nestimating the concrete score of the target distribution, which resides in the\noriginal (clean) data space. This allows seamless integration with reward\nfunctions and pre-trained models, which inherently only operate in the clean\ndata space rather than the noisy intermediate spaces of diffusion processes.\nOur experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that TCSM matches or\nsurpasses current methods. Additionally, TCSM is versatile, applicable to both\npre-training and post-training scenarios, offering greater flexibility and\nsample efficiency.",

However, existing RACG systems\nlargely overlook security, leading to substantial risks. Especially, the\npoisoning of malicious code into knowledge bases can mislead LLMs, resulting in\nthe generation of insecure outputs, which poses a critical threat in modern\nsoftware development. To address this, we propose a security-hardening\nframework for RACG systems, CodeGuarder, that shifts the paradigm from\nretrieving only functional code examples to incorporating both functional code\nand security knowledge. Our framework constructs a security knowledge base from\nreal-world vulnerability databases, including secure code samples and root\ncause annotations. For each code generation query, a retriever decomposes the\nquery into fine-grained sub-tasks and fetches relevant security knowledge. To\nprioritize critical security guidance, we introduce a re-ranking and filtering\nmechanism by leveraging the LLMs' susceptibility to different vulnerability\ntypes. This filtered security knowledge is seamlessly integrated into the\ngeneration prompt. Our evaluation shows CodeGuarder significantly improves code\nsecurity rates across various LLMs, achieving average improvements of 20.12\\%\nin standard RACG, and 31.53\\% and 21.91\\% under two distinct poisoning\nscenarios without compromising functional correctness. Furthermore, CodeGuarder\ndemonstrates strong generalization, enhancing security even when the targeted\nlanguage's security knowledge is lacking.

We propose Metrics-Weighted Averaging (MWA), a simple yet\neffective method to merge model checkpoints by weighting their parameters\naccording to performance metrics. In particular, we investigate weighting by\ntraining loss and by training steps, under the intuition that lower-loss or\nlater-step checkpoints are more valuable. We introduce a formula with a penalty\nfactor to adjust weight distribution, requiring only one hyperparameter\nregardless of the number of checkpoints. Experiments on three fine-tuning tasks\n(mathematical reasoning, preference alignment, and general instruction tuning)\nshow that MWA consistently produces merged models that outperform the naive\nuniform average of checkpoints. Notably, loss-weighted merging often yields the\nbest results, delivering up to 5% higher task accuracy than the baseline\nuniform merge and even surpassing the final individual checkpoint's\nperformance. These findings validate checkpoint merging for PEFT and\ndemonstrate that a metric-driven weighting heuristic can efficiently boost\nmodel performance with minimal computational overhead.",

PixelWeb is constructed using a novel automatic annotation approach that\nintegrates visual feature extraction and Document Object Model (DOM) structure\nanalysis through two core modules: channel derivation and layer analysis.\nChannel derivation ensures accurate localization of GUI elements in cases of\nocclusion and overlapping elements by extracting BGRA four-channel bitmap\nannotations. Layer analysis uses the DOM to determine the visibility and\nstacking order of elements, providing precise BBox annotations. Additionally,\nPixelWeb includes comprehensive metadata such as element images, contours, and\nmask annotations. Manual verification by three independent annotators confirms\nthe high quality and accuracy of PixelWeb annotations. Experimental results on\nGUI element detection tasks show that PixelWeb achieves performance on the\nmAP95 metric that is 3-7 times better than existing datasets. We believe that\nPixelWeb has great potential for performance improvement in downstream tasks\nsuch as GUI generation and automated user interaction.",

    "abstract": "Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue\nin developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is\nlargely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and\ninconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these\nchallenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping\ncode generation, news collection from online sources, accident news\nclassification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The\nsystem uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless\nautomation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,\ndynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts\nfor scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as\ndate, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and\npedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by\nremoving duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites\nover 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news\narticles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module\nachieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the\nhighest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed\nby Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning\n(8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also\ndeveloped with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an\nLLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection,\nproviding a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.",

At the lower level, the\nminiature atomic clocks employ a distributed control strategy that uses only\nlocal information to ensure synchronization in both modes. The resulting\nsynchronized time or generated time scale has the best frequency stability, as\nmeasured by the Allan variance, over the short control period. In the upper\nlayer, a supervisor controls the long-term behavior of the generated time\nscale. In the normal operating mode, the supervisor periodically anchors the\ngenerated time scale to the standard time based on GNSS signals, while in the\nemergency operating mode, it applies optimal floating control to reduce the\ndivergence rate of the generated time scale, which is not observable from the\nmeasurable time difference between the miniature atomic clocks.

The framework\nefficiently extracts relevant information, categorizes reports, and compiles\ndetailed datasets. Thus, this framework overcomes limitations of manual data\ncollection methods such as delays, errors, and communication gaps. The authors'\nevaluation demonstrates that Llama-3, an open-source model, performs comparably\nto GPT-4. It achieved 89% accuracy in the authors' evaluation.

This notion considers a distribution of quantum states that can be\nefficiently cloned, but cannot be converted into a classical string.\nPreviously, work of Nehoran and Zhandry (ITCS 24) showed how to construct\nquantum fire relative to an inefficient unitary oracle. Later, the work of\nBostanci, Nehoran, Zhandry gave a candidate construction based on group action\nassumptions, and proved the correctness of their scheme; however, even in the\nclassical oracle model they only conjectured the security, and no security\nproof was given.\n  In this work, we give the first construction of public-key quantum fire\nrelative to a classical oracle, and prove its security unconditionally. This\ngives the first classical oracle seperation between the two fundamental\nprinciples of quantum mechanics that are equivalent in the\ninformation-theoretic setting: no-cloning and no-telegraphing.\n  Going further, we introduce a stronger notion called quantum key-fire where\nthe clonable fire states can be used to run a functionality (such as a signing\nor decryption key), and prove a secure construction relative to a classical\noracle. As an application of this notion, we get the first public-key\nencryption scheme whose secret key is clonable but satisfies unbounded\nleakage-resilience (Cakan, Goyal, Liu-Zhang, Ribeiro [TCC 24]), relative to a\nclassical oracle. Unbounded leakage-resilience is closely related to, and can\nbe seen as a generalization of the notion of no-telegraphing.\n  For all of our constructions, the oracles can be made efficient (i.e.\npolynomial time), assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions.",

    "abstract": "The furnishing of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has led to the\nemergence of numerous benchmark studies, particularly those evaluating their\nperception and understanding capabilities. Among these, understanding\nimage-evoked emotions aims to enhance MLLMs' empathy, with significant\napplications such as human-machine interaction and advertising recommendations.\nHowever, current evaluations of this MLLM capability remain coarse-grained, and\na systematic and comprehensive assessment is still lacking. To this end, we\nintroduce EEmo-Bench, a novel benchmark dedicated to the analysis of the evoked\nemotions in images across diverse content categories. Our core contributions\ninclude: 1) Regarding the diversity of the evoked emotions, we adopt an emotion\nranking strategy and employ the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) as emotional\nattributes for emotional assessment. In line with this methodology, 1,960\nimages are collected and manually annotated. 2) We design four tasks to\nevaluate MLLMs' ability to capture the evoked emotions by single images and\ntheir associated attributes: Perception, Ranking, Description, and Assessment.\nAdditionally, image-pairwise analysis is introduced to investigate the model's\nproficiency in performing joint and comparative analysis. In total, we collect\n6,773 question-answer pairs and perform a thorough assessment on 19\ncommonly-used MLLMs. The results indicate that while some proprietary and\nlarge-scale open-source MLLMs achieve promising overall performance, the\nanalytical capabilities in certain evaluation dimensions remain suboptimal. Our\nEEmo-Bench paves the path for further research aimed at enhancing the\ncomprehensive perceiving and understanding capabilities of MLLMs concerning\nimage-evoked emotions, which is crucial for machine-centric emotion perception\nand understanding.",

    "abstract": "Cattle lameness is often caused by hoof injuries or interdigital dermatitis,\nleads to pain and significantly impacts essential physiological activities such\nas walking, feeding, and drinking. This study presents a deep learning-based\nmodel for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using\npublicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40\nindividual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor\nenvironments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking\n(normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting\ngait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability,\ndata augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos\nwere then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A\ncomparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification\nperformance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level\nclassification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%,\n90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower\naccuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying\nclassification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data,\noffering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically\ninvolve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction.

    "abstract": "The rising phase of the 2023-24 outburst of the recently discovered bright\ntransient black hole candidate Swift J1727.8-1613 was monitored by\n\\textit{Insight}-HXMT. We study the evolution of hard ($4$-$150$ keV) and soft\n($2$-$4$ keV) band photon count rates, the hardness ratio (HR), and QPO\nfrequencies using daily observations from the HXMT/LE, ME, and HE instruments\nbetween August 25 and October 5, 2023. The QPO frequency is found to be\nstrongly correlated with the soft-band X-ray count rates, and spectral photon\nindices. In contrast, a strong anti-correlation is observed between HR and QPO\nfrequency, as well as between HR and photon index. Based on the evolution of\nthe QPO frequency, the rising phase of the outburst is subdivided into six\nparts, with parts 1-5 fitted using the propagating oscillatory shock (POS)\nsolution to understand the nature of the evolution from a physical perspective.\nThe best-fitted POS model is obtained with a black hole mass of\n$13.34\\pm0.02~M_\\odot$. An inward-propagating shock with weakening strength\n(except in part 4) is observed during the period of our study. The POS\nmodel-fitted mass of the source is further confirmed using the QPO frequency\n($\\nu$)-photon index ($\\Gamma$) scaling method. From this method, the estimated\nprobable mass of Swift J1727.8-1613 is obtained to be $13.54\\pm1.87~M_\\odot$.",

Recent multi-task learning,including reconstruction and\nsuper-resolution, is a good solution to obtain additional relevant information.\nThe interaction between the two tasks is often insufficient, which still leads\nto incomplete and less relevant deep features. To address above limitations, we\npropose an iterative collaboration network (ICONet) to improve communications\nbetween tasks by progressively incorporating reconstruction prior to the\nsuper-resolution learning procedure in an iterative collaboration way.

The $k$-center problem has been extensively studied in the classical\nsequential setting for several decades, and more recently there have been some\nefforts in understanding the problem in parallel computing, on the Massively\nParallel Computation (MPC) model. For now, we have a good understanding of\n$k$-center in the case where each local MPC machine has sufficient local memory\nto store some representatives from each cluster, that is, when one has\n$\\Omega(k)$ local memory per machine. While this setting covers the case of\nsmall values of $k$, for a large number of clusters these algorithms require\nundesirably large local memory, making them poorly scalable. The case of large\n$k$ has been considered only recently for the fully scalable low-local-memory\nMPC model for the Euclidean instances of the $k$-center problem. However, the\nearlier works have been considering only the constant dimensional Euclidean\nspace, required a super-constant number of rounds, and produced only\n$k(1+o(1))$ centers whose cost is a super-constant approximation of $k$-center.\n  In this work, we significantly improve upon the earlier results for the\n$k$-center problem for the fully scalable low-local-memory MPC model.

    "abstract": "The exponential strong converse for a coding problem states that, if a coding\nrate is beyond the theoretical limit, the correct probability converges to zero\nexponentially. For the lossy source coding with side-information, also known as\nthe Wyner-Ziv (WZ) problem, a lower bound on the strong converse exponent was\nderived by Oohama. In this paper, we derive the tight strong converse exponent\nfor the WZ problem; as a special case, we also derive the tight strong converse\nexponent for the distributed function computation problem. For the converse\npart, we use the change-of-measure argument developed in the literature and the\nsoft Markov constraint introduced by Oohama; the matching achievability is\nproved via the Poisson matching approach recently introduced by Li and\nAnantharam. Our result is build upon the recently derived tight strong converse\nexponent for the Wyner-Ahlswede-Korner (WAK) problem; however, compared to the\nWAK problem, more sophisticated argument is needed. As an illustration of the\nnecessity of the soft Markov constraint, we present an example such that the\nsoft Markov constraint is strictly positive.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning in large language models (LLMs) tends to produce substantially\nlonger token generation sequences than simpler language modeling tasks. This\nextended generation length reflects the multi-step, compositional nature of\nreasoning and is often correlated with higher solution accuracy. From an\nefficiency perspective, longer token generation exacerbates the inherently\nsequential and memory-bound decoding phase of LLMs. However, not all parts of\nthis expensive reasoning process are equally difficult to generate. We leverage\nthis observation by offloading only the most challenging parts of the reasoning\nprocess to a larger, more capable model, while performing most of the\ngeneration with a smaller, more efficient model; furthermore, we teach the\nsmaller model to identify these difficult segments and independently trigger\noffloading when needed. To enable this behavior, we annotate difficult segments\nacross 18k reasoning traces from the OpenR1-Math-220k chain-of-thought (CoT)\ndataset. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning\nfine-tuning (RLFT) to a 1.5B-parameter reasoning model, training it to learn to\noffload the most challenging parts of its own reasoning process to a larger\nmodel.

Accurately predicting the future trajectories\nof each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high\nreliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous\ndriving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other\ntraffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that\nmotion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction.

    "abstract": "Agent self-improvement, where the backbone Large Language Model (LLM) of the\nagent are trained on trajectories sampled autonomously based on their own\npolicies, has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing performance. Recent\nadvancements, particularly in web environments, face a critical limitation:\ntheir performance will reach a stagnation point during autonomous learning\ncycles, hindering further improvement. We argue that this stems from limited\nexploration of the web environment and insufficient exploitation of pre-trained\nweb knowledge in LLMs. To improve the performance of self-improvement, we\npropose a novel framework that introduces a co-evolving World Model LLM. This\nworld model predicts the next observation based on the current observation and\naction within the web environment. Leveraging LLMs' pretrained knowledge of\nabundant web content, the World Model serves dual roles: (1) as a virtual web\nserver generating self-instructed training data to continuously refine the\nagent's policy, and (2) as an imagination engine during inference, enabling\nlook-ahead simulation to guide action selection for the agent LLM. Experiments\nin real-world web environments (Mind2Web-Live, WebVoyager, and GAIA-web) show a\n10% performance gain over existing self-evolving agents, demonstrating the\nefficacy and generalizability of our approach, without using any distillation\nfrom more powerful close-sourced models.

    "abstract": "Traditional channel acquisition faces significant limitations due to ideal\nmodel assumptions and scalability challenges. A novel environment-aware\nparadigm, known as channel twinning, tackles these issues by constructing radio\npropagation environment semantics using a data-driven approach. In the\nspotlight of channel twinning technology, a radio map is recognized as an\neffective region-specific model for learning the spatial distribution of\nchannel information. However, most studies focus on static channel map\nconstruction, with only a few collecting numerous channel samples and using\ndeep learning for radio map prediction. In this paper, we develop a novel\ndynamic radio map twinning framework with a substantially small dataset.\nSpecifically, we present an innovative approach that employs dynamic mode\ndecomposition (DMD) to model the evolution of the dynamic channel gain map as a\ndynamical system. We first interpret dynamic channel gain maps as\nspatio-temporal video stream data. The coarse-grained and fine-grained evolving\nmodes are extracted from the stream data using a new ensemble DMD (Ens-DMD)\nalgorithm. To mitigate the impact of noisy data, we design a median-based\nthreshold mask technique to filter the noise artifacts of the twin maps. With\nthe proposed DMD-based radio map twinning framework, numerical results are\nprovided to demonstrate the low-complexity reproduction and evolution of the\nchannel gain maps. Furthermore, we consider four radio map twin performance\nmetrics to confirm the superiority of our framework compared to the baselines.",

However, the strongly renormalized flat\n3$d_{z2}$ band shifts a factor of 5-10 smaller than anticipated by DFT.\nFurthermore, it stays ~70 meV below the Fermi level, contradicting the\nexpectation that superconductivity results from the high density of states of\nthis band at the Fermi level. We also observed a non-trivial k$_z$ dispersion\nof the cuprate-like 3$d_{x2-y2}$ band. Combined with results from both X-ray\ndiffraction and DFT, we suggest that the strained films are under ~5 GPa\neffective pressure, considerably larger than the na\\\"ive expectation from the\nDFT relaxed structure. Finally, the ~70 meV energy position is intriguingly\nclose to the collective mode coupling more prominently seen in thin films, in\nthe energy range of both oxygen related phonons and the maximum of the spin\nexcitation spectrum.",

Our approach follows the procedure of combinatorial\nquantization to construct the operator algebras of quantum holonomies on\n2-surfaces and develop the representation theory. The $*$-representation of the\noperator algebra is carried by the infinite dimensional Hilbert space\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\vec{\\lambda}}$ and closely connects to the infinite-dimensional\n$*$-representation of the quantum deformed Lorentz group\n$\\mathscr{U}_{\\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\\otimes\n\\mathscr{U}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\\mathbf{q}=\\exp[\\frac{2\\pi\ni}{k}(1+b^2)]$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{q}}=\\exp[\\frac{2\\pi i}{k}(1+b^{-2})]$\nwith $|b|=1$. The quantum group $\\mathscr{U}_{\\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\\otimes\n\\mathscr{U}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$ also emerges from the quantum gauge\ntransformations of the complex Chern-Simons theory. Focusing on a $m$-holed\nsphere $\\Sigma_{0,m}$, the physical Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ is\nidentified by imposing the gauge invariance and the flatness constraint. The\nstates in $\\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ are the $\\mathscr{U}_{\\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\\otimes\n\\mathscr{U}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$-invariant linear functionals on a\ndense domain in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\vec{\\lambda}}$. Finally, we demonstrate that the\nphysical Hilbert space carries a Fenchel-Nielsen representation, where a set of\nWilson loop operators associated with a pants decomposition of $\\Sigma_{0,m}$\nare diagonalized.",

However, due to the inherent complexity of digital images, issues of\ninvisibility and security persist when using CNN models for information\nembedding. In this paper, we propose Curriculum Learning Progressive Steganophy\nNetwork (CLPSTNet). The network consists of multiple progressive multi-scale\nconvolutional modules that integrate Inception structures and dilated\nconvolutions. The module contains multiple branching pathways, starting from a\nsmaller convolutional kernel and dilatation rate, extracting the basic, local\nfeature information from the feature map, and gradually expanding to the\nconvolution with a larger convolutional kernel and dilatation rate for\nperceiving the feature information of a larger receptive field, so as to\nrealize the multi-scale feature extraction from shallow to deep, and from fine\nto coarse, allowing the shallow secret information features to be refined in\ndifferent fusion stages. The experimental results show that the proposed\nCLPSTNet not only has high PSNR , SSIM metrics and decoding accuracy on three\nlarge public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, but also the\nsteganographic images generated by CLPSTNet have low steganalysis scores.You\ncan find our code at\n\\href{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}{https://github.com/chaos-boops/CLPSTNet}.",

As diffusion models excel in\ngenerating realistic videos, reliable content attribution is increasingly\ncritical. However, existing video watermarking methods often introduce\ndistortion by altering the initial distribution of diffusion variables and are\nvulnerable to temporal attacks, such as frame deletion, due to variable video\nlengths. VideoMark addresses these challenges by employing a \\textbf{pure\npseudorandom initialization} to embed watermarks, avoiding distortion while\nensuring uniform noise distribution in the latent space to preserve generation\nquality. To enhance robustness, we adopt a frame-wise watermarking strategy\nwith pseudorandom error correction (PRC) codes, using a fixed watermark\nsequence with randomly selected starting indices for each video. For watermark\nextraction, we propose a Temporal Matching Module (TMM) that leverages edit\ndistance to align decoded messages with the original watermark sequence,\nensuring resilience against temporal attacks. Experimental results show that\nVideoMark achieves higher decoding accuracy than existing methods while\nmaintaining video quality comparable to watermark-free generation. The\nwatermark remains imperceptible to attackers without the secret key, offering\nsuperior invisibility compared to other frameworks.

Recently, they have\nbeen shown to succumb to adversarial input attacks which make small\nimperceptible changes to the input image yet the hashing algorithm does not\ndetect its similarity to the original image. Property-preserving hashing (PPH)\nis a recent construct in cryptography, which preserves some property\n(predicate) of its inputs in the hash domain. Researchers have so far shown\nconstructions of PPH for Hamming distance predicates, which, for instance,\noutputs 1 if two inputs are within Hamming distance $t$. A key feature of PPH\nis its strong correctness guarantee, i.e., the probability that the predicate\nwill not be correctly evaluated in the hash domain is negligible. Motivated by\nthe use case of detecting similar images under adversarial setting, we propose\nthe first PPH construction for an $\\ell_1$-distance predicate. Roughly, this\npredicate checks if the two one-sided $\\ell_1$-distances between two images are\nwithin a threshold $t$. Since many adversarial attacks use $\\ell_2$-distance\n(related to $\\ell_1$-distance) as the objective function to perturb the input\nimage, by appropriately choosing the threshold $t$, we can force the attacker\nto add considerable noise to evade detection, and hence significantly\ndeteriorate the image quality. Our proposed scheme is highly efficient, and\nruns in time $O(t^2)$. For grayscale images of size $28 \\times 28$, we can\nevaluate the predicate in $0.0784$ seconds when pixel values are perturbed by\nup to $1 \\%$. For larger RGB images of size $224 \\times 224$, by dividing the\nimage into 1,000 blocks, we achieve times of $0.0128$ seconds per block for $1\n\\%$ change, and up to $0.2641$ seconds per block for $14\\%$ change.",

    "abstract": "People's daily lives involve numerous periodic behaviors, such as eating and\ntraveling. Local-life platforms cater to these recurring needs by providing\nessential services tied to daily routines. Therefore, users' periodic\nintentions are reflected in their interactions with the platforms. There are\ntwo main challenges in modeling users' periodic behaviors in the local-life\nservice recommendation systems: 1) the diverse demands of users exhibit varying\nperiodicities, which are difficult to distinguish as they are mixed in the\nbehavior sequences; 2) the periodic behaviors of users are subject to dynamic\nchanges due to factors such as holidays and promotional events. Existing\nmethods struggle to distinguish the periodicities of diverse demands and\noverlook the importance of dynamically capturing changes in users' periodic\nbehaviors. To this end, we employ a Frequency-Aware Multi-View Interest\nModeling framework (FIM). Specifically, we propose a multi-view search strategy\nthat decomposes users' demands from different perspectives to separate their\nvarious periodic intentions. This allows the model to comprehensively extract\ntheir periodic features than category-searched-only methods. Moreover, we\npropose a frequency-domain perception and evolution module. This module uses\nthe Fourier Transform to convert users' temporal behaviors into the frequency\ndomain, enabling the model to dynamically perceive their periodic features.\nExtensive offline experiments demonstrate that FIM achieves significant\nimprovements on public and industrial datasets, showing its capability to\neffectively model users' periodic intentions. Furthermore, the model has been\ndeployed on the Kuaishou local-life service platform. Through online A/B\nexperiments, the transaction volume has been significantly improved.",

However, two key challenges remain insufficiently addressed:\n(1) Insufficient consideration of missing modality scenarios and (2) the\noverlooking of unique characteristics of modality features. These challenges\nresult in significant performance degradation in realistic situations where\nmodalities are missing. To address these issues, we propose Disentangling and\nGenerating Modality Recommender (DGMRec), a novel framework tailored for\nmissing modality scenarios. DGMRec disentangles modality features into general\nand specific modality features from an information-based perspective, enabling\nricher representations for recommendation. Building on this, it generates\nmissing modality features by integrating aligned features from other modalities\nand leveraging user modality preferences. Extensive experiments show that\nDGMRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MRSs in challenging scenarios,\nincluding missing modalities and new item settings as well as diverse missing\nratios and varying levels of missing modalities. Moreover, DGMRec's\ngeneration-based approach enables cross-modal retrieval, a task inapplicable\nfor existing MRSs, highlighting its adaptability and potential for real-world\napplications.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based user-side feedback\nreduction framework, termed self-nomination. The goal of self-nomination is to\nreduce the number of users (UEs) feeding back channel state information (CSI)\nto the base station (BS), by letting each UE decide whether to feed back based\non its estimated likelihood of being scheduled and its potential contribution\nto precoding in a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink. Unlike SNR- or SINR-based\nthresholding methods, the proposed approach uses rich spatial channel\nstatistics and learns nontrivial correlation effects that affect eventual\nMU-MIMO scheduling decisions. To train the self-nomination network under an\naverage feedback constraint, we propose two different strategies: one based on\ndirect optimization with gradient approximations, and another using policy\ngradient-based optimization with a stochastic Bernoulli policy to handle\nnon-differentiable scheduling. The framework also supports proportional-fair\nscheduling by incorporating dynamic user weights. Numerical results confirm\nthat the proposed self-nomination method significantly reduces CSI feedback\noverhead. Compared to baseline feedback methods, self-nomination can reduce\nfeedback by as much as 65%, saving not only bandwidth but also allowing many\nUEs to avoid feedback altogether (and thus, potentially enter a sleep mode).\nSelf-nomination achieves this significant savings with negligible reduction in\nsum-rate or fairness.",

Our solution allows identifying promising candidates for sensor\npositions using solely preliminary flow field measurements with\nnon-time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), without introducing\nphysical probes in the flow. Data-driven estimation in advection-dominated\nflows often exploits time-delay embedding to enrich the sensor information for\nthe reconstruction, i.e. it uses the information embedded in probe time series\nto provide a more accurate estimation. Optimizing the probe position is the key\nto improving the accuracy of such estimation. Unfortunately, the cost of\nperforming an online combinatorial search to identify the optimal sensor\nplacement in experiments is often prohibitive. We leverage the principle that,\nin advection-dominated flows, rows of vectors from PIV fields embed similar\ninformation to that of probe time series located at the downstream end of the\ndomain. We propose thus to optimize the sensor placement using the row data\nfrom non-time-resolved PIV measurements as a surrogate of the data a real probe\nwould actually capture in time. This optimization is run offline and requires\nonly one preliminary experiment with standard PIV. Once the optimal positions\nare identified, the probes can be installed and operated simultaneously with\nthe PIV to perform the time-resolved field estimation. We show that the\nproposed method outperforms equidistant positioning or greedy optimization\ntechniques available in the literature.",

By representing transitive\nrelations using a directed acyclic graph, we develop an efficient strategy for\ndetermining optimal execution orders, thereby overcoming inherent challenges\nrelated to execution dependencies and parallelism. Building on this foundation,\nwe present the Transitive Array, a multiplication-free accelerator designed to\nexploit transitive sparsity in GEMM. Our architecture effectively balances\ncomputational workloads across multiple parallel lanes, ensuring high\nefficiency and optimal resource utilization. Comprehensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that the Transitive Array achieves approximately 7.46$\\times$ and\n3.97$\\times$ speedup and 2.31$\\times$ and 1.65$\\times$ energy reduction\ncompared to state-of-the-art accelerators such as Olive and BitVert while\nmaintaining comparable model accuracy on LLaMA models.",

This paper\nintroduces $Param\\Delta$, a novel method that streamlines post-training by\ntransferring knowledge from an existing post-trained model to a newly updated\nbase model with ZERO additional training. By computing the difference between\npost-trained model weights ($\\Theta_\\text{post}$) and base model weights\n($\\Theta_\\text{base}$), and adding this to the updated base model\n($\\Theta'_\\text{base}$), we define $Param\\Delta$ Model as:\n$\\Theta_{\\text{Param}\\Delta} = \\Theta_\\text{post} - \\Theta_\\text{base} +\n\\Theta'_\\text{base}$.

Machine learning predictive\nmodeling offers a proactive approach by forecasting patient flow metrics, such\nas waiting count, to improve resource planning and hospital efficiency.\n  Objective: This study develops machine learning models to predict ED waiting\nroom occupancy at two time scales. The hourly model forecasts the waiting count\nsix hours ahead (e.g., a 1 PM prediction for 7 PM), while the daily model\nestimates the average waiting count for the next 24 hours (e.g., a 5 PM\nprediction for the following day's average). These tools support staffing\ndecisions and enable earlier interventions to reduce overcrowding.\n  Methods: Data from a partner hospital's ED in the southeastern United States\nwere used, integrating internal metrics and external features. Eleven machine\nlearning algorithms, including traditional and deep learning models, were\ntrained and evaluated. Feature combinations were optimized, and performance was\nassessed across varying patient volumes and hours.\n  Results: TSiTPlus achieved the best hourly prediction (MAE: 4.19, MSE:\n29.32). The mean hourly waiting count was 18.11, with a standard deviation of\n9.77. Accuracy varied by hour, with MAEs ranging from 2.45 (11 PM) to 5.45 (8\nPM). Extreme case analysis at one, two, and three standard deviations above the\nmean showed MAEs of 6.16, 10.16, and 15.59, respectively.

First, we propose a matrix-based\nmethod that utilizes time-resolved trajectory data to determine the relative\ncrossing order of pedestrians from opposing groups.

    "abstract": "For an $(\\infty,n)$-category $\\mathscr E$ we define an $(\\infty,1)$ category\n$\\mathrm{TwAr}(\\mathscr E)$ and provide an isomorphism between the\nstabilization of the overcategory of $\\mathscr E$ in\n$\\mathrm{Cat}_{(\\infty,n)}$ and the $\\infty$-category of spectrum-valued\nfunctors on $\\mathrm{TwAr}(\\mathscr E)$. We use this to develop the deformation\ntheory of $(\\infty,n)$-categories and apply it to given an $\\infty$-categorical\ncharacterization of lax-idempotent monads.",
